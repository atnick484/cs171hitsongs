line\nI knew I was the victim of somebody's evil plan\nWhen this scroungy looking dude came up and said\n\"Yeah, that's him, man\"\n\n[Chorus]\nHey, wait a minute, man, I've been framed, man\nAw, listen to me, judge, I was framed\nI never do nothing wrong\nAw, but every time I get the blame (Hey, I been framed!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nThen the prosecuting attorney started prosecuting on me\nThat dude gave me the first, second, and third degree\nHe said, \"Where were you on the night of July 29?\"\nI said, \"Man, I was home in bed\"\nHe said, \"Judge, that man is lying\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI said, \"Wait

  by\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Tom Mankiewicz\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   June 20, 1983\n\nFADE IN:\n\nSUPERIMPOSED ON A BLACK SCREEN:\n\nWAYNE MANOR, NEAR GOTHAM CITY - 1960\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - SUNSET\n\nA beautiful, sprawling suburban estate at sunset.  Classic wrought-iron\ngates protect a winding driveway which snakes its way up through a\nneatly manicured lawn.\n\nINT. WAYNE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nALFRED PENNYWORTH, the Wayne family butler, fluffs up a cushion in the\nlarge, elegant living room.  A kind-looking man in his late forties\nwith dark moustache and hair, he epitomizes the proper British moor\ndomo, dressed in a morning coat and striped vest.\n\nAlfred turns, straightens up a pile of thick-looking papers on the\nliving room table.  He picks up the top one, looks at it critically,\nbut with satisfaction.\n\nINSERT SHOT - CAMPAIGN POSTER\n\nThe thick-looking papers are, in fact, political campaign posters.\nThey feature the face of a handsome, fortyish man, with the block\nlettered caption: DR. THOMAS WAYNE FOR CITY COUNCIL - A BETTER TOMORROW\nFOR GOTHAM.\nDR. WAYNE'S VOICE\nBruce?  Hurry up, son, we're going\nto be late.  Martha?\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nAlfred turns to look at DR. THOMAS WAYNE (the man on the poster) enters\nthe room.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nNow where's Martha?  Alfred, have\nyou seen Mrs. Wayne?\n\nALFRED\nI believe she was headed for Master\nBruce's laboratory. Sir.\n\nDr. Wayne checks his watch, exits, muttering.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nThat nymphomaniacal hamster of his\nmust have given birth again...\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\nDr. Wayne heads down the hallway towards a door.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nCome on, everybody, the movie starts\nin less than an hour.  Let's not\nkeep you next city councilman\nwaiting...\n\nINT. BRUCE'S LAB\n\nDr. Wayne opens the door.  The makeshift lab room has a large work\ntable crammed with beakers, test tubes, and other scientific equipment.\nBRUCE WYANE, aged ten, sits behind a microscope, peers down intently at\na specimen on a slide.  He does not look up as his father enters.\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(crossing)\nSon, whatever you're looking at\ncouldn't possible be as pretty as\nAudrey Hepburn, so...\n\nDr. Wayne puts his hand on Bruce's shoulder.  Incredibly enough - it\npasses right through it!  He recoils, shocked, reaches out to touch the\nbody's head.  His hand cuts right through the skull.  Giggling is\nHEARD, O.S.\n\nYoung Bruce stands behind the door with his mother, MARTHA, a beautiful\nwoman in her mid-thirties.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's called a \"holograph,\" dad.  Two\nInterconnecting laser beams...\n(pointing)\nThere and there.  Pretty neat, huh?\n\nDr. Wayne stares at the laser tubes, totally nonplussed.\n\nMARTHA\nWell, don't look at me.  My side\nof the family still can't figure out\nwhy it gets dark at night.  Ready to\ngo?\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(eyes narrowing)\nHow can I be sure you're the real\nthing?\n\nMartha kisses him warmly.  He looks back, impressed.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nSomewhat lifelike, I'll admit...\n\nMARTH\nThat's all?  Then hold on to your\nsocks, buster...\n\nShe kisses him again with passion.  Bruce turns away with the typical\nself-consciousness of a pre-adolescent.\n\nBRUCE\nOh, guy...\n\nHis parents break.  Dr. Wayne looks down at him.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nBruce, you may be the brightest ten\nyear old in Gotham City, or any-\nwhere else, for that matter.  But I\nfeel I ought to let you in on some-\nthing.\n(at Martha)\nThis - is definitely not a guy.\n\nINT. PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT\n\nA huge 35mm motion picture projector springs to life.\n\nINT. THEATER\n\nThe shifting colored rays of a projected film knife though the\nblackness of the theater.\n\nSCREEN VOICE\nSister, you make a beautiful nun.\n\nANGLE ON MOVIE SCREEN\n\nThe screen is filled by the face of AUDREY HEPBURN, dressed as a nun.\nWe are watched The Nun's Story, as are:\n\nANGLE ON WAYNE FAMILY IN SEATS\n\nDr. Wayne, Martha, and Bruce, who downs the remains of his box of Good\nand Plenty.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MOVIE THEATER & STREET - NIGHT\n\nRumblings of distant thunder echo through the night sky.  The Wayne\nfamily exits the theater, heads down a deserted street.  Suddenly - a\nflash of lightning.  A closer, louder clap of thunder.  Dr. Wayne takes\nMartha's arm.  Bruce straggles behind, staring at the pavement.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nI wish I hadn't parked so far away.\nWe're going to get soaked.\n\nMARTHA\n(over her shoulder)\nDo try and keep up, Bruce.  What on\nearth are you staring at, anyway?\n\nBRUCE\nThe cracks, Mom.  It's bad luck to\nstep on one.\n(does so)\nOh, darnit...\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nHold it, you people.  Freeze!\n\nA large man (JOE CHILL) partially hidden by shadows, points a gun at\nthem.  He stands in the sunken entrance to a deserted brownstone house,\ngestures with his weapon.\n\nCHILL\nGet down in here.  Now.\n\nMARTHA\n(terrified)\nThomas...\n\nDR. WAYNE\nYou're welcome to our money.  Any-\nthing we have.  Okay?\n\nChill stares coldly.  Dr. Wayne pulls out his money, takes off his\nwatch.  Martha and Bruce watch, petrified.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nHere...just be careful with that\ngun, will you?  It could go off...\n\nCHILL\nYou know something, Doc?  You're\nright.\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(expression changing)\nDoc?  How did you know I was a...\n\nThere is a deafening roar as Chill fires the gun, lifting Dr. Wayne off\nhis feet, hurling him backwards.\n\nBRUCE\nDaddy!!\n\nMartha screams.  A bolt of lightning flashes.  Chill turns.\n\nCHILL\nLet's have that necklace, lady...\n\nMARTHA\nOh, my God!\n\nMartha tries to escape but is jerked back by Chill's hand as it closes\non her necklace.  Bruce runs at Chill, grabs him by the leg, tries to\npull him down.\n\nBRUCE\nLeave my mommy alone!  Mommy!\nMommy!\n\nChill fires again!  The necklace snaps free as Martha is jerked\nbackwards, then crumples next to her husband.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nHe kneels over his mother's body, pauses in shock, then looks up: the\nbarrel of Chill's gun comes into frame.\n\nCLOSE ON CHILL\n\nThe necklace in one hand, his gun in the other.  He looks down at\nBruce, his expression suddenly changing.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHe stares at Chill, his jaw inadvertently twitching with rage.  A LOUD\nCLAP OF THUNDER rolls across the sky.  Bruce's eyes have become steel,\nvisible fury shooting forth from them in an almost demonic fashion.\n\nChill's gun hand suddenly starts to tremble.  Incredibly, the savage\nface of this young boy has unnerved him.\n\nCHILL\nStop...lookin' at me like that, kid...\n(no response)\nStop looking at me like that!\n\nSuddenly - A FLASH OF LIGHTNING!  Rain begins to fall in sheets.\nChill, runs up to the street, disappears into the rain-swept darkness.\n\nANGLE ON APARTMENT BUILDING\n\nLIGHTS have flicked on in the apartment building across the street.\nFACELESS WITNESSES stand silhouetted in the windows, gazing down at the\ntragedy across the street.\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN on one particular window.  A SHADOWY FIGURE half-\nemerges from the darkness, his face still hidden from us.  All that is\nvisible is an oversized pair of striped pants and a large white daisy\nstuck through the coat lapel.  The Shadowy Figure pauses, then reaches\nout an arm and slowly lowers the window shade.\n\nFrom behind the shade - an insane, maniacal giggle starts to rise.\nTiny at first, but gradually building to a sudden explosion of\ncascading, frightening glee!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nKneeling in the rain across the street, paralyzed with shock and grief.\nHe looks up from the bodies of his parents as a COUPLE approaches along\nthe pavement above.\n\nBRUCE'S VOICE\nHelp...oh, please help me...\n\nThe couple stop, stare down at the scene.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's...my mom and dad.  Please...I\nthink they're dead.\n\nThe couple exchange a quick, horrified glance, then hurry off down the\nstreet.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nSobbing uncontrollably now, tears mixing with the rain.  In the\ndistance: the low whine of an approaching siren.  CAMERA RISES into the\nnight sky:\n\nA FLASHING BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS ACROSS THE SCREEN: the residue\nremains in the night sky - a searing yellow dot.  ANOTHER BOLT OF\nLIGHTNING - another yellow dot.  Then a deafening clap of thunder as\nthe gray-black clouds arrange themselves into a dark and eerie\nsilhouette.  The siren grows louder, piercing shrilly through the\nrumblings of the storm.  The SILHOUETTE becomes more familiar now, as\nthe billowing clouds form themselves into a dark cape.  The dots of\nlightning begin to pulsate as they evolve into two searing yellow eyes.\n\nThis then, is the signal of the future presence of the Dark Redeemer of\nthe Night.  The Black Wraith.  The Avenger of Countless Wrongs...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t THE BATMAN\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE\nTHROUGH TO:\n\nEXT. HILLSIDE CEMETERY NEAR GOTHAM - DAY\n\nA beautiful rolling hill overlooking Gotham City.  As CAMERA TRACKS\nthrough the trees, tombstones begin to appear.  We are in the middle of\nan immaculate pastoral graveyard.  Down below in the distance an\nendless line of black limousines snakes its way up a winding road.\nCAMERA CONTINUES TO TRACK, finally HOLDING ON:\n\nThe unfilled graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne.  Dark-suited FUNERAL\nATTENDANTS wait silently by the caskets.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM CITY - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT\n\nA hot sun showers a blazing glow on the throbbing metropolis of Gotham\nCity, choked with cars, buses, PEDESTRIANS, and the attendant\npollution.  A great American city going through the routine\nperformances of its daily mundane chores.\n\nEXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY\n\nCAMERA CLOSE on an oversized pair of striped pants standing in front of\na corner newsstand.\n\nVOICE\nA copy of the Trib, please.\n\nCLOSE ON GOTHAM TRIBUNE\n\nAn edition of the Gotham Tribune is handed over.  The headlines scream:\nDR. & MRS. THOMAS WAYNE GUNNED DOWN IN SENSELESS ROBBERY/KILLING.\n\"Political hopeful was well ahead in latest polls.\"\n\nAn insane giggle rises, O.S.  CAMERA PANS UP from the front page to the\nhorrified face of a NEWS VENDOR, staring in disbelief at the person\nreading the Tribune.\n\nCLOSE ON JOKER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nWe see the hideous face of THE JOKER.  A revolting perversion of a\nhuman being with a chalk-white complexion, ruby red lips, and a\nstartling shock of green hair.  He continues to giggle as he reads.  A\nCONFEDERATE stands behind.  The Vendor continues to stare as The Joker\nsuddenly notices.\n\nJOKER\nSomething wrong?\n\nVENDOR\nYour...face.  It's...\n\nJOKER\nFamiliar?  Maybe we met in Toledo.\n\nVENDOR\nI never been to Toledo.\n\nJOKER\nNeither have I.  Must have been two\nother guys.\n(taking one out)\nHave a cigar?\n\nVENDOR\nGee, thanks.\n\nThe Vendor takes the cigar, lights it.  The Joker and his Confederate\nmove off down the street.\n\nJOKER\nWant to hear a good one?  What's\nblack and white and dead all over?\n\nCONFEDERATE\nA newspaper, Boss, but ain't it\nblack and white and read all over?\n\nSuddenly - there is a tremendous explosion!\n\nANGLE ON CORNER NEWSSTAND\n\nThe corner newsstand has virtually disappeared.  Thousands of pages\ndrift down through the air into the debris.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nNo...\n\nEXT. HILLSIDE CEMETERY - DAY\n\nThe procession of limousines has started back down the hill from the\nfuneral.  Alfred stands alone by a black Rolls Royce, looks off sadly\nas:\n\nYoung Bruce Wayne gently places a flower on each of his parent's\ngraves, then turns.  His eyes are glassed over, but tears do not fall.\nHe crosses to Alfred who puts a protective arm around him.\n\nALFRED\nIt's unfair, of course.  But some-\ntimes, Master Bruce, one simply has\nto...accept conditions as they are,\nand...make the best of them.\n\nBRUCE\n(softly)\nWhy?\n\nALFRED\nWhy?  Why, because...\n(nice smile)\nI don't know, really.\n\nBRUCE\n(deadly)\nNeither do I.\n\nAlfred helps the boy into the car.  The Rolls Royce heads back down the\nhill toward Gotham City.\n\nINT. THORNE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\nTelephones RING!  Typewriters CLACK!  A campaign poster features the\nface of RUPERT THORNE, an earnest-looking man with a granite-hard face.\nUnderneath is a logo: Rupert Thorne: He'll make our streets safe\nagain.\"\n\nThe headquarters is a beehive of activity.  AIDES rush back and forth\nas a door marked Private bursts open and Thorne appears.  Hr grins with\nan oily manner.\n\nTHORNE\n(to AIDE)\nAre they all out there?\n\nAIDE\nWe're waiting for The Evening\nSentinel, Mr. Thorne...\n\nTHORNE\nScrew The Sentinel.  I gotta make\nThe six o'clock news.\n(adjusts his tie)\nWhat's the name of Wayne's kid?\n\nAIDE\nBruce.\n\nThorne nods, heads for the door, mumbling to himself.\n\nTHORNE\nOur hearts go out to the Wayne\nFamily, particularly their young\nSon, Bruce...Bruce...Bruce...\n\nEXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\nA throng of REPORTERS and TV remote units snap to attention as Thorne\nappears on the steps of his campaign headquarters.  He silences a\ncacophony of overlapping questions with upraised hands, terminally\nsincere.\n\nTHORNE\nI didn't want to win like this.  Not\nthrough tragedy.  But it's cruelly\nironic...\n\nEXT. GOTHAM - DAY\n\nA more downbeat section of Gotham's business district.  CAMERA CLOSES\non a specific building: The Monarch Playing Card Company.  THORNE'S\nVOICE CONTINUES OVER:\n\nTHORNE'S VOICE\n...that a good man like Thomas Wayne\nwho spoke up so forcefully for the\nrights of criminals should himself\nbecome the ultimate victim.\n\nINT. JOKER'S LAIR - DAY\n\nA huge room, garishly decorated in a clown motif.  The wallpaper is one\ncontiguous deck of cards.  There are harlequin chairs, jesters, and\nopen Jack-In-The-Box, etc.\n\nA MAN sits in a chair at the end of the room, facing away from CAMERA.\nHe watches Thorne on a TV set.\n\nTHORNE\n(from TV)\nBut his murderer will be caught and\nexecuted, I promise you!  It's time\nthe scum of our society see that we\nmean to have law and order on the\nstreets of Gotham City!\n\nSuddenly - the set goes mute.  The Man in the chair swivels around\nslowly: It is JOE CHILL!\n\nThe Joker stands at the entrance to the room, lowers a remote control\nbox.  He grins at Chill.  Chill stares back nervously, clearly\nfrightened by The Joker's maniacal presence.\n\nCHILL\nI was...headed for the airport.\nThey said you wanted to see me.\nSomething...wrong?\n\nJOKER\nWrong?  I thought we'd celebrate.  I\nthought you'd like to join me in a\ndrink.\n\nCHILL\n(visibly relieved)\nWhy not...\n\nThe Joker leads him to a table, suddenly glowers darkly.\n\nJOKER\nYou know, I'm disappointed in you,\nJoe.  Very disappointed.\n\nCHILL\n(swallowing)\nYou...are?\n\nJOKER\nI said, \"Would you like to join me\nin a drink.\"  Then you're supposed\nto say, \"Sure there'll be room\nenough for both of us?\"\n(giggle)\nGet it?\n(louder giggle)\n\"Room enough...\"\n\nCHILL\nYeah...sure...I get it now...\n\nJOKER\nYou're a quick study, Joe.\n\nThe Joker claps him on the back as they sit at the table.  The\nConfederate enters with two glasses on a tray.  One contains a clear\nliquid.  The other - a bilious, thick yellow concoction.  The Joker\nedges it across the table toward Chill who eyes it suspiciously.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nDrink up.\n\nChill examines the yellow liquid, wary.\n\nCHILL\nHow come...you ain't drinkin' this...\n\nJOKER\nGood question.  I like lemonade...\n\nHe takes it from Chill, hands him the clear liquid.  They both down\ntheir drinks.  The Joker giggles insanely.\n\nCHILL\nWhat's...so funny...?\n\nJOKER\nMan walks into a doctor's office,\nsays, \"Are you the doctor's nurse?\"\nshe says, \"Yes.\"  He says, \"Oh, is\nthe doctor sick?\"\n\nThe Joker slams the table in glee, out of control.\n\nCHILL\nNo offense, Joker, but that's not\nvery...\n\nChill stops.  The corners of his mouth twitch, then rise involuntarily.\nHe snickers.  Again.  Starts to giggle.  The Joker's eyes narrow.  His\nsmile becomes cruel.\n\nJOKER\nThe doctor says, \"I can sure you.  The\ndisease is hereditary.\"  The patient\nsays, \"Then send the bill to my father.\"\n\nChill instantly explodes with laughter!\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nHe says, \"Help me, Doctor, I've got\namnesia.\"  Doctor says, \"How long\nhave you had it?\"  He says, \"How\nlong have I had what?\"\n\nChill is on his feet now, convulsed in glee.  He sinks to his knees,\nout of control, then collapses on the floor.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nAnd this one will kill you!  I just got\nback from a pleasure trip.  I drove my\nmother-in-law to the airport...\n\nCLOSE ON CHILL\n\nDead.  His mouth frozen in a grotesque grin.  The Joker stares down\nblankly.\n\nJOKER\nBut seriously, folks...\n\nHe looks off, presses the remote control box, activates the sound on\nthe television again.\n\nCLOSE ON TV\n\nRupert Thorne leans in with an oily look.\n\nTHORNE ON TV\nIn the meantime, our hearts go out\nto the Wayne family, particularly to\ntheir young son, Bruce...\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nWatching Thorne.  His face twists into a cruel smile.\n\nTHORNE\n(thoughtful pause)\nAnd I'd like to think that one day\nThomas Wayne will look down on this\nearth and this city and say...\n\nAs Thorne and The Joker speak simultaneously.\n\nTHORNE & JOKER\n\"You know what?  I was wrong.  That\nRupert Thorne is one heck of a city\ncouncilman.\"\n\nThe Joker explodes in laughter!  His terrifying guffaws propel him off\nthe chair onto the floor.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nA large truck with the logo \"GOTHAM GYMNASTICS\" starts down the\ndriveway to the gates, moving away from Wayne Manor.\n\nINT. MANOR EXERCISE ROOM - DAT\n\nAlfred and Bruce stand in a newly outfitted exercise room.  The\nequipment has been expertly installed: rings, parallel bars, balancing\nbeam, weight machines, etc.  Bruce is in a T-shirt and shorts.  He\ngazes at the impressive array.\n\nALFRED\nOne hardly knows where to begin.\n\nBRUCE\nThose rings seem simple enough.\n\nBruce crosses to the rings, leaps, catches hold, tries to hoist himself\nup.  His eyes bulge!  He tries again, then drops to the floor in a\nheap.\n\nALFRED\nPerhaps if we lowered them.\n\nBRUCE\n(grim stare)\nIf you'll excuse me now, Alfred.\nI'll see you at dinner.\n\nALFRED\nYes, Sir.\n\nAlfred leaves, closing the door.  Bruce turns, glares up at the rings\nlike deadly enemies.  He jumps again, catches hold, starts to hoist\nhimself up, straining with the effort.  The veins standing out on his\nforehead.  Slowly, painfully, he begins to inch himself higher and\nhigher.\n\nINT KARATE STUDIO - DAY\n\nBruce is dressed in a martial arts outfit, tensely faces a thick pine\nboard being held by a Japanese INSTRUCTOR.\n\nINSTRUCTOR\n...but you must believe, really\nbelieve you can do it.  The mind\nis more powerful than the fist, and\nthe fist is more powerful than the\nboard.  Understood?\n\nBruce nods earnestly, sets himself.  With a blood-curdling SCREAM -- he\nlashes out!  Then - an instantaneous second SCREAM as his fist crumples\nagainst the unyielding board.\n\nINSTRUCTOR (CONT'D)\nLet's go over it again...\n\nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - SUNRISE\n\nA tree-lined winding road at dawn.  Bruce jogs along easily, his right\nhand encased in a plaster cast.  Jogging next to him, huffing and\npuffing: an exhausted FRENCH PROFESSOR.\n\nBRUCE\nI am happy...\n\nFRENCH PROFESSOR\n(panting)\nJe suis heureux...\n\nBRUCE\nJe suis heureux...to make your\nacquaintance.\n\nFRENCH PROFESSOR\n(gasping)\nDe...faire votre connaissance...\n\nBRUCE\nDe faire votre connaissance...\n\nBruce looks ahead toward a bend in the road.  Alfred stands by the\nRolls Royce, checking his watch.  The spent Professor peels off to the\nside as Bruce continues on.\n\nBRUCE\nMerci, mon Professeur!  Tommorrow at\nSix again, okay?\n\nThe Professor manages a feeble wave, collapses by the side of the road\nin front of Alfred who administers a thermos of hot coffee and a\ncroissant to the stricken man.\n\nANGLE AROUND OTHER SIDE OF BEND.\n\nAnother jogger has joined Bruce around the bend - an older man, his\nbearded RUSSIAN PROFESSOR.\n\nBRUCE\nDobroye utro, Boris...I am happy...\n\nBORIS\nOchen priyatno...\n\nBRUCE\nOchen priyatno...To make your\nacquaintance.\n\nBORIS\nVam...poznakomit...\n\nThe two of them jog off into the distance.\n\nBORIS' VOICE\n(already winded)\nBozhe moy!...\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR LAWN - DAY\n\nBruce stands facing a large, brightly colored archery target on the\nlawn of Wayne Manor.  From O.S., behind his back, WE HEAR A WHIRRING\nSOUND.\n\nCLOSE ON ARROW GUN\n\nA gleaming STEEL ARROW \"clicks\" into the firing slot of an automatic-\nfire Gatling Gun device.  Suddenly - it fires!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nWheeling around to face the on-rushing whizzing arrow - lifting a\nheavily padded hand to catch it in mid-air!\n\nHE MISSES!  The arrow \"thunks\" into his chest, directly over his heart!\nBruce sighs, removes the arrow, jerking it out of his hidden protective\nvest.\n\nBRUCE\nDarn...\n\nANOTHER ARROW whizzes at him!  Bruce drops to one knee, this time\nalmost catching it as the steel tip rips away a piece of the heavy\npadding on his hand.\n\nCLOSE ON ALFRED AT WINDOW\n\nAlfred watches from a window, shaking his head, appalled, now returns\nto his housekeeping.\n\nINT. EXERCISE ROOM - DAY\n\nBruce is on the rings again.  By now using them with considerable\nexpertise, swinging his body in somersaults, then performing the\ndifficult \"Iron Cross\" maneuver.  He pauses at full extension, then\nswings back, launches himself towards the parallel bars.\n\nCatching the bars expertly, he performs a complicated routine, pausing\nat the top to look across the room:\n\nA thin balance beam sits below, ten feet away.\n\nBruce swings back one more time on the upper parallel bar, then flies\nthrough the air for the beam!  His feet land on top for one split,\ntenuous second.  He teeters - then crashes heavily to the floor.\nShaking his head to clear the cobwebs, he stares back at the beam,\ndetermined.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nAlfred exits the rear of Wayne Manor onto the lawn, looks around,\nmystified.\n\nALFRED\nMaster Bruce?  Luncheon is served!\n\nAlfred hears a CUMBLING SOUND, looks up as a piece of brick falls,\nnarrowly missing him.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE - ALFRED'S P.O.V.\n\nBruce is scaling the side of the house!  A thick rope encircles the\nchimney of Wayne Manor as Bruce makes his way up the structure, hand\nover hand.  Suddenly:  the old brick chimney STARTS TO CRUMBLE!  The\nrope jerks free as bricks fly everywhere and Bruce tumbles heavily down\nto the lawn at Alfred'' feet.\n\nBruce looks up, grins sheepishly.  Alfred glances back up at the\ndemolished chimney, then back down at Bruce again.\n\nALFRED\nSanta will be heartbroken.\n\nINT. KARATE STUDIO - DAY\n\nA TERRIFYING SCREAM!  A PINE BOARD is smashed to smithereens by a\nlightning-quick fist!\n\nBruce wheels to FACE CAMERA.  HE IS NOW SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD.  Cool,\nclear eyes flick in the opposite direction as:\n\nTwo STUDENTS charge him!  He flips one over his head, flips the other\nwhile simultaneously spinning around to face the Instructor who closes\nranks from behind.\n\nThe fight is furiously expert - hands and feet working like windmills.\nBruce is parrying every thrust the\nInstructor has to offer, countering every move, but is nonetheless\nbeing backed into a corner.\n\nThe Instructor moves in for the kill as Bruce suddenly vaults up and\nover him in a seven-foot backflip!  Grabbing the man's black belt from\nbehind for leverage, he hoists the Instructor over his head, then sends\nthe bewildered man flying through the air, crashing onto the mat in a\nheap.\n\nBruce looks over, suddenly concerned.  He holds the Instructor's black\nbelt in his hands.  The Instructor is half-dazed, in some pain.  His\neyes suddenly pop open - he grins broadly back at Bruce.\n\nINSTRUCTOR\nThat's okay.

EXERCISE ROOM - DAY\n\nCAMERA PANS past the balancing beam, parallel bars, and exercise rings\nto Bruce, who faces them confidently, but this time with a big\ndifference - HE IS BLINDFOLDED.  He takes a tentative step forward,\ngauging his distance, then leaps up into the air - grabbing the rings\nwith perfect accuracy!  He performs a series of difficult routines with\nclockwork precision, then swings through the air to the parallel bars,\nlatching on to the lower one, then propelling himself up to the higher\none.  His gyrations become faster, gaining speed and momentum.\nSuddenly - he launches himself toward the balance beam!\n\nBruce lands on the end of the beam like a cat - keeping his balance,\nhaving calculated the exact distance to the inch.  He steps forward\nwith total security, travels the length of the beam with the ease of a\npedestrian.  Reaching the end, he does a complete forward somersault,\nlands solidly on his feet.  Bruce removes his blindfold, stares back at\nthe path he's just taken, amazed by himself.\n\nALFRED'S VOICE\nIncredible!\n\nBruce turns.

APARTMENT STREET - NIGHT\n\nBruce crosses the street to a gleaming Aston-Martin sportscar.  ANOTHER\nTHUNDER CLAP!  Rain falls as he reaches into the car, takes out a\ntopcoat and hat.  He starts to pull the convertible top up, glances\ndown the street:\n\nPEOPLE scurry to avoid the rain.  Down the block, across the street, a\nCOUPLE with a YOUNG DAUGHTER look over nervously as a tough-looking\nBIKER on a huge Harley-Davidson rolls up parallel to them on the\nstreet.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nAdjusting the convertible top.  Looking off again.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE'S P.O.V.\n\nSuddenly:  the Biker hops the curb in front of the Family!  Pulling a\ngun, he herds them back into a dark alleyway.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nEyes narrowing.  His jaw twitches.  A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT!  Bruce\nexplodes across the street for the alleyway.\n\nAs Bruce arrives:  the Young Girl bursts out screaming, runs past him.\nBruce hesitates, then runs inside the alley.\n\nANGLE IN ALLEYWAY\n\nThe Man lies in the alley, being cradled by the Woman.  Blood oozes\nfrom the side of his head Bruce arrives.\n\nWOMAN\nI...think he'll be all right.  Our\ndaughter's run to call an ambulance.\n\nBruce hears the REVVING of a motorcycle.  He looks off down the alley,\neyes flashing with anger.\n\nANGLE DOWN ALLEY - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe Biker grins at him from the far end of the alley, puts his Harley\nin gear, rolls off through the pouring rain.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHe makes his decision, takes off in pursuit.\n\nWOMAN\nCareful!  He's got a gun!\n\nEXT. END OF ALLEYWAY\n\nBruce arrives at the alley corner, looks off:\n\nANGLE ON BIKER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe Biker hovers by the side of an apartment building, still grinning\nat Bruce through the rain.  He rolls forward slowly, almost as if\nenticing Bruce to follow him, now disappears again.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce arrives at the rear of the building, which faces on a vacant dirt\nlot.  He edges forward through the mud, turning the corner, suddenly\ncoming face to face with:\n\nThe Biker.  Still grinning.  Switching off his Harley.  Muscles bulging\nthrough his wet T-shirt as he dismounts.\n\nBIKER\nCongratulations, man.\n(wide smile)\nYou caught me.  Matter of fact...\n\nThe ROAR OF ENGINES is HEARD!  Bruce turns to see:  TWO MORE BIKERS,\nrolling into position behind him.  Bruce is hopelessly trapped.\n\nBIKER (CONT'D)\n...you caught all of us...\n\nThe other two Bikers now dismount and close in.  The first Biker draws\nhis gun.  Biker #2 looks Bruce up and down critically, squinting at him\nthrough the rain.\n\nBIKER #2\nThat's my raincoat you're wearing.\nTake it off.\n\nBiker #2 snaps his arm forward - a switchblade appears in his hand.  He\nflicks it at Bruce who stands his ground, slicing a button off the\nfront of his raincoat.\n\nBIKER #2 (CONT'D)\nPick up the button, Wimpy.  Then\nlick it clean and hand me my coat.\n\nBruce stares icily, then slowly bends down to retrieve the button from\nthe mud.  Suddenly:  Biker #1's foot flashes INTO FRAME, headed\nstraight at Bruce's face!  In a lightning-quick move, Bruce grabs the\nswinging leg with both hands, rises, swings Biker #1 off the ground in\na circle, sends him crashing into the motorcycles as his gun goes\nflying.\n\nBiker #2, switchblade in hand, rushes Bruce.  Biker #3 unhooks chains\nfrom his belt.  Bruce sidesteps:  the knife slashes through his\nraincoat, sending it billowing out behind him like a cape!  Biker #3\nwhistles the chains past Bruce's ear:  He snatches them, karate-kicks\nBiker #3 in the stomach, simultaneously belting Biker #2 across the\nside of the head with the chains, knocking him unconscious.\n\nBiker #3 lunges at Bruce from behind!  Bruce spins, grabbing his arm,\ntwisting the knife away, catching it in his other hand as he trips\nBiker #3, sends him sprawling in the mud.  Bruce now straddles him,\nknife in hand.\n\nCLOSE ON BIKER #3\n\nBlinking in fear, his head pressed into the mud next to the button.\n\nBRUCE\nYour turn to pick up the button,\nscumbag...\n\nBiker #3's arm slowly starts forward as Bruce steps on it.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nWith your mouth.\n\nBiker #3 shuts his eyes in humiliation as:  THE SOUND OF A SIREN IS\nHEARD!\n\nANGLE ON SIDE OF BUILDING\n\nTWO POLICEMEN round the corner of the apartment building, now stop,\nstare in astonished silence at:\n\nThe Three Bikers, sprawled in the mud near their machines.

The Woman and\nthe Young Girl follow.\n\nBruce appears at the edge of the crowd, collar still up, hat adjusted\nlow over his face  He stares.\n\nThe Paramedics stop.  One leans down, examines the Man, then covers his\nface with the sheet.  The Woman turns away in silence.  The Young Girl\nclings to her.\n\nBruce watches,  his eyes filled with tears.

Then, moving as if by instinct, he heads for\nthe stairs leading to the basement.\n\nINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nBruce descends the stairs, walks down the hallway to a door.  He stops,\nlooks down at the heavy padlock which seals it shut.  His eyes close in\npain, remembering an earlier time.\n\nINT. YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - NIGHT\n\nSeen through dim half-light:  his childhood lab is coated with dust - a\nroom obviously left unused for years.  We hear A KEY TURNING IN THE\nLOCK.  The door to the lab swings open.  Bruce trains a flashlight on\nthe interior of the musty room.  He enters, finds a light switch, flips\nit on.\n\nThe lab table is much as we remember it, crammed with old test tubes,\nbeakers, etc.  Bruce crosses, stares down, lost in his past, then\nswitches on the holograph machine.  He stares - stunned and amazed as:\n\nTHE HOLOGRAPH FIGURE OF TEN-YEAR-OLD BRUCE WAYNE SPRINGS TO LIFE!  An\nexact visual reproduction of the Child who used to be.  The Young Boy\npeers down through a cobwebbed microscope in precisely the position we\nfirst saw him.\n\nBruce's eyes fill with tears - he shuts them tightly as he hears a\nVOICE from long ago.\n\nYOUNG BRUCE'S VOICE\nIt's called a holograph, Dad.\nPretty neat, huh?\n\nOne laser beam suddenly shorts out with age:  the image of Young Bruce\ndisappears.  The second beam continues to burn, its energy directed at\na disintegrating basement wall.\n\nBruce slumps at the other side of the table, oblivious, his face buried\nin his hands.\n\nOVERLAPPING IMAGES AND VOICE START TO APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.\n\nMartha Wayne\t\t\t   - giggling with Young Bruce, then kissing\nher husband passionately.\n\nDR. WAYNE'S VOICE\nThis - is definitely not a guy.\n\nThomas Wayne\t\t\t  - his face twisted in anguish as Chill's\nbullet blows.\n\nMARTHA'S VOICE\nOh, my God!  No!!\n\nA SHARP CRACK!\t    - As a piece of something crumbles away.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nLooking up.  Staring across the room:\n\nThe remaining laser beam has eaten away a piece of the basement wall -\nthere is a dull ECHOING THUD as the plaster hits the bottom of some\nunseen cavernous space below.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nRising.  Crossing curiously to the hole in the wall.  Training his\nflashlight torch through it.\n\nANGLE DOWN HOLE - HIS P.O.V.\n\nAN IMMENSE CAVERN trails down and away into the blackness.  A network\nof aged timbers intersect themselves, shoring up the side of the\nfoundation.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring.  Playing his flashlight against the visible parts of the\nunderground cavity.  He picks up a beaker from the lab table, then lets\nit fall through the hole.  There is an interminable wait.  Finally -\nthe impact of SHATTERING GLASS.\n\nANGLE BACK THROUGH HOLE\n\nSeen from inside:  the torch beam shines.  Suddenly - a long length of\nrope is tossed through.  Bruce appears in the opening.  He wriggles\nthrough, hanging on to the rope.\n\nBruce expertly shimmies down the rope, a man completely at home in an\naction he knows well.  The beam from the torch dances across the walls\nof the cavern:  high-ribbed, jagged walls, suggesting some sort of\nlabyrinth beyond.  The rope has played out.  Bruce hangs by the end,\nlooks down, lets himself fall to the cavern floor below.\n\nHe rises, plays the torch against the sides of the cave.\n\nANGLE ON BEAM - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe beam searches into crannies, exploring dark gray walls.  It comes\nacross a large patch of solid black.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nLooking curiously.\n\nBACK TO BLACK PATCH\n\nAs the beam hits the black patch fully - dozens of yellow eyes appear.\nThe entire mass LAUNCHES ITSELF INTO CAMERA with a terrifying screech\nand the sound of beating wings.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHis jaw drops, stunned, as THE COLONY OF BATS swarm over him!  He\nstumbles, protecting his face.  The torch drops to the floor.  Its\nshaft of light dances crazily around the cavern.\n\nFrom O.S. - a low moan is heard from Bruce.  It rises, gathers in\nvolume and intensity, gradually becoming a deep, booming guttural roar\n- at once a scream of total pain and a cry of defiance.  The terrified\nbats scream back in a maze of hot and cold light bouncing off beating\nblack wings.\n\nINT. ALFRED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe wind and rain batter against Alfred's partially open bedroom\nwindow.  Mixed with the sounds - a strong echo of the roar from the\ncavern.  Alfred's eyes pop open.

GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\nAn express train roars through a seedy subway station.\n\nINT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT\n\nA well-scrubbed TEENAGE COUPLE sit together holding hands.  The BOY is\ndressed in a dinner jacket, the GIRL is a chiffon party dress with a\nprominent orchid corsage pinned to it.  They exchange a nervous glance,\nlooking across the car at:\n\nA TOUGH-LOOKING THUG who sits opposite them, his muscular arms bulging\nthrough a torn windbreaker.  He grins across at the nervous Teenagers\nmenacingly, exposing yellow teeth, then sneaks a sideways look at:  A\nTHICKLY-BUILT TRUCKDRIVER-TYPE who stares straight ahead.\n\nThese are the only four people in the car.\n\nThe subway slows for the next stop.  The Truckdriver-Type rises\ndisinterestedly, crosses the car, looks down at the Teenagers who are\nnone too happy with his departure.\n\nTRUCKDRIVER-TYPE\nHave a nice time at the prom, kids?\n\nBOY\nYes, thank you, Sir.\n\nThe subway doors hiss open.  The Truckdriver-Type smiles and exits.\nThe Teenagers looks across the car worried.\n\nThe car pulls out of the station.  The Thug rises, crosses the car,\ngrabs hold of a vertical pole to steady himself, smirks down at the\nTeenagers.\n\nTHUG\nYou smell good enough to eat, Sweet-\nheart.\n\nBOY\n(nervous bravado)\nIf you've got something to say,\nMister, talk to me, okay?\n\nTHUG\nI was talking to you - Sweetheart.\n\nA knife drops out of the Thug's sleeve into his hand, its razor-sharp\nblade glinting in the light.  The Teenagers freeze with terror.\n\nTHUG (CONT'D)\nMaybe it's that flower that smells\nso good.\n\nThe Thug plucks the corsage off the trembling Girl's bodice, holds it\nup to his nose, inhales deeply, shaking his head.\n\nTHUG (CONT'D)\nNope.  Still can't place it.\n\nVOICE\nFunny.  I can smell you from way\nover here.\n\nThe Thug wheels, stares off at the end of the car, his jaw dropping\nopen.  The Teenagers' eyes bulge in disbelief.\n\nCLOSE ON CHEST\n\nA golden circle with the black figure of a bat sits in the middle of a\nsteel-gray skin-tight fabric stretched across a massively muscled\nchest.\n\nVOICE\nGive the lady back her flower.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Thug looks his unseen adversary up and down cautiously, unsure of\nwhether to laugh or obey.\n\nTHUG\nOkay...sure.  Just wanted to have a\nlittle fun.  I...\n\nWith a sudden lightning move he flips the switchblade in his hand,\nsending it whizzing in the direction of the Voice.\n\nCLOSE ON KNIFE\n\nThe knife whistles through the air TOWARD CAMERA.  Suddenly a black-\ngloved hand miraculously snatches it out of mid-air, spinning it, then\nsends it flying back!\nThe switchblade pierces the corsage, jerking it out of the Thug's hand,\nsticking it into the wall where it quivers behind him.  The Thug\nfreezes, turning white.\n\nVOICE\nNow then.  I think you said you\nwanted to have a little fun.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\nThe express wheezes to a stop at the next station.  A MIDDLE-AGED\nCOUPLE waits for the doors to open, then enter the car.  They suddenly\nstop, staring in amazement:\n\nThe Thug stands spread-eagled in the middle of the car, both wrists\ncuffed to overhanging metal handholds.  The center vertical pole\ndisappears up one pants leg, finally reappearing out of the collar of\nhis shirt.\n\nThe teenage Boy passes the amazed Couple, confidently dusting his\nhands.  He reaches back for the Girl who sniffs her corsage, then\nfollows him out of the car.\n\nEXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nGotham Police Headquarters.  CAMERA TRACKS PAST cubicles and offices,\nCLACKING, RINGING, DETECTIVES interrogating SUSPECTS, etc., catching up\nwith DAVID GORDON, the Commissioner of Police, a gruff-looking man in\nhis middle fifties who pauses to light a cheap cigarette.\n\nHeading toward him from the other direction:  SERGEANT HALEY, a smooth-\nfaced kissass in his thirties.\n\nGORDON\nWhat's up Haley?\n\nHALEY\nPretty slow, Commissioner.  Half a\ndozen muggings, some kids on PCP,\nand...oh, yeah.  Looks like we got a\ntransvestite prowling the southside\nsubway system.\n\nGORDON\nFull moon tonight.

GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThe extremely cluttered office of an immensely overworked civil\nservant.\n\nHALEY\nFrom his description, this guy could\nmake it as a float in the Rose\nParade.

I may need\nto swap someone for those women.\n\nEXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY & STREET - NIGHT\n\nPolice cars barricade a major avenue, their spotlights trained on a\ndead-end alley.  A SWAT LIEUTENANT speaks through a mike.\n\nSWAT LT.\nCome on out of there, Wells!  Come\nout of we're coming in after you!\n\nWELLS' VOICE\nI got hostages!  You get one minute\nto clear out or I blow'em away!\n\nFrom behind:  Commissioner Gordon's car screeches to a stop.  Gordon\npiles out, followed by Haley.\n\nGORDON\nHow bad is it, Lieutenant?\n\nSWAT LT.\nWe're screwed, Sir.  That's a dead-\nend alley in there.  No way to get\nbehind him.\n\nEXT. DEAD-END ALLEY\n\nA pockmarked thug (WELLS) holds one YOUNG WOMAN roughly, trains his gun\non ANOTHER.  He squints out into the light.\n\nWELLS\nThirty seconds, Pig!  Then I spill\none lady's brains on the street!\nTwenty-five...\n\nCAMERA PANS DOWN to the pavement behind Wells.\n\nWELLS (V.O.)

Please!\n\nWells cocks the gun, sticks it at her head.\n\nWELLS\nFive!  Four!...\n\nVOICE\nThree...two...one...\n\nWells spins in astonishment:\n\nAn ominous hulking shadow looms in the darkness behind him.  TWO\nPULSATING YELLOW EYES pierce through the blackness.\n\nVOICE\nI just counted you out, Wells.\n\nWells fires!  The Shadow swings the manhole cover up as the bullet\nricochets off it harmlessly.  Wells prepares to fire again.  The\nmanhole cover suddenly explodes out of the darkness!  One swing of a\nmassively muscled arm - one sickening \"clang\" - and it's over.\n\nANGLE ON STREET\n\nSWAT LT.\nLet's go!\n\nThe Police rush toward the alley, Gordon and Haley bringing up the\nrear, as the two Women emerge.\n\nWOMAN\nWOMAN #2\nHe saved us!  A giant black\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   Eight\nfee tall!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   monster from the\nsewers!\n\nThe Police storm into the alley as Gordon and Haley comfort the panting\nWomen.\n\nWOMAN\nWOMAN #3\t\t\t\t\t    He had black wings...\nAnd...and yellow eyes...\n\nGORDON\nWell, of course he did...You can\nboth calm down now, ladies.

Haley cocks his head\nquestioningly at Gordon as they proceed into the alley.\n\nGORDON\nForget it.  That airhead from the\nsubway could never have made it to\nthe north side of town this fast.\n\nHALEY\nMaybe there's more than one of them.\nMaybe we're dealing with some sort\nof secret society of cross-dressers.\n\nWells is led past them, still groggy, as they arrive at the open\nmanhole and peer down into the forbidding blackness.\n\nGORDON\nGet after him, Haley.\n\nHALEY\n(gulping)\nMe, Sir?\n\nGORDON\nWell, you're the only one with an\naccurate description!\n\nHaley reluctantly lowers himself into the open manhole as Gordon turns,\nyells down the alleyway.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nComb the area!  I want every squad\ncar available!  We're looking for\nthe mother of all psychos in a party\ncostume!\n\nGordon turns back, looks down into the empty manhole where Haley has\nnow disappeared.\n\nHALEY'S VOICE\n(from manhole)\nYou don't think he...bites, do you,\nSir?\n\nEXT. GOTHAM APARTMENT HOUSE - HIGH SHOT - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA LOOKS DOWN from the roof of a Gotham skyscraper at the windows\nof a forty-story apartment house below.\n\nCAMERA HOLDS on a pair of glass doors leading out to a rosetta-carved\nstone balcony.  Clearly visible through the doors:  AN ELDERLY COUPLE\nlie face down on the floor of their living room, guarded by a masked\nBURGLAR holding a shotgun.  ANOTHER BURGLAR has managed to open a wall\nsafe and begins stuffing valuables into a gunny sack.\n\nCAMERA ZOOMS BACK!\n\nWe are some thirty stories higher across a wide avenue.\n\nA black-gloved hand ENTERS FRAME, holding a thin, clear nylon cord with\na tiny barbed fishhook on the end.\n\nThe other gloved hand steadies a gleaming titanium rifle barrel with an\ninfrared scope.  The fishhook is threaded through the chamber.\n\nA flap is opened in a thick, compartmentalized black belt.  The\nmoonlight glints off a cylindrical silver gas cartridge.\n\nANGLE ACROSS STREET THROUGH SCOPE\n\nSeen through the magnified infrared scope:  the cross hairs of the\nrifle sight settle in on the head of the Burglar holding the shotgun.\n\nThe cross hairs pause - then suddenly lower to the balcony.  The rifle\nFIRES with an audible \"hiss\" of compressed gas.\n\nANGLE ON ROSETTA BALCONY\n\nAs the fishhook whistles through a hole in the rosetta stone framework\nof the balcony.  On impact with the floor it pops open - expanding to\nten times its size, having now become an effective grappling hook.\n\nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe Burglar with the shotgun turns at the muffled metallic NOISE, looks\nthrough the glass doors at the empty balcony.\n\nEXT.

SKYSCRAPER ROOF - NIGHT\n\nThe nylon cord has been pulled taut - it disappears down into the\nblackness at a dizzying height, some four hundred feet above the avenue\nand crisscrossing traffic lights below.\n\nBlack-gloved hands take hold of the cord, testing it.\n\nEXT. SKY - NIGHT\n\nAn ominous BLACK SHADOW, cape billowing out behind in an eerie\nsilhouette, passes in front of the glowing yellow ball of the full\nmoon.\n\nANGLE DOWN CORD AT BALCONY\n\nThe balcony and double glass doors WHISTLE UP AT CAMERA at a dizzying\nspeed, growing larger by the millisecond!\n\nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe Burglar has finished his work at the safe.  He nods to the other\nBurglar who grins, then cocks his shotgun, pointing it down at the\nhelpless Couple on the floor.\n\nThe flicker of an outside SHADOW flits across the room - the Burglar\nblinks, wheels with his shotgun!\n\nSuddenly:  the double doors explode with a hail of shattering glass!\nAlmost simultaneously - the shotgun FIRES!\n\nINT. GORDON'S CAR - NIGHT\n\nA surly Gordon looks over as his intercom crackles.\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nCommissioner, this is Sergeant\nHavemeyer.  I'm on the fortieth\nfloor of the Gotham Arms.  Our boy\nhas struck again.  Cape, boots, hood\n-- the whole drill.\n\nGORDON\n(snatches intercom)\nWhen?\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nJust now.  The owners tripped a\nsilent alarm.  We responded and\nheard a gunshot as we were running\ndown the hallway.  The victims are\nfine.  Sonofabitch cold-cocked both\nperpetrators.\n\nGORDON\nAtta boy, Havemeyer.  Hold him for\nquestioning till I get there.\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nCan't do that, Sir.

GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT\n\nPolice SIRENS everywhere.  A squad car rolls slowly down the street,\nits spotlight searching the doorways and alleys.\n\nINT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT\n\nThe COP DRIVER yawns, turns to his PARTNER who works the spotlight, now\nnotices something.\n\nCOP DRIVER\nWhat's that?\n\nPARTNER\nWino...\n(out the window)\nGo back to sleep, Ace!\n\nSuddenly:  A WHISTLING SOUND through the air!  The two Cops blink, snap\ntheir heads forward as the searchlight is trained on:\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN - THEIR  P.O.V.\n\nTHE BATMAN! - Seen in his majestic totality for the very first time.  A\ntruly awesome figure from his black cowl to his gleaming black boots.\nHis huge, dark cape billows out ominously behind him.\n\nBACK TO SQUAD CAR\n\nCOP DRIVER\nHolee shit...\n\nPARTNER\nLet's get him!\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe squad car lurches forward!

He looks over his shoulder.\n\nANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe squad car fills the alleyway.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nHe looks in front of him in horror - another squad car speed at him\nfrom the other direction.  It too fills the alleyway.

Then - curiously - runs directly at the first\nsquad car.\n\nANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SQUAD CAR #1\n\nCOP #1\nWhat the...?\n\nBACK TO BATMAN - SLOW MOTION SHOT\n\nWith a perfectly timed leap, Batman vaults onto the hood of the car in\na somersault and does a complete 360 - up the windshield - over the\nroof - off the trunk - lands on the pavement with the grave of a cat.\n\nANGLE ON TWO POLICE CARS\n\nThey crash head-on with a sickening sound of crunching metal and flying\nglass.  Two groggy Police exit, front doors falling off, try to clear\ntheir heads.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAWN\n\nThe first orange rays of the morning sun stab upwards through the\nclouds over Wayne Manor.\n\nINT. YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - DAY\n\nYoung Bruce Wayne's lab room remains much as we remember it, except\nthat the gaping hole in the wall caused by the laser has been\nreinforced and shaped into a doorway.  A make-shift ladder-like\nstairway leads down into the cavern below.\n\nFOOTSTEPS are heard climbing the ladder from deep within the cave.\nAfter a moment, Bruce appears, stripped to the waist, still wearing his\nutility belt and the bottom half of his Batman suit.  His chest and\nstomach are nicked with small cuts and bruises from his previous\nnight's work.  His forehead glistens with sweat born of utter\nexhaustion.  He sits heavily on a cot, buries his face in his hands,\nlooks up suddenly as the door to the lab opens.\n\nAlfred enters, stares silently, first appalled by Bruce's physical\ncondition, then shaking his head with sympathy.  Bruce stares back,\neyes heavy with lack of sleep.\n\nBRUCE\nYou...think I'm crazy, don't you?\nCertifiably insane.\n\nALFRED\n(pause; smile)\nA bit...eccentric, perhaps.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's...what I have to do, Alfred.\nAfter all those years of searching\n-- it was always what I had to do.\n\nALFRED\nIf I may be permitted, Sir...\n(with difficulty)\nI've...never had any children of my\nown.  Never saw the advantage in it,\nconsidering my profession.

GOTHAM COUNTRY CLUB - DAY\n\nBruce lies on a deck chair by the swimming pool of the Gotham Country\nClub, his body coated with sun oil.  He listens to Gordon's TV press\nconference on a tiny transistor set next to him.  His eyes flutter open\nwith amusement.\n\nTV REPORTER\nWell considering the fact he apprehended\nfour criminals last night, shouldn't we\nbe calling him...a good Samaritan?\n\nGORDON\nSure.  If you feel like calling John\nHinkley a political activist.\n\nBruce's eyes suddenly bulge wider.  He gazes across the swimming pool,\ntransfixed by what he sees.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER - BRUCE'S P.O.V.\n\nA stunning-looking woman (SILVER ST. CLOUD) steps out onto the high\nboard of the pool, dressed in a daringly-cut shiny white latex tank\nsuit.  A shining mane of glistening silver hair cascades down across\nher shoulders.  She pauses, a shimmering white diamond in the sun.\n\nREPORTER'S VOICE\nCommissioner, it might surprise you\nto know that several polls taken\ntoday show more than eighty percent\nof those interviewed approve of\nthis...vigilante and what he did...\n\nSilver glances over in Bruce's direction.  Curiously enough, she seems\nto smile at him and wave.\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nWell I can't account for public\ntaste, bit I'd like to warn any\npotential copy cats who may be out\nthere that...\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce is stunned and confused, but starts to lift his hand to wave back\nwhen:\n\nTHORNE'S VOICE\nIf brains were bodies, she'd look\njust the same.  Can you believe it?\n\nBruce swivels, lowering his hand.  Thorne stands behind him, waves back\nat Silver who executes a complicated but perfect dive into the pool.\nShe starts to swim across in their direction as Throne grins down at\nBruce.\n\nTHORNE\nName's Silver St. Cloud.  Phi Beta\nKappa, Masters Degree in Political\nScience.  Just arrived in Gotham to\nfinish her doctorate on municipal\ngovernment and guess which City\ncouncilman drew her as an intern?\n\nBRUCE\n(staring)\nTaught her much so far?\n\nTHORNE\n(chuckle)\nNot as much as I plan to.\n\nSilver reaches the edge of the pool.  Thorne starts to help her out as\nBruce continues to start.\n\nSILVER\nThe water's glorious, Rupert.  Come\non in.\n\nTHORNE\nNever had time to learn how to swim.\nToo busy trying to make a living, I\nguess.  Not like Mr. Wayne over\nhere...\n(chuckle)\nRight, Bruce?\n(turns)\nSilver St. Cloud - Bruce Wayne.\n\nBruce looks up, totally mesmerized by the sight of her.  She gazes down\nwith a devastating smile, the sun sparkling off the beads of water on\nher face.  She is instantly and equally smitten as they lock eyes.\n\nSILVER\nPlease don't get up.\n\nBRUCE\n(lost)\nHmm?\n\nSILVER\nI said - please don't get up.\n\nBRUCE\nOh.\n(starts to get up)\nSorry...\n\nSILVER\nThat's all right.  I asked you not\nto, remember?\n\nBRUCE\n(stops)\nSo you did.  Thanks.\n\nSILVER\nDon't mention it.\n\nRupert watches them watching each other.  The uncomfortable silence is\nfilled by Gordon's VOICE from the television.\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nAnd now, if there are no other ques-\ntions, it's my birthday tonight and\nI have a formal party to get ready\nfor...\n\nThorne reaches down, turns off the TV in disgust.\n\nTHORNE\nThat clown has been a disgrace to\nlaw enforcement his entire career.\nThis city's going to hell in a hand-\nbasket and some imbecile's giving\nhim a formal birthday party.\n\nBRUCE\nIt should be fun.  I'm giving it.\n\nThorne raises his eyebrows.  Silver still stares.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nPerhaps the two of you would like to\ncome?\n\nTHORNE\nSILVER\nI'm busy, thanks.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   I'd\nlove to.\n\nTHORNE\n(irritated)\nSilver, I don't think...ah...\n\nSILVER\nIf I'm not being too inquisitive,\nMr. Wayne - exactly what is it you\ndo?\n\nBRUCE\nDo?\n\nSILVER\nFor a living?\n\nTHORNE\n(chuckles)\nYou're looking at it.\n\nBRUCE\nActually, Rupert's not being\nentirely fair about his...\n(nice smile)\nSometimes I go hang gliding.\n\nSILVER\nAnd that's it?\n\nBRUCE\nNot quite.\n\nSILVER\nI didn't think so.\n\nBRUCE\nI have a dog as well.\n\nSilver manages a tiny, unsure smile.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nWayne Manor.  Eight o'clock.  I'll\nhave my car pick you up.\n\nTHORNE\nWhy don't you take my car, Silver?\nIn case you want to leave early.\n\nSILVER\nI'm very flattered by the dueling\nlimos, gentlemen, but I can grab a\ncab, thanks.\n(nods)\nMr. Wayne...\n\nSilver excuses herself.  Both men watch her departure avidly.\n\nTHORNE\nGotham City's no place for a beauti-\nful woman to be travelling alone.\nI'm holding you personally responsi-\nble for her safety, Wayne.\n\nBRUCE\nDon't worry, Rupert.  I'll treat her\njust as if I were in love with her\ninstead of you.\n\nThorne's eyes narrow.  Bruce smiles ingenuously.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nDozens of expensive cars disgorge their passengers in front of stately\nWayne Manor.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nA lavish party is in progress.  A DANCE BAND plays off to the side,\nunder a banner reading \"Happy Birthday to the Finest of Gotham's\nFinest.\"\n\nBruce Wayne greets his arriving GUESTS, his neck craning around in vain\nfor a sight of Silver.\n\nGordon stands by the bar, downs a double scotch, scowls at GUESTS who\ntalks animatedly to him while flapping his arms like wings - doing a\ncrude imitation of the Batman.  The Guest howls with laughter, moves\noff as Gordon orders another drink and Bruce joins him with a\nsympathetic smile.\n\nBRUCE\nThey're giving you a pretty hard time\nabout that Batman, aren't they...\n\nGordon nods, tosses back his drink angrily.\n\nGORDON\nI'd give up half my pension to be\nstanding face to face with that\ncaped fruitcake right now.\n(looks off; stares)\nNow there's a sight to make an old\nman's eyes water.\n\nSilver St. Cloud approaches them, threading her way through the\nappreciative glances of the Guests, dressed in a sparkling, metallic\nevening gown, the light bouncing off it like tiny bursts of shooting\nstars.  She reaches Bruce, extends her hand with a warm smile.\n\nSILVER\nI hope I'm not too late.\n\nGORDON\nIn my case, by twenty years.\n\nBRUCE\nSilver, St. Cloud - this is David\nGordon, Commissioner of Police.\nMiss St. Cloud is picking up the\nfiner points of the city government from\nCouncilman Thorne.\n\nSILVER\nMy ambition is to hold a job as\nimportant as yours one day, Commis-\nsioner.\n\nGORDON\nThen you and Mr. Thorne already have\nmuch in common.\n\nSILVER\n(suddenly)\nWould you care to dance, Mr. Wayne?\n\nBRUCE\n(locking eyes)\nYou're as clairvoyant as you are\nbeautiful, Miss St. Cloud.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nNow heading into the driveway is a brightly painted version of an old-\ntime twenties paddy wagon, with two look-alikes of the old KEYSTONE\nKOPS riding on top.  They honk a comical horn loudly as laughing\nPARKING ATTENDANTS greet them\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ANGLE ON DANCE FLOOR\n\nBruce and Silver glide smoothly across the floor - a perfect fit.\nBruce looks down curiously.\n\nSILVER\nSomething wrong?\n\nBRUCE\nYou're...leading.\n\nSILVER\nI asked you, remember?\n\nAlfred arrives, interrupting them.\n\nALFRED\nExcuse me, Sir, but there are some\noddly dressed gentlemen outside with a\nsinging telegram for the Commissioner.\n\nBRUCE\nAsk them to come in, will you,\nAlfred?\n\nBruce makes his way to the bandstand, whispers some instructions to the\nBANDLEADER.  A LOUD FANFARE is played.  All conversation stops as the\nfront door opens.\n\nNow entering Wayne Manor:  the Two Keystone Kops, in their twenties'\ncostumes with handlebar moustaches.  They dance their way to the center\nof the room in a prearranged routine, singing in harmony from Pirates\nof Penzance.\n\nKOPS\nWhen a felon's not engaged in his\nemployment,\nOr maturing his felonious little\nplans,\nHis capacity for innocent enjoyment\nIs just as great as any honest\nman's...\nOh, a policeman's lot is not a happy\none...\n\nThe Guests applaud loudly.  Gordon joins Bruce and Silver as the Kops\nbreak into a vaudeville routine.\n\nKOP\nExcuse me, Sir.  Have you seen a\npoliceman around here?\n\nKOP #2\nWhy no, I haven't.\n\nKOP\n(drawing gun)\nGood.  Then give me your watch.\n\nSeveral Guests laugh.  Bruce winces at the bad joke.\n\nKOP #2\nBut this watch isn't worth anything.\nIt only has a sentimental value.\n\nKOP\nWell give it to me anyway.  I feel\nlike a good cry.\n\nGordon laughs loudly as the Kop turns to him.\n\nKOP (CONT'D)\nNow, Commissioner, if we could\nborrow your watch for a moment...\n\nGORDON\n(taking it off)\nSure.  Be careful with it, okay?\n\nThe Kop smiles, takes the watch, dangles it from his hand.  Kop #2\nsilently sidles in behind Bruce and Silver.\n\nKOP\nHere's a good one:  what's a police-\nman's favorite way to kill time?\n\nGORDON\n(grinning)\nI'll bite.  What is a policeman's\nfavorite way to kill time?\n\nThe Kop grins, pull his gun - FIRES!  Gordon's watch is smashed to\nsmithereens.  Kop #2's gun suddenly at the back of Silver's head,\nhammer cocked.\n\nKOP #2\nUp against the wall, everybody!\nMove!!\n\nThe Guests scream as six more Kops burst through the front door\ncarrying automatic weapons.  Bruce, Silver, and Gordon are herded back\nagainst the wall with the others.\n\nThe KOP grins, then suddenly starts to giggle insanely.  He takes off\nhis helmet, as a shock of GREEN HAIR is exposed!  He wipes his lips\nclean which now become ruby red.  Cackling in glee, THE JOKER faces his\nvictims, his gaze suddenly becoming cruel and cold.\n\nJOKER\nOne at a time, your money and your\njewels, and no one's head'll wind\nup looking like the Commissioner's\nwatch, capisce?\n\nKOP #3\nHey, boss!  Look!\n\nThe Joker turns.  Kop #3 and a PARTNER have set Gordon's huge birthday\ncake on the floor, now wade through it, stomping up and down, kicking\nthe insides across the room.\n\nKOP #3\nWe're doing the cake walk!\n\nThe Joker giggles, then shoots a satanically maniacal look at the\nGuests who instantly begin stripping off their jewelry, taking out\nwallets, etc. as more Kops pass by with a gunny sack.  The Joker walks\ndown the line, stopping to level a searching and curious gaze into the\neyes of:\n\nBruce Wayne, between Gordon and Silver, his face set, eyes steely,\nstaring at the Joker.  His jaw twitches.\n\nSilver watches him, noticing the twitch.  She gives him a tiny,\nsympathetic smile, then turns to face:\n\nKop #2, who has moved down the line to Silver.  He looks her up and\ndown hungrily as she stares back in defiance.  His fingers slowly reach\nup to grip her necklace, then linger.\n\nKOP #2\nIn your case, lady, I'd like to\nrip the rest off and leave this on.\n\nSuddenly:  BRUCE'S FIST FLASHES INTO FRAME!  Kop #2 is knocked backward\nthrough the air as another Kop lunges at Bruce who grabs the gunny sack\nfilled with jewelry and bashes him in the face!  The Kop crumples to\nthe floor as Bruce wheels to face the Joker and sees:\n\nThe Joker, grinning cruelly, the barrel of his gun pressing up under\nSilver's chin.  Her eyes are welded shut with fear.\n\nJOKER\nNow that was extremely bad manners,\nMr. Wayne.  Especially from someone...\n(gestures)\n...to the Manor born...\n(giggles)\nSo why don't you rejoin the lady here,\nor if you like...\n(cocks gun; glowers)\nI can send part of her over to you.\n\nBruce hesitates, then rejoins the line.

Just catching up on\na little back work.\n\nGUARD\nThe doors are all locked up there,\nMiss, and...I'm not authorized to\nopen them.\n\nSilver dangles her key with a pleasant smile, passes by him, enters the\nelevator.  The doors close.  The nervous Guard picks up a house phone.\n\nGUARD\nThere's a girl named Silver St. Cloud on\nher way up.  I tried to stop her...\n\nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA LOOKS DOWN from the main gears of the elevator at a seemingly\nendless shaft of cables.  The car carrying Silver rises quickly, jerks\nto a stop at one of the top floors.\n\nINT. CITY HALL CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nSilver exits the elevator, starts down the corridor for her office\ndoor.  She passes Thorne's office, then stops, hearing MUFFLED VOICES\nfrom inside.\n\nSILVER\nRupert?...\n\nThere is a sudden silence.  Silver cocks her head curiously.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nRupert, it's Silver...\n\nSilver opens the door, suddenly recoils, aghast:\n\nANGLE ON THORNE - HER P.O.V.\n\nThorne sits behind his desk, bound and gagged, tied to the chair.  His\neyes bulge in terror as Silver rushes in.\n\nSILVER\nRupert, what happened!\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nYou like that gag?\n\nSilver wheels to face the Joker behind her!\n\nJOKER\nWell, here's an even better one!\n\nA stream of clear liquid shoots out from a plastic flower on the\nJoker's coat lapel, drenching Silver's face as she recoils, stunned,\nthen instantly drops to the floor.  The Joker giggles as Thorne rises\nfrom behind the desk, the ropes dropping off him like spaghetti.  He\ntakes the gag out of his mouth, looks down at Silver, nervous and\nagitated.\n\nTHORNE\nI can't get her involved.  This\nchanges everything.\n\nJOKER\nThis changes nothing.\n(looks down; appre-\nciative smile)\nIn fact, it might even give that\nblack-caped creep an added incentive\nto walk into our trap.\n\nTHORNE\n(concerned)\nHow long before she wakes up?\n\nJOKER\nHalf an hour.\n(wicked grin)\nNever, if you prefer...\n\nTHORNE\n(glaring coldly)\nThis better work out.  I warn you,\nJoker - don't disappoint me.\n\nJOKER\n(crossing to door)\nPlease.  If everyone in this country\nworked as efficiently as I do, we'd\nbe back on the road to prosperity.\n(turns; stops)\nOh.  And starting tomorrow - after\nthe Batman's funeral - don't you\ndisappoint me, understood?\n\nThe Joker smiles cruelly, giggles, then disappears.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA PANS the cavernous Batcave.  We HEAR the low, powerful, whining\nGRIND of what seem to be turbine engines.  It rises in pitch and\nintensity, growing richer and more deafening than a 747.\n\nThe blasting SOUND is coming from behind a corner of the cave, its\nsource unseen.  But up against one wall, in a cubicle niche:\n\nA RED TELEPHONE PULSATES WITH GLOWING LIGHT!\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nAlfred walks down the hallway dressed for bed, stifles a yawn, notices\nsomething through the open study door.\n\nANGLE ON STUDY DOOR - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe light coming from the study seems to pulsate as well, first dying,\nthen rising.  Dying, then rising.\n\nINT. STUDY - NIGHT\n\nThe pulsating light comes from a desk lamp.  Alfred enters, crosses,\npresses a hidden button under the desk:\n\nA bottom drawer pops open, revealing a glowing red extension of the\nBatphone in the cave.\n\nAlfred shoves the drawer back, hurries out of the study.\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nAlfred crosses the living room, heading for a tall grandfather's clock\nat one end.  He reaches behind the clock.  We HEAR a switch \"CLICK.\"\nAlfred reaches behind, swivels the clock away from the wall.\n\nThe SOUND of the ENGINE WHINE becomes immediately audible.  Alfred\nhurries through the opening in the wall.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT\n\nKnifing up into the blackness over the skyline of Gotham City - THE\nGLEAMING BATSIGNAL!\n\nINT. THORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThe office has been ransacked.  Drawers overturned, bookcases emptied,\nwith piles of paper and debris strewn across the floor.\n\nSilver sits in a chair, conscious but still groggy.  Thorne paces\nangrily in front of Gordon, kicking trash left and right as the Batman\nwatches from inside the doorway, his eyes darting back and forth.\n\nTHORNE\nIt's unbelievable!  The Joker!\nRight here in my office!\n(at Silver)\nHe could have killed her!\n(realizes)\nHe could have killed me, for God's\nsake!\n\nBATMAN\nI wonder why he didn't...\n\nBatman crosses, eyes riveted on Silver.  She feels his magnetic gaze on\nher, now stares back, fascinated by him.\n\nTHORNE\nYou sound disappointed!\n\nGORDON\nCalm down, Rupert!  We've got a long\nnight ahead of us.\n\nTHORNE\nWhat's this we crap?\n\nGORDON\nWell, you're the only one who'd know\nwhat was missing.\n(turns)\nI'll send for a squad car to drive\nyou home, Miss St. Cloud.\n\nSilver nods at Gordon, then looks back into the dark, magnetically\nintimidating gaze of the Batman.\n\nSILVER\nPerhaps...the Batman would be kind\nenough to see me home.\n\nTHORNE\nWhat?\n\nBatman stares back at Silver with no apparent reaction.  She smiles\nunsteadily, not sure of herself.\n\nSILVER\nIf I'm not too far out of your way.\n\nBATMAN\n(pause)\nI can't imagine such a place exists,\nMiss St. Cloud.\n\nTHORNE\nOh, brother...\n\nSilver blushes, then rises, offers Batman her arm.\n\nSILVER\nGood-night, Rupert...\n\nTHORNE\nWait!...\n\nBatman leads Silver out the door.  Thorne's face trembles with rage and\nfrustration as Gordon looks over curiously.\n\nGORDON\nRelax, Rupert.  Who could she be\nsafer with?\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN on Thorne's troubled face.\n\nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nBatman leads Silver to the elevator, presses the button.\n\nSILVER\nWe're taking the elevator?\n\nBATMAN\nDoesn't everybody?\n\nSILVER\nWhy did I have this feeling we'd be\ndropping out a window together, or\nsomething exotic like that...\n\nThe elevator arrives.

Silver screams as she\nand Batman are momentarily pushed up into the air.  Batman grabs onto a\nlight fixture in the roof, bashes the ceiling escape hatch away.\n\nANGLE ON ELEVATOR\n\nPlummeting down the shaft.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nHe reaches into his utility belt, pulls out a nail-like piece of curved\nmetal attached to a nylon cord.  It pops open into a large, four-\npronged fish hook.\n\nBATMAN\nGrab my belt!  Hang on!\n\nANGLE IN SHAFT\n\nThe hook flies out of the top of the sinking elevator heading for the\nwall of the shaft.  It grazes down the shaft wall, catches on one set\nof gears which allow the doors to open on each individual floor.  The\nnylon cord goes taut.\n\nBACK TO ELEVATOR\n\nSilver hangs on as Batman hooks his arm around her.  The two of them\nshoot upwards through the escape hatch.\n\nANGLE ON ELEVATOR\n\nStill plummeting.  It hits the ground with an ear-splitting, sickening\ncrash.\n\nINT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nA WASHERWOMAN standing by the elevator doors, with her mop and pail,\npresses the \"down\" button.  It opens.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman and Silver hang by the cord in the shaft, her arms locked around\nhim in a death grip.  She stares, goggle-eyed.\n\nBATMAN\n(at Silver)\nNext time - remind me to try the\nwindow.\n\nEXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\nBatman and Silver walk down a deserted street.  She is a wreck -\ntrembling, ripped dress, with streaks of cable grease on her face and\nhair.\n\nBATMAN\nI'm parked in the alleyway.

Batman and\nSilver's heads snap up:\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN'S GANG - THEIR P.O.V.\n\nTHREE PENGUIN CONFEDERATES whizz down at them through the night sky\nwearing jetpacks!  Orange flames shoot out from behind their propelling\nrigs as they maneuver through the air, now heading into a synchronized\npower dive.\n\nThe Penguin hovers above, still supported by his whirling umbrella-\ncopter.\n\nA hail of MACHINE GUN BULLETS spews forth from guns mounted on top of\ntheir packs - the flyers close in on Batman and Silver like attacking\nfighter planes.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN AND SILVER\n\nBatman dives behind a row of garbage cans, pushing a screaming Silver\ndown in front of him as the fusillade ricochets off the cans and\nbuilding walls.\n\nThe flying formation zooms back up into the sky again, preparing to\nmake another pass.  Batman turns to a trembling Silver who is paralyzed\nwith fear.\n\nBATMAN\nStay here!  It's me they want...\n\nSILVER\nDon't leave me!!\n\nBatman turns and looks:  she is a quaking mess.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nOh, please?

A sleek,\npowerful, futuristic panther of a car - jet black with a domed\ninterior.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nThe interior is a glistening, intricate maze of computers, screens, and\ncomplicated electrical systems.  Silver's eyes are frozen open in\nastonishment.

There is one.\n\nANGLE ON SKY\n\nThe Penguin and his three Jetpack Bandits zoom down at the car, their\nmounted machine guns BLAZING.  Bandit #1 powers forward, spewing\nbullets as he comes.\n\nINT.

They soar higher to avoid their own fire.\n\nBACK ON BATMOBILE\n\nSpeeding down an avenue along the side of the park.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nSilver looks over hopefully.\n\nSILVER\nI guess we frightened them off.\n\nBatman shakes his head, flips another switch:  A small radar screen\nlights up.  Three blinking LIGHT BLIPS are still following them.\nBatman suddenly looks ahead, eyes widening.\n\nANOTHER CAR heads directly at them, guns blazing!\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nI think I'll keep my mouth shut.\n\nANGLE ON STREET\n\nThe HOOD CAR swerves off the street into the park.

A giant horseshoe\nmagnet swivels, pointing out behind the car!\n\nANGLE ON BANDIT #3\n\nScreaming, wide-eyed, as the force of the powerful magnet spins him in\nmid-air and he is sucked into the trunk by his jetpack.  The trunk\ncloses on him, slamming shut.\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN SKY\n\nThe Penguin looks down disgustedly, then lifts his gaze ahead and\nbelow, into the park.\n\nEXT. PARK - ANGLE ON CURVE - NIGHT\n\nA Bandit watches near a curve in the park road as the Hood Car roars\nby.

PARKING BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nThe Batmobile roars around hairpin turns, ascending the levels of the\nparking building like a sportscar.\n\nThe Hood Cars screech after him, gaining speed.  They pursue Batman\nhigher and higher, threading the narrow openings through the lines of\nparked cars, tearing off side mirrors, doors, and fenders on their way\nby.\n\nANGLE ON HIGHER LEVEL\n\nThe Batmobile, reaching the level just under the roof, squeals around a\ncorner, catches the fender of a parked car, and spins out of control!\n\nBatman slams on the brakes as the Batmobile skids and turns to face:\n\nThe two Hood Cars, which have stopped so that they are completely\nblocking off the exit ramps, up and down.

Her gaze flicks from Bruce to Batman to Bruce to\nBatman like someone watching a tennis match.\n\nANGLE ON GORDON AT TOP OF STAIRS\n\nGordon stands in a group at the top of the stairs to the mezzanine,\nlooking down in dismay.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Batman joins Rupert and Archerd at the microphone with a cold and\ndistant air.  (His resemblance to Bruce is uncanny.)  Archerd swallows\nnervously.\n\nARCHERD\nYou're...taking quite a chance,\nshowing up in public like this,\naren't you, Batman?\n\nBATMAN\nThe way I see it, we're all taking\nquite a chance if we let a sick\ncriminal mind like the Joker paralyze\nthis entire community with fear.\n\nAn angry MUTTERING is heard from within the Crowd.\n\nCROWD MEMBER\nSure.  He's not the one who's\ngoing to get killed...\n\nBatman's head snaps around angrily at the remark.\n\nBATMAN\nStep forward and say that to my\nface, if you've got the guts!\n\nThe Crowd hangs back, confused and frightened.  More angry muttering is\nheard, now mixed in with boos.\n\nCROWD #2\nCROWD #3\n\t\t\t\t\t Get him out of here!\nGo home, Batman!\n\nThe boos grow louder and defiant, as Gordon hurries to the fake\nBatman's side and Thorne smiles thinly at the imposter.\n\nTHORNE\nIt seems you're not exactly the\npeople's choice anymore, Batman...\n\nGORDON\n(at Batman)\nC'mon.  Let me get you out of here\nbefore these gentle people tear you\nup into little pieces...\n\nGordon leads a reluctant Batman away through the jeering Crowd.  Bruce\nwatches in horror with Alfred as the taunts continue.\n\nCROWD #4\nCROWD #5\n\t\t   Leave us alone!\nI'm not getting killed for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nyou!\n\nALFRED\n(grim whisper)\nA rather cruel sort of joke,\nwouldn't you say?\n\nBRUCE\n(nods coldly)\nAnd I don't think we've heard the\npunch line yet.\n\nGordon appears in the doorway, raises his arms to quiet the panicking\nCrowd.\n\nGORDON\nSettle down, folks!  Take it easy\nnow!  I've got half the police in\nthis city on their way over here!\nSo if you'll all take your seats...\n\nCROWD #6\nCROWD #7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Is he crazy?\nLet's get out of here!\n\nTHORNE\n(into mike)\nWait!!\n\nThere is a hush.  A stern-faced Thorne plays to his audience for all\nhe's worth.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nWhat the Batman just did was inex-\ncusable.  Perhaps even criminal.\nBut he's right about one thing.  No\ncheap hoodlum is going to intimidate\nRupert Thorne while I still have the\nsaliva to spit on him!  My ticket\nsays seat E-6, and that's where I'm\nparking my keyster for the next\nfew hours!\n(pause; low voice)\nAnd I call upon His Honor, the\nMayor, to join me in the audience.\n\nThe Crowd looks over to the side of the lobby:\n\nGOTHAM'S MAYOR emerges from a group of onlookers.  A grey-haired man\nwho is visibly terrified, he swallows hard.\n\nMAYOR\nCouncilman Thorne is right, of\ncourse.  And I expect every other\ndecent citizen of Gotham City to\nstand up and be counted.\n\nThe Mayor silently starts up the stairs to the mezzanine.  After a\nbeat, Thorne theatrically extends his arm to Silver who hesitates, then\nreluctantly joins him.  They start for the orchestra section as others\nin the Crowd begin to follow.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nWatching Silver disappear.  His jaw twitches.\n\nINT. OPERA MEZZANINE - NIGHT\n\nBruce and Alfred head for their box.  The Mayor approaches from the\nother direction, now escorted by Gordon and a phalanx of Police.  The\nMayor sees Bruce and stops to shake hands.\n\nMAYOR\nIt's good of you to stay, Bruce...\n\nBRUCE\nYou've made a courageous decision,\nYour Honor.  I hope it's the right\none.\n\nThe Mayor nods grimly, enters his box.  The Police form a guard by the\ndoor.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S BOX - NIGHT\n\nAs Bruce and Alfred enter.  Gordon stands in their box, a radio\nreceiver in his ear.  A loud ovation is heard.\n\nWIDE SHOT - AUDIENCE\n\nThe audience is on its feet, facing away from the stage, applauding the\nMayor in his box.  The Mayor lifts his arms in a victory salute.  The\napplause dies down.  The lights dim.  The Overture to I Pagliacci is\nheard, O.S.   CAMERA RISES past the Mayor and his party to the hanging\nchandelier directly above him.  The fixture consists of huge crystal\nteardrops.\n\nEXTREME CLOSE ON CHANDELIER\n\nOne of the crystals is filled with a clear liquid.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce and Alfred settle into their chairs.  Gordon mumbles into his\nradio receiver, ever watchful.\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nINT. OPERA HOUSE - ANGLE ON STAGE\n\nThe Leading Man (CANIO), dressed as a clown, sings the aria \"Vesti La\nGiubba\".  A passionate, sad piece.  He kneels in front of a large\ngaily-painted drum.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nAlfred nods off in his chair.  Bruce elbows him gently.\n\nBACK TO CANIO\n\nApproaching the high point of the aria.  With a magnificent voice, he\nreaches for a \"High C\", hits it strongly and purely, holds on to the\nnote.\n\nANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX\n\nThe Mayor and his party exchange impressed glances.  CAMERA PUSHES IN\nON the chandelier teardrop.  It trembles from the force of the High C -\nnow cracks.  The liquid drips down into the box.\n\nBACK TO STAGE\n\nThe sad aria is ending.  Canio is on his knees, sobbing.  He sings\npianissimo, milking every heart-breaking second.  Suddenly - O.S. - a\nchuckle.  Then the sound of laughter.  Canio peers angrily into the\naudience.\n\nANGLE ON AUDIENCE\n\nConfused, then irritated, as the laughter grows louder.\n\nANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX\n\nThe Mayor and his Party guffaw loudly, pounding their chairs in glee.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nBruce rises from his seat, concerned.\n\nBACK TO MAYOR\n\nTears of laughter stream down the Mayor's cheeks.  He is on his feet\nnow, totally out of control.  The others flop over their chairs,\nroaring helplessly.\n\nBACK TO CANIO\n\nHe walks off the stage in disgust.\n\nBACK TO MAYOR'S BOX\n\nWith a sudden, final burst of insane giggling - all four men collapse.\nThe Mayor hangs over the edge of his box, dead - a grotesque grin\nfrozen on his face.\n\nANGLE ON AUDIENCE\n\nGasping.  Panicking.  As:\n\nANGLE ON STAGE\n\nThe huge clown drum suddenly rips apart from the center.  The Joker\nsteps out, dressed as an obese soprano.\n\nJOKER\nWait!  The opera's not over till the\nfat lady sings!\n\nThe Joker hits his own version of a High C as:\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nOpen fire!\n\nThe lights go out.  Gunfire and screaming are heard in the darkness.\nTotal pandemonium.\n\nINSERT SHOT - GOTHAM TRIBUNE\n\nThe Gotham Tribune cartwheels into frame:  CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME MAKES\nGOOD ON BOAST.  Rupert Thorne appointed acting Mayor.  In the center of\nthe page:  a large photograph of the Batman with the caption:  A\nKILLER?\n\nINT. BATCAVE - WIDE ANGLE - DAY\n\nBruce paces dejectedly, a tiny figure lost in the vastness of the\nenormous cavern.\n\nANGLE FROM STAIRS\n\nAlfred watches sadly from the top of the stairs.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStill pacing.  Thinking.  He passes the huge crime computer, pauses,\nlooks down, punches some keys.\n\nANGLE ON COMPUTER SCREEN\n\nA series of CRIMINAL MUG SHOTS flashes across the screen, law-breakers\nof every variety, finally stopping at:\n\nThe face of the Joker - grinning down menacingly.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring back.  Face set.  Jaw twitching.\n\nThe screen suddenly goes blank.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nAlfred has turned off the computer.  Bruce stares numbly.\n\nALFRED\nSir, I...\n(swallows)\nPerhaps...this isn't the only way.\nPerhaps this is all meant to signal\na...a new beginning for you.  After\nall, you're an intelligent, enter-\nprising young man with every capa-\nbility in the world to...\n\nBruce puts his hand on Alfred's shoulder.\n\nBRUCE\nI...know you love me very much, and I'm\ndeeply grateful, but I wish you'd get\nout of here now, and leave me alone.\n\nAlfred pauses, then nods, walks off dejectedly.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nHe wanders through the cave with glassy eyes, passing a table near the\nBatmobile.  On it - a new version of the battering ram.  Bruce picks it\nup, smiles bitterly, carries it in one hand as he continues to wander,\npassing the crime lab section.\n\nSuddenly - he lashes out - sends the battering ram flying through a set\nof glass beakers filled with chemicals.  Swinging it wildly now, he\ndestroys a section of the crime lab, then sinks heavily into a chair,\nhead bowed.\n\nEXTREME WIDE ANGLE\n\nThe cavernous Batcave.  The tiny, slumped figure of Bruce.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - WIDE ANGLE - DAY\n\nThe hot noonday sun drenches the spacious grounds of Wayne Manor.  Seen\nrunning along a track cut on the periphery of the estate:  the solitary\nfigure of Bruce Wayne.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nAlfred watches from the window, concerned, as O.S., the TELEPHONE\nstarts to RING.\n\nEXT. RUNNING TRACK - DAY\n\nCAMERA CLOSE on Bruce's grimly determined face, oblivious to the\nrivulets of sweat which pour down freely.  His body is encased in\nseveral layers of exercise clothes, deeply stained by perspiration,\nthat turn him into a human pressure cooker.  His legs churn like\ndisassociated pistons.\n\nBACK TO ALFRED\n\nThe telephone continues to RING.  Alfred turns, still distracted by the\nsight of Bruce and answers it.\n\nALFRED\n(into phone)\nMr. Wayne's residence...I'm sorry, he's\nnot available...No, as I told you previ-\nously, I don't know when that would be,\nbut if you'd care to leave another\nmessage...\n\nINT. CITY HALL OFFICE - DAY\n\nCAMERA CLOSE on the door to an inner office marked:  Special Assistant\nto the Mayor - Private.\n\nThe door opens as Silver exits into her outer office, followed by\nseveral NEEDY-LOOKING CONSTITUENTS.\n\nSILVER\n...I'll take it up with Mayor\nThorne.  Gotham needs an effective\nnetwork of daycare centers, and\ntomorrow night's charity opening of\nthe circus seems like a good place\nto start.\n\nThe Constituents thank her profusely.  Silver crosses to her\nSECRETARY's desk with a hopeful look.\n\nSILVER\nAny luck?\n\nSECRETARY\nNada.  Mr. Wayne seems to be perma-\nnently...unavailable.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nWayne Manor seems deserted under the glow of the moon.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE IN POOL\n\nThe Olympic-sized Wayne Manor swimming pool is illuminated by the glow\nof outdoor lights.  In it:  Bruce swims laps, knifing through the water\nwith powerful strokes.\n\nEXT. POOL - CLOSE ON BRUCE - NIGHT\n\nBruce churns through the water, eyes glazed with a total single-\nmindedness.  His speed is Olympian.  As he tilts his head to take\nanother gulp of air, he suddenly stops dead in the water as he sees:\n\nANGLE ON SILVER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nSilver emerges from the darkness, her glistening hair cascading down\nover an evening dress.  She carries a wooden tray with two glasses of\nchampagne on it, smiles as she faces a stunned Bruce who stands waist-\nhigh in the water.\n\nSILVER\nYou know, Bruce, you simply must\npick up your phone messages.\n\nBRUCE\n(careful pause)\nIf I did - what would they say?\n\nSILVER\nThat we were supposed to have dinner\ntonight.\n\nSilver smiles, kicks off her shoes.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nFor some strange reason, I thought you\nmight suddenly have an evening free.\n\n\nBRUCE\nSilver...look...\n(with difficulty)\nI...hope you won't misunderstand\nwhat I'm about to say...\n\nSILVER\nThere aren't going to be any more\nMisunderstandings between us, Bruce.\nAnd I warn you.\n\nSilver slowly and calmly begins walking down the steps into the pool,\ncarrying the tray with her.  The water rises above the hemline of her\nevening dress, heading up for her waist as she advance toward as\nastonished Bruce.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nI can be a very determined person.\n\nSilver arrives at Bruce, the water now up to her chest, letting the\nwooden tray with the champagne float on the surface next to them.  She\nhands him a glass, takes the other herself, raises it, stares deeply\ninto his eyes.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nTo no more misunderstandings.\n\nBruce smiles in spite of himself, tosses back his champagne, then\nstudies her unwavering gaze carefully.  Flipping the glass over his\nhead, he suddenly pulls her toward him, locking her in a passionate,\nhungry kiss.\n\nThey finally break.  Silver purrs, whispers into his ear.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nThere...see what I mean about mis-\nunderstandings?\n\nBRUCE\nNo.  What?\n\nSILVER\nWell just now - a moment ago - I\nthought you were being rude, not\ngetting out of the pool to say hello.\n(looks down; grins)\nI didn't realize you weren't wearing\na bathing suit.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nBruce lies naked under powder-blue silk sheets.  A lovely hand comes\nINTO FRAME, gently strokes his cheek.\n\nSILVER (O.S.)\nWhen I think of how many nights I've\nreached across an empty pillow, hoping\nmy hand would find that face...\n\nThen - a shining mane of hair as Silver, also naked, wraps him in a\ntight embrace.  They kiss.\n\nBRUCE\nThere's so much to explain.  And I'm\nnot quite sure I ever can.\n\nSILVER\nI don't need explanations.  I just\nwant whatever it was to evaporate.\nto simple disappear...\n\nShe rolls over, looks at him carefully.  A Police siren is heard\nfaintly in the distance.  Bruce blinks.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nDid you ever meet him?\n\nBRUCE\nWho?\n\nSILVER\nThe Batman.\n(smiles)\nEvery time I hear a siren.  I think\nof the Batman.\n\nBRUCE\nI...ran into him a few times.  Here\nand there.\n\nSilver smiles down tenderly, studying him.\n\nSILVER\nYou know...that night at the opera.  I\nnever believed that the real Batman\nwould show up like that in public -\nnot when he knew someone else's life\nwas on the line.\n\nBRUCE\n(deadly stare)\nYou're right.  He wouldn't.\n\nBruce suddenly breaks eye contact, unsure if she thinks she's talking\nabout Batman or to Batman.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nYou...met him too one night, didn't\nyou?  Commissiner Gordon told me he\ntook you home or something.\n\nSILVER\n(smiles; remembers)\nOr something.\n(pause)\nWhat can I say?  He was dashing, re-\nsourceful, strong - very sweet in\nhis own special way - all the\nthings you'd expect from the Batman.\n(grins)\nThe next morning I told Rupert I'd\nfallen madly in love with him.\n\nBRUCE\nYou don't say.\n\nSILVER\n(penetrating gaze)\nAnd what's more - I told Rupert I\nwas sure that the Batman...had\nfallen in love with me.\n\nThey look deeply into each other's eyes.  Silver smiles.\n\nBRUCE\nI...think I'm jealous.\n\nSILVER\nI think I'm in love.\n\nThey wrap themselves in each other passionately.\n\nEXT.

All new spectacular extravaganza - THE GLORY THAT WAS ROME.\nPast the billboard is a maze of smaller tents for sideshows, the\nhousing of animals, etc.  Past the - the big top itself.\n\nCAMERA PANS the arriving SPECTATORS, Bruce and Silver among them.  They\nare surrounded by mothers and children.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's almost immoral, you know.\nGoing to the circus without bringing\nyour own children along.\n\nSILVER\nDon't worry.

The head lowers OUT OF FRAME, then\nreappears, this time covered by a CLOWN MASK!\n\nThe Clown Figure hurries out of the tunnel, wearing a floor-lengthed\ngranny dress.\n\nBACK TO ARENA\n\nSeveral of the other Clowns have dispersed, running up into the\naudience as a DRUM ROLL is heard.  The Granny Clown edges over toward\nthe cage containing the big cats.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nOne Clown runs up the aisle past them with what seems to be a bucket of\nwater, spots Silver, flings the contents of the bucket at her!  Bruce\nand Silver flinch as a SHOWER OF CONFETTI blankets them to general\nlaughter and applause.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nNow let me direct your attention to\nthe trapeze and high wire.  Out\nstars of the evening - The Flying\nGraysons!\n\nANGLE ON GRAYSONS\n\nA family of aerialists.  The older Graysons, trim and athletic, stand\non one platform.  Their son, DICK, stands on the other.  He is in his\nmiddle teens, a handsome young man in immaculate physical shape.  He\ntakes hold of a trapeze, swings down.\n\nANGLE ON STANDS\n\nThe Clown who poured the confetti on Bruce and Silver watches through\npancake makeup with more than a passing interest.  Protruding from\nunderneath a large silly hat:  we see the edges of a startling green\nshock of hair.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nDick Grayson swings on the trapeze in a long, powerful arc, executes a\ndifficult flip into the arms of his father.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBRUCE\nRemarkable.  That young boy's one of\nthe greatest natural aerialists I've\never seen.\n\nSILVER\nOh?

He is the only flier\nin the world to accomplish this feet!\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nA DRUM ROLL is heard.  Dick swings down, picking up momentum, then back\nup, then down again.  On his third pass, he tries it:  revolves\ndizzyingly - MAKING FOUR COMPLETE SOMERSAULTS IN MID-AIR!  (Note:\nThere is, actually, only one person in the world who can do this, with\nRingling Bros.)  Dick completes the impossible feat to wild applause.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nOn their feet, applauding enthusiastically with the Crowd.\n\nANGLE ON CLOWN (JOKER)\n\nThe Clown (Joker) giggles under his breath, lifts one billowing sleeve\nof his oversized costume, begins to unbutton it.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nThe Graysons will now perform their\nworld-famous maneuver on the high-\nwire - passing each other and\nexchanging positions - all without\na net!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nBoth starring up, wide-eyed.\n\nANGLE ON GRAYSONS\n\nThe older Graysons stand at either end of a high wire some seventy feet\noff the ground.

It\nhesitates, then takes off!\n\nBACK TO GRAYSONS\n\nThey're face to face now, on the wire, preparing to pass each other\nabove the hushed Crowd.  Suddenly - the falcon flies into view, lands\nheavily on one end of the male Grayson's pole with a SHRIEK!  The\nsurprised man teeters - the wire trembles - the falcon suddenly flies\nat his face!

The Joker grins.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nThe Batman stares coldly, speaks in a icily clear voice.\n\nBATMAN\nI've risked my life to help this\ncity.

SECOND COURTROOM - DAY\n\nCAMERA PULLS BACK from another gavel rapping in another courtroom,\nrevealing the face of a more benign JUDGE.\n\nJUDGE #2\n...therefore, by the power invested\nin this Court...\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nBruce and Dick Grayson stand facing the Judge.\n\nJUDGE #2\nI hereby declare Richard Grayson to\nbe the legally designated ward of\nMr. Bruce Wayne.\n(smiles)\nAnd may I add in passing - you're a\nvery fortunate young man.\n\nBRUCE\nThank you, Your Honor.  I'm aware of that.\n\nJUDGE #2\nI meant...\n\nBruce turns to Dick, grins broadly.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nThe Rolls Royce pulls up in front of Wayne Manor.  Alfred hurries to\nopen the front door as Bruce and Dick exit the car.  Dick stares up at\nthe sprawling residence in awe.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nAs Dick enters with Bruce:  the towering hallway of Wayne Manor is\nfilled with balloons and a banner reading:  \"WELCOME HOME, DICK.\"\nSilver grins down from the staircase.\n\nDick drinks it all in, slightly uneasy and embarrassed.  He wanders\ninto the enormous living room, unsure, visually adjusting himself to\nhis new, outsized life.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nCAMERA PANS ACROSS a fully outfitted trapeze and ring set on the lawn\nof Wayne Manor.  Bruce gazes up proudly at it, looks over to Dick for\nhis reaction.\n\nDick looks up at the apparatus somewhat apprehensively, then flashes\nBruce a self-conscious smile.  Bruce understands, claps a hand on his\nshoulder, leads him away.\n\nEXT. POOLSIDE - DAY\n\nDick lies sunning himself on a chaise by the pool.  Suddenly, a large,\nwet beach ball lands on his stomach.  He pops up, looks off toward the\npool:\n\nBruce and Silver laugh from inside the pool, gesture at Dick to come\nand join them.  He gives them a half-hearted smile, shakes his head,\nthen tosses the ball back.\n\nSilver looks at Bruce with concern.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR DINING ROOM - DAY\n\nDick toys with his food at lunch, looks over nicely at Bruce who is\ntalking non-stop from across the table.\n\nBRUCE\n...later on we'll pick up Silver and\ngo to that new magic musical every-\none's talking about.  We can't stay\nout too later - don't forget we've\nfor that doubleheader tomorrow...\n\nDICK\nSounds great.\n\nBRUCE\n(pause)\nIs something wrong, Dick?\n\nDick lowers his eyes, not wanting to respond.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nWe're all trying just a little too\nhard around here to make you feel at\nhome, right?\n\nDICK\n(with difficulty)\nIt's not that.  You've been wonder-\nful to me.  It's my fault you've\nhad to try so hard.  It's...\n(eyes misting)\nIt's just that I still hurt so much\nsometimes...and then I remember, and\nI get so filled with...hate again.\n\nBRUCE\nHate?\n\nDick's eyes harden.  His face sets with a cold look, not unlike that of\na young Bruce Wayne when he faced Joe Chill.\n\nDICK\nI made a promise to myself the day my\nparents died.  A promise that someday\n-- somehow - I'm going to keep.\n\nBruce's eyes flick over carefully.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat did you promise?\n\nDICK\nI'm going to kill the Batman.\n\nThere is a long silence.  Bruce smiles tentatively.\n\nBRUCE\nThat's a pretty tall order.\n\nDICK\nWe'll see.  I have the rest of my\nlife to get it done.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat if he's...skipped town?  Given\nthe whole thing up?  Died, even.  No\none ever knew who he was in the\nfirst place.  You can't dedicate\nyour whole life to killing a ghost.\n\nDICK\nI thought you'd understand when you\ntold me how your parents were\nkilled.  Didn't you feel the same way?\n\nBRUCE\n(avoiding his gaze)\nWell I was younger than you are,\nand...\n\nDICK\n(pressing him)\nDidn't you hate?  Didn't you want\nto do something about it?\n\nBRUCE\n(pause)\nYes.  For a while.  But then I...\n(looks down)\n...realized how fruitless it was.\n\nDICK\nWell that's not going to happen to\nme!\n\nDick rises from the table, looks over with total, piercing sincerity,\nhis eyes misting over again.\n\nDICK (CONT'D)\nListen, I'm...grateful for every-\nthing you've done for me - and for\nall you intend to do.  But if you\ncan't live with my promise, accept\nit, support it, even - then maybe\nwe've both made a mistake.\n(eyes glistening)\nMay I be excused now?\n\nBruce stares back, deeply moved, almost whispers.\n\nBRUCE\nYes.  Of course you can.\n\nDick hurries out the door.  Bruce grits his teeth, crumples up his\nnapkin, squeezing it into a tiny ball.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nDamn.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM INTERSECTION - NIGHT\n\nRupert Thorne walks briskly down the street, hat tipped low over his\nface, coat collar turned up against the night wind.  He arrives at a\ndeserted intersection, checks the cross street signs, then glances down\nat his watch impatiently.\n\nANGLE ON SIDE OF BUILDING\n\nTucked under a high ledge of a nearby building:  a mounted camera lens\nswivels, the moonlight glinting off its surface.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nRubbing his hands together.  Looking around at the empty streets,\nirritated.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nYou're late.\n\nThorne's head snaps around at he VOICE.  He sees nothing.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nWe shouldn't be seen together any-\nmore, Mr. Mayor.  You can't afford\nthe risk.\n\nThorne stares:  the Joker's Voice is coming from inside a short,\nstanding mailbox on the corner.\n\nThorne hesitates, then slowly moves to the mailbox, tilts back the\nletter slot, mutters, looking around nervously.\n\nTHORNE\nI feel like a Goddamn idiot...\n\nINT. JOKER'S LAIR - NIGHT\n\nThe Joker speaks into a microphone attached to a tiny transmitting set.\n\nA VIDEO SCREEN above shows Thorne standing by the mailbox.\n\nNOTE:  THIS SCENE TO BE INTERCUT AS REQUIRED:\n\nJOKER\nThat's what I felt like twenty years\nago, Thorne.  When I decided to start\noff your political career with a\n\"bang.\"  Remember Thomas Wayne?\n\nTHORNE\n(cold pause)\nEvery time I see his son.\n\nJOKER\nNo regrets now, Mr. Mayor.  It's\ntaken me too long to maneuver us\ninto a position of total control in\nthis city.  I've got the judges\nlined up, the public at your feet...\n(cold pause)\nYou owe me, Rupert Thorne.\n\nTHORNE\nIt's a two-way street.  Once I\nrelieve Commissioner Gordon of his\nduties, you'll have a free rein in\nGotham - less my cut.  And now that\nit's legal to shoot the Batman...\n\nJOKER\nWe have to find him first.  So far,\nit's been like looking for a virgin\nin a maternity ward.\n\nTHORNE\nThen don't find him.  Let him find\nYou.\n\nJOKER\nHow?  If the real Batman wouldn't\neven appear at the opera to save the\nMayor...\n\nTHORNE\nThe Batman wasn't in love with the\nMayor.  He is in love...with a\ncertain young lady.  Or so she tells\nme and I've never known her to lie.\n\nJOKER\nWhat is she, a mute?\n\nTHORNE\n(deadly)\nCareful.  You may be talking about\nthe future Mrs. Thorne.  I...want\nyou to kidnap her.\n\nJOKER\nNow take my wife - please...\n\nTHORNE\nThe girl is not to be harmed.  Once\nyou've killed Batman and made your\nescape - I'll call the police and\nrescue her.\n\nJOKER\nHer knight in shining armor.\n\nTHORNE\nSomething like that.\n\nJOKER\nI underestimated you, Thorne.  I always\nknew you were corrupt, but I had no\nidea you'd turn out to be such a\ndelightfully repellent human being.\n\nThe Joker cackles insanely.  Thorne spots someone coming, closes the\nslot, hurries off.\n\nAfter a beat, an ANCIENT WOMAN approaches the mailbox with a handful of\nletters.  She lowers the slot.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\n(outraged)\nDo you mind?  I'll never get these\npictures developed!\n\nThe Woman SCREAMS!  Her letters go flying up in the air as she hustles\ndown the street.  The insane giggle of the Joker trails off into the\nnight.\n\nINT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nSilver is dressed in a lacy, powder-blue slip, exits her dressing room,\ncombing her hair.  The DOORBELL RINGS.\n\nSILVER\n(crossing)\nWho is it?\n\nVOICE\n(through door)\nGotham Florists, lady.  For a Miss\nSt. Cloud.\n\nSilver looks through the peephole.\n\nANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE\n\nA DELIVERY BOY waits, head down, holding a bouquet.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nSilver opens the doors slightly, sticks her arm out.  The Delivery Boy\nthrusts the bouquet in her hand.\n\nDELIVERY BOY\nSay it with flowers...\n\nSILVER\nWhat a surprise!...\n\nShe inhales the aroma of the bouquet deeply.  Her eyes become glassy.\nShe drops to the floor.\n\nDELIVERY BOY\nWhat a straight man!\n\nHe swings the door open.  It is the Joker.\n\nINT. POLICE HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nThorne strides purposefully down the hallway, followed by a reluctant\nSergeant Haley.\n\nHALEY\n...I don't know, Your Honor.  I\nmean, you're the Mayor and all that\n-- but I work for the Commissioner.\n\nTHORNE\nAs of tomorrow morning, no one works\nfor the Commissioner.  I'm relieving\nhim of his duties.\n\nThey have arrived at Gordon's door.  Haley is shocked.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI assume you'll be staying on, Ser-\ngeant - as a loyal member of the\nforce?\n\nHALEY\nI...hope to, Sir.\n\nTHORNE\nThen open it.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nHaley's key opens the door.  They enter.  Thorne looks around, spots\nthe red phone connected to the Batcave.\n\nTHORNE\nAnyone have the bright idea to run a\ntrace on this.\n\nHALEY\nYes, sir.  First day it was installed.\nBut all we ever got back was an echo\nof our own number.  Guy's amazing,\nisn't he?\n\nTHORNE\nOh, he's a crafty one, all right.\nThanks, Haley.  That's all.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nDick Grayson descends the darkened staircase, dressed in his pajamas.\nHe hears a NOISE, sees a light coming from the study.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR STUDY - NIGHT\n\nAlfred is tidying up the study, turns as Dick appears.\n\nDICK\nAll right if I make a sandwich in\nthe kitchen, Alfred?\n\nALFRED\nWhy certainly, Master Grayson.  If I\nmay be of help...\n\nDICK\n(grin)\nI think I can handle it.  Thanks.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT\n\nBruce sits at the computer, runs through a criminal history of the\nJoker on the video screen.  He pauses, looks off.\n\nANGLE ON BATPHONE\n\nThe red Batphone lights up, then dies.  Lights up, then dies.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring.  Unsure.\n\nINT. WAYNE STUDY - NIGHT\n\nAlfred reaches to turn off the desk lamp.  Suddenly, the light from the\nlamp rises, then dies.  Rises, then dies.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThorne sits, Batphone in hand, waits.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce crosses to the phone.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred presses the button under the desk.  The bottom drawer pops open.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce picks up the phone, listens.\n\nBACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE\n\nTHORNE\nBatman?\n(no reply)\nBatman - if you're there - this is\nMayor Rupert Thorne.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce listens silently, frowning.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred holds the extension, listens in as well.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nNOTE:  THIS CONVERSATION TO BE INTERCUT BETWEEN THORNE, BRUCE, AND\nALFRED AS REQUIRED:\n\nTHORNE\nThis...isn't easy for me, Batman,\nconsidering what I've said and done\nwhere you're concerned.  But I love\nSilver St. Cloud very much - and I\nhave reason to believe you do too.\n\nBruce and Alfred react in their respective locations.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI...dropped by to have a drink with\nher tonight.  The door was open,\nthere were signs of a struggle, and\nshe was gone.  The Joker left a\nplaying card - addressed to you.\n\nBruce's face sets darkly.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\n\"Dear Batman.  Crime fighters may come\nand go, but I carry on in the Great\nAmerican Tradition of violence.  I'm\ncalling my little caper, Slaughter In\nSilver.  Sorry I have to run now.\nWrite if you get work.\"\n\nBruce's eyes narrow, thinking.  Thorne's voice begins to crack\nemotionally over the phone.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI...don't know where they took her\n...or why the note was left for you.\nI only know that Silver means more\nthan my life to me, and I beg you to\nfind her and save her.  You're her\nonly chance, Batman, I...\n\nThorne's voice dies away theatrically.  He hangs up.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce hangs up, stares coldly.  His jaw twitches.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred hangs up in the study, worried.\n\nBACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE\n\nThorne takes a deep breath, smiles, rises, exits.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nDick has made his sandwich, closes the refrigerator door, starts off\nfor the hallway.\n\nANGLE ON HALLWAY ENTRANCE\n\nDick enters the dark hallway, starts for the stairs as he sees:\n\nANGLE ON ALFRED - HIS P.O.V.\n\nAlfred rushes out of the study, heading for the living room.  He slips,\nfalls heavily, picks himself up, oblivious to the pain, rushes into the\nliving room.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nWatching.  He starts for the stairs, then stops, now curiously heads\nfor the living room himself.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nDick enters, look around in amazement:  Alfred is nowhere to be seen!\nHis eyes scan the room for any other exit.\n\nANGLE ON GRANDFATHER CLOCK - DICK'S P.O.V.\n\nThe tall grandfather clock stands against one wall.  A thin shaft of\nlight seems to be emanating from behind it.\n\nDick advances to the clock, looks down, puzzled.  It seems to be\nstanding at a slight angle away from the wall.  Exploring the edge of\nthe clock with his hand, he starts to pull back.  The clock swivels,\nrevealing:\n\nANGLE DOWN INTO BATCAVE - DICK'S P.O.V.\n\nThe Batcave - with all its trophies, computers - in all its regal\nsplendor.  Alfred is standing near the gleaming Batmobile, looks off\nwith concern.\n\nNow emerging from the shadows - THE BATMAN!  Dressed in his full\nregalia, heading quickly toward Alfred and the Batmobile.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nStaring down, his jaw slack.  Stunned.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT\n\nBatman crosses to Alfred, who stares with deadly concern.\n\nALFRED\nDon't go, Sir.\n\nBATMAN\nPlease get out of my way, Alfred.\n\nALFRED\nSince when have you trusted Rupert\nThorne?  You don't even know where\nyou're meant to be going.\n\nBATMAN\nThe clues in the note were obvious.\nThe \"Great American Tradition\" line?\nThat's the name of this year's series\nof exhibits at the Gotham Museum.\nAnd \"Write if you get work\"?  This\nmonth it's on American writers and\nWriting.\n\nALFRED\nIf the clues are that obvious, they\nmust want you to come.  It's a\ntrap, can't you see that?\n\nBATMAN\nThat boy up there thinks the Batman\nkilled his parents.  I told him he\ncouldn't live his whole life chasing\na ghost.  What I realize now is - I\ncan't live the rest of my life\nbeing a ghost.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nListening at the top of the stairs.  Thunderstruck.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nBatman puts an arm on Alfred's shoulder.\n\nBATMAN\nIf I come back, old friend, I'll\nexplain things to Dick.  Tell him\nthe truth and have the Joker to\nprove it.\n(pause)\nAnd if I don't - take care of him,\nAlfred.  He'll be in much better\nhands than he has been in mine.\n\nAlfred silently steps aside as Batman enters the Batmobile, roars off\nthrough the cave.\n\nAlfred pauses sadly, then turns back, heading for the staircase again.\nHe looks up.\n\nANGLE ON DICK - ALFRED'S P.O.V.\n\nDick stands at the top of the stairs, staring down, grimly determined,\nhis face carved in granite.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM ROOFTOPS - NIGHT\n\nBatman's silhouette as he leaps and glides effortlessly across the tops\nof buildings.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\nThe deserted museum with the billboard:  GREAT AMERICAN TRADITIONS.\nThis month:  American Writers and Writing.\n\nEXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT\n\nThe museum roof is a network of vaulted glass skylights.  TWO THUGS\nstand on a surrounding catwalk.\n\nCLOSE ON CATWALK\n\nA sharp metallic \"ping\" is heard across the catwalk.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Thugs look up.  One pulls a gun.\n\nTHUG\nThe Batman...\n\nBATMAN'S VOICE\nCount on it.\n\nThey wheel.  Batman stands directly behind them.  He grabs the first\nThug, swivels him as the second Thug fires - killing his partner.\nBatman shoves the dead man into the second Thug, as both bodies crash\ndown through the glass skylight.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - UP ANGLE - NIGHT\n\nThe bodies explode through the glass, falling some sixty feet to the\nfloor.  Then - total silence.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStaring down through the broken glass.  Listening.  He pulls a tiny\nrevolver from his belt.  A barbed metal dart sticks out of the barrel.\nBatman aims it through the hole, fires.\n\nANGLE ON MUSEUM RAFTERS\n\nThe dart embeds itself deeply into a rafter.  Attached to it is a white\nnylon cord.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nSecuring the other end of the cord.  He hooks himself to it with a\nclip, glides through the opening in the glass.\n\nBACK TO RAFTERS\n\nBatman shoots silently along the cord to a rafter, lands gracefully,\nlooks down.\n\nANGLE DOWN ON MUSEUM - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThrough the dim, eerie light.  This exhibit (like the one including the\ngiant penny) consists of huge, outsized version of everyday items.  In\nthis case - the tools of a writer's trade:  enormous pencils, erasers,\nquill pens, fountain pens, ink wells, a ten-foot-high pencil sharpener,\ntall volumes of famous American novels, etc.\n\nIn the center of the display - a giant electric typewriter, some thirty\nfeet wide.  A huge sheet of blank white paper is rolled up on it.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStaring down curiously through the silent darkness.  His gaze starts to\nwander, then suddenly spots something.\n\nBACK TO TYPEWRITER\n\nA FIGURE attached to the typewriter now moves.  It is Silver, hooked\nonto the ribbon near the center of the page.  She moans, still\nrecovering from the effects of the drugs.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nEyes widening.  He hooks one end of a nylon cord to a rafter, launches\nhimself, swinging down toward Silver.\n\nBACK TO RAFTER\n\nA hand with a knife reaches out, slices through the cord!\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nNow plummeting like a rock.  He falls into the typewriter in front of\nSilver, his cape suddenly catching on something, partially ripping it,\njerking him to a stop.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe lights are turned on.  Emerging from behind or under the various\nexhibits:  thirty or forty GOONS.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman hangs helplessly from the circular element ball which prints out\nthe characters on the page.  His cape is caught on the projected edge\nof one of the giant letters.  He stares ahead, unable to extricate\nhimself.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nThe glaring lights have brought Silver back to consciousness.  Hooked\nto the huge ribbon near the center of the page, she suddenly spots\nBatman across from her.\n\nSILVER\n(horrified)\nOh, my God...\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nStepping out onto the end of the carriage - the Joker!\n\nJOKER\nI knew you'd drop in, Batman.\nYou're that type of guy.\n(insane giggle)\nGet it?  Type?\n\nThe forty Goons circle in around the typewriter.  The Joker nods to two\nof them.\n\nCLOSE ON SWITCH\n\nTwo Goons give a mighty heave, flip the \"ON\" lever.  A loud hum is\nheard as the typewriter activates.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nRupert Thorne hides in the shadows behind a large pencil box, watches\nthe scene.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nYou know, you're nothing to write\nhome about, Batman - but let's give\nit a try.\n\nThe Joker points a gun down at the keyboard.\n\nJOKER\nWhat letter could be hiding under\nyour cape?  A \"D', maybe?\n\nThe Joker fires:\n\nCLOSE ON LETTER \"D\"\n\nThe bullet hits the letter \"D\", depressing it.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nThe element ball carrying Batman shifts, hurtles toward the page with\nblinding speed.  It \"cracks\" against the paper sharply, imprinting a\n\"D\".  Batman's head has stopped mere inches from the page.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nEyes welded shut - terrified.  The printing of the letter has advanced\nthe ribbon.  She is perilously close to the exact center of the page.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nNot the \"D\".  Hmm.  The most common\nletter is \"E\"...\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nThe Joker fires!  Batman flies toward the page, this time nearly\nsquashed on the other side.  A giant \"E\" has been imprinted.  Silver\nadvances one more position on the ribbon.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nAn \"A\", maybe...\n\nThe element ball spins, hurtles toward the paper again.  It splats into\nthe page, narrowly missing Batman, pushing Silver along again.\nImmediately - another shot - the ball whizzes back, prints another \"D\".\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nI know I tried the \"D\" before, but I\nsimply couldn't resist.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe message on the page reads \"DEAD\".  The trembling Silver is only one\nletter away from being obliterated.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStruggling, but helpless.  His eyes flash nervously.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nAlarmed as he sees what could happen to Silver.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nI know what letter is hidden under\nyour cape, by the way.  It's \"B\" -\nfor Batman.  But you see, I've got a\nproblem.  If I hit the letter \"B\",\nMiss St. Cloud will die, and I pro-\nmised not to kill her.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nGrim.  Pulling a gun.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nTo \"B\" or not to \"B\"...That seems to\nbe the question.  Well, I suppose\npromises - like laws - are made to\nbe broken.\n\nVOICE\nI made a promise, too, Joker.  The\nnight you killed my parents.\n\nQUICK CUTS:\n\nThorne looks up.  Silver looks up.  Batman looks up.  The Joker looks\nup.\n\nANGLE ON ROBIN - THEIR P.O.V.\n\nDick Grayson stands high in the rafters.\n\nDICK\nI promised to wipe filthy crud like\nyou off the face of the earth.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nShoot him!\n\nThere is a hail of gunfire as Dick flies down through the air toward\nthe typewriter.\n\nDick lands on the \"TAB\" key.  The carriage releases, shoots across the\ntypewriter, carrying the Joker with it.  He flies off the end, crashes\nsickeningly into the wall, drops to the floor, unconscious.\n\nDick bounces off the \"TAB\", flies across the keyboard, lands on the\n\"SHIFT\" key.\n\nDICK\nThat ought to give you a lift,\nBatman!\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nThe \"SHIFT\" swivels the element ball 180-degress to expose the capital\nletters.  Batman is swung to the front, grabs the carriage, pulls\nhimself up, looks down as Dick launches himself into a pile of Goons\nlike a human dynamo.\n\nBATMAN\nLeave a few for me, son!\n\nBatman leaps off the carriage, joins Dick in the fray.\n\nNOTE:  The fight which follows will be outrageous and thrilling, but\nshould look physically believable.  The Dynamic Duo will overpower the\ngang using the following elements and devices:\n\nA. Dick flinging Goons back into the pointed tips of quill pens.\n\nB. Batman lifting a fountain pen lever, firing a river of ink at an\nonrushing group.\n\nC. Both of them using springy, huge erasers as launching platforms.\n\nD. Oversized volumes of literature slamming shut on the villains.\n\nE. Enormous bookmarks and letter openers swung as clubs, knocking out\nthree or four crooks at a time.\n\nF. Heavies being hurled into huge, deep ink wells, turning them sopping\nblack wet, unable to climb out again.\n\nG. Dick bashing a pair of Thugs back into the side of the giant pencil\nsharpener.  They slam back against the \"ON\" button, activating it.\n\nDuring the chaos, Rupert Thorne has made his way down the typewriter's\nsteel bar which holds the paper to the roller.  He unhooks Silver,\nlifts her to safety.\n\nSILVER\nRupert?  What...\n\nTHORNE\nDon't talk.  Let's go.\n\nThe fight continues as Rupert and Silver run down the bar, drop off the\ntypewriter, cross the floor through the furious melee, heading for the\ndoor.  Batman rounds the corner of a giant book.  Silver spots him,\nstops.\n\nSILVER\nBatman?...Batman!...\n\nThorne yanks at her.  She tries to pull away, sees two Goons coming up\nbehind Batman.\n\nSILVER\nBruce!  Look out!\n\nBatman ducks, rolls, trips the Goons, knocks their heads together.\nSilver rushes toward him as Thorne pulls a gun, realizing.\n\nTHORNE\nBruce...Bruce Wayne...\n\nBATMAN\nSilver!  Get away!\n\nDick has bashed a Goon backwards - he careens across the floor, hits\nSilver from the side, knocking her into Batman as Thorne fires.\n\nCLOSE ON SILVER\n\nBlood spurts quickly across the lacy back of Silver's powder-blue slip.\nBatman hooks an arm around her, stares into her dying face, struck\ndumb.\n\nSILVER\n(trembling)\nI'm...right...aren't I...Bruce.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nHorrified.  He turns, runs.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nGiving chase.  Dodging bullets as Thorne fires at him.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nLowering Silver to the floor.  She's barely breathing.  Thorne's\ngunfire echoes through the museum.  Batman's jaw twitches.  His eyes\nflash with rage.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nDick rounds the corner of a giant prop some ten feet high off the\nfloor.  Thorne waits for him on the next prop - gun poised and ready.\nDick spots him, freezes.\n\nTHORNE\nI don't know what part you play in\nall this, kid.  But it's turned out\nto be a one-night stand.\n\nBATMAN'S VOICE\n(roaring with rage)\nMay God damn you, Rupert Thorne!\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nBatman has placed a huge, viciously sharp thumbtack in a giant rubber\nband pulled taut.  He lets it fly.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nThe thumbtack spears Thorne in the chest, topples him back across the\nprop - which is the giant pencil sharpener - he falls into the hole:  A\ndisappearing scream is cut short as Thorne is ground to death.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman kneels, cradles Silver's head in his lap.  Her eyes flutter open\npainfully.  She tries to smile.\n\nSILVER\nHello...Bruce...\n\nHe stares down, eyes filled with tears.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nMaybe...it's better, you know?\nI'd...just...get in the way...\n\nBATMAN\n(low whisper)\nDon't...\n\nSILVER\nI could...never really have you, and\n...I could never fall in love with\nsomeone else.\n\nHer eyelids tremble.  One of his tears hits her cheek softly.  She\nreaches up, gently caresses his chin.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nPoor...darling...you're the one...\nwho's...left behind...\n\nHer eyes close.  Her face relaxes, dead.  Tears stream heavily down\nBatman's cowl.\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nINT. MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\nCommissioner Gordon supervises the aftermath and cleanup,  The Joker,\nstill groggy, handcuffed, is yanked along by a COP.\n\nJOKER\nTake it easy, okay?  I get winded\nopening clams.\n\nHe is led away.  Gordon stares across the room.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman stands by Silver's body which has been placed on a gurney.  TWO\nPARAMEDICS cover her face with a blanket.\n\nBATMAN\nWait.\n\nThey stop.  He reaches in, pulls back the blanket, stares down at her\nface.  Gordon has crossed to join him.\n\nGORDON\nWhat a Goddamn shame.  You know\nwho's going to be really broken up\nabout this - Bruce Wayne.\n\nBatman turns, glances at Gordon blankly.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nThey were real close, you know.  Or\nmaybe you didn't.\n\nGordon turns, paces thoughtfully.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nBut at least you're back, I'm\nback, and all's right with this\ncrazy world for a second.  Now I\ndon't know where the hell this kid\nthey're talking about went to,\nbut...\n\nHe turns, looks.  Batman has disappeared.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - DAWN\n\nThe gurney carrying Silver's body is loaded into an ambulance.  It\ntakes off, red lights flashing, siren wailing.  The rising sun is just\nbeginning to crack the clouds on the horizon.  CAMERA WIDENS, STARTS TO\nRISE:\n\nThe ambulance becomes a tiny red dot as we now view the magnificent\ndowntown section of Gotham.\n\nCAMERA CONTINUES TO RISE, SHOOTING UP some eighty stories, then ninety,\nthen one hundred, finally revealing:\n\nWE DISSOLVE AS:\n\nThe dark, majestic figure of the Batman, standing on the top edge of\nthe tallest building in Gotham.  He looks down silently, cape billowing\nout behind him, a regal black prince surveying his steel and concrete\nrealm.\n\nNow swinging up and across from a nearby lower building:\n\nTHE IMPOSING, GRIM-FACED, COLORFUL FIGURE OF ROBIN!  Dressed in his\ngreen shirt, red vest, flowing yellow cape and black mask, he lands on\nthe roof noiselessly.\n\nBatman's eyes acknowledge his presence without turning.  Robin\nadvances, then stops silently, several paces behind.\n\nThe DYNAMIC DUO has been joined.  Both for now, and for the future\nadventures which await them in Gotham.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nTHE ENDEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1800159", "artist_names": "Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr.", "full_title": "I Hope We Get To Love In Time by\u00a0Marilyn\u00a0McCoo & Billy Davis Jr.", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/b167616cec64a716435603cafaba1db5.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b167616cec64a716435603cafaba1db5.595x595x1.png", "id": 1800159, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 399354, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1532902191, "path": "/Marilyn-mccoo-and-billy-davis-jr-i-hope-we-get-to-love-in-time-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Marilyn-mccoo-and-billy-davis-jr-i-hope-we-get-to-love-in-time-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1976, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1976", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1976", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/b167616cec64a716435603cafaba1db5.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b167616cec64a716435603cafaba1db5.595x595x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "I Hope We Get To Love In Time", "title_with_featured": "I Hope We Get To Love In Time", "updated_by_human_at": 1647892378, "url": "https://genius.com/Marilyn-mccoo-and-billy-davis-jr-i-hope-we-get-to-love-in-time-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/1540977", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/573b618c15e0fd058a9cedc09d1737dc.633x633x1.jpg", "id": 1540977, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/573b618c15e0fd058a9cedc09d1737dc.633x633x1.jpg", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr.", "slug": "Marilyn-mccoo-and-billy-davis-jr", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Marilyn-mccoo-and-billy-davis-jr"}, "artist": "Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr.", "lyrics": "I Hope We Get To Love In Time Lyrics[Billy Davis Jr]\nI hope we get to love in time\n'Cause I got to make you mine\nBefore I lose you; I couldn't stand the pain\n\n[Marilyn McCoo]\nThe road to love has tragedies\nSome loves don't get to be\nLaying the tears in someone's eyes, I won't cry\n\n[Billy Davis Jr]\nAnd it could happen to us if we're not strong\nSo why don't we hurry to love before it's gone\n[Chorus]\nI hope we get to love in time\n'Cause I got to make you mine\nBefore I lose you, I couldn't stand the pain\nI hope you'll fall in love with me\n'Cause it would be a tragedy\nIf I should lose you, I couldn't stand the pain\n\n[Marilyn McCoo]\nThe gates are open, we're so close\nLove is almost ours to hold\nA few more steps and we'll be there, if you care\n\n[Billy Davis Jr]\nWe'll make it together, it's easier that way\nWith two falling deeper love will soon be ours to stay\n\n[Chorus]\nI hope we get to love in time\n'Cause I got to make you mine\nBefore I lose you, I couldn't stand the pain\nI hope you'll fall in love with me\n'Cause it would be a tragedy\nIf I should lose you, I couldn't stand the painYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1275516", "artist_names": "Rufus (Ft.

Whether your earliest musical memories are of The Beatles professing that they love you yeah yeah yeah, your grammar school classmates singing along with Thriller, or Jay Z rapping about his hard knock life, the tunes you hear in your formative years pave the way for what\u2019s to come.\n\nSo it is with hip-hop.  The musical backbone of rap\u2019s most influential era -- the so-called Golden Age of the late 1980s to early 90s -- has its roots in the childhood memories of its creators.  Songs heard in parents\u2019 dens or at dances got chopped up, dissected, and scientifically rearranged.\n\nA few seconds of solo drums in the middle of a song would become the basis for a whole new creation.  A guitar stab, grunt, or horn riff took on new life as the canvas for an emcee or group to paint on.  And anything was fair game.  Cheesy pop songs, novelties, movie soundtracks -- as long as it was funky, it made the cut.  It was all about the breaks.\n\nAt the very beginning of hip-hop culture, there was the break.  A DJ named Clyde Campbell working parties in the Bronx in the early 1970s discovered that people loved the moments in songs where everything would drop out except the drums, or occasionally the drums and bass.  But these instrumental sections were almost always short -- a few seconds or a minute.  How to keep the party going?\n\nCampbell, who was dj\u2019ing under the name \u201cKool Herc,\u201d invented a technique he called \u201cthe Merry-Go-Round.\u201d  It involved finding those key moments in each record, and going right from one to the other.  He\u2019d start with James Brown\u2019s \u201cGive It Up or Turn It Loose,\u201d a favorite among b-boys to this day (it\u2019s the one old-schoolers call \u201cClap your hands, stomp your feet,\u201d after Brown\u2019s exhortation at the beginning of the break).  Then he\u2019d transition into \u201cBongo Rock\u201d from the Incredible Bongo Band, and go right into Babe Ruth\u2019s \u201cThe Mexican.\u201d  Or, even better, he\u2019d take two copies of the same record and switch back and forth, extending a single break into infinity.  The dancers loved it -- all of their favorite moments that they\u2019d previously had to wait for, now happening one after another, in an endless wave of funky drums.\n\nBy the time rap music made it to record in 1979, the concept of extending a single breakbeat was transferred onto the new genre.  The early records featured popular songs of the era either sampled or replayed, with grooves that had once rocked the dance floor now expected to rock the pockets of record buyers.\nFamiliarity may breed contempt, but to early hip hop record makers, it also bred success.  Chic\u2019s monster hit \u201cGood Times,\u201d released that very year, formed the basis for dozens of early rap songs, including the biggest one of all, \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d by the Sugarhill Gang. Cheryl Lynn\u2019s \u201cGot to be Real\u201d from the previous year was another one whose groove was used over and over.\n\nBut the breaks used at the earliest parties showed up as well.  As the genre grew and more records started being made, the tunes that folks remembered from the parties they had attended as kids ten or so years prior began showing up in their raps.  By the mid-1980s, records like The Incredible Bongo Band\u2019s \u201cApache,\u201d the Honeydrippers\u2019 \u201cImpeach the President,\u201d or any number of James Brown cuts began appearing in earnest as the backing to rap records.\n\nAnd then 1986 hit, and nothing was the same.  Two enigmatic figures known as \u201cBreakbeat Lou\u201d and \u201cBreakbeat Lenny\u201d put out the first volume of an anthology that would shake up the world and change the sound of rap forever.  Louie Flores and Lenny Roberts released the first of what would become 25 volumes of a series called Ultimate Breaks and Beats.\n\nThese were wide-ranging, extremely illegal compilations that included songs favored by DJs for their breaks.  The first volume contained tunes ranging from The Monkees\u2019 \u201cMary Mary\u201d to Rufus Thomas\u2019 novelty \u201cDo the Funky Penguin.\u201d  But it was the third song, \u201cAmen Brother\u201d by The Winstons, that would push the project over the edge.  The drum solo in that tune became so popular that it eventually got its own name -- the \u201c\u2018Amen\u2019 break.\u201d  It showed up in NWA (\u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d), Salt-N-Pepa (\u201cI Desire\u201d), the Ultramagnetic MCs (\u201cCritical Beatdown\u201d), and countless other dope late-80s tracks.  It also took on a second life in the 90s, as it appeared in sped-up form in nearly every drum-n-bass song of the era.\n\nMore than any individual tune, though, it was the idea of having all of the hottest breaks in one easy-to-find place that made the series take off.  Until the series stopped in 1991, the tunes on UBB became the backbone of the genre.  The songs on the 25 volumes ranged from 1966 to 1984, with the vast majority unsurprisingly dating from the 70s, the same era as the parties where breakbeats first ruled.  Every producer of the era, whether they copped to it or not, used breaks found somewhere on the compilations.  They defined the sound of the era.\n\nThe series ceased right around the time sampling laws tightened up, and using breaks became considerably more expensive.  The classic breaks are now far too identifiable, so current producers engage in a cat-and-mouse game of finding more and more obscure breaks, or trying to alter them enough to be unrecognizable.\n\nLuckily for the inquisitive listener of today, UBB was reissued (still illegally!) a few years ago as a set of 2 CDs containing all 25 volumes on MP3, so it\u2019s possible to find if you look hard enough.\n\nWhat Makes a Break?\n\u201cI\u2019m ripping emcees from \u2018Funky Drummer\u2019 to \u2018Big Beat\u2019\u201d\n-- LL Cool J, \u201cMurdergram\u201d\n\nSo why have some breaks been used over and over?  What makes a good break beat?  First off, from a producer\u2019s perspective, ease of use is important.  Having only the drums playing makes a breakbeat easy to sample and loop -- there are no difficult decisions on how to cut out the vocals or other instruments.\n\nIt is this simple qualification that many of rap\u2019s most sampled breaks have in common.  In 2010, the website Who Sampled put together a list of the most-sampled breaks of all time.  The vast majority of them -- eight out of ten -- were from between 1969 and 1973, with just one outlier on each end of that time period.  In almost all of them, there were between two and eight bars of solo drums.\n\nWhat does that mean to you as a listener?  First off, certain popular breaks have become a part of the language and meaning of rap songs.  When a contemporary song uses \u201cApache\u201d from the Incredible Bongo Band (from 1973, #6 on the list), it\u2019s used not only because it\u2019s a dope break.  The sample\u2019s existence is itself a reference to its popularity in early park jams, and also to the hundreds of times the beat has been sampled since 1981.  Jay Z and Kanye West used these associations astutely on the 2011 track \u201cThat\u2019s My Bitch.\u201d  The song foregrounded an \u201cApache\u201d sample, but also included an homage to Public Enemy and a lyrical shoutout to Golden Age rapper Monie Love.  All of these things worked in tandem to add an intended subtext of, as Digital Underground put it, \u201ca tribute to the early days.\u201d\n\nIn fact, as early as 1987, \u201cApache\u201d was used to signify those same early days.  A sample of the song was used on Kool Moe Dee\u2019s \u201cWay Way Back,\u201d on which he used a self-consciously dated style to pay tribute to his roots.  Likewise, Busy Bee used the \u201cApache\u201d break on his 1988 song \u201cOld School.\u201d  Immediately after the break plays, his first words are, \u201cOh man, that\u2019s that old school.\u201d  Without the knowledge of the break\u2019s history, that ad-lib would fall on deaf ears, and in fact the whole concept of the song would be nonsensical.\nThat same sample could also serve as a canvas for innovation.  Kool G. Rap used it for his 1989 tune \u201cMen At Work,\u201d  whose polysyllabic rhymes left a lifelong impression on a whole generation of emcees (to this day, Black Thought of The Roots can still rap the tune perfectly word-for-word).  The tune had all the more impact for including advanced lyricism against a familiar template, where listeners were used to hearing the simplistic end-line rhymes of The Sugarhill Gang or the schoolyard chants of Busy Bee.\n\nIn truth, a solid knowledge of the soul and funk of the late 1960s and 1970s is essential to really understanding hip-hop.  Being able to identify the bells on Bob James\u2019 classic \u201cTake Me to the Mardi Gras\u201d (1974) or the drums of Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cChocolate Buttermilk\u201d (1969) will add layers upon layers to your enjoyment of rap songs.\n\nCan\u2019t Stop the Rock: Rock & Roll and Other Outliers\n\u201cI\u2019m the King of Rock, there is none higher/Sucker emcees should call me \u2018Sire\u2019\u201d\n-- Run-DMC, \u201cKing of Rock\u201d\n\nOne of the oddities on Who Sampled\u2019s list provides another important clue to unlocking the mysteries of the break beat.  Number nine on the list is \u201cThe Big Beat,\u201d a 1980 track by hard rocker Billy Squier.  The song didn\u2019t chart, and would have been forgotten, despite its charming stop-motion-filled video , if not for rap.  Its opening drum break was immediately adopted by rappers -- by 1981, it was already a staple of many artists\u2019 live performances.\n\nSo what does this mean?  That rappers were anxiously awaiting Billy Squier\u2019s first solo album?  Of course not.  The break was adopted because it had open drums, was right at the beginning of the song, and sounded great.  That it was on a hard-rock record mattered not a bit.\n\nThis catholic approach to sampling has been true of hip-hop from the beginning, and continues to be so today.  Popular Golden Age breaks came from funk and soul records, to be sure.  But they also came from jazz, hard rock, and even The Monkees, the only-on-television 1960s \u201cband\u201d whose \u201cMary Mary\u201d was adopted by De La Soul, Run-DMC, J.J. Fad, and 2 Live Crew proteges Anquette.  If something sounded good, the source didn\u2019t matter.\n\nThis approach, of reshaping good bits no matter where they\u2019re from, goes back very far in hip-hop\u2019s DNA.  Afrika Bambaataa, one of the genre\u2019s foremost pioneers, was famous for it.  During hip-hop\u2019s early years, he would throw parties where he would play everything -- electronic music, video game soundtracks, calypso -- with an unerring ear for what would both surprise people and keep the party moving.  His record collection, which is now preserved at Cornell University, grew to over 40,000 strong, and he became known as the \u201cMaster of Records.\u201d  That same adventurousness is preserved even in today\u2019s big stars -- Jay Z\u2019s sample of Gonjasufi, Kanye West taking from 1970s Hungarian rockers Omega, and more.\n\nThe Godfather: James Brown and the Break Beat\n\u201cTell the truth, James Brown was old/\u2019Til Eric and Ra came out with \u2018I Got Soul\u2019\u201d\n-- Stetsasonic, \u2018Talkin All That Jazz\u2019\n\nNo discussion of break beats is complete without an examination of James Brown.  Tracks that he either performed on or produced have been sampled well over 5,000 times, making him by far the most-sampled artist of all time.\n\nWhy is that?  As with so many things in hip-hop, and in history generally, there is no one monolithic answer.  Brown\u2019s cultural impact was unparalleled during the 1960s and 70s -- remember that showing a concert of his on television in the wake of MLK\u2019s death was pretty much the only thing that kept the city of Boston from rioting.  His call to \u201csay it loud, I\u2019m black and I\u2019m proud\u201d and his self-reliant cry that \u201cI don\u2019t want nobody to get me nothing/Open up the door, I\u2019ll get it myself\u201d had a huge impact on black people (and also cost him a lot of his white audience).\nMusically, Brown more or less single-handedly invented the hard-edged funk that would come to dominate the 1970s.  He took the traditions of rhythm and blues music and stripped them down to almost nothing -- a few words (often made up on the spot), a groove, and often just a single chord.\n\nSomehow, the force of his personality -- and an unerring nose for finding great musicians -- made it all work, and songs like \u201cSuper Bad\u201d and \u201cGet Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\u201d created what we now think of as funk.\n\nJames\u2019 influence extended far beyond his own tunes.  The songs he co-wrote and produced for other members of his camp became classics as well.  Lyn Collins (\u201cThink (About It)\u201d) and Bobby Byrd (\u201cI Know You Got Soul\u201d) used Brown\u2019s band The J.B.\u2019s to produce great records in the vein of the master.  And The J.B.\u2019s themselves released a ton of instrumentals in the 1970s that stand alongside Brown\u2019s greatest work.  Even former members of Brown\u2019s band got in on the act.  The sibling team of William \u201cBootsy\u201d Collins on bass and Phelps \u201cCatfish\u201d Collins on guitar, who played with Brown briefly in 1970-1, became key members of the legendary Parliament-Funkadelic collective after leaving the group.\n\nWhat does this all have to do with breaks?  First off, James\u2019 early funk songs were repetitive grooves.  While played straight through by the musicians, their circular nature connects them to the four- and eight-bar loops of early rap.  Also, the extended length of many of the tunes meant that there were lots of moments without vocals for burgeoning producers to sample.  And then there were the drum breaks.\n\n\u201cFunky Drummer,\u201d number two on Who Sampled\u2019s list, is a prime example.  The song itself is a seven-minute mellow bit of funk that consists almost entirely of a one-bar vamp.  Brown emotes and plays some organ on top of the groove.\n\nThen, almost five minutes in, Brown starts giving the band instructions for an upcoming drum break.   \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do no soloing, brother.  Just keep what you got!\u201d he tells drummer Clyde Stubblefield.  And 45 seconds later, Stubblefield does just that.  Everyone drops out, and perhaps the most famous eight bars in the history of funk begins.\n\nThe beat -- a barrage of ghost notes, hi-hat openings and closings, and a tricky syncopated kick drum pattern -- would echo down through the decades.  Starting in the mid-1980s, the beat became a staple in hip-hop.  Other Brown songs would soon follow, creating renewed interest in the master\u2019s work.  While all eras of his career would be fair game for samplers, his \u201chard funk\u201d period that began with 1967\u2019s \u201cCold Sweat\u201d and continued through 1976 makes up the vast majority of the sampled tunes.\n\nThe funk and soul of the late 1960s and 1970s, Brown especially, is the DNA of hip-hop.  It worked its way into the genre\u2019s sound, its emcees rhythms, and even its lyrical preoccupations.  From Biggie\u2019s \u201cfunk flow to make your drawers drop slow\u201d to \u201cRedman on the funk train,\u201d the sound, feel, attitude, and cool of the funk pioneers has been a guiding light in the rap world.\n\nIn addition to Brown, his proteges in the Parliament-Funkadelic collective had a huge influence on the sound of West Coast rap in particular.  Dr. Dre\u2019s breakthrough 1992 solo album The Chronic, a record that came to define the so-called \u201cG-funk\u201d sound, featured ten different samples from either Parliament, Funkadelic, or the collective\u2019s leader George Clinton, where no other artist was sampled more than once.\n\nKool & the Gang, before having smash success with crossover hits like \u201cHollywood Swingin\u2019,\u201d released funky instrumental tracks that would later be raided by producers.  Their 1969 debut record would be used by pioneers like Eric B and Rakim, Stetsasonic, X-Clan, NWA, Special Ed, A Tribe Called Quest, and more.\n\nWhile breakbeats were originally used to keep the party going, they came to be much more than that.  They were a way for producers to use the music that was most familiar to them in order to create something exciting and new.  And later, they began to signify themselves -- that is, to represent all of the other times that particular break has been used.  That, ultimately, is the magic of breaks, and their ever-shifting meaning over time is as hip-hop as anything else about them.20Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

Why? There was so much of it. 2014 was bookended by astounding years, with 2015 possibly overtaking the number of classic releases 2013 gave us. The enigma from Atlanta, Future, dropped four projects; dreamy duo Beach House released two albums in as many months. Break-outs like Jamie xx caught our attention and hip-hop superstar Kendrick Lamar demanded it. Here are the 20 best albums of 2015. \u2014 Michael Heal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a020. A$AP Rocky - At.Long.Last.A$AP2015 began with the passing of Rocky\u2019s close-friend and collaborator A$AP Yams, the mastermind behind the A$AP organization, but Pretty Flacko bounced back in May with his long-awaited sophomore album, At.Long.Last.A$AP. Rocky used the tragedy as motivation to deliver one of the best rap albums of the year, dedicated to the late Yamborghini\nAt.Long.Last.A$AP was proclaimed \"the return of the God MC,\" delivering insightful lyrics and fusing elements of psychedelic rock with the promethazine-inspired trap Rocky's become famous for. The majority of the album was recorded in London, where Rocky discovered a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a friend in Joe Fox, who appears on stand-outs \u201cMax B\u201d and \u201cJukebox Joints,\u201d (which says something on a track featuring Kanye West). However, the best cut belongs to Rocky and Bones, who linked up for a marauding ode to New York\u2019s \u201cCanal St.\u201d The collage of high-quality music elevates Flacko to rap royalty and keeps the memory of A$AP Yams eternal. \u2014 Vuk Aleksi\u0107\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a019. Florence + the Machine - How Big, How Blue, How BeautifulFlorence + the Machine continue to set baroque-pop standards with their album How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful. Its simple concept\u2014lead singer Florence Welch attempts to break off a relationship\u2014soars thanks to a heap of melodrama and a pinch of restraint.\n\nWelch lets her emotions shine through her vocals, whether she's growling on the rage-filled \"What Kind of Man,\" or sighing resignedly on the atmospheric \"Long & Lost\". By limiting how many times she references water, Welch stretches her lyricism to encompass even more imagery. The transcendent results include \"Delilah,\" which elevates a missed phone call to Biblical proportions: \u201cI'm calling for my mother as I pull the pillars down /It's a different kind of danger and my feet are spinning around / Never knew I was a dancer \u2014'til Delilah showed me how.\u201d\n\nProducer Markus Dravs redirects F+TM's sound, preserving the band's lushness, while giving the guitarists more presence. Goldfrapp's Will Gregory arranges the new horn ensemble, which exhale sharply on the medieval \"Queen of Peace.\"\nThe title track embodies HBHBHB. An acoustic guitar erupts into rueful nostalgia. Welch melts into the words \"every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips,\" and lets out an improv \"woo!\" The jaunt climaxes with a three-minute instrumental, with hearty trumpets that could score a death scene. F+TM might be indulgent as times, but their expansive sound captures love's sweeping emotions. As Welch puts it in \"Caught\":Old friends have said, the books I've read, say it's the thing to do / But it's hard to see it when you're in it, cause I went blind for you.\u2014 Chihuahua0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a018. Future - 56 Nights56 Nights celebrates Future's close friend and collaborator DJ Esco's release from a Dubai prison. Alternately somber and jubilant, the album paints a picture of a drugged out but resilient creative, drowning his pain in codeine to inspire the trappers he left behind.  Following on the heels of 2014's breakup record Monster and the innovative Zaytoven collab Beast Mode #FutureHive were in full swarm for fresh heat rocks\u2014they were satiated by tracks like \"Trap Niggas\" and \"March Madness,\" which retain a social conscience in the midst of debauchery and felony. \"March Madness,\" one of 2015's liveliest bangers, comes with a triumphant beat from Tarentino (it's the only track on the tape not produced by Southside)\u2014it's both an ode to lean and an elegy.\n\u201cAll these cops killing niggas tragic\u201d somehow doesn't sound out of place on what became a club and radio standard. The anthemic \u201cTrap Niggas\u201d is much more than a series of coke rap tropes on a dark brooding beat. Future's shifting between first and third person invites the listener to identify with him and universalizes the dealer's struggle. He offers a message of hope, rooted in a profound belief that whatever one's station in life and the thankless tasks one performs, \"God blessing all the trap niggas.\u201d\n\u2014Shaz\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a017. Clarence Clarity - No NowIf you\u2019re thinking Clarence Clarity sounds like an internet meme, you\u2019re not entirely wrong. No Now is the debut album by multi-instrumentalist, singer, and embodiment of the internet age. The maximalist atmosphere of No Now entertains even those with the shortest attention spans, as sounds from seemingly countless genres clash, glitch, and mold into one to create the most serene aura.\n\nClarence\u2019s musical style likely derives from his drive to be different, something made abundantly clear on the second track, \u201cWill to Believe,\u201d as he breaks through a dense wall of sound to denounce the non-risk takers and those who attempt to appear \u201ccute.\" In the modern era where songs rarely stick to one pure genre, artists are boxed in by a myriad of sound-defining labels. Clarence Clarity has managed to create his own box.\nNo Now is hectic. It\u2019s unpredictable. It\u2019s ever-changing. From the poppy melodies of \u201cThose Who Can\u2019t Cheat\u201d to the gritty guitar work of \u201cPorn Mountain,\u201d to the completely glitched-out mess of \u201cHit Factory of Sadness,\u201d Clarence Clarity creates a unique journey. In a way, No Now represents the world we live in. Nothing is guaranteed in the future\u2014all we have is now. We can choose to sit back and let the universe take its path, or we can evolve and become one with the erratic atmosphere. Take a step into Clarence Clarity\u2019s beautifully insane world with No Now; you\u2019ll find the unknown to be quite exhilarating. \u2014 Matt Witkowsky\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a016. Wolf Alice \u2013 My Love Is Cool\u201cKeep your beady eyes on me\u201d, warns 23-year-old Ellie Roswell over shimmering synths and intricate guitar arpeggios, and it would be hard to resist. The album\u2019s opener, \u201cTurn to Dust,\" is a seductive, enigmatic number which sets the tone of the London four-piece\u2019s debut: cool, accomplished, and never failing to surprise the listener. No two tracks sound the same; indeed, in the middle of the album, we\u2019re transported on a whistle-stop tour from the smooth and considered \u201cSilk\u201d to the jazzy slap bass of \u201cFreazy,\" and then to the energetic single \u201cGiant Peach,\" which sounds like it could\u2019ve been written in the mid-90s. Producer Mike Crossey\u2019s versatility is commendable; his sound knowledge of dynamics is especially prominent on songs like \u201cFluffy,\" tracks are spacious and reflective when necessary, and the incredible diversity of styles makes it all the more impressive that one man has achieved such a feat.\n\nAll four members of the band lend their vocal talents to the project, with Joel taking full creative reign and lead vocals on the reverb-drenched \u201cSwallowtail.\" \u201cI never thought we\u2019d hit this hard,\" he sings in the verses, before breaking into an assured falsetto for the chorus. A cynic could call this sort of variation inconsistent, but the eclectic styles allow the band members\u2019 individual skills to flourish. If you appreciate unique lyricism, innovative structure, and great replay value, don't sleep on My Love Is Cool.\n\u2014 Luke Ballance (UnBalanced)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a015. Miguel - WildheartMiguel begins his third LP with the words \u201cDon\u2019t ever sell your self short for acceptance.\u201d It\u2019s a drastic change from what we\u2019ve come to expect on the opening of a Miguel album. It follows a heartfelt Instagram post in which he detailed the spark behind Wildheart. As well as the personal and emotional sentiment, he takes inspiration from his home town of L.A, with every song having a connection to the City of Angels. This concept allows Miguel to expand his horizons and showcase the improvement in his writing skills, with themes of power, fame, childhood insecurities and at his most daring, alluding to L.A\u2019s adult film industry on \u201cThe Valley.\u201d\nThe infusion of electric guitars layered over heavy bass lines and synths results in a psychedelic rock-r&b sound reminiscent of Prince\u2019s Sign O\u2019 The Times. The atmospheric vibe beautifully meshes over his more passionate songs, with \u201cFLESH\u201d and the deluxe edition cut \u201cgfg\u201d showcasing his breathtaking falsetto. Over a pulsating bass, backed by an electric guitar riff, the lead single \u201cCoffee\u201d seamlessly acts as a successor to \u201cAdorn.\u201d It follows his guilty pleasure of morning after sex, and the transformation of a purely sexual relationship into one of greater intimacy.\nAlthough it faltered commercially, the album was highly praised by critics and fans alike. However, had everything gone according to plan, \u201cwaves\u201d would have likely topped the charts and Miguel\u2019s praises would be ringing even higher. But as contemporary R&B continues to stray towards a drug induced sound with repetitive themes of lust and narcotic abuse, one of the genre's finest continues to challenge his sound and breathe new life into the genre with what may be his finest work to date. \u2014 zk123\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a014. Beach House - Thank Your Lucky StarsWhen discussing Thank Your Lucky Stars, one fact is inescapable: it\u2019s not the album Beach House were trying to make.  And whilst the search for a context-free album may be a fool\u2019s errand, if Stars were a debut album from an up and coming band, it would be celebrated as evidence of a great emerging talent.\nIt\u2019s true that most of these songs probably wouldn\u2019t have worked on Depression Cherry, but they\u2019re still great songs \u2013 indeed, \u201cElegy To The Void,\" with its dark lyrics and chilling outro, may be their best since \u201cTake Care.\" Beach House aren\u2019t a conventional band, but they have a very defined sound which these songs push against. There\u2019s much more going on in the lower registers here than on any Beach House album since Devotion, at least. The lyrics, too, are much more grounded; while Legrand usually speaks directly to the listener about grand themes, Stars makes much more use of the third person. Mysterious women lead you to pools of water, lovers bend at the altar, schoolgirls pray by fading lace curtains \u2013 it\u2019s all quite reminiscent of Ishmael Butler. This is as close to traditional storytelling as Beach House has ever come. We\u2019re dropped into real lives and given snippets of information that are just enough to construct a portrait of who they really are.\n\nThere is an obvious temptation to dismiss this as an afterthought to a masterpiece, but it\u2019s much more than that. It\u2019s almost like the eccentric second disk of one of the great double albums of the seventies. It\u2019s not Depression Cherry, but it more than stands alone. \u2014 Vesuvius\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a013. Natalie Prass - Natalie PrassIn an era of surprise releases and casual DIY mixtapes, it\u2019s hard to imagine a label taking two years to release a great record, but that\u2019s exactly what Spacebomb Records did with Natalie Prass.\n\nTrey Pollard\u2019s string arrangements accentuate Prass\u2019s delicate delivery, whilst the horns in the instrumental bridge of \u201cBird Of Prey\u201d bare Matthew E. White\u2019s fingerprints. Break-up records are a dime a dozen, but these breathtaking arrangements are all too rare in contemporary pop. Pollard and White deserve a great deal of credit for the album\u2019s overwhelmingly positive reception.\n\nBut Prass\u2019s songwriting is what lifts this record above White\u2019s Big Inner. Her songs are much more accessible and charming than those of her label mate. Her use of metaphor is constantly delightful \u2013 break-up as predation, as a fantasy novel, as a train pulling away from a platform - and some of her imagery is visceral. She may knock her singing voice, but Prass provides plenty of intriguing inflections, and her vocals simultaneously convey her heartbreak and confidence. The crescendo of \u201cMy Baby Don\u2019t Understand Me\u201d is so affecting because of the synergy between arrangement, performance, and the train station goodbye metaphor\n\nNobody wants a needless two year delay before they can hear a record \u2013 but if it allows Prass and Spacebomb to keep making records like this, it\u2019s completely worthwhile.\n\u2014 Vesuvius\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a012. Lupe Fiasco - Tetsuo & YouthLupe struck that elusive balance between beautiful instrumentals, intelligent lyrics and vivid storytelling with Tetsuo & Youth. Fans and critics alike have praised the album \u2013 it\u2019s even been referred to as \"a Rap Genius wet dream.\"\n\nYet T&Y is so much more than just complex, annotation-worthy lyricism (though there\u2019s plenty of that too). Lupe organised the album into three distinct sections separated by \u201csonic palate cleansers\u201d named after the four seasons. Songs are feel-good and upbeat from \"Summer\" to \"Fall,\" more melancholy leading into \"Winter,\" and then quite ominous (though by \"Spring\" things start to look up again).\n\nWhile every track is brilliantly executed, of particular note are the three monsters, each exceeding 8 minutes in length. Summer's \"Mural\" is an all-bars-no-hook lyrical assault that will leave you physically tired (in a good way) by the end. Fall's \"Prisoner 1 & 2\" is the most musically complex track on the album, with lyrics drawing a parallel between prison inmates and guards and a striking foundation of string and piano arrangements. Winter\u2019s \"Chopper\" is a ratchet, bass-heavy beast featuring 6 artists that most wouldn\u2019t think team up with Lu.\n\nFew contest that Lupe Fiasco is a lyrical and creative genius, and his ability arguably shines brighter on T&Y than on any of his previous albums. Its seasonal transitions mean you can start listening to any track, come around full circle and experience the album in a completely different way. And just when you think you've digested everything T&Y has to offer, take our word for it and listen once more -- backwards. \u2014 Treflip\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a011. Courtney Barnett - Sometimes I Sit And Think, and Sometimes I Just SitCourtney Barnett\u2019s debut album is quirky and awkward, much in the vein of getting the title of it: taking it from a poster that hung in her grandmother's bedroom. Abrasive guitar riffs simultaneously flow and jag behind Barnett, who sing-talks about, well, everything. Her breakout single \u201cAvant Gardener\u201d puns off of \u201cavant garde.\" You can guess where that goes. Topics include trying to impress someone while swimming and accidentally fainting, a rambling rant about anything to get someone off her mind, and a home-buyer's depressing first time looking into the market. However, it also explores concepts like her newfound fame and self-worth.\n\nWhat really makes the album great is its lack of inhibition.  Sometimes I Sit And Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit is poignant, but not forced. Her lyrics paint of picture of seemingly anything. It's an album you can sit and think to--or at least just sit. Even if she doesn't know who she is, she surely sounds good trying to find out. \u2014 Babu Sea\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010. Tame Impala - CurrentsCurrents is a stunning, near-perfect sonic achievement, made all the more powerful by the clash between its precise instrumentals and hazy lyrics. The LP announces Tame Impala as the rare group whose work isn\u2019t linked by rehashes of the same familiar sounds, but consistent mood, themes, and ethos present at the core of everything they record. The band\u2019s third offering has been hailed as a departure from their previous work. More accurately, it\u2019s an amplification of every shift Kevin Parker and co. made between their debut Innerspeaker and follow-up release Lonerism. After the magnetism of pop music shook up the group\u2019s lo-fi sound, Currents pushes the needle even further from psychedelia and towards an R&B/disco sound that only threatened to claw to the surface on Lonerism. Instead of hesitantly stripping back a few more guitars, Parker all but phased them out for the synths that form the backbone of this LP. Rather than resist his his growing auteur-like tendencies, the group\u2019s frontman/writer/producer Parker cut out all collaborations and added another responsibility to his ever-growing list: mixing.\nYet the remarkable thing about Currents isn\u2019t how indistinguishable the record is from the band\u2019s previous releases; it\u2019s how perfectly it blends into the rest of their discography. Despite marked sonic and lyrical changes, it only takes a few notes from the massive intro track \u201cLet It Happen\u201d to realize this could only be a Tame Impala album. Whether this trilogy\u2019s narrator slides into the past or embraces the healing properties of the future, puts on a false bravado or gets crippled by anxiety, we are never left feeling that the inconsistencies are the result of Parker conjuring up new narrators to deliver one-off tracks. Rather, we\u2019re reminded a person is more than their current mindstate, just as a band isn\u2019t defined by the amount of fuzzy guitars it\u2019s employing in any given moment.\n\u2014 Nick Ferguson\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09. Joanna Newsom - DiversCall this her My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy moment, minus the controversy. One of music\u2019s greatest auteurs collects the stunning aesthetic signifiers of her previous classic works and imagines what they\u2019d sound like all meshed together. Lacking the featured players from whom Kanye derived greatness, the lyricism instead is the most important guest star. Era-hopping, the loose concept album threaded by time visits a restless pastoral resident (\u201cLeaving the City\u201d), pre-Revolutionary America (\u201cSapokanikan\u201d), and a futuristic militia on the outskirts of the Fourth World War (\u201cWaltz of the 101st Airborne\u201d), to name but a few. Maneuvering unconventional rhyme schemes is nothing new to her, and doctoral-level literary devices are played with the precision usually reserved for her harp. But like MBDTF before it, Divers is an extraordinarily listenable album, a populist masterpiece offered up by the only genius capable of creating it. \u2014 Brian Duricy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08. Susanne Sundf\u00f8r - Ten Love SongsWhen Susanne Sundf\u00f8r released her third album, The Brothel, Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet said it would reduce her domestic rivals to tears. It was beautiful, but it would also make the chasm in talent that stood between them absolutely clear. No upcoming artist, and precious few established ones, could hope to compete with her.\nThe Brothel set a high bar, but Ten Love Songs is a clear step up again. Sundf\u00f8r set out to write an album of songs centred on violence, but found each of them morphing into a song about love. The result is a startling album full of conflict, between narratives as well as characters. Our narrators are unreliable, often unsympathetic, and highly flawed, which makes them all the more compelling. On \u201cDelirious,\" Sundf\u00f8r threatens to push her victim \u201cover the edge\u201d because she believes him to be \u201cthe one holding the gun\". Meanwhile, \u201cSilencer\u201d is set in the aftermath of a jealous murder; Sundf\u00f8r compares the swimming pool in which she disposes of the corpse as \u201can aquarelle of coral blue and red, like the colours of your lover's pretty eyes and hair.\"\n\nSundf\u00f8r\u2019s vocal performances bring life to her lyrics. Her range is staggering, spanning octaves and emotions almost casually, even within songs. She convinces with everything from a breathy whisper to the unhinged power of Freddie Mercury in Queen\u2019s early prog-metal stage.\nAlthough the album has an electronic backbone, the instrumentation is varied, with classical instruments blending incredibly seamlessly with ultra-modern dubstep. The transitions between songs are similarly masterful, pulling the listener deeper into the album.\nThe Brothel  showed that Sundf\u00f8r was leagues above other Norwegian artists. Ten Love Songs goes one better and establishes her in the upper echelon of pop musicians internationally. As a singer, songwriter, and visionary, few can match her. \u2014 Vesuvius\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Father John Misty - I Love You, HoneybearFor two albums, the sarcastic, witty, Josh Tillman has marauded both on wax and off as the pseudo-clerical persona Father John Misty. 2013\u2019s Fear Fun, and its oft-referenced hallucinogen birth, marked a new creative outlet for a 21st century cynic. No longer bound by the serious shackles of a name he never cared for, or the dull \u201cJ. Tillman\u201d his previous eight albums debuted under, Our Father uses the new name as a mask that counter-intuitively allows an album truer than before. This mask questions the amount of oil it takes to make a record; trolls the music press with singular post-irony; parodies whiskey commercials and social media; and hip shakes with post-postured confidence that predates \u201cHotline Bling\u201d during eccentric live performances.\n\nConsumerism, irony, and technological dependence return in his latest release, I Love You, Honeybear,through the bourgeoisie-bashing \u201cBored In The USA,\u201d and \u201cTrue Affection,\u201d touching on the isolation and dissonance of digital communication. But at ILYHB\u2019s core sits Tillman\u2019s immutable motif \u2013 a struggle with identity. Falling in love only heightened the existential battle, creating what seems like a fourth iteration of the man. Now married, Emma Tillman is his \u201cHoneybear.\u201d Not something he actually calls her off-record, the pet name is a respite from the love songs that the misanthropic narrator so unexpectedly finds himself creating. In the middle tracks, loathsome ways introduced in Fear Fun return, yet, despite himself, he finds beauty through brutal honesty.\n\nHe conceals nothing from Emma, nor the captive audience; \u201cThe Ideal Husband\u201d rattles off ineptitude upon ineptitude, finishing with the accept-me-as-I-am \u201cLet\u2019s put a baby in the oven / Wouldn\u2019t I make the ideal husband?\u201d On \u201cHoly Shit,\u201d the magnitude of his wedding day sinks in, as he simultaneously commits to the marriage while pointing out its institutional absurdity. Bookending the strange loop, \u201cI Went to the Store One Day\u201d is the truest \u201clove song\u201d here, recalling the words and place that spawned the relationship, but not without the self-aware lyrical outline \u201cInsert here a sentiment re: our golden years.\u201d Raw and unfiltered, for better or for worse, right? \u2014 Brock Chenier\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Grimes - Art AngelsThe disconnect between artist and consumer is rarely more apparent than when clear works of excellence are disregarded by their creator. When Grimes revealed her apprehensions about early single \u201cREALiTi\u201d\u2019s quality, critics and fans collectively reacted in disbelief. How could one of the year\u2019s best songs be a mere throwaway? And then we heard Art Angels. An album with alienation as a core inspiration containing some of the most zeitgeisty pop of the decade. Grimes told NME of \u201cCalifornia,\" \u201cI wanted to make a song that is so uncool that no cool hipster people would like it,\u201d and yet, what could capture post-808s culture better than \u201cYou only like me when you think I\u2019m looking sad\u201d? A lucky few have the artist\u2019s mind that could relate to her litmus test of song quality, but for the rest of us, all we know is that it\u2019s unbelievably good. \u2014 Brian Duricy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. D'Angelo - Black MessiahLet your days slip away come with me and ride - D\u2019Angelo, \"Ain\u2019t That Easy.\" Black Messiah is a gem that was 14 years in the making. When someone as talented and popular as D\u2019Angelo just leaves the music scene at the height of his run and has all the well documented troubles he\u2019s had, there are certainly a few questions  going into his latest, mysterious release. Could he rekindle that same magic from Voodoo and Brown Sugar? How would D\u2019Angelo fit into today\u2019s musical landscape? What we  got is a triumphant return and an album that lined up perfectly with today\u2019s times. The socially cognizant nature of the album weighs on the racial tension going on in the United States. The Michael Brown situation actually inspired D\u2019Angelo to move up the release date of the album. From samples of Black Panther Party member Fred Hampton, Nation of Islam/New Black Panther Party member Khalid Abdul Muhammad, to the cover for the album that was shot at an Afropunk concert, this album is deeply entrenched in Black culture. \u201cThe Charade\u201d in particular captured the thoughts of African-Americans nationwide superbly.\n\nThe soul and emotion in D\u2019Angelo\u2019s voice and personal lyrics resonated as deeply as ever. In this musical endeavor, D\u2019Angelo once again showed his mastery as an artist. From his instrumental performance, which included eclectic, but consistently stellar guitar work, to production, tremendous vocal harmonies, and lyrics, D\u2019Angelo knocks it out of the park in every aspect. The cast he assembled included the likes of Questlove, Q-Tip, and Kendra Foster. On this record, D\u2019Angelo showed that he still has that magic of years past and may in fact be sharper than ever.  A magnificent return album and certainly worth the 14 year wait.\n\u2014 YahwehSolomon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Jamie xx - In ColourThe highs of Jamie xx\u2019s solo debut In Colour are euphoric. The atmospheric introspection of \u201cLoud Places\u201d to the unapologetically bright summer jam  \u201cI Know There\u2019s Gonna Be (Good Times)\u201d is the best back-to-back punch of the year. \u201cGosh\u201d is an intimidating introduction, announcing its arrival with harsh jungle MC callouts, before sneaking in a deceptively gorgeous drone. Throw in two more collaborations from his xx bandmates Romy and Oliver Sim, and you have a top-heavy album that, while impressive, may initially threaten to topple the record as a whole. But under a microscope, the less memorable songs flourish in their own right. Even \u201cJust Saying,\u201d the 84-second prelude to \u201cStranger In A Room,\u201d finds strength as a celestial version of a track from Grouper\u2019s Ruins, whose keys keep their individual power in their differentiation, forcing intimacy through the sustained focus of each note. This divisive populist electro may never shake its myriad detractors who cry foul about the glossy repackaging of the scene it\u2019s largely indebted to, but it\u2019s wrong to dismiss such meticulously crafted production because of its accessibility. The monolithic In Colour will remain a striking affirmation of Jamie\u2019s solo chops, long after Jamie xx lays down his synths. \u2014 Brock Chenier\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Beach House - Depression Cherry\u201cThere\u2019s a place I want to take you,\u201d says Victoria Legrand on \u201cLevitation\u201d, the opening track from Depression Cherry. She and Alex Scally certainly achieve that here. Their fifth studio album isn\u2019t as cacophonous as Bloom, and it doesn\u2019t dazzle like the peaks of Teen Dream, but it\u2019s their most immersive and dream-like album. One can\u2019t help but feel that it should switch names with the much more downbeat Teen Dream.\n\nIt may be dreamlike, but it\u2019s not floaty or airy. This is one of those dreams that seem more real than real life, where colors are bolder, every detail etches itself onto your memory, and you find yourself stumbling onto profound truths about mortality, maturity, love, and loss every few minutes. The intensity is a steady 8/10 throughout, largely thanks to Legrand\u2019s woozing synths and Scally\u2019s guitar flourishes. Scally most shines on the album\u2019s opening tracks. On \u201cSpace Song,\" his abrasive guitar sounds like it is popping the bubbles blown by the staccato synth arpeggios. A shimmering riff drives the intro of \u201cSparks,\" before Legrand\u2019s heavy organ fades in and overwhelms him. The guitar is back in the second half of the song, whining in the background during several musical transitions.\n\nThat\u2019s where the magic of Beach House can be found. They largely eschew traditional song structures. Where most think in beats per minute, Scally and Legrand, like Joanna Newsom, work in songs per minute. Instruments loop hypnotically, dropping in and out unpredictably. There are faster transitions, but even these are smooth, and give the impression that the album arrived fully-formed and immaculate. So do Legrand\u2019s lyrics, that say \u201cyou will grow old too quick, then you will get over it\u201d, and speak of a universe that \u201cgoes riding off with you\u201d too soon. Sure enough, even this blissful record must come to an end. \u2014 Vesuvius\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Sufjan Stevens - Carrie & LowellSufjan Stevens has never done the same thing twice. A single glance through his discography reveals as eclectic a collection as one could ever hope for\u2014handbells and pure synth, classical woodwinds and autotuned lamentations. What unites his albums is exactly this\u2014a willingness to play and experiment\n\nBut this is not those albums. Carrie and Lowell is the sound of Sufjan Stevens distilled and perfected. He\u2019s selected the best parts of his most successful styles and fused them into a perfect synthesis\u2014bleak, unabashedly personal, and almost, but not quite, on the edge of low-fi.\n\nThose qualities alone are enough to make any album shine. But don\u2019t be mislead\u2014just because there\u2019s not the same sense of musical playfulness here doesn\u2019t mean Sufjan isn\u2019t breaking any new ground. Rather than a new musical style, Carrie & Lowell\u2019s true genius lies in its lyrics. Carrie & Lowell sees Sufjan on a poetic form unmatched by any of his previous projects. The minimalist wonder of \u201cSister\u201d or \u201cFutile Devices,\" the dramatic flourishes of \u201cPalisades\"\u2014all of these and more are reflected in his new album, in every song. Whether it\u2019s the unalloyed joy he sees in his niece (\u201cMy brother had a daughter/the beauty that she brings, illumination\u201d), or his self-destructive behavior in the wake of his mother\u2019s death (\u201cShould I tear my eyes out now? Everything I see returns to you somehow\u201d) Sufjan infuses each line with the same understated beauty and wonder. Ultimately, Carrie & Lowell is a much more consistently poetic effort than any of his previous projects, and a much more ambitious one. Carrie & Lowell brings to the table a maturity, sensitivity and depth that Sufjan has only ever shown us glimpses of before\u2014all while maintaining the absolutely note-perfect production and orchestration that is Sufjan\u2019s forte.The only reason why I continue at all\nFaith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb\nSigns and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark\nBlind faith, God\u2019s grace, nothing else left to impart\u2014 nightpool\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A ButterflyKendrick Lamar\u2019s near 80-minute epic is a rollercoaster of emotion backed by an eclectic assortment of live instrumentation. G-funk to jazz, Compton to Africa, Kendrick navigates his way in search of answers on To Pimp A Butterfly. A stark contrast to his previous works, the LP draws parallels to an Oscar-nominated feature-length film; Kendrick nominated for best actor and director. Deep cuts like \"How Much a Dollar Cost\" require the listener to immediately rewind. We're sure President Obama was among them \u2014 he named the song his favorite from 2015.\n\nEnthralling interludes and dark, brooding tracks like \u201cu\u201d find Lamar grappling with depression and survivor's guilt following his rise to stardom. Buoyancy comes in waves on the likes of \u201cKing Kunta\u201d and \u201cYou Ain\u2019t Gotta Lie (Momma Said),\" as Kendrick spits game for whoever\u2019s willing to listen \u2014 the people listened. \u201cAlright\u201d became an overnight cultural phenomenon in the wake of the #BlackLivesMatter movement, as protestors chanted \u201cWe gon\u2019 be alright!\u201d in moving scenes just months after the album's release. Even Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Chabon couldn't ignore TPAB, within hours of \"The Blacker The Berry\" hitting the web, he was annotating the song right here on Genius.\n\nLamar engaged fans past dope drum breaks and hard-hitting lyrics to deliver an ambitious project full of tenacity and conviction \u2014 two traits he shares with idols 2Pac and Nelson Mandela. As the former prophesied: \u201cI'm not saying I'm gonna change the world, but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world.\u201d Enter: Kendrick Lamar. \u2014 Michael HealCheck out the Genius Community's 50 Best Songs of 2015 here.60Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/146999", "artist_names": "Mark Twain", "full_title": "The Innocents Abroad  (Chap. 14) by\u00a0Mark\u00a0Twain", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/92f78d3d927360a7e6bfc88a461d2bbb.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/92f78d3d927360a7e6bfc88a461d2bbb.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 146999, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 205874, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": null, "path": "/Mark-twain-the-innocents-abroad-chap-14-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Mark-twain-the-innocents-abroad-chap-14-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/92f78d3d927360a7e6bfc88a461d2bbb.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/92f78d3d927360a7e6bfc88a461d2bbb.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "The Innocents Abroad  (Chap. 14)", "title_with_featured": "The Innocents Abroad  (Chap. 14)", "updated_by_human_at": 1373999828, "url": "https://genius.com/Mark-twain-the-innocents-abroad-chap-14-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/37525", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/eb60329fb4c6a7c7fb982a0c4c1b3380.723x1000x1.jpg", "id": 37525, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/eb60329fb4c6a7c7fb982a0c4c1b3380.723x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Mark Twain", "slug": "Mark-twain", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Mark-twain"}, "artist": "Mark Twain", "lyrics": "The Innocents Abroad  (Chap. 14) Lyrics\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We went to see the Cathedral of Notre Dame. We had heard of it before. It surprises me sometimes to think how much we do know and how intelligent we are. We recognized the brown old Gothic pile in a moment; it was like the pictures. We stood at a little distance and changed from one point of observation to another and gazed long at its lofty square towers and its rich front, clustered thick with stony, mutilated saints who had been looking calmly down from their perches for ages. The Patriarch of Jerusalem stood under them in the old days of chivalry and romance, and preached the third Crusade, more than six hundred years ago; and since that day they have stood there and looked quietly down upon the most thrilling scenes, the grandest pageants, the most extraordinary spectacles that have grieved or delighted Paris. These battered and broken-nosed old fellows saw many and many a cavalcade of mail-clad knights come marching home from Holy Land; they heard the bells above them toll the signal for the St. Bartholomew's Massacre, and they saw the slaughter that followed; later they saw the Reign of Terror, the carnage of the Revolution, the overthrow of a king, the coronation of two Napoleons, the christening of the young prince that lords it over a regiment of servants in the Tuileries to-day\u2014and they may possibly continue to stand there until they see the Napoleon dynasty swept away and the banners of a great republic floating above its ruins. I wish these old parties could speak. They could tell a tale worth the listening to.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They say that a pagan temple stood where Notre Dame now stands, in the old Roman days, eighteen or twenty centuries ago\u2014remains of it are still preserved in Paris; and that a Christian church took its place about A.D. 300; another took the place of that in A.D. 500; and that the foundations of the present cathedral were laid about A.D. 1100. The ground ought to be measurably sacred by this time, one would think. One portion of this noble old edifice is suggestive of the quaint fashions of ancient times. It was built by Jean Sans-Peur, Duke of Burgundy, to set his conscience at rest\u2014he had assassinated the Duke of Orleans. Alas! Those good old times are gone when a murderer could wipe the stain from his name and soothe his troubles to sleep simply by getting out his bricks and mortar and building an addition to a church.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The portals of the great western front are bisected by square pillars. They took the central one away in 1852, on the occasion of thanksgivings for the reinstitution of the presidential power\u2014but precious soon they had occasion to reconsider that motion and put it back again! And they did.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We loitered through the grand aisles for an hour or two, staring up at the rich stained-glass windows embellished with blue and yellow and crimson saints and martyrs, and trying to admire the numberless great pictures in the chapels, and then we were admitted to the sacristy and shown the magnificent robes which the Pope wore when he crowned Napoleon I; a wagon-load of solid gold and silver utensils used in the great public processions and ceremonies of the church; some nails of the true cross, a fragment of the cross itself, a part of the crown of thorns. We had already seen a large piece of the true cross in a church in the Azores, but no nails. They showed us likewise the bloody robe which that archbishop of Paris wore who exposed his sacred person and braved the wrath of the insurgents of 1848, to mount the barricades and hold aloft the olive branch of peace in the hope of stopping the slaughter. His noble effort cost him his life. He was shot dead. They showed us a cast of his face taken after death, the bullet that killed him, and the two vertebrae in which it lodged. These people have a somewhat singular taste in the matter of relics. Ferguson told us that the silver cross which the good archbishop wore at his girdle was seized and thrown into the Seine, where it lay embedded in the mud for fifteen years, and then an angel appeared to a priest and told him where to dive for it; he did dive for it and got it, and now it is there on exhibition at Notre Dame, to be inspected by anybody who feels an interest in inanimate objects of miraculous intervention.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next we went to visit the Morgue, that horrible receptacle for the dead who die mysteriously and leave the manner of their taking off a dismal secret. We stood before a grating and looked through into a room which was hung all about with the clothing of dead men; coarse blouses, water-soaked; the delicate garments of women and children; patrician vestments, hacked and stabbed and stained with red; a hat that was crushed and bloody.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On a slanting stone lay a drowned man, naked, swollen, purple; clasping the fragment of a broken bush with a grip which death had so petrified that human strength could not unloose it\u2014mute witness of the last despairing effort to save the life that was doomed beyond all help. A stream of water trickled ceaselessly over the hideous face. We knew that the body and the clothing were there for identification by friends, but still we wondered if anybody could love that repulsive object or grieve for its loss. We grew meditative and wondered if, some forty years ago, when the mother of that ghastly thing was dandling it upon her knee, and kissing it and petting it and displaying it with satisfied pride to the passers-by, a prophetic vision of this dread ending ever flitted through her brain. I half feared that the mother, or the wife or a brother of the dead man might come while we stood there, but nothing of the kind occurred. Men and women came, and some looked eagerly in and pressed their faces against the bars; others glanced carelessly at the body and turned away with a disappointed look\u2014people, I thought, who live upon strong excitements and who attend the exhibitions of the Morgue regularly, just as other people go to see theatrical spectacles every night. When one of these looked in and passed on, I could not help thinking\u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now this don't afford you any satisfaction\u2014a party with his head shot off is what you need.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One night we went to the celebrated Jardin Mabille, but only staid a little while. We wanted to see some of this kind of Paris life, however, and therefore the next night we went to a similar place of entertainment in a great garden in the suburb of Asnieres. We went to the railroad depot, toward evening, and Ferguson got tickets for a second-class carriage. Such a perfect jam of people I have not often seen\u2014but there was no noise, no disorder, no rowdyism. Some of the women and young girls that entered the train we knew to be of the demi-monde, but others we were not at all sure about.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The girls and women in our carriage behaved themselves modestly and becomingly all the way out, except that they smoked. When we arrived at the garden in Asnieres, we paid a franc or two admission and entered a place which had flower beds in it, and grass plots, and long, curving rows of ornamental shrubbery, with here and there a secluded bower convenient for eating ice cream in. We moved along the sinuous gravel walks, with the great concourse of girls and young men, and suddenly a domed and filigreed white temple, starred over and over and over again with brilliant gas jets, burst upon us like a fallen sun. Nearby was a large, handsome house with its ample front illuminated in the same way, and above its roof floated the Star-Spangled Banner of America.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well!\" I said. \"How is this?\" It nearly took my breath away.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ferguson said an American\u2014a New Yorker\u2014kept the place, and was carrying on quite a stirring opposition to the Jardin Mabille.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Crowds composed of both sexes and nearly all ages were frisking about the garden or sitting in the open air in front of the flagstaff and the temple, drinking wine and coffee or smoking. The dancing had not begun yet. Ferguson said there was to be an exhibition. The famous Blondin was going to perform on a tightrope in another part of the garden. We went thither. Here the light was dim, and the masses of people were pretty closely packed together. And now I made a mistake which any donkey might make, but a sensible man never. I committed an error which I find myself repeating every day of my life. Standing right before a young lady, I said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Dan, just look at this girl, how beautiful she is!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I thank you more for the evident sincerity of the compliment, sir, than for the extraordinary publicity you have given to it!\" This in good, pure English.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We took a walk, but my spirits were very, very sadly dampened. I did not feel right comfortable for some time afterward. Why will people be so stupid as to suppose themselves the only foreigners among a crowd of ten thousand persons?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Blondin came out shortly. He appeared on a stretched cable, far away above the sea of tossing hats and handkerchiefs, and in the glare of the hundreds of rockets that whizzed heavenward by him he looked like a wee insect. He balanced his pole and walked the length of his rope\u2014two or three hundred feet; he came back and got a man and carried him across; he returned to the center and danced a jig; next he performed some gymnastic and balancing feats too perilous to afford a pleasant spectacle; and he finished by fastening to his person a thousand Roman candles, Catherine wheels, serpents and rockets of all manner of brilliant colors, setting them on fire all at once and walking and waltzing across his rope again in a blinding blaze of glory that lit up the garden and the people's faces like a great conflagration at midnight.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dance had begun, and we adjourned to the temple. Within it was a drinking saloon, and all around it was a broad circular platform for the dancers. I backed up against the wall of the temple, and waited. Twenty sets formed, the music struck up, and then\u2014I placed my hands before my face for very shame. But I looked through my fingers. They were dancing the renowned \"Can-can.\" A handsome girl in the set before me tripped forward lightly to meet the opposite gentleman, tripped back again, grasped her dresses vigorously on both sides with her hands, raised them pretty high, danced an extraordinary jig that had more activity and exposure about it than any jig I ever saw before, and then, drawing her clothes still higher, she advanced gaily to the center and launched a vicious kick full at her vis-a-vis that must infallibly have removed his nose if he had been seven feet high. It was a mercy he was only six.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is the can-can. The idea of it is to dance as wildly, as noisily, as furiously as you can; expose yourself as much as possible if you are a woman; and kick as high as you can, no matter which sex you belong to. There is no word of exaggeration in this. Any of the staid, respectable, aged people who were there that night can testify to the truth of that statement. There were a good many such people present. I suppose French morality is not of that straight-laced description which is shocked at trifles.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I moved aside and took a general view of the can-can. Shouts, laughter, furious music, a bewildering chaos of darting and intermingling forms, stormy jerking and snatching of gay dresses, bobbing beads, flying arms, lightning flashes of white-stockinged calves and dainty slippers in the air, and then a grand final rush, riot, a terrific hubbub, and a wild stampede! Heavens! Nothing like it has been seen on earth since trembling Tam O'Shanter saw the devil and the witches at their orgies that stormy night in \"Alloway's auld haunted kirk.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We visited the Louvre, at a time when we had no silk purchases in view, and looked at its miles of paintings by the old masters. Some of them were beautiful, but at the same time they carried such evidences about them of the cringing spirit of those great men that we found small pleasure in examining them. Their nauseous adulation of princely patrons was more prominent to me and chained my attention more surely than the charms of color and expression which are claimed to be in the pictures. Gratitude for kindnesses is well, but it seems to me that some of those artists carried it so far that it ceased to be gratitude and became worship. If there is a plausible excuse for the worship of men, then by all means let us forgive Rubens and his brethren.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I will drop the subject, lest I say something about the old masters that might as well be left unsaid.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course we drove in the Bois de Boulogne, that limitless park, with its forests, its lakes, its cascades, and its broad avenues. There were thousands upon thousands of vehicles abroad, and the scene was full of life and gaiety. There were very common hacks, with father and mother and all the children in them; conspicuous little open carriages with celebrated ladies of questionable reputation in them; there were Dukes and Duchesses abroad, with gorgeous footmen perched behind, and equally gorgeous outriders perched on each of the six horses; there were blue and silver, and green and gold, and pink and black, and all sorts and descriptions of stunning and startling liveries out, and I almost yearned to be a flunkey myself, for the sake of the fine clothes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But presently the Emperor came along and he outshone them all. He was preceded by a bodyguard of gentlemen on horseback in showy uniforms, his carriage-horses (there appeared to be somewhere in the remote neighborhood of a thousand of them,) were bestridden by gallant-looking fellows, also in stylish uniforms, and after the carriage followed another detachment of bodyguards. Everybody got out of the way; everybody bowed to the Emperor and his friend the Sultan; and they went by on a swinging trot and disappeared.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I will not describe the Bois de Boulogne. I can not do it. It is simply a beautiful, cultivated, endless, wonderful wilderness. It is an enchanting place. It is in Paris now, one may say, but a crumbling old cross in one portion of it reminds one that it was not always so. The cross marks the spot where a celebrated troubadour was waylaid and murdered in the fourteenth century. It was in this park that that fellow with an unpronounceable name made the attempt upon the Russian Czar's life last spring with a pistol. The bullet struck a tree. Ferguson showed us the place. Now in America that interesting tree would be chopped down or forgotten within the next five years, but it will be treasured here.

M. P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.\n\n\u2014Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?\n\n\u2014Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?\n\n\u2014Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.\n\n\u2014What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane\u2014old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him\u2014lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.\n\u2014Circumcised? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.\n\n\u2014That the lay you're on now? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?\n\nFor nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.\n\u2014Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Not taking anything between drinks, says I.\n\n\u2014What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.\n\n\u2014Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.\n\n\u2014Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.\n\n\u2014Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?\n\u2014Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.\n\n\u2014-What was that, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.\n\nSo we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.\n\nIn Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.\n\nAnd there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.\n\nI dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!\n\nAnd by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.\n\nSo we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.\n\n\u2014There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.\n\nThe bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.\n\n\u2014Stand and deliver, says he.\n\n\u2014That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.\n\u2014Pass, friends, says he.\n\nThen he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:\n\n\u2014What's your opinion of the times?\n\nDoing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.\n\n\u2014I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.\n\nSo begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:\n\n\u2014Foreign wars is the cause of it.\n\nAnd says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:\n\n\u2014It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.\n\n\u2014Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.\n\n\u2014Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Wine of the country, says he.\n\n\u2014What's yours? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.\n\n\u2014Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.\n\n\u2014Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?\n\nAnd with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.\n\nThe figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.\n\nHe wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.\n\nSo anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.\n\n\u2014And there's more where that came from, says he.\n\n\u2014Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.\n\n\u2014I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.\n\nWho comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.\n\n\u2014For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.\n\nAnd he starts reading them out:\n\n\u2014Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...\n\n\u2014I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.\n\n\u2014Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, honourable person.\n\n\u2014Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.\n\nAh! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.\n\nAnd lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.\n\nLittle Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.\n\n\u2014Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...\n\nAnd he doubled up.\n\n\u2014Take a what? says I.\n\n\u2014Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.\n\n\u2014O hell! says I.\n\nThe bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.\n\n\u2014Bi i dho husht, says he.\n\n\u2014Who? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.\n\n\u2014When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...\n\nAnd he started laughing.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?\n\n\u2014Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.\n\nTerence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.\n\nThen did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.\n\nBut he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.\n\n\u2014What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.\n\nSo he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.\n\n\u2014Are you codding? says I.\n\n\u2014Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.\n\nSo Joe took up the letters.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.\n\nSo I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:\n\n\u2014How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?\n\n\u2014I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...\n\n\u2014You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?\n\n\u2014With Dignam, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is it Paddy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Why?\n\n\u2014Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.\n\n\u2014Who's dead? says Bob Doran.\n\n\u2014You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?\n\n\u2014What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?\n\n\u2014Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.\n\n\u2014Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\n\n\u2014Paddy? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says Alf.\n\nBegob he was what you might call flabbergasted.\n\nIn the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.\n\nAssurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.\n\nHe is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.\n\n\u2014There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.\n\nAnd, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.\n\nLittle Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.\n\nAnd says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:\n\n\u2014Who said Christ is good?\n\n\u2014I beg your parsnips, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.\n\nBut Bob Doran shouts out of him.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.\n\nTerry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.\n\n\u2014The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.\n\nThe tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.\n\n\u2014The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.\n\nAnd mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.\n\nOld Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.\n\n\u2014Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.\n\nSo Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.\n\n\u2014O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?\n\nAnd he starts reading out one.\n\n7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.\n\nHonoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...\n\n\u2014Show us, Joe, says I.\n\n\u2014... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...\n\n\u2014Jesus, says I.\n\n\u2014... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...\n\nThe citizen made a grab at the letter.\n\n\u2014Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.\nH. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.\n\n\u2014And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?\n\nSo they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.\n\n\u2014Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.\n\nAnd Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.\n\n\u2014They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.\n\nAnd he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.\n\nIn the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.\n\nSo they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.\n\n\u2014There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.\n\n\u2014That so? says Joe.\n\n\u2014God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in\n\nKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.\n\n\u2014Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.\n\n\u2014That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...\n\nAnd then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.\n\nThe distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.\n\nSo of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:\n\n\u2014Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!\n\nArrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.\n\nAnd the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b\u00e9zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!\n\n\u2014The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...\n\n\u2014Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.\n\nThe last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petit\u00e9patant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Vir\u00e1ga Kis\u00e1szony Putr\u00e1pesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.\n\nQuietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate\u2014short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fianc\u00e9e an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:\n\n\u2014God blimey if she ain't a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.\n\nSo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.\n\nSo howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.\n\n\u2014Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.\n\n\u2014No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.\n\nSo he calls the old dog over.\n\n\u2014What's on you, Garry? says he.\n\nThen he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.\n\nAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.\n\nThe curse of my curses\nSeven days every day\nAnd seven dry Thursdays\nOn you, Barney Kiernan,\nHas no sup of water\nTo cool my courage,\nAnd my guts red roaring\nAfter Lowry's lights.\n\nSo he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling.\n\nGob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:\n\n\u2014Could you make a hole in another pint?\n\n\u2014Could a swim duck? says I.\n\n\u2014Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.\n\n\u2014Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.\n\n\u2014Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?\n\n\u2014Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.\n\n\u2014Whose admirers? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.\n\nThen he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.\n\nSo Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.\n\n\u2014Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.\n\n\u2014No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.\n\n\u2014Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.\n\nAnd off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.\n\nSo Terry brought the three pints.\n\n\u2014Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.\n\n\u2014Slan leat, says he.\n\n\u2014Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.\n\nGob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.\n\n\u2014Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Friend of yours, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?\n\n\u2014I won't mention any names, says Alf.\n\n\u2014I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.\n\n\u2014Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.\n\nSo Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.\n\nGa Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.\n\n\u2014Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.\n\n\u2014Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.\n\n\u2014Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.\n\n\u2014That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?\n\n\u2014Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?\n\nMr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.\n\nMr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?\n\nMr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)\n\nMr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.\n\nMr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.\n\n(Ironical opposition cheers.)\n\nThe speaker: Order! Order!\n\n(The house rises. Cheers.)\n\n\u2014There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?\n\n\u2014Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.\n\n\u2014Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.\n\n\u2014Is that really a fact? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?\n\nSo off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.\n\nA most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.\n\nAmongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.\n\n\u2014Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?\n\n\u2014No, says Joe.\n\n\u2014I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Who? Blazes? says Joe.\n\nAnd says Bloom:\n\n\u2014What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.\n\n\u2014Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.\n\n\u2014We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.\n\n\u2014-True for you, says Joe.\n\nAnd Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:\n\n\u2014Now, don't you think, Bergan?\n\n\u2014Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.\n\nIt was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.\n\n\u2014He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north.\n\n\u2014He is, says Joe. Isn't he?\n\n\u2014Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.\n\n\u2014Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.\n\n\u2014My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.\n\nHe's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.\n\nHoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.\n\nPride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.\n\nAnd lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.\n\n\u2014Hello, Ned.\n\n\u2014Hello, Alf.\n\n\u2014Hello, Jack.\n\n\u2014Hello, Joe.\n\n\u2014God save you, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?\n\n\u2014Half one, says Ned.\n\nSo J. J. ordered the drinks.\n\n\u2014Were you round at the court? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.\n\n\u2014Hope so, says Ned.\n\nNow what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.\n\n\u2014Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.\n\n\u2014Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.\n\n\u2014Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.\n\n\u2014Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.\n\n\u2014Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.\n\n\u2014Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.\n\n\u2014Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.\n\n\u2014Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.\n\n\u2014How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...\n\n\u2014Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh.\n\n\u2014Nor good red herring, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.\n\nBegob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.\n\n\u2014And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.\n\nSix and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.\n\n\u2014Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Good health, Ned, says J. J.\n\n\u2014-There he is again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Where? says Alf.\n\nAnd begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.\n\n\u2014How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Remanded, says J. J.\n\nOne of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.\n\n\u2014Who tried the case? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Recorder, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.\n\n\u2014Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.\n\nAnd he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:\n\n\u2014A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?\n\n\u2014Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.\n\n\u2014And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.\n\nAnd whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.\n\n\u2014Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.\n\nSo Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.\n\n\u2014Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret.\n\n\u2014Rely on me, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.\n\n\u2014O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see.\n\n\u2014Consider that done, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Very kind of you, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.\n\n\u2014Decree nisi, says J. J.\n\nAnd Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.\n\n\u2014A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.\n\n\u2014And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.\n\n\u2014Give us a squint at her, says I.\n\nAnd what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.\n\n\u2014O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!\n\n\u2014There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?\n\nSo anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.\n\n\u2014Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?\n\nO'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.\n\n\u2014It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.\n\nSo J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.\n\n\u2014Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.\n\n\u2014The European family, says J. J....\n\n\u2014They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d'aisance.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\n\nAnd says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!\n\nHe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.\n\n\u2014What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.\n\n\u2014Gold cup, says he.\n\n\u2014Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.\n\n\u2014And Bass's mare? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.\n\n\u2014I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.\n\n\u2014Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.\n\nSo he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.\n\n\u2014Not there, my child, says he.\n\n\u2014Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog.\n\nAnd J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.\n\n\u2014Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.\n\n\u2014Raimeis, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?\n\n\u2014As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's...\n\n\u2014Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.\n\n\u2014Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.\n\nThe fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.\n\n\u2014And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.\n\n\u2014And will again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.\n\nAnd he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.\n\n\u2014Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?\n\n\u2014An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.\n\n\u2014Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.\n\nHanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.\n\n\u2014But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?\n\n\u2014I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.\n\nSo he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.\n\n\u2014A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the breech.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\n\nThen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.\n\n\u2014That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.\n\nThe fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.\n\n\u2014On which the sun never rises, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it.\n\nThey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.\n\n\u2014But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?\n\nDidn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.\n\n\u2014We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.\n\n\u2014Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...\n\n\u2014We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.\n\n\u2014Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?\n\n\u2014The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Fran\u00e7ais, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.\n\n\u2014And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?\n\nJesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.\n\n\u2014Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!\n\n\u2014And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.\n\n\u2014They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.\n\nAnd says J. J.:\n\n\u2014Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.\n\n\u2014Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says he. I will.\n\n\u2014You? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.\n\n\u2014Repeat that dose, says Joe.\n\nBloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.\n\n\u2014Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.\n\n\u2014But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014What is it? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.\n\n\u2014By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm living in the same place for the past five years.\n\nSo of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:\n\n\u2014Or also living in different places.\n\n\u2014That covers my case, says Joe.\n\n\u2014What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.\n\nThe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\n\n\u2014After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.\n\n\u2014Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.\n\nThe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's Cave\u2014all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.\n\n\u2014Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?\n\n\u2014That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.\n\n\u2014And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.\n\nGob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.\n\n\u2014Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.\n\n\u2014Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.\n\nThat's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.\n\n\u2014But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.\n\nWho's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.\n\n\u2014A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.\n\n\u2014Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.\n\n\u2014That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.\n\nLove loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.\n\n\u2014Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.\n\n\u2014Hurrah, there, says Joe.\n\n\u2014The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.\n\nAnd he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.\n\n\u2014We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\nSo the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:\n\n\u2014A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.\n\n\u2014Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.\n\n\u2014Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.\n\n\u2014Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P.\n\n\u2014And a very good initial too, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's this his name is?\n\n\u2014Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.\n\n\u2014Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.\n\n\u2014I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels.\n\n\u2014Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?\n\n\u2014That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.\n\n\u2014There you are, says Terry.\n\nGoodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.\n\nSo anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one.\n\n\u2014Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.\n\nSure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense.\n\nOur travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.\n\n\u2014Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!\n\nSo saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.\n\nMine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.\n\n\u2014Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.\n\n\u2014Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.\n\n\u2014Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.\n\n\u2014How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?\n\nAn instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.\n\n\u2014Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.\n\n\u2014Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?\n\nMine host bowed again as he made answer:\n\n\u2014What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?\n\n\u2014Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!\n\n\u2014Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.\n\nSo in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.\n\n\u2014Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.\n\n\u2014Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?\n\n\u2014That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.\n\n\u2014Who made those allegations? says Alf.\n\n\u2014I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.\n\n\u2014And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow?\n\n\u2014Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.\n\n\u2014Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.\n\n\u2014Who is Junius? says J. J.\n\n\u2014We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.\n\n\u2014He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.\n\n\u2014Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.\n\n\u2014That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!\n\n\u2014Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he's a father or a mother.\n\n\u2014Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.\n\n\u2014O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.\n\n\u2014En ventre sa m\u00e8re, says J. J.\n\n\u2014Do you call that a man? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014And who does he suspect? says the citizen.\n\nGob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.\n\n\u2014Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.\n\n\u2014A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.\n\n\u2014Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.\n\n\u2014Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.\n\n\u2014You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.\n\n\u2014Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.\n\n\u2014Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.\n\n\u2014Amen, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And I'm sure He will, says Joe.\n\nAnd at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S. Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S. Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge, illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.\n\n\u2014Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.\n\n\u2014Qui fecit coelum et terram.\n\n\u2014Dominus vobiscum.\n\n\u2014Et cum spiritu tuo.\n\nAnd he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:\n\n\u2014Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum.\n\n\u2014And so say all of us, says Jack.\n\n\u2014Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.\n\n\u2014Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.\n\nI was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.\n\n\u2014I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I'm not...\n\n\u2014No, says Martin, we're ready.\n\nCourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,\n\n\u2014Beg your pardon, says he.\n\n\u2014Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a secret.\n\nAnd the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.\n\n\u2014Bye bye all, says Martin.\n\nAnd he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.\n\n\u2014-Off with you, says\n\nMartin to the jarvey.\n\nThe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.\n\nBut begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.\n\n\u2014Let me alone, says he.\n\nAnd begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:\n\n\u2014Three cheers for Israel!\n\nArrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.\n\nAnd all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:\n\n\u2014Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!\n\nAnd says he:\n\n\u2014Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.\n\n\u2014He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.\n\n\u2014Whose God? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.\n\nGob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.\n\n\u2014By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.\n\nBy Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.\n\n\u2014Stop! Stop! says Joe.\n\nA large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great \u00e9clat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakoczsy's March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra, kedves bar\u00e1ton! Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra! Gone but not forgotten.\n\nGob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre:\n\n\u2014Where is he till I murder him?\n\nAnd Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.\n\n\u2014Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.\n\nBut as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other way and off with him.\n\n\u2014Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!\n\nBegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.\n\nThe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of d\u00e9bris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F. R. C. S. I.\n\nYou never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him.\n\n\u2014Did I kill him, says he, or what?\n\nAnd he shouting to the bloody dog:\n\n\u2014After him, Garry! After him, boy!\n\nAnd the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.\n\nWhen, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai! And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1081420", "artist_names": "Freddy Fender", "full_title": "Since I Met You Baby by\u00a0Freddy\u00a0Fender",

livin'\nYou just leave this long haired country boy alone\n[Verse 2]\nPreacher man talkin' on TV\nPuttin' down the rock and roll\nWants me to send a donation\n'Cause he's worried about my soul\nHe said, \"Jesus walked on the water.\"\nAnd I know that it's true\nBut sometimes I think that preacher man\nWould like to do a little walkin' too\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'\nIf I can't get it on my own\nIf you don't like the way I'm livin'\nYou just leave this long haired country boy alone\n\n[Verse 3]\nA poor girl wants to marry\nAnd a rich girl wants to flirt\nA rich man goes to college\nAnd a poor man goes to work\nA drunkard wants another drink of wine\nAnd a politician wants your vote\nI don't want much of nothin' at all\nBut I will take another toke\nYou might

take care of my new mama\nShe's the apple of his eye\n\nAnd as he kissed his brand new wife goodbye\nI always used to hear him say\nLook after my boy\nWon't you please, now, Judy Mae\n\nJudy Mae\nOh, she sure had a way of looking after me\nYes, her eyes would sparkle and shine\nEvery time Papa got ready to leave\n\nWell, one night while my daddy was gone\nShe tiptoed into my room\nShe said that she had to talk to me\nCause my dad was gonna be home soon\n\nShe said, you know\nI get so lonely and cold\nWhen your daddy is gone for days\nWhat a boy like you could do to Judy Mae\n\nWell, I told her that I'd never done this before\nAnd then she took my hand\nAnd showed me all of the secret things\nThat turned a boy into a man\nYou might also likeAnd as I lay there by her side\nI heard a noise

nothing\nIf you look close, see a tear dropping\nDon't answer the door, that's the jakes knocking\nDon't answer the phone, don't know who's ringing\nI didn't wanna stop till the crew's winning\nI swear I had a plan and a true vision\nThey closed down the youth clubs and build a new prison\nJust lost my pops, I weren't close with him\nBut it felt like part of my soul's missing\nGotta move on cuh the world keeps spinning\nTake it from the streets but the streets in him\nHad to tell a queen, \"Just keep grinning\nCuh your self-esteem needs refilling\"\nJust fucked up my zoot, it needs re-billing\nMetaphor for the life that I been living\nCuh I bit one fruit and it was forbidden\nSee your life fall apart from one poor decision\nIt's only when you're stressed, you turn to religion\nIf you wanna conquer them then cause a division\nYeah, I make a lot of bread but I'm stuck in the system\nThere's no one like me cuh I'm one in million\nNever ask for your help but ask for assistance\nI don't ever say nothing, I watch from a distance\nEvery story I tell is non-fiction\nCame out the court, they gave me my bail conditions\nWhat's the point in being free when your brain's in prison?\nI'm by myself but I'm still with the coalition\nYou don't make moves, you're only just hoping and wishing\nCriticise me when your gang do a whole heap of snitching\nIt's the remix ignition, hot and fresh out of the kitchen\nIf Shaytan prayed today, would he be forgiven?\nFrom an adolescent, I never learned my lesson\nIf my name was Smith, they'll have to add a Wesson\nSee my aggression, I left a bad impression\nSelf-medicate myself through my depression\nAll I need is money, man, I'm more than eager\nI need to be a man, I need to be a leader\nI need to bun a zoot, I need to bun a reefer\nIt's Meek Mill and Omelly, nah, that's Hus and Creepa\nThe way I've been roasting, I think I need a diva\nBig bunda, she in the Bundesliga\nBut every time I bust, I wish I never seen her\nIt's like every time I bust, I catch an amnesia\nAll I need is my notes and my calculator\nI've been out of town tryna stay off the radar\nCut the tension with a razor\nThe next reh teh gon' come with a laser\nSweet talker, smooth operator, you ain't never gonna shine cuh you're a big hater\nMake 50 mil, become an innovator, before I get taken away by the Malaikah\nRisk taker, not a compromiser, that's why I had to run away from a coloniser\nNever had a childhood like Lizzie McGuire, so I had to stack up and invest in a fire\nWhy wait for the return of the Messiah, when they scheming on me now, when they try to conspire?\nYeah, I lost a lot of faith but now I pray harder\nStill had to put a bullet in a slave master\nCame looking for me like a couple days after\nThey don't know I'm clued up, I play the game smarter\nAll I see is bare opps and bare Garda\nIf I don't see you now, I'll see you in the hereafter\nLight a zoot and then I speak to my forefathers\nStill now, I don't have all the answers\nMovers and shakers, not break-dancers\nYou still ain't blown but you had all the chances\nI know you feel the force but you can't stop it\nYeah, you can see it but you can't touch it\nTake me for a fool but I'm far from it\nNow we shot lyrics, not narcotics\nHow dare you put money in my opps' pockets?\nMy mood goes up and down like the stock market\nI had to finish it but I didn't start it\nI'm just a black-hearted black bastard\nYou heard the tec blasting and then the mac blasted\nThe time your whole block got bombarded\nThere's a war going on, don't close your eyelids\nI just raised hell, that's how I'll raise my kids\nI didn't bang off, I just brandished it\nI saw a bad man doing gymnastics\nSaw your whole gang, they was jumping ship\nBig Bonsam make you jump when it kicks\nHeard man chatting on a YouTube clip\nThe way I turn up and then cause an eclipse\nHad a ting spitting fire like Charlie Clips\nHad to get a safe-house out in the sticks\nBare mash and corn, not rice and peas\nDot all my I's and I cross all my T's\nShe wan' eat me while I'm smoking trees, too much chocolate give you diabetes\nI hopped out the ride and I done a baiteze\nGyal love me but they say I'm crazy\nWe spin in your ends, start talking grease\nIf you love me, you're gon' get on your knees\nHer milkshake brought me to her yard like Kelis\nLong time, you ain't had a real good squeeze\nI don't want the whole cake, I just get a piece\nHad to make a one move and go and get a cheese\nWhy these police wan' put me on a leash?\nI can't even- I can't even roll in peace\nIf you want a hook, that's like a hundred G's\nJust wait for my tape to release\n[Outro]\nIt Sounds Like NygeYou might also like7Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path":

nowhere\nThe road was often paved with tears and pain\nWhenever I got lost you were always there\nThrough it all you never once complained\n\nThere were times I know you thought\nThe sun would never find us\nSometimes I felt that same way too\nNow it looks as if all the hard times are behind us\nOne by one our dreams are coming true\n(One by one, one by one)\nLove finds its own way\nThrough the darkest night\nLove finds its own way\nIt needs no guiding light\n\nWhoa, oh, it only needs two people\nWith a dream and endless faith\nAnd given time and a little patience\nLove finds its own way\n\nI know you must have pushed aside your feelings\nWhen down inside you thought you'd fall apart\nAnd if it hadn't been for your believin'\nWe might still be stumblin' in the dark\n\nNow we're standing on the threshold of a new beginning\nThe doors of life are opened wide\nFor once in our lives we're finally winnin'\nAll because love is on our side\n\nLove finds its own way\nThrough the darkest night\nLove finds its own way\nIt needs no guiding light\n\nBecause love, love finds its own way\nThrough the darkest night\nLove, love, love finds its own wayYou might also likeEmbed"},

This search sometimes feels undignified on my part. I've had to ask about teenagers' sex lives, where, how often, with whom, about notes they passed in class, about their drug habits, their relationships with their parents.\nAnd I'm not a detective or a private investigator. I've not even a crime reporter. But, yes, every day this year, I've tried to figure out the alibi of a 17-year-old boy. Before I get into why I've been doing this, I just want to point out something I'd never really thought about before I started working on this story. And that is, it's really hard to account for your time, in a detailed way, I mean.\n\nHow'd you get to work last Wednesday, for instance? Drive? Walk? Bike? Was it raining? Are you sure? Did you go to any stores that day? If so, what did you buy? Who did you talk to? The entire day, name every person you talked to. It's hard.\n\nNow imagine you have to account for a day that happened six weeks back. Because that's the situation in the story I'm working on in which a bunch of teenagers had to recall a day six weeks earlier. And it was 1999, so they had to do it without the benefit of texts or Facebook or Instagram. Just for a lark, I asked some teenagers to try it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do you remember what you did on that Friday?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tyler\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No. Not at all.

And did you go with friends?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Elliot\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yeah. I went with Sam and this kid Sean, Carter, a bunch of people.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wait, Sam, my nephew Sam?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Elliot\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, yeah.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oh, OK. So Sam says he was at work.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Elliot\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oh, then it wasn't that night, then.\nSarah Koenig\nOne kid did actually remember pretty well, because it was the last day of state testing at his school and he'd saved up to go to a nightclub. That's the main thing I learned from this exercise, which is no big shocker, I guess. If some significant event happened that day, you remember that, plus you remember the entire day much better. If nothing significant happened, then the answers get very general. I most likely did this, or I most likely did that. These are words I've heard a lot lately. Here's the case I've been working on.\nAlmost 15 years ago, on January 13, 1999, a girl named Hae Min Lee disappeared. She was a senior at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County in Maryland. She was Korean. She was smart, and beautiful, and cheerful, and a great athlete. She played field hockey and lacrosse. And she was responsible.\n\nRight after school she was supposed to pick up her little cousin from kindergarten and drop her home. But she didn't show. That's when Hae Lee's family knew something was up, when the cousin's school called.\n\nAbout a month later, on February 9, Hae's body was found in a big park in Baltimore, really a rambling forest. A maintenance guy who said he'd stopped to take a leak on his way to work discovered her there. He'd noticed a bit of her black hair poking out of a shallow grave.\n\nThe cause of death was manual strangulation, meaning someone did it with their hands. A couple weeks after that, so six weeks after she first went missing, Hae's ex-boyfriend, a guy named Adnan Syed, was arrested for her murder. He's been in prison ever since.\n\nI first heard about this story more than a year ago when I got an email from a woman named Rabia Chaudry. Rabia knows Adnan pretty well. Her younger brother Saad is Adnan's best friend. And they believe he's innocent. Rabia was writing to me because, way back when, I used to be a reporter for the Baltimore Sun, and she'd come across some stories I'd written about a well-known defense attorney in Baltimore who'd been disbarred for mishandling client money. That attorney was the same person who defended Adnan, her last major trial, in fact.\n\nRabia told me she thought the attorney botched the case-- not just botched it, actually, but threw the case on purpose so she could get more money for the appeal. The lawyer had died a few years later. She'd been sick. Rabia asked if I would please just take a look at Adnan's case. I don't get emails like this every day. So I thought, sure, why not?\n\nI read a few newspaper clips about the case, looked up a few trial records. And on paper, the case was like a Shakespearean mashup-- young lovers from different worlds thwarting their families, secret assignations, jealousy, suspicion, and honor besmirched, the villain not a Moor exactly, but a Muslim all the same, and a final act of murderous revenge. And the main stage? A regular old high school across the street from a 7-Eleven.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hi, are you Rabia? Hi. Am I saying your name correctly?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia. OK.\n\nSarah Koenig\nI went to go see Rabia. She was surrounded by paper-- files, loose stacks, binders, some crappy looking boxes-- all court documents and attorney's files from Adnan's case. Some of the papers were warped and discolored.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why do they look wet? They look wet.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These have been damaged, because these--\nSarah Koenig\nShe explained that it was because the boxes had been in her car, on and off, for 15 years. Rabia is a lawyer herself. She mostly does immigration stuff. Her office takes up the corner of a much larger open space that I think is a Pakistani travel agency, though it's hard to tell.\n\nIt's in this little strip mall. Across the parking lot, there's a new Pakistani restaurant, an African evangelical church, an Indian clothing shop, a convenience store. On the sidewalk outside, I found a teeny weeny bag of marijuana. Baltimore County is like this, at least on the west side. It's where a lot of middle class and working class people go, many immigrants included, to get their kids out of the badass city. Though the badass city is close by.\n\nRabia is 40. She's short, and she's got a beautiful round face framed by hijab. She's adorable looking, but you definitely shouldn't mess with her. She's very smart and very tough, and she could crush you. Her brother Saad was at Rabia's office too the first time I went. He's 33, a mortgage broker, more laid back than Rabia. They told me about Adnan Syed, their friend-- not just a good kid, but an especially good kid-- smart, kind, goofy, handsome. So that when he was arrested for murder, so many people who know him were stunned.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was like the community's golden child.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oh, really? Talk more about that.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was an honor roll student, volunteer EMT. He was on the football team. He was a star runner on the track team. He was the homecoming king. He led prayers at the mosque. Everybody knew Adnan to be somebody who was going to do something really big.\n\nSarah Koenig\nI later fact checked all these accolades, of course, and learned that Rabia was mostly right, though she sometimes gets a little loosey-goosey with the details. Adnan was an EMT, but he didn't volunteer. He was paid for it. He was on the track team, but he wasn't a star. He did play football. And he did lead prayers on occasion.\nHe wasn't homecoming king. But he was prince of his junior prom, and this at a high school that was majority black. They picked the Pakistani Muslim kid. So you get the picture. He was an incredibly likable and well-liked kid.\n\nThis conversation with Rabia and Saad, this is what launched me on this year long-- \"obsession\" is maybe too strong a word-- let's say fascination with this case. By the end of this hour, you're going to hear different people tell different versions of what happened the day Hae Lee was killed. But let's start with the most important version of the story, the one Rabia told me first. And that's the one that was presented at trial.\n\nThe state's case against Adnan went like this. He and Hae had been going out since junior prom. But Adnan wasn't supposed to be dating at all. Adnan was born in the US, but his parents are from Pakistan. And they're conservative Muslims-- no drinking, no smoking, no girls, all that.\n\nSaad and Rabia's parents are the same way. Their families are friends. But even though Adnan and Saad and their buddies were Muslims, they were also, shall we say, healthy American teenagers who were going to do what teenagers do, so long as they didn't get caught.\n\nSo Adnan had to keep his relationship with Hae secret. The state used this against him in two ways. First, they argued, he put everything on the line-- his family, his relationships at the mosque-- to run around with this girl. So that when she broke up with him eight months later, he was left with nothing, and he was outraged. He couldn't take it, and he killed her.\nAnd the second way they used it, as they said-- look at what a liar he is, how duplicitous. He plays the good Muslim son at home and at the mosque, but look what he was up to. Saad remembers the prosecutor's closing argument at trial.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saad\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His family didn't know that he actually drank, he smoked, he was having sex.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThis was proof of bad character, someone who could be a murderer. But Saad says, if Adnan is guilty of anything, it's of being a normal kid with immigrant parents.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saad\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So the prosecution had painted Adnan as a totally bipolar or a maniacal dual personality. We all grew up with that dual personality. I know, it was forced. I'm the same way. I was like, they could paint the same thing. Because I was actually homecoming king, which I don't know if my sister even knows.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not know this.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saad\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She did not know. So I was dating a girl that was--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And why is homecoming king bad? That sounds like a good thing.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We don't go to homecoming. We don't--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because it's a dance.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's a dance. It's a mixed gender--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saad\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So I was in the same boat. My parents, my sister, they didn't know about this at all. Right now, more than 10 year later, she's finding out. I know, I'll admit. On one side, my family thinks I'm a virgin. But on the other hand, I play-- you know.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0--way too much.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saad\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But it's the truth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TMI, TMI, TMI.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saad\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See that? That right there is kind of making her feel uncomfortable. She's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\nSarah Koenig\nSo just on motive alone, Saad and Rabia found the whole thing ridiculous. As for physical evidence, there was none-- nothing. Apart from some fingerprints in Hae's car, which Adnan had been in many times, there was nothing linking him to the crime-- no DNA, no fibers, no hairs, no matching soil from the bottom of his boots.\n\nInstead, what they had on Adnan was one guy's story, a guy named Jay. He's the third person you need to remember in this crime story besides Hae and Adnan. Jay was a friend of Adnan's. They'd been in school together since middle school.\n\nThey weren't super close, but they had mutual friends. Jay sold weed, and he and Adnan smoked together. The story Jay told police had problems, because it kept changing from telling to telling. But they were able to bolster the main plot points using cell records from Adnan's phone.\n\nBy the time I left Rabia's office that first day, I understood only one thing clearly, though maybe not the thing Rabia and Saad wanted me to understand. But what I took away from the visit was, somebody is lying here. Maybe Adnan really is innocent. But what if he isn't? What if he did do it, and he's got all these good people thinking he didn't?\n\nSo either it's Jay or it's Adnan. But someone is lying. And I really wanted to figure out who.\n\nIn the early morning of February 28, 1999, Adnan was arrested by Baltimore City detectives. He was asleep in his bed when they showed up at his house. They took him straight from his untidy bedroom to an interrogation room at Homicide downtown. What Adnan didn't know is that just hours before they picked him up, the cops had interviewed his friend Jay.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\nThis is a taped interview of Jay, black male, 19 years of age. We're at the offices of Homicide, specifically the colonel's conference room.\nSarah Koenig\nThe police recorded two taped interviews with Jay. And I'm going to play you the second one from a couple weeks later, only because the sound quality is much better. Just a warning that the tape is a little upsetting to hear in parts.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\nWhy don't you go ahead and tell us what you know about the death of Hae Lee.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OK. I'd left out, went shopping with a friend of mine, an ex-friend of mine, Adnan. We had had a conversation. During the conversation he stated that he was going to kill that bitch, referring to Hae Lee. I took it with context. It didn't stand out in my head any.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay said he didn't take it too seriously. The cops have him start again from the top. On the morning of the 13th, Jay says, Adnan had left school and driven to Jay's house. Jay had graduated from school the year before and was working, but not on that day. January 13 happens to be the birthday of Jay's girlfriend, Stephanie. And Jay, who didn't have his own car, needed to go buy something for her. So Adnan comes over. According to Jay, they go shopping at the mall.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When did you do that?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We left the mall. I took him to school. I dropped him off in the back of the school. He went up to class. He left his cell phone in the car with me, told me he'd call me. I went back to my friend Jenn\u2019s house and waited for him to call.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OK, now at this point, you know why he's leaving the car with you.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And why is that?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because he said he was going to kill Hae.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the reason you have the car and the cell phone was why?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To pick him up from wherever he was going to do this at.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OK, and you had talked about this while you were shopping that day?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The details of the car and all?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The events, how they were going to plan out.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That day he told me, yes.

Adnan's driving Hae's car with her body in the trunk. Jay's driving Adnan's car. They ditch Hae's car at the I-70 Park and Ride. And then, to hear Jay tell it, they just kind of tool around Baltimore County together for a while as if nothing had happened-- buy some weed, cruise around, make some calls. After a while, Jay drives Adnan back to Woodlawn High School.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why did you take him back to school?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He told me that I had to take him back to school because he needed to be seen there.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was he going to a certain event?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was practice, track practice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Track practice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he wanted an alibi?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He wanted to be seen by people at track.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And you guys had discussed that?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He just told me that he needed to be seen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He told me that he needed to be seen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detective\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At track practice.

They drive around some more. By this time, Hae's family was worried, and they'd called the police, who in turn called a couple of Hae's friends, including Adnan.\n\nThe call comes in on his cell. The cops ask if he's seen Hae or knows where she is. Jay says after the call, they drive to Jay's to get some shovels, go retrieve Hae's car from the park and ride. They drive around some more and finally end up at Leakin Park, where Adnan proceeds to bury Hae. It's evening by now, maybe 7:00 or 8:00 PM.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he asked me if I was going to help. And I told him, [BLEEP] no.

Adnan told Jay in advance he was going to do it. He did it. They buried her. Jay's story wasn't just the foundation of the state's case against Adnan. It was the state's case against Adnan.\nIn the picture Jay drew, it's cold. I mean, he's not describing a crime of passion here. This is something much darker-- to methodically map out the death of your friend, to strangle her with your own hands so close up like that. That would mean Adnan wasn't just a killer, but a master liar and manipulator, a psychopath, probably.\n\nAdnan's in a maximum security prison in western Maryland. He calls me at my request about twice a week. He talks to me from a bank of eight pay phones in the rec hall, a pretty large room where other guys are sitting at tables with metal seats attached to them playing chess or cards or using the microwave or watching TV. It can get a little loud sometimes. Once I asked if all eight phones were always occupied. And he said, usually not, because guys who have been in for a long time, often they have no one to call.\nWhen I first met Adnan in person, I was struck by two things. He was way bigger than I expected-- barrel chested and tall. In the photos I'd seen, he was still a lanky teenager with struggling facial hair and sagging jeans. By now, he was 32. He'd spent nearly half his life in prison, becoming larger and properly bearded. And the second thing, which you can't miss about Adnan, is that he has giant brown eyes like a dairy cow. That's what prompts my most idiotic lines of inquiry. Could someone who looks like that really strangle his girlfriend? Idiotic, I know.\n\nWhen he first heard Jay's story of the crime, Adnan didn't say, well, it didn't happen like that, or, I didn't mean for it to happen like that. He said, it didn't happen. None of this is true at all. He says he had nothing to do with Hae's murder, and he doesn't know who did. Hae was Adnan's first serious relationship with a girl. He says he loved her in the way of high school love, but then also in the way of high school got over her. So that when they broke up for good sometime before Christmas break of senior year, he says he was sad for sure, but not obsessed or anything.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I just sometimes wish they could look into my brain and see how I really felt about her. And no matter what else someone would say, they would see, man, this guy had no ill will toward her. Whatever the motivation is to kill someone, I had absolutely-- it didn't exist in me, you know what I mean? No one can ever say why.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People could say why. Oh, man, he was mad, this, that, or the other. But no one could ever come with any type of proof or anecdote or anything to ever say that I was ever mad at her, that I was ever angry with her, that I ever threatened her. That's the only thing I can really hold onto. That is like my only firm handhold in this whole thing, that no one's ever been able to prove it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No one ever has been able to provide any shred of evidence that I had anything but friendship toward her, like love and respect for her. That's at the end of the day, man. The only thing I can ever say is, man, I had no reason to kill her.\nSarah Koenig\nHe's adamant about this. You can hear it, right? He's staunch. The problem is, when you ask Adnan to go back and tell his version of what happened that day, to refute Jay's story, everything becomes a lot mushier.\nYes, he hung out with Jay on the 13th, both during and after school. But he doesn't remember exactly where they went, or what they did, or what time it was. Here's what he's got.\n\nJanuary 13 unfolded like any other day, a normal, mostly uneventful day. He says there are a couple of things that do stand out, though. That day was Stephanie's birthday. Stephanie was one of Adnan's best friends and also Jay's girlfriend.\n\nAdnan had gotten Stephanie a birthday present, a stuffed reindeer, which he'd given to her in second period, Miss Efron's English class.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it occurred to me that day that I was going to ask her boyfriend, Jay, did he get her a gift? So sometime during the day before noon--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wait, Adnan, just hold up for a second. Why did you care whether Jay got Stephanie a present? What's it to you?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well, Stephanie was a very close friend of mine, as I mentioned. And I just kind of wanted to make sure that she also got a gift from him, you know? She had mentioned to me that she was looking forward to getting a gift from him. She mentioned that she was really happy to get the gift that I gave her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So as I would with any friend, I just kind of went to check on that. I kind of had a feeling that maybe he didn't get her a gift. And I had free periods during school. So it was not abnormal for me to leave school to go do something and then come back.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So I went to his house. And I asked him, did you happen to get a present for Stephanie? He said no. So I said, if you want to, you can drop me back off to school. You can borrow my car. And you can go to the mall and get her a gift or whatever. Then just come pick me up after track practice that day.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So then what happened?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well, then when school was over, I would have went to the library. I know that I usually check-- well, I didn't usually check. But if I was going to check my email, it would be using the library computer. You know, sometimes I would go there because track practice didn't start until around maybe 3 o'clock or 3:30-ish.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So it didn't start right after school. So there was a period of time of almost like an hour, an hour and some change, that was kind of free time.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThis hour and change after school, this is the crucial window. This is the time when the state says Hae was killed. School got out at 2:15. People remember seeing her after her last class heading to her car.\n\nAccording to Jay's story and the cellphone records, she was dead by 2:36 PM. So sometime in those 21 minutes, between 2:15 and 2:36, she was strangled. So that's obviously the same window Adnan needed to account for. To quote Adnan, \"My case lived and died in those 21 minutes.\"\n\nSo where does Adnan say he was? Well, maybe the library, but nobody testified to that at trial. Then to track practice-- he does remember being at track one day when it was snowing, which might have been that day. The coach testified that Adnan probably was there, but he can't be 100% sure because, as a rule, he didn't take attendance. After school is when his memories become nonspecific. Usually we did this, or we probably would have done that.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Probably track practice would have ended like, I'd say, 4:30.\n\nSarah Koenig\nJay did come to pick up Adnan after track. That part Adnan seems to more or less remember. It was Ramadan, so Adnan would have been fasting all day and hungry.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It probably would've been close to time for me to break fast. He would have came to pick me up, and we would have went to go get something to eat. And then we would have smoked some weed after, right? And then I would have had to have been home around 7, 8 o'clock, right?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or usually like the last 10 nights of Ramadan, my father would spend the night at the mosque. So a lot of times I would take him food. I think my mother would make food for him, and I would take it usually before 8 o'clock. Because that's the last evening prayer.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Did you ever leave the campus before the end of track practice? Did you ever--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OK.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You're sure?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I want to say that I'm 99% sure.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OK.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reason why I can't say 100 is because-- I mean, I do kind of understand that it comes across as-- I don't know if it does or doesn't. But it seems like I remember things that are beneficial to me, but things that aren't beneficial to me I can't remember. It's just that I don't really know what to say beyond the fact that a lot of the day that I do remember, it's bits and pieces that comes from what other people have said that they remember, right? And it kind of jogs my memory.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yeah. I don't really know what to say. And I completely understand how that comes across. I mean, the only thing I can say is, man, it was just a normal day to me. There was absolutely nothing abnormal about that day.\nSarah Koenig\nAdnan knows better than anyone how unhelpful this all is, how problematic. Because it plays both ways. If he's innocent, right, it's any other day. Of course he doesn't remember.\n\nBut you can also read it as, how convenient. He doesn't remember the day. So no one can fact check him, or poke holes in his story. Because he has no story.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I definitely understand that someone could look at this and say, oh, man, he must be lying. It's so coincidental that he doesn't remember what he did this particular time. I mean, I completely understand that, and I get that. Like I said, that's the hardest thing I've dealt with for these past 15 years.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There's nothing tangible I can do to remember that day. There's nothing I can do to make me remember. I've pored through the transcripts. I've looked through the telephone records. What else can I do?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There's nothing I can do. So perhaps I'll never be able to explain it. And it is what it is. If someone believes me or not, you know, I have no control over it.\n\nSarah Koenig\nAdnan's trial was a long ordeal. Jay was on the stand for something like five days. A cellphone expert testified for two days, a lifetime when you're discussing cell tower technology. There were absences, and some bad weather closed the courts. So it was six weeks before both sides rested.\n\nBut the jury? They moved like lightning. After just a few hours, including a lunch break, they convicted Adnan of first-degree murder. Rabia Chaudry was there in the courtroom when it happened. She says his mother was crying. She was crying.\n\nRabia hadn't sat through the whole trial. So the first time she fully understood that the case came down to those 21 minutes was during closing arguments, when the prosecutor brought out a dummy's head and strangled it in front of the jury. That evening, after the verdict, Rabia went to see Adnan in lockup.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so I went to go see him. So this is the same day he's been convicted. And this is the first time I actually had a conversation with him about, what's going on? And I was like, you know, Adnan, the whole thing's turning on these 20, 25 minutes. Where were you?\n\nAnd he's like, she disappeared in January, you know? In March, you're asking me, where were you after school for 20 minutes on a specific day? All the days are the same to me, you know?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But then he mentions that there was this one girl, an alibi girl.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He's like, the only thing I could offer is I remember there's a girl I go to school with. Her name's Asia McClain. He's like, right after I got arrested, she wrote me a couple of letters. And she said she also went to see my family. And she said she specifically remembers me being at the library, at the public library, right after school.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThe Woodlawn public library is just across the parking lot from Woodlawn High School. It's not technically part of the campus, but it might as well be.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He said, I gave those letters to Christina Gutierrez, to my attorney. He's like, but apparently it didn't really check out. So he's like, I don't know. So they're not helpful to us. So this was the first time I heard of this girl Asia McClain. I had never heard of her before. Nobody had mentioned her before.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were you floored, like, wait, wait, wait, wait, what? I mean, like--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't floored at the time. Because I thought, if this girl wrote and the attorney-- what criminal defense attorney's not going to check out a potential alibi? So I asked him, I said, do you have a copy of those letters? He said, yeah, I have a copy. I said, send me a copy.\n\nSarah Koenig\nAdnan sends the letters to Rabia, and here's what she reads. The first letter, the first of two, is dated March 1, 1999. That is one day after Adnan was arrested. At the top of the letter, she notes, \"I just came from your house an hour ago.Dear Adnan-- I hope I spelled it right. I'm not sure if you remember talking to me in the library on January 13, but I remember chatting with you.\" She says, quote, \"we aren't really close friends, but I want you to look into my eyes and tell me of your innocence. If I ever find otherwise, I will hunt you down and whip your ass. OK, friend?At the bottom she added a little note.My boyfriend and his best friend remember seeing you there, too.That's letter number one. Then the next day, on March 2, she writes Adnan another letter. This one's typed. It's chattier. She talks about the gossip at school, the bits and pieces of evidence about the crime that are circulating, what the students are saying, what the teachers are saying, about her visit to his house.\n\nQuote,Your brothers are nice. I don't think I met your mother. I think I met your dad. Does he have a big gray beard? They gave me and Justin soda and cake. There was a whole bunch of people at your house. I didn't know who they were.\n\nI also didn't know that Muslims take their shoes off in the house. Thank God they didn't make me take mine off. My stinky feet probably would have knocked everyone out cold. Why haven't you told anyone about talking to me in the library?she asks him.Did you think it was unimportant? You didn't think that I would remember? Or did you just totally forget yourself?Adnan says now that he does in fact remember seeing Asia in the library. The thing he remembers about it is so high school. Asia used to go out with Adnan's friend Justin. And Justin had confided that Asia was a \"proper young lady.\" In other words, Justin wasn't getting any.\n\nSo Adnan remembers thinking he would now get to tease Justin about seeing Asia with her new boyfriend. Maybe the new guy was getting lucky, ha, ha. Anyway, Rabia calls Asia up. It's been a year since she wrote the letters, but she agrees to meet.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she told me, that day after school I went to the public library. And Adnan was sitting at a computer, checking email or something. And I sat down next to him. We started chatting. And Adnan was a very popular boy in school. He was handsome and popular with the ladies.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So she was speaking to him. And her boyfriend shows up a little bit later with a friend. And she said her boyfriend was really angry at her, because he's like, why are you talking to him? You know, high school kids, why are you talking to him? Is he hitting on you?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she remembered very specifically that that day she went to her boyfriend's house with him, and they got snowed in. And it snowed really heavily that night. And she remembered that for the following two days, school was closed. So she had very specific details about why she remembered that day.\nSarah Koenig\nAsia wrote out an affidavit on the spot. In it, she says she and Adnan spoke for about 15 to 20 minutes while she was waiting for her boyfriend to give her a ride. Quote, \"We left around 2:40,\" unquote. Remember, Hae is supposed to be dead by 2:36. And then, the kicker-- \"No attorney has ever contacted me about January 13, 1999 and the above information.\"\n\nSo benefit of the doubt for a second-- maybe Adnan never actually showed the letters to Cristina Gutierrez, his attorney. Sure, he said he did, but who knows? Well, I know. Deep inside Gutierrez's notes on the case-- I have boxes and boxes of such stuff-- there's this in her handwriting. \"Asia plus boyfriend saw him in library 2:15 to 3:15.\"\n\nThen there's another note, dated July 13. It's more than four months after Adnan's arrest. This is written by one of Gutierrez's law clerks, who visited Adnan in jail. Quote, \"Asia McClain saw him in the library at 3:00. Asia boyfriend saw him too. Library may have cameras.\"\nWhy, oh, why was this person never heard from at trial-- a solid, non-crazy, detail-oriented alibi witness in a case that so sorely needed alibi witnesses? I can't ask Christina Gutierrez, because she died in 2004.\n\nSo I put that question to a few defense attorneys. And they said, well, alibi witnesses can be tricky, especially if it's just one person. Because then it becomes one person's word over another. A single witness like that can backfire under cross-examination. Or they might take the jury's focus away from the weaknesses in the state's case.\n\nSo there are conceivable strategic reasons why Christina Gutierrez might not have wanted to put Asia McClain on the stand. But what is inconceivable, they all said, is to not ever contact Asia McClain, to never make the call, never check it out, never find out if her story helps or hurts your case. That makes no sense whatsoever. That is not a strategy. That is a screw-up.\n\nWhen I first heard about the long-lost Asia letters and the lawyer's mistake, I thought, well, their fight is over, right? They've got an alibi witness who was never heard from. It's such a slam dunk. They're done.\n\nAdnan's family hired a new attorney, who filed a petition in court based on the Asia affidavit. His argument was that Adnan's trial could have turned out differently if Gutierrez had checked out Asia's story. And so Adnan should get some form of what's called post-conviction relief.\n\nThe new lawyer figures he'll get Asia to come to the hearing. She'll vouch for her story. By this time, Asia had finished school and moved away. He finds an address on the West Coast, tries calling, sending messages-- nothing. Finally, he writes a letter to her, gives it to a private investigator, who goes out to Asia's house in hopes of delivering it.\n\nAsia's fiance comes to the door, opens it part way, tells the investigator that she cannot speak to Asia, but that from what he knows of Adnan's case, Adnan is guilty and deserved the punishment he got. Later, the investigator gets a call from the fiance. \"We don't have to talk to you. Leave us alone.\"\n\nSo Adnan's lawyer calls off the search for Asia, figuring once a witness turns on you like that, it's too risky to keep pushing. And then at Adnan's hearing on the new petition, it comes out that Asia had done the very thing they dreaded. Asia had called one of the prosecutors in Adnan's case, a guy named Kevin Urick, and undermined her own statement. This is from a recording of the hearing. Mr. Urick is testifying on the witness stand.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Attorney\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Urick, how did you learn that the [INAUDIBLE] petition?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kevin Urick\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A young lady named Asia called me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Attorney\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And what did she say?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kevin Urick\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was concerned, because she was being asked questions about an affidavit she'd written back at the time of the trial. She told me that she'd only written it because she was getting pressure from the family, and she basically wrote it to please them and get them off her back.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what happened to her and why she would do this.\nSarah Koenig\nHere's Rabia again. She says it's not true that Asia was bullied into writing that statement 15 years ago. And she can't fathom why Asia would discredit her own statement like that.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don't know why. The affidavit was written voluntarily. I'm an attorney. I'm a licensed attorney. I work on homeland security. I have no reason to make something like this up. I didn't even know she existed until after the conviction.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So what do you think happened? Why would they have this sort of violent reaction to helping out Adnan now?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rabia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don't know. It was just really odd.\n\nSarah Koenig\nSo who knows what would have happened if Asia had shown up? Maybe it wouldn't have made a difference. After all, they had the original letters and the affidavit. That's all that should've mattered. But it didn't look good.\n\nIt would be natural for the judge to wonder, why can't the defense produce this Asia person? Why is she making this call to a prosecutor? I mean, anyone would wonder. I wondered. I wondered if maybe she was pressured into writing that affidavit. And I wondered if she was hiding something.\n\nLike maybe she'd lied in those 1999 letters. Maybe she didn't really see Adnan at the library that day and had just wanted to insert herself into something exciting. And maybe now that she was grown up, she wanted nothing to do with any of it.\n\nSo three, four months after I first sat down with Rabia, I had become fixated on finding Asia. I'm like a bloodhound on this thing. Because the whole case seemed to me to be teetering on her memories of that afternoon. I have to know if Adnan really was in the library at 2:36 PM.\n\nBecause if he was, library equals innocent. It's so maddeningly simple. And maybe I can crack it if I could just talk to Asia.\nI write her a long, gentle, pleading letter and send it off to an address I find online. I'm calling people who know her or who I think might know her. I'm checking the same loop of Facebook, MyLife, LinkedIn sites over and over, trawling for clues about where she might be or how she might think.\n\nIf you're wondering why I went so nuts on this story versus some other murder case, the best I can explain is this is the one that came to me. It wasn't halfway across the world or even next door. It came right to my lap. And if I could help get to the bottom of it, shouldn't I try?\n\nI start running down all the other information in Asia's 1999 letters. She mentioned there were security cameras inside the library. So my producer and I went to see the very nice manager there, Michelle Hamiel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was there a security system back in '99 that could've been checked at the time?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Michelle Hamiel\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Probably, yes. I'm going to say yes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OK. And what system was it?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Michelle Hamiel\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have no idea. [LAUGHING] It was an old system.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yeah. But you think probably video?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Michelle Hamiel\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was video. And that was part of set up. Every morning you put a videotape in.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were you guys recycling the videotapes?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Michelle Hamiel\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes. I think it ran for a week. So you had a Monday tape, a Tuesday tape, a Wednesday tape, and so forth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So even if, on the very day that Asia had written her first letter, Adnan's lawyer had run out to find the security tape, it probably would have been nonexistent by then. But what about the computer Adnan was supposedly using to check his email?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To use the computer, did people have to sign in, write their name down?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Michelle Hamiel\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They did.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And what was the system then?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Michelle Hamiel\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Piece of paper and pencil.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And those, by any chance, weren't logged meticulously and kept for 15 years, were they?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Michelle Hamiel\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No. [LAUGHING]\n\nSarah Koenig\nBummer. We got nothing. Then there was the mystery of Asia's boyfriend, Derek, and his friend Jerrod. All winter and spring, every time I went to Baltimore, I went to Derek's mom's house looking for him, and to Jerrod's window tinting business. And then finally--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All right, so you're Jerrod Johnson.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jerrod Johnson\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I am.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You don't know how excited we are to be talking to you. I've been looking for you for, like, four months.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jerrod Johnson\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What did I do?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You didn't do anything. But we were hoping maybe you remembered this moment. On January 13, 1999, do you have any memory, by any miracle, that you went to Woodlawn public library branch near Woodlawn High School to pick up Asia McClain with your friend Derek?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jerrod Johnson\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have no idea. Asia McClain. Is that a person or a book?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's a person.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jerrod Johnson\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No, no recollection of it.\n\nSarah Koenig\nScratch Jerrod. Derek was my last hope. Eventually I caught him at home. Considering I woke him up, he was exceedingly courteous. He showed me a photo of Asia and him all dressed up. They dated most of senior year.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What's up here?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Derek\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is our senior prom. Yeah.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You guys both look really beautiful.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Derek\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yeah. That's Asia, yeah.\n\nSarah Koenig\nBut Derek couldn't remember that day either-- shocking, I know. He used to pick Asia up from school almost every day back then, either from the library or from the front of the school. And he says he spoke to a lot of her friends just to be polite.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Derek\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it's very possible that I could have spoken to the gentleman and her on that day. But it's very hard to remember 15 years later. But it sounds like this definitely could have happened. I don't think Asia would-- Asia's not the type of person that would lie just to--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That's what I'm wondering.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Derek\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She's definitely not that type of person to get involved with a lie. She's not that type of person. So it seemed pretty credible to me.\n\nSarah Koenig\nOne day I get a call on my cellphone from a blocked number. You guessed it-- Asia. I wish I could say that my charming, persuasive letter is what prompted Asia to call. But the truth is, she never got my letter. I had the wrong address. But she was calling because I'd followed up weeks later with a one-line email. And she was responding to that, a little confused.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asia McClain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's just crazy. I mean, I have a couple minutes if you want to chat about it.\n\nSarah Koenig\nI recorded our conversation on the cell, which is why the sound quality is so bad. Sorry about that. Asia is now a 33-year-old stay-at-home mother. And she has not spent the last 15 years worrying about Adnan and whether he's guilty.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asia McClain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I trust the court system to do their due diligence. Because I was never questioned. I was never informed of anything pertaining to the case. I don't know why he was convicted.\n\nSarah Koenig\nAsia said she was spooked when the private investigator came to her house. I don't know if that's why she didn't testify at the hearing or why she made the call to the prosecutor. But she told me that when she got the knock at the door, quote, \"that was not cool.\" Because to her, if Adnan did do it, quote, \"the last thing you want is a murderer being pissed off at you, knowing where you live.\"\n\nBut she had a remarkably clear memory of what happened on January 13, 1999. She had an internship at the time, and so she got out of school much earlier than everyone else. Derek was supposed to come get her at the library along with Jerrod, but they were very late. She remembers seeing Adnan come in after Woodlawn let out for the day.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asia McClain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan came in. He sat at the table. And we weren't really close friends or anything like that, but we knew each other. And we chatted or whatever. And I can't remember.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think I must have asked him how he was doing or whatever, and he said fine. And he told me that him and Hae had broke up. And I was like, oh, well, that's a bummer. And I was like, what happened? And he was like, oh, well, she is seeing this other guy, some white dude.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he was pretty chill about it. He was just like, you know, well, if she doesn't want to be with me, then that's fine. I just wish the best for her-- that kind of attitude.\nSarah Koenig\nI'm not sure why Asia's memory of this interaction is so clear all these years later. My best guess is that, because she wrote it down at the time in those letters and then the affidavit, that the details somehow stuck.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do you remember what time you were talking, this would have happened in the library? Do you remember what time that conversation would have happened?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asia McClain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don't. Because I know school let out around 2:15. So it was probably around 2:30.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because you had said you got out of school earlier than other people. So were you there, were you at the library, before 2:15?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asia McClain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oh, yeah, I had been at the library for a few hours.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oh wow.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asia McClain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, I was pretty pissed when Derek showed up. And he asked me who Adnan was. That was teenager boy language. He's like, you know, who the hell is that?\nAnd I said, don't even start with me. Because you're a few hours late. Don't worry about who that is, you know? I remember that day, because that was the day that it snowed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were there snow days after that, do you remember?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asia McClain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I want to say there was, because I think that was like the first snow of the year. I wouldn't have even remembered if it hadn't have been for the snow. And the whole-- I just remember being so pissed about Derek being late and then getting snowed in at his house. And it was the first snow of that year.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The snow is important. Hae disappeared on a Wednesday. That night there was a huge ice storm, which is unusual in Maryland. It ended up being a state emergency. And school was closed for the rest of the week.\nAsia started asking me questions about the case. Wasn't there DNA evidence? And what exactly was Jay's part in the whole thing? She wasn't sure Adnan was guilty. She said things I've now heard from so many people since. He seemed like he cared about Hae. He didn't seem angry or upset. I thought there was more proof.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asia McClain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even that day, I didn't walk away thinking, oh, I just started something. Do you know what I mean? If you want to base his innocence off of his composure at that moment, I would say he's innocent. But I'm 32 years old now, and I know that there's people out there capable of heinous acts that can keep a calm demeanor, you know?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And I know that there are people who flip out on a moment's notice and do something that they regret for the rest of their lives. Even now, it would be nice if there was some technicality, something that would prove his innocence. Great, you know? One less evil person I've met in my life, you know?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I think, Asia, you might be that technicality. Do you see what I mean? If you're saying that you saw him on this day at that time, that means the state's timeline for their whole theory of the case doesn't make any sense.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asia McClain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's a possibility.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because they're saying he was in the car with her at the very time that you're saying, no, I saw him at the library, and we were talking. Do you know what I mean? That's exactly the window where they're saying she was murdered.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asia McClain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[SIGH]\n\nSarah Koenig\nIn case you couldn't hear that, it was a sigh. And I completely understand that sigh. That's how I feel a lot of the time. Because I talk to Adnan regularly, and he just doesn't seem like a murderer. A few minutes after I hung up with Asia, Adnan called on schedule.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hey, Sarah, how are you doing?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'm good. I'm good. So I was just talking to Asia McClain.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OK.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You don't sound very excited.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had a-- well, I really--\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was not the reaction I expected. I felt like I'd just interviewed an ivory-billed woodpecker. But when I told Adnan what Asia remembered, instead of being excited, Adnan said it was heartbreaking.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adnan Syed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I mean, on a personal level, I'm happy. Because, in a sense, I'm not making this up. And at least, if nothing else, it's kind of like, at least someone other than Rabia knows that this did take place.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anything that can kind of support what I'm saying to be the truth, that I didn't do this, is great. But from a legal perspective, it's like, I wish she would have came to this realization maybe like a year and a half ago, you know what I mean? Because it's kind of like, it's too late.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry, I definitely appreciate it. And I definitely kind of hear the elation in your voice. But now I feel like I punctured your balloon.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Koenig\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No, no, I totally see what you're saying. I hadn't thought about it in that way.\n\nSarah Koenig\nWhen I told Rabia I talked to Asia, she immediately burst into tears. Because they were all correct. It was too late. The judge ruled on Adnan's petition a few weeks before I spoke to Asia-- denied.\n\nThe judge wrote in his opinion that Christina Gutierrez's decision not to use Asia McClain as an alibi witness was strategic. After all, Asia's original letters didn't specify an exact time. And Gutierrez could've reasonably concluded that Asia was offering to lie in order to help Adnan.\n\nAnd finally, he wrote, Asia's letter contradicted Adnan's own alibi. Asia says she saw him at the public library, but Adnan said he was on the school campus the whole afternoon. Maybe the judge didn't understand that Woodlawn library is basically part of the campus. But anyway, Asia's story, then, is legally worthless. A witness who says she saw you at the exact moment when the state contends you were strangling a young woman in a car is worthless.\n\nA few days after I spoke to Asia, she wrote me an email. \"I've been thinking a lot about Adnan,\" she wrote.All this time I thought the courts proved it was Adnan that killed her. I thought he was where he deserved to be. Now I'm not so sure.\n\nHae was our friend, too. And it sucks feeling like you don't know who really killed your friend. Hae was the sweetest person ever. If he didn't kill Hae, we owe it to him to try to make that clear. And if he did kill her, then we need to put this to rest. I just hope that Adnan isn't some sick bastard just trying to manipulate his way out of jail.\nSarah Koenig\nI wrote back, \"Believe me, I'm on exactly the same page.\"\n\nComing up this season on Serial.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Male Speaker\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think that there are other people involved.

A long list of county families was confidently run over as sure of attending, and sanguine hopes were entertained that the Osbornes themselves would be there. The Edwards' invitation to the Watsons followed, of course. The Edwards were people of fortune, who lived in the town and kept their coach. The Watsons inhabited a village about three miles distant, were poor, and had no close carriage; and ever since there had been balls in the place, the former were accustomed to invite the latter to dress, dine, and sleep at their house on every monthly return throughout the winter. On the present occasion, as only two of Mr. Watson's children were at home, and one was always necessary as companion to himself, for he was sickly and had lost his wife, one only could profit by the kindness of their friends. Miss Emma Watson, who was very recently returned to her family from the care of an aunt who had brought her up, was to make her first public appearance in the neighbourhood, and her eldest sister, whose delight in a ball was not lessened by a ten years' enjoyment, had some merit in cheerfully undertaking to drive her and all her finery in the old chair to D. on the important morning.\n\nAs they splashed along the dirty lane, Miss Watson thus instructed and cautioned her inexperienced sister: --\n\n\"I dare say it will be a very good ball, and among so many officers you will hardly want partners. You will find Mrs. Edwards' maid very willing to help you, and I would advise you to ask Mary Edwards' opinion if you are at all at a loss, for she has a very good taste. If Mr. Edwards does not lose his money at cards, you will stay as late as you can wish for; if he does, he will hurry you home perhaps -- but you are sure of some comfortable soup. I hope you will be in good looks. I should not be surprised if you were to be thought one of the prettiest girls in the room; there is a great deal in novelty. Perhaps Tom Musgrave may take notice of you; but I would advise you by all means not to give him any encouragement. He generally pays attention to every new girl; but he is a great flirt, and never means anything serious.\"\n\n\"I think I have heard you speak of him before,\" said Emma; \"who is he?\"\n\n\"A young man of very good fortune, quite independent, and remarkably agreeable, -- a universal favourite wherever he goes. Most of the girls hereabout are in love with him, or have been. I believe I am the only one among them that have escaped with a whole heart; and yet I was the first he paid attention to when he came into this country six years ago; and very great attention did he pay me. Some people say that he has never seemed to like any girl so well since, though he is always behaving in a particular way to one or another.\"\n\"And how came your heart to be the only cold one?\" said Emma, smiling.\n\n\"There was a reason for that,\" replied Miss Watson, changing colour, -- \"I have not been very well used among them, Emma. I hope you will have better luck.\"\n\n\"Dear sister, I beg your pardon if I have unthinkingly given you pain.\"\n\n\"When first we knew Tom Musgrave,\" continued Miss Watson, without seeming to hear her, \"I was very much attached to a young man of the name of Purvis, a particular friend of Robert's, who used to be with us a great deal. Everybody thought it would have been a match.\"\n\nA sigh accompanied these words, which Emma respected in silence; but her sister after a short pause went on.\n\n\"You will naturally ask why it did not take place, and why he is married to another woman, while I am still single. But you must ask her, not me, -- you must ask Penelope. Yes, Emma, Penelope was at the bottom of it all. She thinks everything fair for a husband. I trusted her; she set him against me, with a view of gaining him herself, and it ended in his discontinuing his visits, and soon after marrying somebody else. Penelope makes light of her conduct, but I think such treachery very bad. It has been the ruin of my happiness. I shall never love any man as I loved Purvis. I do not think Tom Musgrave should be named with him in the same day.\"\n\n\"You quite shock me by what you say of Penelope,\" said Emma. \"Could a sister do such a thing? Rivalry, treachery between sisters! I shall be afraid of being acquainted with her. But I hope it was not so; appearances were against her.\"\n\n\"You do not know Penelope. There is nothing she would not do to get married. She would as good as tell you so herself. Do not trust her with any secrets of your own, take warning by me, do not trust her; she has her good qualities, but she has no faith, no honour, no scruples, if she can promote her own advantage. I wish with all my heart she was well married. I declare I had rather have her well married than myself.\"\n\n\"Than yourself! yes, I can suppose so. A heart wounded like yours can have little inclination for matrimony.\"\n\n\"Not much indeed -- but you know we must marry. I could do very well single for my own part; a little company, and a pleasant ball now and then, would be enough for me, if one could be young forever; but my father cannot provide for us, and it is very bad to grow old and be poor and laughed at. I have lost Purvis, it is true; but very few people marry their first loves. I should not refuse a man because he was not Purvis. Not that I can ever quite forgive Penelope.\"\n\nEmma shook her head in acquiescence.\n\n\"Penelope, however, has had her troubles,\" continued Miss Watson. \"She was sadly disappointed in Tom Musgrave, who afterwards transferred his attentions from me to her, and whom she was very fond of; but he never means anything serious, and when he had trifled with her long enough, he began to slight her for Margaret, and poor Penelope was very wretched. And since then she has been trying to make some match at Chichester, -- she won't tell us with whom; but I believe it is a rich old Dr. Harding, uncle to the friend she goes to see; and she has taken a vast deal of trouble about him, and given up a great deal of time to no purpose as yet. When she went away the other day, she said it should be the last time. I suppose you did not know what her particular business was at Chichester, nor guess at the object which could take her away from Stanton just as you were coming home after so many years' absence.\"\n\n\"No indeed, I had not the smallest suspicion of it. I considered her engagement to Mrs. Shaw just at that time as very unfortunate for me. I had hoped to find all my sisters at home, to be able to make an immediate friend of each.\"\n\"I suspect the Doctor to have had an attack of the asthma, and that she was hurried away on that account. The Shaws are quite on her side, -- at least, I believe so; but she tells me nothing. She professes to keep her own counsel; she says, and truly enough, that `Too many cooks spoil the broth.'\"\n\n\"I am sorry for her anxieties,\" said Emma; \"but I do not like her plans or her opinions. I shall be afraid of her. She must have too masculine and bold a temper. To be so bent on marriage, to pursue a man merely for the sake of situation, is a sort of thing that shocks me; I cannot understand it. Poverty is a great evil; but to a woman of education and feeling it ought not, it cannot be the greatest. I would rather be teacher at a school (and I can think of nothing worse) than marry a man I did not like.\"\n\n\"I would rather do anything than be teacher at a school,\" said her sister. \"I have been at school, Emma, and know what a life they lead; you never have. I should not like marrying a disagreeable man any more than yourself; but I do not think there are many very disagreeable men; I think I could like any good-humoured man with a comfortable income. I suppose my aunt brought you up to be rather refined.\"\n\n\"Indeed I do not know. My conduct must tell you how I have been brought up. I am no judge of it myself. I cannot compare my aunt's method with any other person's, because I know no other.\"\n\n\"But I can see in a great many things that you are very refined. I have observed it ever since you came home, and I am afraid it will not be for your happiness. Penelope will laugh at you very much.\"\n\n\"That will not be for my happiness, I an sure. If my opinions are wrong, I must correct them; if they are above my situation, I must endeavour to conceal them; but I doubt whether ridicule -- Has Penelope much wit?\"\n\n\"Yes; she has great spirits, and never cares what she says.\"\n\n\"Margaret is more gentle, I imagine?\"\n\n\"Yes; especially in company. She is all gentleness and mildness when anybody is by; but she is a little fretful and perverse among ourselves. Poor creature! She is possessed with the notion of Tom Musgrave's being more seriously in love with her than he ever was with anybody else, and is always expecting him to come to the point. This is the second time within this twelvemonth that she has gone to spend a month with Robert and Jane on purpose to egg him on by her absence; but I am sure she is mistaken, and that he will no more follow her to Croydon now than he did last March. He will never marry unless he can marry somebody very great, -- Miss Osborne, perhaps, or something in that style.\"\n\n\"Your account of this Tom Musgrave, Elizabeth, gives me very little inclination for his acquaintance.\"\n\n\"You are afraid of him; I do not wonder at you.\"\n\n\"No, indeed; I dislike and despise him.\"\n\n\"Dislike and despise Tom Musgrave! No, that you never can. I defy you not to be delighted with him if he takes notice of you. I hope he will dance with you; and I dare say he will, unless the Osbornes come with a large party, and then he will not speak to anybody else.\"\n\"He seems to have most engaging manners!\" said Emma. \"Well, we shall see how irresistible Mr. Tom Musgrave and I find each other. I suppose I shall know him as soon as I enter the ball-room; he must carry some of his charm in his face.\"\n\n\"You will not find him in the ball-room, I can tell you; you will go early, that Mrs. Edwards may get a good place by the fire, and he never comes till late; if the Osbornes are coming, he will wait in the passage and come in with them. I should like to look in upon you, Emma. If it was but a good day with my father, I would wrap myself up, and James should drive me over as soon as I had made tea for him; and I should be with you by the time the dancing began.\"\n\n\"What! Would you come late at night in this chair?\"\n\n\"To be sure I would. There, I said you were very refined, and that's an instance of it.\"\n\nEmma for a moment made no answer. At last she said, --\n\n\"I wish, Elizabeth, you had not made a point of my going to this ball; I wish you were going instead of me. Your pleasure would be greater than mine. I am a stranger here, and know nobody but the Edwardses; my enjoyment, therefore, must be very doubtful. Yours, among all your acquaintance, would be certain. It is not too late to change. Very little apology could be requisite to the Edwardses, who must be more glad of your company than of mine, and I should most readily return to my father; and should not be at all afraid to drive this quiet old creature home. Your clothes I would undertake to find means of sending to you.\"\n\n\"My dearest Emma,\" cried Elizabeth, warmly, \"do you think I would do such a thing? Not for the universe! But I shall never forget your good-nature in proposing it. You must have a sweet temper indeed! I never met with anything like it! And would you really give up the ball that I might be able to go to it? Believe me, Emma, I am not so selfish as that comes to. No; though I am nine years older than you are, I would not be the means of keeping you from being seen. You are very pretty, and it would be very hard that you should not have as fair a chance as we have all had to make your fortune. No, Emma, whoever stays at home this winter, it sha'n't be you. I am sure I should never have forgiven the person who kept me from a ball at nineteen.\"\n\nEmma expressed her gratitude, and for a few minutes they jogged on in silence. Elizabeth first spoke: --\n\n\"You will take notice who Mary Edwards dances with?\"\n\n\"I will remember her partners, if I can; but you know they will be all strangers to me.\"\n\n\"Only observe whether she dances with Captain Hunter more than once, -- I have my fears in that quarter. Not that her father or mother like officers; but if she does, you know, it is all over with poor Sam. And I have promised to write him word who she dances with.\"\n\n\"Is Sam attached to Miss Edwards?\"\n\n\"Did not you know that?\"\n\n\"How should I know it? How should I know in Shropshire what is passing of that nature in Surrey? It is not likely that circumstances of such delicacy should have made any part of the scanty communication which passed between you and me for the last fourteen years.\"\n\n\"I wonder I never mentioned it when I wrote. Since you have been at home, I have been so busy with my poor father and our great wash that I have had no leisure to tell you anything; but, indeed, I concluded you knew it all. He has been very much in love with her these two years, and it is a great disappointment to him that he cannot always get away to our balls; but Mr. Curtis won't often spare him, and just now it is a sickly time at Guildford.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose Miss Edwards inclined to like him?\"\n\n\"I am afraid not: you know she is an only child, and will have at least ten thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"But still she may like our brother.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! The Edwards look much higher. Her father and mother would never consent to it. Sam is only a surgeon, you know. Sometimes I think she does like him. But Mary Edwards is rather prim and reserved; I do not always know what she would be at.\"\n\n\"Unless Sam feels on sure grounds with the lady herself, it seems a pity to me that he should be encouraged to think of her at all.\"\n\n\"A young man must think of somebody,\" said Elizabeth, \"and why should not he be as lucky as Robert, who has got a good wife and six thousand pounds?\"\n\n\"We must not all expect to be individually lucky,\" replied Emma. \"The luck of one member of a family is luck to all.\"\n\n\"Mine is all to come, I am sure,\" said Elizabeth, giving another sigh to the remembrance of Purvis. \"I have been unlucky enough; and I cannot say much for you, as my aunt married again so foolishly. Well, you will have a good ball, I daresay. The next turning will bring us to the turnpike: you may see the church-tower over the hedge, and the White Hart is close by it. I shall long to know what you think of Tom Musgrave.\"\n\nSuch were the last audible sounds of Miss Watson's voice, before they passed through the turnpike-gate, and entered on the pitching of the town, the jumbling and noise of which made farther conversation most thoroughly undesirable. The old mare trotted heavily on, wanting no direction of the reins to take the right turning, and making only one blunder, in proposing to stop at the milliner's before she drew up towards Mr. Edwards' door. Mr. Edwards lived in the best house in the street, and the best in the place, if Mr. Tomlinson, the banker, might be indulged in calling his newly erected house at the end of the town, with a shrubbery and sweep, in the country.\n\nMr. Edwards' house was higher than most of its neighbours, with four windows on each side the door, the windows guarded by posts and chains, and the door approached by a flight of stone steps.\n\n\"Here we are,\" said Elizabeth, as the carriage ceased moving, \"safely arrived, and by the market clock we have been only five-and-thirty minutes coming; which I think is doing pretty well, though it would be nothing for Penelope. Is not it a nice town? The Edwards have a noble house, you see, and they live quite in style. The door will be opened by a man in livery, with a powdered head, I can tell you.\"\n\nEmma had seen the Edwardses only one morning at Stanton; they were therefore all but strangers to her; and though her spirits were by no means insensible to the expected joys of the evening, she felt a little uncomfortable in the thought of all that was to precede them. Her conversation with Elizabeth, too, giving her some very unpleasant feelings with respect to her own family, had made her more open to disagreeable impressions from any other cause, and increased her sense of the awkwardness of rushing into intimacy on so slight an acquaintance.\n\nThere was nothing in the manner of Mrs. or Miss Edwards to give immediate change to these ideas. The mother, though a very friendly woman, had a reserved air, and a great deal of formal civility; and the daughter, a genteel-looking girl of twenty-two, with her hair in papers, seemed very naturally to have caught something of the style of her mother, who had brought her up. Emma was soon left to know what they could be, by Elizabeth's being obliged to hurry away; and some very languid remarks on the probable brilliancy of the ball were all that broke, at intervals, a silence of half an hour, before they were joined by the master of the house. Mr. Edwards had a much easier and more communicative air than the ladies of the family; he was fresh from the street, and he came ready to tell whatever might interest. After a cordial reception of Emma, he turned to his daughter with, --\n\n\"Well, Mary, I bring you good news: the Osbornes will certainly be at the ball tonight. Horses for two carriages are ordered from the White Hart to be at Osborne Castle by nine.\"\n\n\"I am glad of it,\" observed Mrs. Edwards, \"because their coming gives a credit to our assembly. The Osbornes being known to have been at the first ball, will dispose a great many people to attend the second. It is more than they deserve; for in fact, they add nothing to the pleasure of the evening: they come so late and go so early; but great people have always their charm.\"\n\nMr. Edwards proceeded to relate every other little article of news which his morning's lounge had supplied him with, and they chatted with greater briskness, till Mrs. Edwards' moment for dressing arrived, and the young ladies were carefully recommended to lose no time. Emma was shown to a very comfortable apartment, and as soon as Mrs. Edwards' civilities could leave her to herself, the happy occupation, the first bliss of a ball, began. The girls, dressing in some measure together, grew unavoidably better acquainted. Emma found in Miss Edwards the show of good sense, a modest unpretending mind, and a great wish of obliging; and when they returned to the parlour where Mrs. Edwards was sitting, respectably attired in one of the two satin gowns which went through the winter, and a new cap from the milliner's, they entered it with much easier feelings and more natural smiles than they had taken away. Their dress was now to be examined: Mrs. Edwards acknowledged herself too old-fashioned to approve of every modern extravagance, however sanctioned; and though complacently viewing her daughter's good looks, would give but a qualified admiration; and Mr. Edwards, not less satisfied with Mary, paid some compliments of good-humoured gallantry to Emma at her expense. The discussion led to more intimate remarks, and Miss Edwards gently asked Emma if she were not often reckoned very like her youngest brother. Emma thought she could perceive a faint blush accompany the question, and there seemed something still more suspicious in the manner in which Mr. Edwards took up the subject.\n\n\"You are paying Miss Emma no great compliment, I think, Mary,\" said he, hastily. \"Mr. Sam Watson is a very good sort of young man, and I dare say a very clever surgeon; but his complexion has been rather too much exposed to all weathers to make a likeness to him very flattering.\"\n\nMary apologised, in some confusion, --\n\n\"She had not thought a strong likeness at all incompatible with very different degrees of beauty. There might be resemblance in countenance, and the complexion and even the features be very unlike.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of my brother's beauty,\" said Emma, \"for I have not seen him since he was seven years old; but my father reckons us alike.\"\n\n\"Mr. Watson!\" cried Mr. Edwards; \"well, you astonish me. There is not the least likeness in the world; your brother's eyes are grey, yours are brown; he has a long face and a wide mouth. My dear, do you perceive the least resemblance?\"\n\n\"Not the least. Miss Emma Watson puts me very much in mind of her eldest sister, and sometimes I see a look of Miss Penelope, and once or twice there has been a glance of Mr. Robert, but I cannot perceive any likeness to Mr. Samuel.\"\n\n\"I see the likeness between her and Miss Watson,\" replied Mr. Edwards, \"very strongly, but I am not sensible of the others. I do not much think she is like any of the family but Miss Watson; but I am very sure there is no resemblance between her and Sam.\"\n\nThis matter was settled, and they went to dinner.\n\n\"Your father, Miss Emma, is one of my oldest friends,\" said Mr. Edwards, as he helped her to wine, when they were drawn round the fire to enjoy their dessert. \"We must drink to his better health. It is a great concern to me, I assure you, that he should be such an invalid. I know nobody who likes a game of cards, in a social way, better than he does, and very few people that play a fairer rubber. It is a thousand pities that he should be so deprived of the pleasure. For now we have a quiet little Whist Club, that meets three times a week at the White Hart; and if he could but have his health, how much he would enjoy it!\"\n\n\"I dare say he would, sir; and I wish, with all my heart, he were equal to it.\"\n\n\"Your club would be better fitted for an invalid,\" said Mrs. Edwards, \"if you did not keep it up so late.\"\n\nThis was an old grievance.\n\n\"So late, my dear! What are you talking of?\" cried the husband, with sturdy pleasantry. \"We are always at home before midnight. They would laugh at Osborne Castle to hear you call that late; they are but just rising from dinner at midnight.\"\n\n\"That is nothing to the purpose,\" retorted the lady, calmly. \"The Osbornes are to be no rule for us. You had better meet every night, and break up two hours sooner.\"\n\nSo far the subject was very often carried; but Mr. and Mrs. Edwards were so wise as never to pass that point; and Mr. Edwards now turned to something else. He had lived long enough in the idleness of a town to become a little of a gossip, and having some anxiety to know more of the circumstances of his young guest than had yet reached him, he began with, --\n\n\"I think, Miss Emma, I remember your aunt very well, about thirty years ago; I am pretty sure I danced with her in the old rooms at Bath, the year before I married. She was a very fine woman then; but like other people, I suppose, she is grown somewhat older since that time. I hope she is likely to be happy in her second choice.\"\n\n\"I hope so; I believe so, sir,\" said Emma, in some agitation.\n\n\"Mr. Turner had not been dead a great while, I think?\"\n\n\"About two years, sir.\"\n\n\"I forget what her name is now.\"\n\n\"O'Brien.\"\n\n\"Irish! ah, I remember; and she is gone to settle in Ireland. I do wonder that you should not wish to go with her into that country, Miss Emma; but it must be a great deprivation to her, poor lady!, after bringing you up like a child of her own.\"\n\n\"I was not so ungrateful, sir,\" said Emma, warmly, \"as to wish to be anywhere but with her. It did not suit them, it did not suit Captain O'Brien that I should be of the party.\"\n\n\"Captain!\" repeated Mrs. Edwards. \"The gentleman is in the army then?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Aye, there is nothing like your officers for captivating the ladies, young or old. There is no resisting a cockade, my dear.\"\n\n\"I hope there is,\" said Mrs. Edwards, gravely, with a quick glance at her daughter; and Emma had just recovered from her own perturbation in time to see a blush on Miss Edwards' cheek, and in remembering what Elizabeth had said of Captain Hunter, to wonder and waver between his influence and her brother's.\n\n\"Elderly ladies should be careful how they make a second choice,\" observed Mr. Edwards.\n\n\"Carefulness -- discretion should not be confined to elderly ladies or to a second choice,\" added his wife. \"They are quite as necessary to young ladies in their first.\"\n\n\"Rather more so, my dear,\" replied he; \"because young ladies are likely to feel the effects of it longer. When an old lady plays the fool, it is not in the course of nature that she should suffer from it many years.\"\n\nEmma drew her hand across her eyes; and Mrs. Edwards, on perceiving it, changed the subject to one of less anxiety to all.\n\nWith nothing to do but to expect the hour of setting off, the afternoon was long to the two young ladies; and though Miss Edwards was rather discomposed at the very early hour which her mother always fixed for going, that early hour itself was watched for with some eagerness.\n\nThe entrance of the tea-things at seven o'clock was some relief; and luckily Mr. and Mrs. Edwards always drank a dish extraordinary and ate an additional muffin when they were going to sit up late, which lengthened the ceremony almost to the wished-for moment.\n\nAt a little before eight, the Tomlinsons' carriage was heard to go by -- which was the constant signal for Mrs. Edwards to order hers to the door; and in a very few minutes the party were transported from the quiet and warmth of a snug parlour to the bustle, noise, and draughts of air of the broad entrance passage of an inn. Mrs. Edwards, carefully guarding her own dress, while she attended with yet greater solicitude to the proper security of her young charges' shoulders and throats, led the way up the wide staircase, while no sound of a ball but the first scrape of one violin blessed the ears of her followers; and Miss Edwards, on hazarding the anxious inquiry of whether there were many people come yet, was told by the waiter, as she knew she should, that \"Mr. Tomlinson's family were in the room.\"\n\nIn passing along a short gallery to the assembly-room, brilliant in lights before them, they were accosted by a young man in a morning-dress and boots, who was standing in the doorway of a bed-chamber, apparently on purpose to see them go by.\n\n\"Ah! Mrs. Edwards, how do you do? How do you do, Miss Edwards?\" he cried, with an easy air. \"You are determined to be in good time, I see, as usual. The candles are but this moment lit.\"\n\n\"I like to get a good seat by the fire, you know, Mr. Musgrave,\" replied Mrs. Edwards.\n\n\"I am this moment going to dress,\" said he. \"I am waiting for my stupid fellow. We shall have a famous ball. The Osbornes are certainly coming; you may depend upon that, for I was with Lord Osborne this morning.\"\n\nThe party passed on. Mrs. Edwards' satin gown swept along the clean floor of the ball-room to the fireplace at the upper end, where one party only were formally seated, while three or four officers were lounging together, passing in and out from the adjoining card-room. A very stiff meeting between these near neighbours ensued; and as soon as they were all duly placed again, Emma, in the low whisper which became the solemn scene, said to Miss Edwards, --\n\n\"The gentleman we passed in the passage was Mr. Musgrave, then; he is reckoned remarkably agreeable, I understand?\"\n\nMiss Edwards answered hesitatingly, \"Yes; he is very much liked by many people; but we are not very intimate.\"\n\n\"He is rich, is not he?\"\n\n\"He has about eight or nine hundred pounds a year, I believe. He came into possession of it when he was very young, and my father and mother think it has given him rather an unsettled turn. He is no favourite with them.\"\n\nThe cold and empty appearance of the room and the demure air of the small cluster of females at one end of it, began soon to give way. The inspiriting sound of other carriages was heard, and continual accessions of portly chaperons and strings of smartly-dressed girls were received, with now and then a fresh gentleman straggler, who, if not enough in love to station himself near any fair creature, seemed glad to escape into the card-room.\n\nAmong the increasing number of military men, one now made his way to Miss Edwards with an air of empressement which decidedly said to her companion, \"I am Captain Hunter\"; and Emma, who could not but watch her at such a moment, saw her looking rather distressed, but by no means displeased, and heard an engagement formed for the two first dances, which made her think her brother Sam's a hopeless case.\n\nEmma in the meanwhile was not unobserved or unadmired herself. A new face, and a very pretty one, could not be slighted. Her name was whispered from one party to another; and no sooner had the signal been given by the orchestra's striking up a favourite air, which seemed to call the young to their duty and people the centre of the room, than she found herself engaged to dance with a brother officer, introduced by Captain Hunter.\n\nEmma Watson was not more than of the middle height, well made and plump, with an air of healthy vigour. Her skin was very brown, but clear, smooth, and glowing, which, with a lively eye, a sweet smile, and an open countenance, gave beauty to attract, and expression to make that beauty improve on acquaintance. Having no reason to be dissatisfied with her partner, the evening began very pleasantly to her, and her feelings perfectly coincided with the reiterated observation of others, that it was an excellent ball. The two first dances were not quite over when the returning sound of carriages after a long interruption called general notice, and \"The Osbornes are coming! The Osbornes are coming!\" was repeated round the room. After some minutes of extraordinary bustle without and watchful curiosity within, the important party, preceded by the attentive master of the inn to open a door which was never shut, made their appearance. They consisted of Lady Osborne; her son, Lord Osborne; her daughter, Miss Osborne; Miss Carr, her daughter's friend; Mr. Howard, formerly tutor to Lord Osborne, now clergyman of the parish in which the castle stood; Mrs. Blake, a widow sister who lived with him; her son, a fine boy of ten years old; and Mr. Tom Musgrave, who probably, imprisoned within his own room, had been listening in bitter impatience to the sound of the music for the last half-hour. In their progress up the room, they paused almost immediately behind Emma to receive the compliments of some acquaintance; and she heard Lady Osborne observe that they had made a point of coming early for the gratification of Mrs. Blake's little boy, who was uncommonly fond of dancing. Emma looked at them all as they passed, but chiefly and with most interest on Tom Musgrave, who was certainly a genteel, good-looking young man. Of the females, Lady Osborne had by much the finest person; though nearly fifty, she was very handsome, and had all the dignity of rank.\n\nLord Osborne was a very fine young man; but there was an air of coldness, of carelessness, even of awkwardness about him, which seemed to speak him out of his element in a ball-room. He came, in fact, only because it was judged expedient for him to please the borough; he was not fond of women's company, and he never danced. Mr. Howard was an agreeable-looking man, a little more than thirty.\n\nAt the conclusion of the two dances, Emma found herself, she knew not how, seated amongst the Osborne set; and she was immediately struck with the fine countenance and animated gestures of the little boy, as he was standing before his mother, wondering when they should begin.\n\n\"You will not be surprised at Charles' impatience,\" said Mrs. Blake, a lively, pleasant-looking little woman of five or six and thirty, to a lady who was standing near her, \"when you know what a partner he is to have. Miss Osborne has been so very kind as to promise to dance the two first dances with him.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! we have been engaged this week,\" cried the boy, \"and we are to dance down every couple.\"\n\nOn the other side of Emma, Miss Osborne, Miss Carr, and a party of young men were standing engaged in very lively consultation; and soon afterwards she saw the smartest officer of the set walking off to the orchestra to order the dance, while Miss Osborne, passing before her to her little expecting partner, hastily said: \"Charles, I beg your pardon for not keeping my engagement, but I am going to dance these two dances with Colonel Beresford. I know you will excuse me, and I will certainly dance with you after tea\"; and without staying for an answer, she turned again to Miss Carr, and in another minute was led by Colonel Beresford to begin the set. If the poor little boy's face had in its happiness been interesting to Emma, it was infinitely more so under this sudden reverse; he stood the picture of disappointment, with crimsoned cheeks, quivering lips, and eyes bent on the floor. His mother, stifling her own mortification, tried to soothe his with the prospect of Miss Osborne's second promise; but though he contrived to utter, with an effort of boyish bravery, \"Oh, I do not mind it!\" it was very evident, by the unceasing agitation of his features, that he minded it as much as ever.\n\nEmma did not think or reflect; she felt and acted. \"I shall be very happy to dance with you, sir, if you like it,\" said she, holding out her hand with the most unaffected good-humour. The boy, in one moment restored to all his first delight, looked joyfully at his mother; and stepping forwards with an honest and simple \"Thank you, ma'am,\" was instantly ready to attend his new acquaintance. The thankfulness of Mrs. Blake was more diffuse; with a look most expressive of unexpected pleasure and lively gratitude, she turned to her neighbour with repeated and fervent acknowledgments of so great and condescending a kindness to her boy. Emma, with perfect truth, could assure her that she could not be giving greater pleasure than she felt herself; and Charles being provided with his gloves and charged to keep them on, they joined the set which was now rapidly forming, with nearly equal complacency. It was a partnership which could not be noticed without surprise. It gained her a broad stare from Miss Osborne and Miss Carr as they passed her in the dance. \"Upon my word, Charles, you are in luck,\" said the former, as she turned him; \"you have got a better partner than me\"; to which the happy Charles answered \"Yes.\"\n\nTom Musgrave, who was dancing with Miss Carr, gave her many inquisitive glances; and after a time Lord Osborne himself came, and under pretence of talking to Charles, stood to look at his partner. Though rather distressed by such observation, Emma could not repent what she had done, so happy had it made both the boy and his mother; the latter of whom was continually making opportunities of addressing her with the warmest civility. Her little partner, she found, though bent chiefly on dancing, was not unwilling to speak, when her questions or remarks gave him anything to say; and she learnt, by a sort of inevitable inquiry, that he had two brothers and a sister, that they and their mamma all lived with his uncle at Wickstead, that his uncle taught him Latin, that he was very fond of riding, and had a horse of his own given him by Lord Osborne; and that he had been out once already with Lord Osborne's hounds.\n\nAt the end of these dances, Emma found they were to drink tea; Miss Edwards gave her a caution to be at hand, in a manner which convinced her of Mrs. Edwards' holding it very important to have them both close to her when she moved into the tea-room; and Emma was accordingly on the alert to gain her proper station. It was always the pleasure of the company to have a little bustle and crowd when they adjourned for refreshment. The tea-room was a small room within the card-room; and in passing through the latter, where the passage was straitened by tables, Mrs. Edwards and her party were for a few moments hemmed in. It happened close by Lady Osborne's cassino table; Mr. Howard, who belonged to it, spoke to his nephew; and Emma, on perceiving herself the object of attention both to Lady Osborne and him, had just turned away her eyes in time to avoid seeming to hear her young companion delightedly whisper aloud, \"Oh, uncle! do look at my partner; she is so pretty!\" As they were immediately in motion again, however, Charles was hurried off without being able to receive his uncle's suffrage. On entering the tea-room, in which two long tables were prepared, Lord Osborne was to be seen quite alone at the end of one, as if retreating as far as he could from the ball, to enjoy his own thoughts and gape without restraint. Charles instantly pointed him out to Emma. \"There's Lord Osborne; let you and I go and sit by him.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Emma, laughing; \"you must sit with my friends.\"\n\nCharles was now free enough to hazard a few questions in his turn. \"What o'clock was it?\"\n\n\"Eleven.\"\n\n\"Eleven! and I am not at all sleepy. Mamma said I should be asleep before ten. Do you think Miss Osborne will keep her word with me, when tea is over?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! I suppose so\"; though she felt that she had no better reason to give than that Miss Osborne had not kept it before.\n\n\"When shall you come to Osborne Castle?\"\n\n\"Never, probably. I am not acquainted with the family.\"\n\n\"But you may come to Wickstead and see mamma, and she can take you to the castle. There is a monstrous curious stuffed fox there, and a badger; anybody would think they were alive. It is a pity you should not see them.\"\n\nOn rising from tea, there was again a scramble for the pleasure of being first out of the room, which happened to be increased by one or two of the card-parties having just broken up, and the players being disposed to move exactly the different way. Among these was Mr. Howard, his sister leaning on his arm; and no sooner were they within reach of Emma, than Mrs Blake, calling her notice by a friendly touch, said, \"Your goodness to Charles, my dear Miss Watson, brings all his family upon you. Give me leave to introduce my brother, Mr. Howard.\" Emma curtsied, the gentleman bowed, made a hasty request for the honour of her hand in the two next dances, to which as hasty an affirmative was given, and they were immediately impelled in opposite directions. Emma was very well pleased with the circumstance; there was a quietly cheerful, gentlemanlike air in Mr. Howard which suited her; and in a few minutes afterwards the value of her engagement increased, when, as she was sitting in the card-room, somewhat screened by a door, she heard Lord Osborne, who was lounging on a vacant table near her, call Tom Musgrave towards him and say, \"Why do not you dance with that beautiful Emma Watson? I want you to dance with her, and I will come and stand by you.\"\n\n\"I was determining on it this very moment, my lord; I'll be introduced and dance with her directly.\"\n\n\"Aye, do; and if you find she does not want much talking to, you may introduce me by and by.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord; if she is like her sisters, she will only want to be listened to. I will go this moment. I shall find her in the tea-room. That stiff old Mrs. Edwards has never done tea.\"\n\nAway he went, Lord Osborne after him; and Emma lost no time in hurrying from her corner exactly the other way, forgetting in her haste that she left Mrs. Edwards behind.\n\n\"We had quite lost you,\" said Mrs. Edwards, who followed her with Mary in less than five minutes. \"If you prefer this room to the other, there is no reason why you should not be here; but we had better all be together.\"\n\nEmma was saved the trouble of apologizing, by their being joined at the moment by Tom Musgrave, who requesting Mrs. Edwards aloud to do him the honour of presenting him to Miss Emma Watson, left that good lady without any choice in the business, but that of testifying by the coldness of her manner that she did it unwillingly. The honour of dancing with her was solicited without loss of time; and Emma, however she might like to be thought a beautiful girl by lord or commoner, was so little disposed to favour Tom Musgrave himself that she had considerable satisfaction in avowing her previous engagement. He was evidently surprised and discomposed. The style of her last partner had probably led him to believe her not overpowered with applications.\n\n\"My little friend Charles Blake,\" he cried, \"must not expect to engross you the whole evening. We can never suffer this. It is against the rules of the assembly, and I am sure it will never be patronised by our good friend here, Mrs. Edwards; she is by much too nice a judge of decorum to give her license to such a dangerous particularity --\"\n\n\"I am not going to dance with Master Blake, sir!\"\n\nThe gentleman, a little disconcerted, could only hope he might be fortunate another time, and seeming unwilling to leave her, though his friend Lord Osborne was waiting in the doorway for the result, as Emma with some amusement perceived, he began to make civil inquiries after her family.\n\n\"How comes it that we have not the pleasure of seeing your sisters here this evening? Our assemblies have been used to be so well treated by them that we do not know how to take this neglect.\"\n\n\"My eldest sister is the only one at home, and she could not leave my father.\"\n\n\"Miss Watson the only one at home! You astonish me! It seems but the day before yesterday that I saw them all three in this town. But I am afraid I have been a very sad neighbour of late. I hear dreadful complaints of my negligence wherever I go, and I confess it is a shameful length of time since I was at Stanton. But I shall now endeavour to make myself amends for the past.\"\n\nEmma's calm courtesy in reply must have struck him as very unlike the encouraging warmth he had been used to receive from her sisters, and gave him probably the novel sensation of doubting his own influence, and of wishing for more attention than she bestowed. The dancing now recommenced; Miss Carr being impatient to call, everybody was required to stand up; and Tom Musgrave's curiosity was appeased on seeing Mr. Howard come forward and claim Emma's hand.\n\n\"That will do as well for me,\" was Lord Osborne's remark, when his friend carried him the news, and he was continually at Howard's elbow during the two dances.\n\nThe frequency of his appearance there was the only unpleasant part of the engagement, the only objection she could make to Mr. Howard. In himself, she thought him as agreeable as he looked; though chatting on the commonest topics, he had a sensible, unaffected way of expressing himself, which made them all worth hearing, and she only regretted that he had not been able to make his pupil's manners as unexceptionable as his own. The two dances seemed very short, and she had her partner's authority for considering them so. At their conclusion the Osbornes and their train were all on the move.\n\n\"We are off at last,\" said his lordship to Tom. \"How much longer do you stay in this heavenly place -- till sunrise?\"\n\n\"No, faith! my lord; I have had quite enough of it. I assure you, I shall not show myself here again when I have had the honour of attending Lady Osborne to her carriage. I shall retreat in as much secrecy as possible to the most remote corner of the house, where I shall order a barrel of oysters, and be famously snug.\"\n\n\"Let me see you soon at the castle, and bring me word how she looks by daylight.\"\n\nEmma and Mrs. Blake parted as old acquaintance, and Charles shook her by the hand, and wished her \"good-bye\" at least a dozen times. From Miss Osborne and Miss Carr she received something like a jerking curtsey as they passed her; even Lady Osborne gave her a look of complacency, and his lordship actually came back, after the others were out of the room, to \"beg her pardon,\" and look in the window-seat behind her for the gloves which were visibly compressed in his hand. As Tom Musgrave was seen no more, we may suppose his plan to have succeeded, and imagine him mortifying with his barrel of oysters in dreary solitude, or gladly assisting the landlady in her bar to make fresh negus for the happy dancers above. Emma could not help missing the party by whom she had been, though in some respects unpleasantly, distinguished; and the two dances which followed and concluded the ball were rather flat in comparison with the others. Mr. Edwards having played with good luck, they were some of the last in the room.\n\n\"Here we are back again, I declare,\" said Emma, sorrowfully, as she walked into the dining-room, where the table was prepared, and the neat upper maid was lighting the candles. \"My dear Miss Edwards, how soon it is at an end! I wish it could all come over again.\"\n\nA great deal of kind pleasure was expressed in her having enjoyed the evening so much; and Mr. Edwards was as warm as herself in the praise of the fullness, brilliancy, and spirit of the meeting, though as he had been fixed the whole time at the same table in the same room, with only one change of chairs, it might have seemed a matter scarcely perceived; but he had won four rubbers out of five, and everything went well. His daughter felt the advantage of this gratified state of mind, in the course of the remarks and retrospections which now ensued over the welcome soup.\n\n\"How came you not to dance with either of the Mr. Tomlinsons, Mary?\" said her mother.\n\n\"I was always engaged when they asked me.\"\n\n\"I thought you were to have stood up with Mr. James the two last dances; Mrs. Tomlinson told me he was gone to ask you, and I had heard you say two minutes before that you were not engaged.\"\n\n\"Yes, but there was a mistake; I had misunderstood. I did not know I was engaged. I thought it had been for the two dances after, if we stayed so long; but Captain Hunter assured me it was for those very two.\"\n\n\"So you ended with Captain Hunter, Mary, did you?\" said her father. \"And whom did you begin with?\"\n\n\"Captain Hunter,\" was repeated in a very humble tone.\n\n\"Hum! That is being constant, however. But who else did you dance with?\"\n\n\"Mr. Norton and Mr. Styles.\"\n\n\"And who are they?\"\n\n\"Mr. Norton is a cousin of Captain Hunter's.\"\n\n\"And who is Mr. Styles?\"\n\n\"One of his particular friends.\"\n\n\"All in the same regiment,\" added Mrs. Edwards. \"Mary was surrounded by red-coats all the evening. I should have been better pleased to see her dancing with some of our old neighbours, I confess.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; we must not neglect our old neighbours. But if these soldiers are quicker than other people in a ball-room, what are young ladies to do?\"\n\n\"I think there is no occasion for their engaging themselves so many dances beforehand, Mr. Edwards.\"\n\n\"No, perhaps not; but I remember, my dear, when you and I did the same.\"\n\nMrs. Edwards said no more, and Mary breathed again. A good deal of good-humoured pleasantry followed; and Emma went to bed in charming spirits, her head full of Osbornes, Blakes, and Howards.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

up\n\nOh, so is it any wonder that we\nHate to see the sun go down\n\nThen we heard a shot\nAnd I said, Papa got em\nThen we heard a scream and Mama\nSmiled and said, betcha Billy got em\n\nBut when I lifted up my eyes, there was\nPapa in the doorway staring at the floor\nAnd my big brother Billy never did\nCome home no more\n\nIs it any wonder we hate\nTo see the sun go down\nAnd is it any wonder

that grows in the womb, only to be crushed before you can bloom\n\n[Chorus]\nMama stop! Turn around, go back, think it over\nNow stop, turn around, go back, think it over\nStop, turn around, go back think it over\n[Verse 2]\nOh no momma, just let it be. You'll never regret it, just wait and see\nThink of all the great ones who gave everything\nThat we might have life here, so please bear the pain\n\n[Chorus]\nMama stop!

diversion, he was thinking for himself\nA little money riding on the Maple Leafs\nAlong comes a lady in lacy sleeves\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe says: \"Let me sit down, you know, drinkin' alone's a shame\nIt's a shame, it's a crying shame\nLook at those jokers glued to that damn hockey game\nHey honey, you've got lots of cash\nBring us 'round a bottle and we'll have some laughs\nGin's what I'm drinking, I was raised on robbery\"\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a pretty good cook, I'm sitting on my groceries\nCome up to my kitchen, I'll show you my best recipe\nI try and I try but I can't save a cent\nI'm up after midnight cooking, trying to make my rent\nI'm rough but I'm pleasin', I was raised on robbery\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe had a little money once\nThey were pushing through a four lane highway\nGovernment gave us three thousand dollars\nYou should have seen it fly away\nFirst he bought a '57 Biscayne, he put it in a ditch\nHe drunk up all the rest, that son of a bitch\nHis blood's bad whiskey, I was raised on robbery\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou know you ain't bad looking, I like the way you hold your drinks\nCome home with me honey, I ain't asking for no full length mink\nHey, where you going? Don't go yet\nYour glass ain't empty and we just met\nYou're mean when you're loaded, I was raised on robberyYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

Badazz]\nYou better believe it, you better believe it\nYou better believe it (my money don't fold, I'm gettin' this dough)\nYou better believe it, you better believe it\nYou better believe it (always

top of brick\nYeah I laid my foundation 'til I built my house\nAnd it was mixtape after mixtapes\nAnd then the next thing you know, I was runnin' the South\nStreets introduced me to the trap\nSee that wasn't enough, see I wanted the world\nAnd that's about the time my album dropped\nAnd the next thing you know I was runnin' the world\nWho ya think ya is bitch, one of the girls?\nSee ya ass in ya jeans makes me wonder girl\nI'm a super nigga, need a cape for me\nReal street niggas they relate to me\nA big disappointment I would hate to be\nIn the wrong place at the wrong time\nIn the wrong line with the wrong man\nRight car with the wrong thang\nCan't tell me shit, I'm a grown man\nSixteen years old with a old thang\nSame clothes for days, same spot for months\nTwo AKs and a box of blunts\nIf it's money you want, it's money you get\nYa hang out with the boy then it's money you get\nYa ever believe that I'd ever believe\nThat I'd ever achieve what I ever achieved\n[Verse 3: Webbie]\nStop this bitch, let me tell the world something\nFrom the bottom to the top, shoulda seen that shit\nMe and my lil' thug got it from the mud\nEvery thang I spit I really mean that shit\nIt's crazy, ain't it? Hard to explain it\nI done got famous, all I did was bring it\nThe Savage Life behind the mic\nNow everybody hollerin' 'bout Trill Entertainment\nRest in peace, Pimp C\nI scream that shit every time I do shows\nYou put me on, and I ain't forget\nSo for my nigga, I gotta fuck two hoes\nWhatever y'all mean that I ain't got cream\nIf ya see me in the hood, don't think I can't leave\nWhen I was nineteen, I really had whole mil'\nThese other lil' niggas just sellin' ya'll dreams\nI ain't through yet, I done done at all\nBut I got a lot of stuff that I ain't get to do yet\nI fucked up, I ain't make it through school\nWanna see if my kids gonna make it through that\nFrom Miami, to L.A\nBack to Manhattan where the big cake\nFrom Baton Rouge, I done did it\nGo ahead, admit it, I'm the shit, hey\nAnd I don't care what a bitch say\nI'ma be like this 'til I get gray\nAnd I ain't puttin' no rims on it\nWhen it's $500 ya ride factory\nThe new album is on the way\nWhen it's the real deal, ya know ya gotta wait\nBad Azz gon' act a dog ass\nAnd y'all already know this\n\n[Chorus: Boosie Badazz]\nYou better believe it, you better believe it\nYou better believe it (my money don't fold, I'm

his men\nMade a bee-line for the jail\nAnd for miles around\nYou could hear the sirens wail\nThere's a rumor goin' 'round death row\nThat a fuse is gonna blow\nAt the local hop\nAt the local county
