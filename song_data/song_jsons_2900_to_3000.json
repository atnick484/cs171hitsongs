been a\u2005year\u2005since I've seen\u2005a deer, had a smallmouth on\u2005the line\nThe other day I hooked a monster, and as\u205fI\u205freeled\u205fhim in\nI thought,\u205f\"Man, it feels\u205fgood to be country again\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI spent way less time in Nashville, more time in L.A\nMy back home buddies, they quit callin', thought I had too much on my plate\nBut last night, we cracked some cold beers and cranked Eric Church to ten\nThought, \"Man, it feels good to be country again\"\n[Chorus]\nYeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee\nAnd my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me\nAnd I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been\nMan, it feels good to be country again\n\n[Verse 3]\nI traded in my Silverado, didn't need no four-by-four\nI tucked my boots in the back of the closet, they didn't feel like me no more\nBut I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on, they've been on my feet since then\nMan, it feels good to be country again\n\n[Bridge]\nOh-oh\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee\nAnd my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me\nAnd I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been\nMan, it feels good to be country again\n\n[Verse 4]\nI traded sunsets with my wife, for hours on my phone\nAnd even when I was right beside her, I still wasn't really home\nBut last night, we built a fire, watched the moonlight kiss her skin\nI thought, \"Man, it feels good to be country again\"\n\"Man, it feels good to be country again\"\nSee Thomas

out my ass, no quick brand\nI was packing on the pounds, got my weight up\nHad beef on the streets, had to stay up\nBetty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh\nDoing that put everything I love at stake, bruh\nSince a jit stood tall with a kickstand\nThinking of a plan to get quick bands\nFalling in deep with the quicksand\nFlag out my ass, no quick brand\nI was packing on the pounds, got my weight up\nHad beef on the streets, had to stay up\nBetty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh\nDoing that put everything I love at stake, bruh\n[Verse 1]\nBack in the day, man a nigga had rip jeans\nCouldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams\nCouldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams\nOutfit was the match of a crack fiend\nI was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off\nClothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg\nNo jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg\nThen I said, \"Fuck it,\" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg\nThen my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick\nWasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix\nInterceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six\nIn the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick\nNever killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted\nHe was the target, but he lucky that I missed it\nI was always fucking up, was a misfit\nMy opportunity was knocking and I missed it\nYoung when I hopped off the stoop\nTwo doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe\nToo sore from a war where I couldn't lose\nGot scars and bruises, man, I got the proof\nResemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice\nYou think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose\nStepping on necks with my Timberland boots\nI'm planted, I'm stable, I'm growing in roots, yeah\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSince a jit stood tall with a kickstand\nThinking of a plan to get quick

was raw and my hands was so gifted\nBoy had me chop, had get him a mix quick\nCouple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted\nFought another nigga after I thought was some kinship\nThrowing up both of our sets which ended the friendship\nGave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down\nHad 'em standing up then he ended up back down\nHis hands in my life now they ended up flat now\nFlat like a wing, let's see if he flap now\nHad enough, it was tough only lasted about one round\nK.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound\nMade 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound\nMade 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down\nI ain't got no time for the fakes\nThe phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes\nMy homies the only who come past the gate\nI'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes\nI'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate\nI want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take\nI'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place\nThe reason I'm popping is all of the hate, yeah\n[Chorus]\nSince a jit stood tall with a kickstand\nThinking of a plan to get quick bands\nFalling in deep with the quicksand\nFlag out my ass, no quick brand\nI

on your face\nLost in your current like a priceless wine\n\n[Chorus]\nThe more that you say, the less I know\nWherever you stray, I follow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, that's my man\n[Verse 2]\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind\nHead on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in\nAs if you were a mythical thing\nLike you were a trophy or a champion ring\nAnd there was one prize I'd cheat to win\n\n[Chorus]\nThe more that you say, the less I know\nWherever you stray, I follow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, that's my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, that's my man\n\n[Bridge]\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind\nThey count me out time and time again\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind\nBut I come back stronger than a '90s trend\n\n[Verse 3]\nWait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark\nShow me the places where the others gave you scars\nNow this is an open-shut case\nI guess I should've known from the look on your face\nEvery bait-and-switch was a work of art\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets

nice, but I'm goin' back mean\nI'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine\nMothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on\nMade a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on\nI tell the critics, \"Shut up,\" like my show is on\nGave a T-shirt to her, said, \"Throw it on\"\nShe one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)\nMy peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong\nY'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on\nI'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys\nI tried it back then, it

moderation with no problems\nSocial, moral, or medical\nThey have\u2005learned\u2005to enjoy liquor\u2005without letting it upset\nThe functioning of\u2005their body and mind\nIt relaxes you, makes you more congenial\u205f(I\u205fjust\u205fhad one sip)\nThis\u205fhelps make a\u205fgathering cheerful and friendly\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt ain't my fault, so don't blame me\nI swear I just came here to unwind and have one drink\nThe way it looks, it ain't what you think\nThis Cabernet has a way of vanishing on me\n[Chorus]\nThere's a hole in the bottle leaking all this wine\nIt's already empty and it ain't even supper time\nHoney, no, I don't miss him\nIn fact, it slipped my mind\nThere's a hole in the bottle of wine\n\n[Verse 2]\nI keep my cool, play by all the rules\nI swear ten minutes ago that bottle was full\nBut I won't cry about love gone wrong\n'Cause tears would water down this ruby red I'm sipping on\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a hole in the bottle leaking all this wine\nIt's already empty and it ain't even supper time\nHoney, no, I don't miss him\nIn fact, it slipped my mind\nThere's a hole in the bottle of wine (Aw, yeah)\n\n[Bridge]\nI went and got a new one\n'Cause the other one was broken\nNow this one's halfway gone\nAnd it's barely even open\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThere's a hole in the bottle (Hole in the bottle) leaking all this wine\nIt's already empty and it

bun, one hand on a mug\nAnd the other one\u2019s playin' snare\nTo a George Strait vinyl, that yes-or-no line will get her close\nBut I don't think she can understand\nJust how far I\u2019ve been lettin' my heart fall\nBut what's in my head\n\n[Chorus]\nShe don't know I got some big, big plans\nBuild a little house out on some hand-me-down land\nFind a little island where we go to get tan\nI bet we take our kids down there one day\nAnd I know she wouldn't mind if I\nDid a little somethin' like find a flight\nOvernight to paradise and leave tonight\nAnd I'ma put a diamond on her hand\n[Post-Chorus]\nShe don't know I got some big, big plans\nWell, she don\u2019t know, well, she don\u2019t know\nShe don't know I got some big, big plans\nWell, she don\u2019t know, well, she don't know\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, she don't know I already bought a ring\nHid it in the bottom left drawer, right beside the sink\nA shiny emerald diamond on a brand-new band\nAsked her mama for permission and her daddy for her hand\n\n[Chorus]\nI got some big, big plans\nBuild a little house out on some hand-me-down land\nFind a little island where we go to get tan\nI bet we take our kids down there one day\nAnd I know she wouldn't mind if I\nDid a little somethin\u2019 like find a flight\nOvernight to paradise and leave tonight\nAnd I'ma put a diamond on her hand\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nShe don't know I got some big, big plans\nWell, she don't know, well, she don't know\nShe don't know I got some big, big plans\nWell, she don't know, well, she don't know\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nWell, here I go\n'Cause right now, we're back in her hometown\nAnd I'm down on one knee\nI guess she finally figured out\nI'm gonna ask her to marry me\n\n[Chorus]\nI got some big, big plans\nBuild a little house out on some hand-me-down land\nFind a little island where we go to get tan\nI bet we take our kids down there one day\nAnd I know she wouldn't mind if I\nDid a little somethin' like find a flight\nOvernight to paradise and leave tonight\nAnd I'ma put a diamond on her hand\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nShe don't know I got some big, big plans\nWell, she don't know, well, she

Well Lyrics[Intro]\nMm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, uh\nI can't breathe (Chopsquad), I can't breathe, 999\nWaiting for the exhale\nI toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale\nToss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well\nStill no luck, but oh well\nI still try even though I know I'm gon' fail\nStress on my shoulders like a anvil\nPerky got me itching like a anthill\nDrugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill\nSometimes I don't know how to feel\n[Verse 1]\nRing-ring, phone call from depression\nYou used my past and my memories as a weapon\nOn the other line, I talk to addiction, huh\nSpeaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them\nThis can't be real, is it fiction?\nSomethin' feels broke, need to fix it\nI cry out for help, do they listen?\nI'ma be alone until it's finished\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThis is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying\nI just don't want you to worry\nThis is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em\n'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale\nToss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well\nStill no luck, but oh well\nI still try even though I know I'm gon' fail\nIt's stress on my shoulders like a anvil\nPerky got me itching like a anthill\nDrugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill\nSometimes I don't know how to feel\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nSometimes I don't know how to feel\nLet's be for real\nIf it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here\nBut if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah\nI just told y'all my secret, yeah\nIt's tearing me to pieces\nI really think I need them\nI stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThis is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying\nI just don't want you to worry\nThis is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em\n'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale\nToss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well\nStill no luck, but oh well\nI still try even though I know I'm gon' fail\nIt's stress on my shoulders like a anvil\nPerky got me itching like a anthill\nDrugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill\nSometimes I don't know how to feel218Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/5735137", "artist_names": "Genius Russian Translations

over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just\u2005straight\u2005cooked this motherfucker\u2005up)\nLast night, people protesting in Minneapolis\u2005escalated\nAs demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets\nThe main message here, the main message here, the main message here\nIs that they want to see those officers involved\nThey want to see those officers arrested\nOfficers arrested\n(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)\n\n[Verse 1]\nTrade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve\nI gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please\nI find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze\nFucked up, I seen what I seen\nI guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe\nIt's too many mothers that's grieving\nThey killing us for no reason\nBeen going on for too long to get even\nThrow us in cages like dogs and hyenas\nI went to court and they sent me to prison\nMy mama was crushed when they said I can't leave\nFirst I was drunk, then I sobered up quick\nWhen I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb\nHe got a life sentence plus\nWe just some products of our environment\nHow the fuck they gon' blame us?\nYou can't fight fire with fire\nI know, but at least we can turn up the flames some\nEvery colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist\nI be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces\nFucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive\nCrazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside\nStare in the mirror whenever you drive\nOverprotective, go crazy for mine\nYou gotta pay attention to the signs\nSeem like the blind following the blind\nThinking 'bout everything that's going on\nI boost security up at my home\nI'm with my kind if they right or they wrong\nI call him now, he'll pick up the phone\nAnd it's five in the morning, he waking up on it\nTell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'\nI see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'\nThat shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us\nThrow us in handcuffs and arrest us\nWhile they go home at night, that shit messed up\nKnowing we needed help, they neglect us\nWondering who gon' make them respect us\nI can see in your eye that you fed up\nFuck around, got my shot, I won't let up\nThey know that we a problem together\nThey know that we can storm any weather\n[Chorus]\nIt's bigger than black and white\nIt's a problem with the whole way of life\nIt can't change overnight\nBut we gotta start somewhere\nMight as well gon' 'head start here\nWe done had a hell of a year\nI'ma make it count while I'm here\nGod is the only man I fear\n\n[Verse 2]\nFuck it, I'm goin' on the front line\nHe gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line\nYou know when the storm go away, then the sun shine\nYou gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time\nI want all my sons to grow up to be monsters\nI want all my daughters to show out in public\nSeems like we losing our country\nBut we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to\nEvery video I see on my conscience\nI got power, now I gotta say somethin'\nCorrupted police been the problem where I'm from\nBut I'd be lying if I said it was all of them\nI ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them\nAltercations with the law, had a lot of them\nPeople speaking for the people, I'm proud of them\nStick together, we can get it up out of them\nI can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote\nI did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go\nThis bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change\nGot time to be serious, no time for no games\nWe ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains\nGod bless they souls, every one of them names\nSee Lil Baby LiveGet tickets as low as $120You might also

I know that they feel it\nThese scars too deep to heal us\nWhat happened to COVID? Nobody remember\nIt ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent\nIt happen to one of your people, it's different\nWe get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it\nKnowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted\nI won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me\nAin't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention\nIt's people who can, well, here's the chance\nI won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe\nMust not be breathing the air that I breathe\nYou know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed\nI never been a fan of police\nBut my neighborhood know I try to keep peace\nSo it's only right that I get in the streets\nMarch for a reason, not just on GP\nOur people died for us to be free\nFuck do you mean? This was a dream\nNow we got the power that we need to have\nThey don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah\n[Chorus]\nIt's bigger than black and white\nIt's a problem with the whole way of

1]\nGirl you know I've known you forever\nHow many nights we hung out together\nSame little crowd, little bar, little town\nRound this old dance floor\nMy boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder\nMaking a motion like \"'Could y'all get any closer?\"\nThey wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya\nEven when the song is over\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a rumor going round about me and you\nStirring up our little town the last week or two\nSo tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling\nI feel it, don't you feel it too?\nThere's a rumor going round, and round, and round\nWhat d'you say we make it true?\nWe make it true\nOh, we make it true\n[Verse 2]\nWell I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy\nI can do whatever you want me to do, baby\nOr you could lay one on me right now\nWe could really give them something to talk about\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a rumor going round about me and you\nStirring up our little town the last week or two\nSo tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling\nI feel it, don't you feel it too?\nThere's a rumor going round, and round, and round\nWhat d'you say we make it true, baby?\n\n[Bridge]\nOh be honest girl now\nDo you want to do this or not?\nShould we keep them talking, girl\nOr should we just make them stop?\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a rumor going round about me and you\nStirring up our little town the last week or two\nSo tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling\nI feel it, and you feel it too\nThere's a rumor going round, and round, and round\nWhatd'you say we make it-\nMake it true?\nWhatd'you say we make it
