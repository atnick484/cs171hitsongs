need a moment\n\nThe whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways\nThe atmosphere, as thrilling here as always\nFeel the early morning madness\nFeel the magic in the making\nWhy, everything's as if we never said goodbye\nI've spent so many mornings just trying to resist you\nI'm trembling now, you can't know how I've missed you\nMissed the fairy tale adventure\nIn this ever-spinning playground\nWe were young together\n\nI'm coming out of make-up, the lights already burning\nNot long until the cameras will start turning...\nAnd the early morning madness\nAnd the magic in the making\nYes, everything's as if we never said goodbye\n\nI don't want to be alone, that's all in the past\nThis world's waited long enough: I've come home at last!\n\nAnd this time will be bigger and brighter than we knew it\nSo watch me fly, we all know I can do it...\nCould I stop my hands from shaking?\nHas there ever been a moment\nWith so much to live for?\n\nThe whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways\nSo much to say, not just today, but always...\nWe'll have early morning madness\nWe'll have magic in the making\nYes, everything's as if we never said goodbye\nYes, everything's

Never Said Lyrics[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nIt's so loud inside my head\nWith words that I should have said\nAs I drown in my regrets\nI can't take back the words I never said\nI can't take back the words I never said\n\n[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]\nI really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit\nJust a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets\nHow much money does it take to really make a full clip?\n9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?\nUh, and a bunch of other coverups\nYour child's future was the first to go with budget cuts\nIf you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut\nThe school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up\nKeep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust\nYou get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough\nIf you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of what-the-fucks\nDude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such\nAnd that ain't Jersey Shore, homie, that's the news\nAnd these the same people supposedly telling us the truth\nLimbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist\nGaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit\nThat's why I ain't vote for him, next one either\nI'm a part of the problem, my problem is I'm peaceful\nAnd I believe in the people, yeah\n[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nIt's so loud inside my head\nWith words that I should have said\nAs I drown in my regrets\nI can't take back the words I never said\n\n[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]\nNow we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it\nBut if we know better, then we probably deserve it\nJihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?\nMurdering is not Islam, and you are not observant\nAnd you are not a Muslim\nIsrael don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed them\nWalk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went\nComplain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?\nComplain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?\nJust listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop\nA rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt\nIf you don't become a actor, you'll never be a factor\nPills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt\nWash 'em down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells\nCrooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today\nSo if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away\n[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nIt's so loud inside my head\nWith words that I should have said\nAs I drown in my regrets\nI can't take back the words I never said, never said\nI can't take back the words I never said\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]\nI think that all the silence is worse than all the violence\nFear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it\nWe scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth\nSo scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you\nSometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to\nI'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you\nConsider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few\nMy screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through\n\n[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nIt's so loud inside my head\nWith words that I should have said\nAs I drown in my regrets\nI can't take back the words I never said51Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/388766", "artist_names": "3 Doors Down",

the Creep (ha)\nDo the Creep (ha)\nAnd if you wanna make friends at the ATM\nDo the Creep (ha)\nAnd do the Creep (ha)\n[Verse 1: Andy & Akiva]\nWell, we got a new dance, so get up on your feet\nIt\u2019s real easy to do and it\u2019s called the Creep\nLet your hands flop around, like a marionette\nPop your knees up and down, sh-sh-shakin\u2019 your neck\nNow pull your waistband up like you expecting a flood\nAnd stick your hair down flat like it was covered in mud\nTrim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers\nPut this in your speakers, you a certified creeper\n\n[Hook: The Lonely Island]\nWhen you see a country peach laying out at the beach\nDo the Creep (ha)\nAnd do the Creep (ha)\nAnd when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree\nDo the Creep (ooh)\nAnd do the Creep (ha)\n\n[Verse 2: Andy & Akiva]\nI was six years old when I started creeping\nMy parents took it to their room and I started peeping\nYou can imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads\nAnd saw my little ass creeping at the foot of the bed\nAnd they knew I was a creep since the day I was born\nGet popping out my momma like some kettle corn\nAnd the doctor caught my head and he starting freaking\nCause I came out clean and I came out creeping\nYou might also like[Interlude: The Lonely Island & Nicki Minaj]\nNicki (uh), Nicki (uh huh)\nNicki, Nicki, Nicki, Nicki (yeah)\n\n[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & The Lonely Island]\nWhen I was a girl, I creeped in the boys' locker room\nHide deep inside, it was my little creep stalker room\nAs they disrobed, I was oogling and oggling\nLittle did they know that for me, they were modeling\nAnd I would laugh: ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha\nAnd they would dance: la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nSo pop your peepers and squeak out your sneakers\nDon\u2019t sleep, come on, get your creep on with me\n\n[Hook: The Lonely Island & Nicki Minaj]\nGo on and get you sweating off the bride at her wedding\nDo the Creep (ha)\nAnd do the Creep (ha)\nBut when you sneak into a wake and you see a beefcake\nDo the Creep (ooh)\nAnd do the creep (ha)\nWhen the judge is a hottie and you can\u2019t control your body\nDo the Creep (ha)\nAnd do the Creep (ha)\nSo get your knees flexin\u2019 and your arms T-Rexin\u2019\nAnd creep, haha (ha)\nDo the Creep (ha)\n[Outro: John Waters]\nAnd don\u2019t forget to smile5Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

more\nI'd soften my heart, shock the world\nDo you hear my voice?\nDo you know my name?\nLight my way, lift my head, light my way\n\n[Hook]\nI can see my mother in the kitchen, my father on the

to explain how I feel\nThat I still need your love after all that I've done\nYou won't believe me\nAll you will see is a girl you once knew\nAlthough she's dressed up to the nines\nAt sixes and sevens with you\nI had to let it happen, I had to change\nCouldn't stay all my life down at heel\nLooking out of the window, staying out of the sun\nSo I chose freedom\nRunning around, trying everything new\nBut nothing impressed me at all\nI never expected it to\nDon't cry for me Argentina\nThe truth is I never left you\nAll through my wild days\nMy mad existence\nI kept my promise\nDon't keep your distance\n\nAnd as for fortune, and as for fame\nI never invited them in\nThough it seemed to the world they were all I desired\nThey are illusions\nThey're not the solutions they promised to be\nThe answer was here all the time\nI love you and hope you love me\n\nDon't cry for me Argentina\nThe truth is I never left you\nAll through my wild days\nMy mad existence\nI kept my promise\nDon't keep your distance\n\nHave I said too much?\nThere's nothing more I can think of to say to you\nBut all you have to do is look at me to know\nThat every word is trueYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type":

own shots\nBut don't make her drop you off around the block\nRemember that she's getting older, too\nAnd don't lose the way that you dance around\nIn your PJs getting ready for school\n\n[Chorus]\nOh,

age\n[Chorus]\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nI was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered\n\n[Verse 2]\nI said, \"Remember this feeling\"\nI pass the pictures around\nOf all the years that we stood there on the sidelines\nWishing for right now\nWe are the kings and the queens\nYou traded your baseball cap for a crown\nWhen they gave us our trophies\nAnd we held them up for our town\nAnd the cynics were outraged\nScreaming, \"This is absurd\"\n'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans\nGot to rule the world\n\n[Chorus]\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nI was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid\nLong live all the mountains we moved\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\nI was screaming, \"Long live that

my name\nTell 'em how the crowds went wild\nTell 'em how I hope they shine\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nI had the time of my life with you\n\n[Chorus]\nLong, long live the walls we crashed

you in the evening\nSitting on your throne\nYou're playing with a fireball\nAnd posted up against the wall\n\nI just wanna hold you\nTake you by your hand\nAnd tell you that you're good enough\nTell you that it's gonna be tough\n\n[Hook]\nThis could be the end...\nThis could be the end\nThis could be the end\nThis could be the end...\nCos I ain't got a home\n\n[Verse 3]\nRunning from the street lights\nShining on the grave\nOnce you've had the good stuff\nNever gonna fill you up\nYou might also likeI wanna be the one who\nGives them all a whirl\nAnd gives them all the finger at it\nJust a little taste of it\n\n[Hook]\nThis could be the end...\nThis could be the end\nThis could be the end\nThis could be the end\nCos I ain't got a home\nI'll forever roam\nSaid I ain't got a home\nI'll
