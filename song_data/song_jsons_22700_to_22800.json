judges frown?\nCause I saw the end before we'd begun\nYes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won\nSo I took what's mine by eternal right\nTook your soul out into the night\nIt may be over but it won't stop there\nI am here for you, if you'd only care\nYou touched my heart, you touched my soul\nYou changed my life and all my goals\nAnd love is blind but that I knew when\nMy heart was blinded by yours\nI've kissed your lips and held your hand\nShared your dreams and shared your bed\nI know you well, I know your smell\nI've been addicted to you\n[Chorus]\nGoodbye my lover\nGoodbye my friend\nYou have been the one\nYou have been the one for me\nGoodbye my lover\nGoodbye my friend\nYou have been the one\nYou have been the one for me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI am a dreamer and when I wake\nYou can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take\nAnd as you move on, remember me\nRemember us and all we used to be\nI've seen you cry, I've seen you smile\nI've watched you sleeping for a while\nI'd be the father of your child\nI'd spend a lifetime with you\nI know your fears and you know mine\nWe've had our doubts but now we're fine\nAnd I love you, I swear that's true\nI cannot live without you\n\n[Chorus]\nGoodbye my lover\nGoodbye my friend\nYou have been the one\nYou have been the one for me\nGoodbye my lover\nGoodbye my friend\nYou have been the one\nYou have been the one for me\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nAnd I still hold your hand in mine\nIn mine when I'm asleep\nAnd I will bare my soul in time\nWhen I'm kneeling at your feet\n\n[Chorus]\nGoodbye my lover\nGoodbye my friend\nYou have been the one\nYou have been the one for me\nGoodbye my lover\nGoodbye my friend\nYou have been the one\nYou have been the one for me\n\n[Outro]\nI'm so hollow, baby, I'm so

battle\nAnd someone said that ain't my scene\n'Cause they need a new song like a new religion\nMusic for the television\nI can't do the long division\nSomeone do the math\nFor the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer\nGotta find another way to live the life of leisure\nSo I drop my top\nMix and I mingle\nIs everybody ready for the single? And it goes...\n[Chorus]\nHa la la la la la\nNow listen closer to the verse I lay\n(Ha la la la la la)\nIt's all about the wordplay\nHa la la la, love\nThe wonderful thing it does\nBecause, because\nI am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's\nYeah, the Mister A to Z\nThey say I'm all about the wordplay\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen it's time to get ill, I got your remedy\nFor those who don't remember me\nWell, let me introduce you to my style\nI try to keep a jumble and the lyrics never mumble\nWhen the music's makin' people tongue-tied\nYou want a new song like a new religion\nMusic for the television\nI can't do the long division\nSomeone do the math\nFor the people write me off like I'm a one-hit wonder\nGotta find another way to keep from going under\nPull out the stops\nGot your attention\nI guess it's time again for me to mention the wordplay\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nHa la la la la la\nNow listen closer to the verse I lay\n(Ha la la la la la)\nIt's all about the wordplay\nHa la la la, love\nThe wonderful thing it does\nBecause, because\nI am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's\nYeah, the Mister A to Z\nThey say I'm all about the wordplay\n\n[Bridge]\nI built a bridge across the stream my consciousness\nIt always seems to be a flowin'\nBut I don't know which way my brain is going\nOh, the rhyming and the timing keeps the

this doubt and insecurity\nAnd I've been locked inside that house\nAll the while You hold the key\nAnd I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me\nAnd even though there's no way of knowing where to go\nI promise I'm going because\n[Chorus]\nOoh, I gotta get outta here\nI'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake\nOoh, I gotta get outta here\nAnd I'm begging You, I'm begging You\nI'm begging You to be my escape\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm given up on doing this alone now\n'Cause I've failed and I'm ready to be shown how\nYou've told me the way and now I'm trying to get there\nAnd this life sentence that I'm serving\nI admit that I'm every bit deserving\nBut the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause I've been housing all this doubt

the gun\nBy going out on a limb\nAnd invite him home for Christmas\nTo meet the family\n\n[Chorus 2]\nSeems like just yesterday\nYou brought home - oh, what's his name?\nHe had been drinking\nWhat were you thinking?\nAfter dinner he passed out\nWe can laugh about it now\n'Cause we've learned a lot since then\nMy sister, my friend\n\n[Bridge]\nDo you think you could come and see me sometime soon?\nWe could just hang out like we used to\n\n[Chorus 3]\nIt's late and I should go\nBut I can't hang up the phone\nUntil I tell you\nWhat I don't tell you enough\nEven though at times it

2Pac]\nHahaha (Boo, boo, man)\nHahaha, man, you crazy\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nSee, it ain't easy bein' me, life as a celebrity is less than heavenly\nI got these fakes and these backstabbers chasin' me around\nAnd it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around\nMama told me, long before I ever came up\nGotta be true to what you do and keep the game up\n\u2018Cause things change and jealousy becomes a factor\nBest friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her\nI'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door\nAnd I got no time to worry, I'm steady wantin' more\nEvery day is a test, yes, I try hard\nBut I'm strugglin' with every breath, I pray to God\nThat the woman that I left at home, all alone\nThere ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone\nIn my mind, I can see her naked, I can't take it\nGot me shakin' at the thought that we can make it\nI thought you knew\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\nI'm rollin' out on tour today\nYou gettin' sad, \u2018cause I'm going away (Nah-ah-ah)\nThe chickenheads wanna play with me\nYou gettin' mad, \u2018cause you think I'ma sway\nSome of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck\nI hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage (Nah-ah-ah)\nStill I be gettin' lonely for you\nI'm comin' home soon as I make this pay, make this pay\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nI call you up long distance, on the telephone\nWanna tuck you in, even though I can't make it home\nI whisper things in your ear like you're near me\nWonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?\nIt seems to me, that you're jealous\n\u2018Cause I'm hustlin' and makin' money with the fellas\nIn the backstreets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up\nThugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier\nAnd there's no way I'ma stop makin' money\n\u2018Cause your attitude's changed and you're actin' a little funny\nAlways complainin', saying we don't spend time\nCan't you see I got enough stress on my mind?\nAnd hangin' up like you all that?\nThen get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back\nPlease, ain't nothin' left to say to you\nThugs get lonely too (You know)\nYou might also like[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\nI'm rollin' out on tour today\nYou gettin' sad,

hit the stage (Nah-ah-ah)\nStill I be gettin' lonely for you\nI'm comin' home soon as I make this pay, make this pay\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nI sit alone in my room, drinkin' without a care\nTalking out loud to you, like you're there\nTake your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on\nYou're the first face I wanna see, when I get home\nWanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild\nTouchin' every wall in the house, thug style\nPut your hands on the headboard, think of me\nDrippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see\nIt's in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down\nReminisce and relax \u2018cause, baby, right now\nI feel it in the middle of my stomach\nYou whisper in my ear and, baby, tell me how you really want it\nHold on tightly, watch the ceilin'\nScratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me\n\u2018Cause everything I'm giving to you, is so true\nAnd thugs get lonely too (You know)\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\nI'm rollin' out on tour today\nYou gettin' sad, \u2018cause I'm going away (Nah-ah-ah)\nThe chickenheads wanna play with me\nYou gettin' mad, \u2018cause you think I'ma sway\nSome of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck\nI hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage (Nah-ah-ah)\nStill I be gettin' lonely for you\nI'm comin' home soon as I make this pay, make this pay\n\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nYeah, Thug Life, baby\nSteady thuggin'\nAyy, so you remember that\nNext time you sweating me when I'm on the road, man\nThugs get lonely too\nWe ain't gotta go through all these bullshittin' ass problems\nIf you wanna be real with me, be real with me\nIf you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me\nYou know10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/7811", "artist_names": "The Alchemist (Ft.

Berry of these rap skits, styles I mastered\nMany brothers snatched it up and tried to match it\nBut I'm still number one, everyday real\nSpeak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel\nCause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss\nKeep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi\nDid it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy\nBridging the gap, from the blues, to jazz, to rap\nThe history of music on this track\nBorn in the game, discovered my father's music\nLike Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain\nBut my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids\nSome are well-known, some doin' bids\nI mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks\nIf Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo\n\n[Chorus/Hook: Olu Dara & Nas]\nSee I come from

blues\nI'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart\nGraffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent\nBut Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with\nBooks to read, like X and stuff\nCause the schools said the kids had dyslexia\nIn art class I was a compulsive sketcher of\nTeachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up\nCause none'a them would like my style\nRead more books than the curriculum profile\nSaid, \"Mr. Jones please come get your child\nCause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild\"\n\n[Chorus/Hook: Olu Dara & Nas]\nI was born in Mississippi\nI was young and runnin' wild\nMoved to New York City\nWhere I had my first child\nI named the boy Nasir\nAll the boys call him Nas\nI told him as a youngster\nHe'll be the greatest man

can forgive me for that time\nWhen I put my hand between your legs\nAnd said it was small\n'Cause it's really not at all\nI guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down\nJust to keep you around\n'Cause the day that you realize how amazing you are\nYou're gonna leave me\n\nYou're the only one who\nHolds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick\nYou're the only one who\nKnows

I hopped my ass over to see if I was convinced\nFast paced city life, but country livin's the sense\nCop me a Caddy say to hell with a Benz\nBenz, Benz, twenty inch rims\nI can't leave the vertical grill back at the ranch\nGot a \"Phat\" farm with with cows and whole lotta land\nTwenty acres (???)\n[Verse 2: B. Stille]\nMeanwhile up in the D where they hollowin up dope\nAnd thugs blow weed in the park when the club close\nIn Mil-waukee the beats it petro\nOff in D.C., the streets is ghetto\nLet's roll - to Cali where they chief the best 'dro\nAnd drive cars so big you can't reach the pedal\nNever had a glass of purple juice for breakfast\nUntil I took my ass to Houston, Texas, that's country!\n\n[Hook]\nThe whole damn world is country\nBeen all around the globe from Monday to Sunday\nY'all the same folk we see in Kentucky (it must mean)\nThe whole damn world is country\nBeen all around the globe from Monday to Sunday\nY'all the same folk we see in Kentucky (it must mean)\nThe whole damn world is country\n\n[Verse 3: Big V]\nIn New Orleans they was sportin, Jordans and Waltons\nWent in for the Cajun, and winded up staying\nIn Kentucky it was meth but Miami they was basing\nRap my ass off in NYC at the Bassment\nHit VA, where they do nothing but cook\nCarolina, Indiana, Alabama, Savannah\nBoston, Denver, and all points between\nTennesse, Florida, ain't nothing love for ya\nYou might also like[Verse 4: R.

Scales]\nAlright first say a prayer for those in combat\nMight could throw somethin on the grill when you come back\nMight could take a trip to the 'Ville and then back\nWe can all get loose on the 'Ports, and of course\nHit Churchill Downs and throw some on a horse\nOr we can hit them Saint Claire waters\nYou ain't seen country till you been through Georgia\nGod durn, they still got girls with perms (dang)\nBig cars, big wheels is the biggest concern\n[Verse 6: Ron Clutch]\nMy old Kentucky home, I was\nBorn and raised on catfish and corn, collard greens and fatback\nIt's country than a mug, don't care where ya stay\nYa got country in ya blood if ya love 'em and that's that\nCircled the globe, met the important and paid\nNow I know for a fact that...\n\n[Hook] 2X1Embed"}, {"_type":

home\nAnd word on the streets is that you got me whipped (word up)\nIt got back and had a brother on flip (word)\nHow they know I had brought that whip\nIt's all good, that's just one of my gifts\nCuz the love it when my stomach touch ya body\nBaby, my tongue game is mad crazy\nEnough about me, Ton' Starks, sugar, I drove the Arc\nNoah taught me how to parallel park\nI may hit you while I'm writin'

my wife is because\nYou see me for me the real me and love me unconditionally\nAnd even with the circumstances that I had you still gave me a chance\nAnd that's why I live and breathe for you and the kids\nAnd you give me more than what this thing could ever give to me\nAnd now my life is satisfied and complete visions are coming true\nYea of me and you placing rings on each others fingers saying \"I do\"\nYou stuck with me through my thick and my thin to go back and live life over\nAgain\nNah this is my destiny it was worth the agony to get the ecstasy\n(Chorus)\nWe can runaway and spend some

quite like you\nAnd even though it was wrong I fell in love with you\nNow we sit here not really knowing what to do\nBut I'm sure that you know I'll give the world for you\nIf I could runaway with you I wouldn't even think twice\nI promise girl I'll put it all on the line\nI know forever seems to be a long time\nBut thats what I'm seeing when I look into your eyes\nAnd it don't matter what your friends might say\nCuz I know deep inside you feel the same way\nYou could tell me what u want but I could read your mind\nSo quit lying to yourself and put ya hand in mine\nI get excited everytime you come close\nAnd being right here with you is what I love the most\nSo any time your feeling lonely inside\nWe could runaway together and leave this world behind\n\n(Chorus)\nWe can runaway and

may sound dumb, but here we go\nDo you believe in love at first sight\n\n[Verse 2]\nMe neither\nI'm glad that we agree\nBelieve me\nThat's a big relief\nWell, this place is awful crowded\nAnd this music is so loud\nWould you like to go and grab a bite to eat\nMe neither\n[Verse 3]\nIt's nice to finally meet a girl who doesn't move too fast\nI was only checking, that's the reason that I asked\nRelationships need time to grow\nYou and I should take this slow\nAnd darling tell me, would you like to dance\n\n[Verse 4]\nMe neither\nI was just being polite\nThank goodness\nMy feet are much too tired\nI'm sure you're tired too\nI can see an empty booth\nWould you like to maybe sit and talk a while\nMe neither\nWe'd never get along\nI'm thinking there's no chemistry at all\nThis has been a waste of time\nAnd I'm running outta lines\nDon't you think it's time for me to end this song\nMe neitherSee Brad Paisley LiveGet tickets as low as $305You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type":

love, the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally.\n\nTed: My first solo batch.\n\nVictoria: Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer. Here's a professional tip. If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake. It's a beverage.\n\nTed from 2030: Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great.\n\n(Barney arrives, while Marshall is coloring his butt)\nBarney: Um, are you coloring in your butt?\n\nMarshall: I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.\n\nBarney: So wear another one.\n\nMarshall: I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.\n\nBarney: Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.\n\nMarshall: Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for...  their bosses are going to save the world.\n\nBarney: Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.\n\nMarshall: A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.\n\nBarney: Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks \"suit.\" Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.\n\nMarshall: No thanks, dude. (Barney grabs Marshall's pants and tears them apart) Noon?\n\nBarney: Noon. See you then.\n\n\n\nThe Bar\nVictoria: Hey, girls.\n\nRobin and Lily: Hey.\n\nVictoria: Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted. It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner.\n\nRobin: Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask.\n\nLily: Robin!\n\nRobin: Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship.\n\nVictoria: Really? Oh.\n\nRobin: Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again.\n\nVictoria: What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping. You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops. If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount.\n\nLily: Really? That'd be great.\n\nVictoria: Yeah. Huh. I should take this. Hello.\n\nRobin: Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?\n\nLily: Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?\nRobin: The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.\n\nLily: Sold. Victoria, what's wrong?\n\nVictoria: I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany.\n\n\n\nThe Bar\n\nTed: Wait. Germany, Europe?\n\nVictoria: It's for two years. I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but... I'm in.\n\nTed: So, this is the Europe Germany?\n\nVictoria: What other Germany would it be?\n\nTed: The one in Epcot?\n\nVictoria: Ted.\n\nTed: Sorry. Congratulations.\n\nVictoria: Thank you. I don't know if I'm going to go.\n\nTed:  Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?\n\nVictoria: I don't know. I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone.\n\nTed: Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.\n\nVictoria: So, that leaves us with...\n\nTed: Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel...\n\nVictoria: I have to leave on Monday.\n\nTed: Monday, September the...?\n\nVictoria: Ted. Do you have any thoughts?\n\nTed: Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.\n\nVictoria: It's a date.\n\nTed from 2030: And that's when things got complicated.\n\n\n\nMarshall is At Barney's tailor / Lily is shopping for her wedding dress with Victoria and Robin\n\nMarshall: Hey, baby, how's the dress place?\n\nLily: Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor?\n\nMarshall: Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.\n\nLily: Well, good luck, baby.\n\nMarshall: Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?\n\nBarney:  Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.\n\nMarshall: You speak Ukrainian?\n\nTed: Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.\n\nMarshall: No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no sex. Kill me now.\n\nBarney: Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.\n\nTed: Really? You?\n\nBarney: Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.\n\nMarshall: Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?\n\nTed: Yeah.\n\nMarshall: Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, \"You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face.\" Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am.\n\nTed: Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?\n\nMarshall: Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost killed us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay.\n\nTed: Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.\n\nMarshall: Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.\n\nTed: Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.\n\nBarney: Are you sure?\n\nTed: All right. (He calls Victoria)\n\nVictoria: Hello.\n\nTed: Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?\n\nVictoria: Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.\n\nTed: Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye. (He hungs up) She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.\n\nBarney: Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.\n\nMarshall: Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?\n\nBarney: Here. Play with this pin cushion.\n\nMarshall: God. I'm going to look hot.\n\nBarney: Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.\n\nMarshall: No way.  The Kid does not sell out.\n\nBarney: Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.\n\nMarshall: No. I've made my decision.\n\nTed: So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.\n\n\n\nIn a restaurant\n\nTed from 2030: And so I met her that night to tell her my decision.\n\nVictoria: All right, I've been thinking a lot about this... Okay, wait, before you say anything, I wanted to give you this. This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking.\n\nTed: I want you to stay.\n\n\n\nAt the Tailor / At the wedding shop\n\nMarshall: Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.\n\nLily: Oh, good luck, baby.\n\nMarshall: Bye.\n\nWoman: Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?\n\nLily: Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.\n\nRobin: I saw a couple up front that were nice.\n\nBy the window? No offense, dear, but those are a little out of your price range.\n\nLily: Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.\n\nVictoria: Oh, these women are experts. They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear.\n\nLily: Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!\n\nVictoria: At least we get free champagne!\n\nRobin: And cake.\n\nVictoria: Mm-hmm.\n\nRobin: Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?\n\nVictoria: You know, I don't know. I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted. I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works.\n\nLily: Ugh. All talking and no sex. Kill me now.\n\nVictoria: I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from.\n\nRobin: Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.\n\nVictoria: But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.\n\nRobin: Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.\n\nVictoria: I really don't...\n\nRobin: Sex. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This bastard's kicked.\n\nWoman: Thanks.\n\nVictoria and Robin: Oh!\n\nLily: It's okay, guys, I hate it.\n\nVictoria: Just horrible.\n\nRobin: It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.\n\nLily: You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.\n\nVictoria: But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates? It's too soon. Ooh. Speak of the devil. Hello.\n\nTed: Hey, random question: how do you feel cats?\n\nVictoria: Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.\n\nRobin: A cat person. Why am I not surprised?\n\nVictoria: Bye. Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?\n\nLily: Maybe he's going to buy you one.\n\nVictoria: I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together?\n\nRobin: Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.\n\nVictoria: That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing?\n\nRobin: Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.\n\nVictoria and Robin: Aw.\n\nLily: Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.\n\nRobin: Ugly, ugly, ugly.\n\nVictoria: I don't know what to say. You know what? We're doing this all wrong. I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun.\n\nLily: Are you okay?\n\nRobin: I'm fine.\n\nLily: Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.\n\nRobin: I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.\n\nLily: Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.\n\nVictoria: Somebody say \"beautiful princess.\"\n\nLily: Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.\n\nVictoria: Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.\n\nRobin: I know what you mean.\n\nVictoria: You do?\n\nLily: Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.\n\nVictoria: See, that's what I'm afraid of.\n\nRobin: Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.\n\nVictoria: Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends.\n\nRobin: Oh, no way... you're the coolest.\n\nVictoria: No, you are.\n\nRobin: Okay, I am.\n\nVictoria: I'm going to stay.\n\nVictoria and Robin: Aw.\n\nLily: Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.\n\nRobin: Wow, you look incredible.\n\nLily: Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?\n\nRobin: Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.\n\nLily: Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married. (She sits on the cake, without noticing it) Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?\n\nRobin: Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.\n\nVictoria: But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.\n\nRobin: Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.\n\n(Lily stands up and tears the dress apart, the woman arrives at the same time)\n\nLily: It was like this when I found it?\n\nWoman: And how will you be paying for this?\n\nLily: Credit card... s.\n\n\n\nIn a restaurant\n\nVictoria: I wanted to give you... this. This is what happens when you... you know, let them finish baking.\n\nTed: I want you to stay.\n\nVictoria: I have to go to Germany.\n\nTed: You're going?\n\nVictoria: Yes. I have to.\n\nTed: So that's what you decided?\n\nVictoria: Well, no... I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying, but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go.\n\nTed: What is this, opposite day or something?\n\nVictoria: No.\n\nTed: So it is?\n\nVictoria: Ted, we've only been dating for two months. I can't let you make this decision for me.\n\nTed: I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are.\n\nVictoria: Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?\n\nTed: Well, that's just crazy.\n\nVictoria: Oh, okay. So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy.\n\nTed: But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.\n\nVictoria: You'd have me.\n\nTed: We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this.\n\nVictoria: So... we're breaking up?\n\nTed: I guess so. I guess so.\n\n\n\nAt the appartment\n\nMarshall: God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.\n\nTed: It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.\n\nMarshall: Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?\n\nTed: She's leaving tomorrow.\n\nMarshall: Yeah, but she's still in town.\n\nTed: Yeah, she... she's still in town.\n\nMarshall: Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together. Ted, think about it this way: if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?\n\nTed: Awesome air kicks, huh?\n\nMarshall: New pajama bottoms?\n\nTed: You know it.\n\n\n\nThe Bar\n\nTed: So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.\n\nVictoria: Wait, so we're sharing the leg?\n\nTed: No, the leg is a metaphor.\n\nVictoria: How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next? I don't know, Ted.\n\nTed: Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?\n\nVictoria: Well, what would you want to do?\n\nTed: Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.\n\nVictoria: Like go to the Mets.\n\nTed: Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nVictoria: See some monkeys at the zoo?\n\nTed: Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?\n\nVictoria: Wow! We better get going.\n\nTed: Yeah, big day.\n\nVictoria: Yeah.\n\nTed from 2030: And, kids, that's exactly what we did with our last day. The museum, the bridge, the restaurant, and all of those nice things.\n\n\n\nThe Bar\n\nRobin: Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.\n\nLily: No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.\n\nRobin: Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.\n\nLily: Yeah, but only, like, second base.\n\nBarney: Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.\n\nMarshall: Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.\n\nBarney: So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?\n\nMarshall: Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.\n\nBarney: Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.\n\nMarshall: B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.\n\nBarney: Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.\n\nMarshall: You set this up! You set this whole thing up!\n\nBarney: I most certainly did...\n\nMarshall: Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.\n\nLily: I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.\n\nMarshall: What time is the interview?\n\nBarney: 9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy.\n\n\n\nAt the airport\n\nVictoria: I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.\n\nTed: Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the sex.\n\nVictoria: I'm going to miss you so much.\n\nTed: I'm going to miss you, too.\n\nVictoria: Hey, you know, I mean, if, when I get back, we're still single, we can...\n\nTed: Even if we're not.\n\nVictoria: Okay.\n\nTed: Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?\n\nVictoria: Yes.

together puttin' a front on\nI'd rather be on my own (On my own)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen we first met things were fine\nWe went out to dine\nWe strolled the beach, holding hands, sharing quality time\nWhat happened between then and now?\nThe love we shared was lost somehow\n(My friends tried to tell me)\nThat we're moving too fast\nBut how could I know the feelings would pass\nIt wouldn't last\nI know I should have left a long time ago\nBut I stayed to see\nHoping and praying you still love me\n[Chorus]\nGirl, I gotta go, I can't stay\nYou said things would change\nBut girl, things are still the same (Say it one more time)\nGirl, I gotta go, I can't stay (Ooh wee)\nWe stay together puttin' a front on\nI'd rather be on my own (On my own)\n(Listen)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI took you in, treated your children as mine\nThen we laid and made love\nAnd you had my son, what a precious time\nI did all that I could to get through to you\nTo let you know, girl, it's you I was living for\n(But you let your mind play games on you)\nThen when I'm not around\nYou think that I don't know\nThat you're passing time with the guy next door\nI gave you all that I had\nYou didn't love me one ounce\nSo like a basketball, I gotta bounce\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl, I gotta go, I can't stay\nYou said things would change\nBut girl, things are still the same (Oh girl)\nGirl, I gotta go, I can't stay (Gotta go bye, bye, bye, bye)\nWe stay together puttin' a front on\nI'd rather be on my own\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nListen\nBaby, can you tell me\nWhere I went wrong, yeah\nAll I ever wanted, baby, baby, baby\nWas

(Lord have mercy)\nBut girl, things are still the same\nGirl, I gotta go, I can't stay (Ooh yeah, mmm)\nWe stay together puttin' a front on\nI'd rather be on my own (Oh)\nGirl, I gotta go, I can't

own\n\n[Outro]\nBreak it down\nBreak it down, mhm\n'Cause I wanna talk to my people this evening\n(Come on)\nAnd let 'em know it takes a fool to learn (It takes a fool), mhm\nThat love don't love nobody\nThat's why I can truly say in my heart\nThat love don't live here (Love don't live here anymore)\nGood God almighty\nBaby, you hurt me so bad\nBut oh, I'm mighty grateful\nThat love don't live here (Love don't live here anymore)\nOh, hoo, it's alright, it's okay\nGonna move on anyone (I can move on)\nYeah yeah, yeah yeah\nYeah yeah\nBaby, you hurt me so bad\nI gotta move on (I can move

grace\nMillennium\n\n[Verse 2]\nLive for liposuction\nAnd detox for your rent\nOverdose at Christmas\nAnd give it up for Lent\nMy friends are all so cynical\nRefuse to keep the faith\nWe all enjoy the madness\n'Cause we know we're gonna fade away\n\n[Chorus]\nWe've got stars directing our fate\nAnd we're praying it's not too late\n'Cause we know we're falling from

often think that we were born to hate\nGet up and see the sarcasm in my eyes\nAnd when we come we always come too late\nI often think that we were born to hate\nGet up and see the sarcasm in my

Can't take it with you under this earth\nRich men died and tried, but none of it worked\nThey just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid\nBefore my number's called, history's made\nSome'll fall, but I rise \u2014 thug or die\nMakin' choices that determine my future under the sky\nTo rob, steal or kill, I'm wonderin' why\nIt's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?\nMuch success to

"Money\u2019s Just a Touch Away Lyrics[Intro: Mack 10]\nThis song is dedicated\nTo all the up and coming rappers, singers, hustlers, actors\nWhatever you may be remember:\nWithout no struggle, you get no progress\nSo keep grindin, keep on mashin, get yours\n\n[Chorus: Gerald Levert]\nYou're nothin far from comin up (keep on)\nMoney's just a touch away (keep on)\nSo keep on grindin don't give it up (keep on)\nThere'll always be another day (keep on)\n[Mack 10]\nAnd now I'm sittin at the pad, teary eyed and depressed\nStarvin and sufferin from mental stress\nNow a true center to the game of beginner\nBut hard to feel like a winner when you eat spreads for dinner\nHit the streets late night in the form of star mushin\nOn the 211 mission just to pay tuition\nFor my kids I got to grind and develop street savvy\nServin stress cause I just ain't got enough to cop cavi\nBut I can't stop, I won't stop, til I got it made\nEither build my clientele, get a job or learn a trade\nLike hip-hop, and make enough to live good forever\nSo I learned to write the rhymes and get my metaphors together\nThen I joined a rap crew, with the homies on my street\nSellin underground tapes out the local swap meet\nGettin tighter on the mic, as I worked day to day\nSo now I lay down at night, and I hear voices say, \"Mack\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Mack 10]\nNow I'm new to the scene, H as in Hard, N as in Nympho\nSo like EPMD, could you _Please Listen to My Demo?_\nI left the local crew, felt like I was the man\nIn popular demand and now ready for SoundScan\nSo I searched for a deal with no luck I kept rappin\nFelt like it would take a miracle to make it all happen\nMarble said it was a test, \"Mack don't do nuttin wrong!\nJust have faith in God and keep your hustle goin strong\nStay hongry, keep writin, don't quit you're too close\nRemember good things come to those who want it most\"\nSo I never left the house, without my rap book\nThought I found a new crew but eventually got shook\nFirst they said I was cool, but then started to doubt me\nPut me on the backburner and just forgot all about me\nPartna said I wasn't fresh, and sent me on my way, but you know what?\nAs I was leavin, I could hear voices say, \"Mack\"\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n\n[Mack 10]\nNow the tables turned, but I remember they used to clown me\nThe hard work paid off, and luck finally found me\nSo call every publication, Billboard and the editor\nAnd tell em Mack's being signed by dude workin on _The Predator_\nI got the Midas touch, now everything be the bomb\nHooked up with The Don, now made a few mill-ion\nI don't bang I write the good rhymes, you know about mines\nMan I'm the tightest MC, Ice Cube ever signed\nNow if ain't the radio, it's a video shoot\nLivin life in the limelight, with a bank full of loot\nNow my crew is solid, shook the haters and the leeches\nRunnin full court at my house with our girls on the beaches\nPlus the violence is ceased, no more bi-coastal beef\nCause now I get down with the North South and the East\nI reminisce on hard times, seem like yesterday, but now\nHoo Bangin' is official and I remember they used to say, \"Mack\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Levert] Money's just a touch, just a simple touch\nMoney's just a touch away..\nMoney's just a touch, just a simple touch\nMoney's just a touch away..\n[Mack 10] Man I knew I was gonna make it, but they didn't believe me\nYaknowhatI'msayin?  Clowned me -- gon' be a rapper, what?\nHahahahaEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/839385", "artist_names": "Bravo All Stars (Ft.

with a nigga that got it together\nFor real, and even think his own thoughts\nEverybody wanna do what everybody else do\nWhen the \"copycat\" is what they been taught\nI'ma get in the brain of the

B.M\nI'm about to go in on my B.M\nI'm about to go in on my B.M, about to go in\nAbout to go in\n\n[Verse 1:]\nI should've never drank that liquor\nI should've used a condom\nBut that's my bad\nSomething I got to live with it\nIf I had my choice to do it all again\nI would've kept it moving\nWithout even acknowledging your existence\nAbout the deadest beat mama\nA child could never have\nA coke using alcoholic\nYou foul with no class\nSitting, waiting on the checks the arrive that you cash\nDon't even spend it on my son then wanna turn around and ask me for more money\nTrying to get more from me\nBitch I got 7 seven mouths to feed\nYou think that you the only person with a kid\nTrying to pay the bills, how about getting off your lazy ass\nTo work at a job it's been years\nYou think that just because you provide a place to live\nThat's raising them?\nNah that's just rumor in your crib\nYour own mama said I need to come and grab it quick\nThat's a shame when the grandma saying you unfit\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2:]\nMy son an honor roll student, football star\nExerting his use\nGotta sit around and listen\nTo all your verbal abuse\nBecause your life ain't shit so when you get hurt from the truth\nGo and take it out on him cause life ain't working for you\nHe looking for a job and I'm bout to buy him a car\nYou ain't never had a job and you live at the local bar\nSleeping with everybody and being the ho you are\nWhen he graduate, he coming straight to me and his step mama\nSmack in the face saying you mad\nCause I make payments out to his grandma\nCause she got my son back faded\nWhile you got the courts up in our business about a back payment\nBitch I ain't no Eminem so why you trying to act shady\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nAnother unworthy candidate I never should've hit plus\nA mass aching freak I need to cover my dick up\nAin't gotta, don't gotta, can't keep a job\nBut you won't up the child support and get it modified\nPaying every month and piano lessons too\nWhat I do for all my 7 kids most niggas wouldn't even do\nFor one, why you talking, you think because I'm touring\nAnd I got money out the cooler, bitch, you better get to walking\nIt's about the QT that we spend when he over\nNot about you and me, but you bending me over\nTrying to fuck with no grease, I refuse to be Rover\nDon't except nothing next, that's what I told her so\nYou might also like[Hook]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1398922", "artist_names": "Brady Seals", "full_title": "Another You, Another Me

movin'\nI hope that we don't move apart\nYou still have my heart\nI've got so much to do, but girl it doesn't matter\nBut when it comes down to you\nI can't think of nothing better\nEvery time I'm

bursting\nYeah I feel that good!\nShe slips from the stage\nA foot no more\nBut it seems to take an hour for her to reach the floor\nAnd the two chord cool still grooves\nAs she slides towards me smooth as a snake\nI can't swallow I just start to shake\nAnd I just know this is a big mistake\nYeah but it feels good!\n[Chorus]\nDo it to me! do it to me! do it to me! do it to me!\nDo it to me! do it to me! do it to me!\n\n[Verse 2]\n\"If you want I can take you on another kind of ride\n\"Believe me I would but\nDeep inside the 'but' is 'please'\nI am yearning for another taste\nAnd my shaking is 'yes'\n\"you will be all the things in the world you've never been\nSee all the things in the world you've never seen\nDream all the things in the world you've never dreamed\nBut I think I get a bit confused\nAm I seducing or being seduced?\nOh I know that tomorrow I'll feel bad\nBut I really couldn't care about that\nShe's grinning singing spinning me round and round\nSmiling as I start to fall\nHer face gets big her face gets small\nIt's like tonight I'm really not me at all\nAnd it feels good!\n\n[Chorus]\nDo it to me! do it to me! do it to me! do it to me!\nDo it to me! do it to me!

locks\nNow who kicks that phenomical, astronomical? Uhh\nThat's my nine in you; feelin' nauseous? That's my rhyme in you\nI swing funk like nunchucks, my game's death\nThat's cool when I blind fools like Kareem Abdul\nHot like Worchestire, sometimes I get more higher than Cheech\nMy funk speech make words wear sun visors\nI'm gettin' down with the funk in your trunk\nDef Squad's in the house for *95* for all you punks\n[Sampled Hook: Q-Tip]\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\n\n[Verse 2]\nAhhh, I'm just as high as three pilled up motherfuckers\nDef Squad's in the house for *95* you suckers\nPunks, y'all chumps, I blew the frame once, twice\nI'm dumb nice, I bring my worst lyrics to a gunfight\nThe top notch, nah fuck that, that notch's topped\nI'm off the meter, I make computer's catch amnesia\nI'm swifter than roller blades on Ice Capades\nI'm Fearless like Four plus I'm Kool like Aid\nMy grammar, slam from here to York, Alabama\nI never pull my pants up, I'm nutty like Planters\nMy style gets Death like Row or Def like Jef\nDef like Jam or Squad, or Def like Lep\nOne, two!

With weed for you!\nWho says I can't burn shit up just like Lisa Lopes?\nI cause the ruckus, my area is fucked up\nYou better off calling them Power Ranger motherfuckers\n'Cause Redman will bomb just like Saddam\nWhen I'm loose I'm worldwide like Triple F.A.T.

We're From the Darkside Radio\nThis is Dave Rockin' Reel, as we take a caller\nCaller, you're on the air\nYeah, yeah, yeah, and this is Roz from Newark and I wanna hear that tune by Redman, \"Can't

hiddash\nRoll it up and then ask, \"Who chipped in for the ten bag?\"\nEt cetera, I roll my blunts with two textures\nPick up fifty bags and then I smoke all the extras\nIt's the truth, like vodk' one-eighty proof\nDon't drop your drawers, I'll fuck through your daisy dukes (True)\nPut your fingers up in the air if you're high (High)\nI walk by (By), so f' a drive (Drive)\nI swing up in it, batting average is half as\nGood as Reggie Jackson's, that's why you talk backwards\nAnd, uh, chumps be on some Bogart shit like Humphrey\nYou couldn't beat me if you ran with 21 Jump Street\nOr
