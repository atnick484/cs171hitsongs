Cliff White examines the output of the sex machine inch by inch.Cathy McGowan, reminiscing on BBC's 'The Story of Pop':\n\n\"When he came here he was hailed as the great James Brown \u2013 and the show was awful. I mean he just couldn't produce the sound. It was terrible. I mean it was really awful. It was a bad, bad show. A disaster. And the only reason that they devoted the whole show to Brown was because of the following that he'd got here built up because of the hysteria on the part of the mods. You know, it was like everything else. It was like everybody's-gotta- say-you-like-James-Brown-week. So, of course, the demand for James Brown records was such that everyone was writing into the programme saying James Brown. Every mod you asked would say James Brown. So you imagined that he was so big that if you could just get this James Brown... And that's really where Ready Steady Go! fell flat on their face \u2013 because it was awful. And the worst thing of all was that when he actually did his numbers the mods didn't like him. When he actually came into the studio they didn't like him. The music and the records were so fantastic, but when they actually came there to the studio to do it live... something went.\"\n\nNow then, if you're the perceptive kind of reader that the editor like to thinks you are, you'll have begun to realize that Ms. McGowan and her mohair-suited friends were just a teeny bit disappointed with James Brown. What was that again? \"...when they actually came to the studio...something went.\" What \"went\", of course, on that memorable Friday evening in March 1966, was the cosy notion that here was simply another harmless jigaboo with a trendy kind of rhythm and a humble smile.\n\nThere were a lot of them about at the time. In return for the legion of guitar-playing boys next door that were flocking across the Atlantic, we were receiving an amazing array of American talent. Rockers (black and white assorted, some famous, some not so), bluesmen (rural and urban, old and ancient), and a diverse selection of \"soul\" singers were all suddenly turning up on our shores. And it was the soul stars who were the darlings of the young and hip.\n\nIn truth, they were a mixed bunch. Some, like Solomon Burke and Ben E. King, proved to be even greater than their records had suggested, others (choose your own) would have done better to stay home and be admired from afar. But at least they were all greeted warmly at RSG where things were super and smashing so long as they loved our wonderful country and performed their hit(s) adequately. And then came James Brown.\n\nBrown didn't so much appear on RSG as dominate an hour of television that just happened to fill the program's regular spot. He strutted and stamped and screamed, he sweated and grunted and fell on his knees (and screamed), he danced across the stage like he had skates on and then charged around the studio, through the audience, and back again (screaming). In short, he was quite uncontrollable, and he kept it up for the entire show, pouring out barely intelligible lyrics while his bloody great band hit chords that fractured nerves and hammered relentless riffs without mercy.\nAll in all, he was quite magnificent. Little old ladies in faraway places were moved to bombard TV Times with outraged invective, including, as I recall (although this may possibly be my fancy), a cry of \"why are these monkeys allowed on TV instead of our own great stars like Helen Shapiro?\" Even the oh-so-hipsters retreated behind a screen of confusion from where they still hurl the occasional brickbat. Yes indeed, Brown stirred reactions that had lain dormant since the hey-day of rock 'n' roll. Two years earlier Little Richard had perpetrated an hour of similar mayhem without any fuss, because even by 1964 rock had become comfortably old-hat, and anyway somehow it was always clear that really he was a sweet boy who just got carried away with himself. As far as the Ray Charles spectacular, screened shortly after \u2013 he was so acceptable, he was respectable. Brown was altogether more menacing. In fact, judging by the hysterical backlash you'd have thought he was some kind of revolutionary, bent on smashing the status quo. In a way, you'd have been right.\n\nFor the most part Brown has always been portrayed by the mass (i.e. predominantly white) media as a cunning opportunist. Energetic, certainly, sometimes even astute, but basically a musical bore who has achieved his success by understanding and using the mechanics of the industry to his great advantage. Part of this assessment is true enough \u2013 Brown has indeed skillfully manipulated his way to fame and fortune. It's the conclusion that this necessarily indicated musical poverty that's at fault.\n\nBefore Brown, black performers could either be true to themselves and accept the limited recognition/rewards that came their way, or bend to suit the mores of white establishment controlled show-biz. To a greater extent than is generally admitted this is still true, but at least black music and musicians are now an influential slice of the industry rather than an exploited sub-culture. It would be silly to promote Brown as the sole architect of this upheaval, there are too many other socio-political factors involved, but his has been the extreme example that defines the whole change. He has achieved more than any other single back entertainer, while continuing to produce music that is so intensely personal that it irritates many sensitive black souls, let alone white audiences.\n\nI'm not, here, going to attempt to examine how he achieved the hitherto impossible. Instead I urge you to take a fresh listen to the aural evidence of his defiant independence, for Brown's music has always been the clearest expression of the complex tangle of angry frustration, determination, raw energy and pride with which he has forged his career. Now, with other black bands beginning to break through with updated spin-offs from various Brown themes \u2013 and the Average White Band creating waves with a remarkably clever pastiche of what he was doing several years ago \u2013 there seem to be grounds for a calmer assessment than the old tooth 'n' nail \"he's fantastic/no he's trash\" arguments.\n\nAfter always deliberately vetoing any Greatest Hits/Best Of albums (because he's forever insisting that \"the best is yet to come\"), in the last couple of years Brown finally compromised by allowing American Polydor to put together two unsatisfactory compilations from his extensive repertoire, under the title Soul Classics. Malcolm Jones at British Polydor seized the opportunity to squeeze an extra four tracks onto each of the original volumes, and is now extending the series with a third album already issued and at least one more on the way.\n\nCompared to, say, Atlantic's Ray Charles Story or the recent Tamla Motown Anthology series, the Brown albums are a frustrating disappointment. The tracks have been drawn at random from all points of his long and complex career and jumbled illogically together without regard to recording dates or continuity of style and atmosphere; all of his extended performances have been issued in truncated form (usually 'Part One' only); and, perhaps the greatest sin, there has been no attempt to sketch in even the simplest of background details. The only sleevenote (500 words on Volume Three) suggests that Brown is probably \"the most important artist in the history of R&B music\" but does nothing about the packaging to contradict the usual impression of a prolific but shallow hit machine.\n\nHaving said that, it must be emphasised that there is far greater evidence of his talent in the grooves. With hardly a dud track amongst the 42 so far used, for the first time it's possible to obtain a meaty selection of Brown\u2019s important recordings without forking out for 20 or 30 albums or a shelf full of singles. Assuming that we'll have to wait until his death before someone takes the trouble to collate a better sampling of the man's work, I wholeheartedly recommend Soul Classics and offer the following notes as a guide around his maze of recordings.\n\nAlthough cut-and-dried divisions are necessarily an over-simplification, there have been several distinct phases in the revolution of Brown's music reflecting parallel changes I his career. Using these as a base, I have suffixed the album tracks A to F and then summarized the six ages of Brown, craftily headed by appropriate song titles from the relevant period. Included are some generalisations which ardent discographers may wish to pick holes. Don't write and tell me \u2013 I'm just trying to make an awkward job less difficult.

In case you don't and were about to be confused, here's a bit of background detail: At the beginning of 1956, Brown (and The Famous Flames) were signed by King Records of Cincinnati who issued his records on their subsidary, Fedral, until November 1960 when they were transferred to the parent label. By the end of 1963 Brown had clashed so often with his producers and King's boss Syd Nathan that he ignored his contract and sent his own recordings to Smash, a division of Mercury. Although he was eventually forced to return to Kind until 1971 when he joined Polydor, he retained complete control of his own recordings. He'd stopped using the Famous Flames on record by mid-1964, but kept them as part of the stage show for a couple more years.\n\nWhat d'ya mean you're still confused?\n\nAnd now, to the music....\n\n(A) Messing With The Blues (Feb 1956 \u2013 Jan. 1959)\n\nThe sharp-eyed among you will have noticed that there are no tracks suffixed (A). Brown's first eight sessions yielded 32 tracks with vocal group the Famous Flames, using studio musicians mainly supervised by King's A&R man Gene Redd. With the exception of the very first release 'Please, Please, Please', a beautifully adapted gospel song 'Try Me', and the last side from these sessions 'Bewildered', they were a commercial disaster. Stylistically they were nothing new, borrowing from earlier gospel-based R&B groups like the Dominoes and, in particular, the Five Royales. However Brown was never much of a singer in the accepted sense of the word so the overall sound was much rawer than the predecessors. As American writer Alan Leeds once observed, it was \"rather like Little Richard leading The Drifters\". When you consider that these are the only sides by Brown that year average '50s vocal group specialist deigns to collect, you'll realise how far removed they are from his later work.\n\nSo far Soul Classics ignores these formative sessions, but as well as the three tracks mentioned there are several other interesting examples of Brown's/the group's/the company's search for identity which ought to be aired again, including a frantic rocker 'Chonnie-On-Chon', a novelty song 'That Dood It', and an intense blues 'Why Does Everything Happen To Me'. Collectors who want to hear these and more should look out for Brown's first two LP's. Please, Please, Please (King 610, reissued 909) and Try Me/The Unbeatable JB (King 635, reissued 919), released here on London HA8231 and HA 8203 respectively. Long deleted, they still occasionally turn up in discount stores and oldies lists.\n\n(B) I Got The Money (June 1959 \u2013 Oct. 1963)\n\nIn the strength of his first national hit ('Try Me'), Brown was signed by a major booking agency, assembled a permanent road band, and began recording highly original, exciting hits. With each success he increased the size of his band and stage-show; by 1962 he'd become America's foremost R&B star. The following year he was awarded million dollar sales for Live At The Apollo, gained his first pop Top 20 entry ('Prisoner Of Love'), and prepared to divorce himself from King.\n\nWith a well-rehearsed tight little band punching in and around his unorthodox phrasing, each new record took him further away from his contemporaries and closer to a realistic expression of his own emotions. Unexpected changes of tempo; sudden stops between verses, or even within verses; and a three-sided interplay between Brown, the band, and the Famous Flames, were used on both the fast numbers \u2013 the foundation of his intricate dance routines \u2013 and the pleading love songs which he extended into hysterical sermons.\nSoul Classics includes a few of the best known uptempo tracks (although they've missed the finest of the lot, 'I Got Money'), but all the great wailers are omitted, including 'You've Got The Power', 'The Bells', 'I Don't Mind', 'Baby You're Right', 'Like A Baby', and the superb 'Lost Someone'. Hopefully, future volumes will do something about this. In the meantime Polydor are going one better by reissuing Live At The Apollo. A historic recording by anybody's standards, it captures the young emergent Brown at the precise moment of fruition, when all of his energy and ideas gelled in one cataclysmic performance. Never known to be self-effacing, Brown refers to it simply as \"a masterpiece\". I'm inclined to agree. BUY IT.\n\n(C) Brand New Bag (Jan. 1964 \u2013 Jan. 1967).\n\nThe triumphant expression of independent success. From now on Brown is solely responsible for his own recordings and cuts sides all over America, wherever he happens to be at the moment of inspiration. Results are erratic, not only artistically but technically (for instance, 'Money Won't Change You', cut at the Talent-Master studios in New York, is so badly mixed it's liable to shatter your stylus. Live At The Garden, recorded six months later in New Jersey, is even worse. It should never have been issued). But the best are by far the most unique recordings ever made by a \"rhythm & blues\" singer. Aided by his bandleader Nat Jones, Brown begins to break down traditional forms of song construction. Hits like 'Out Of Sight' (cut in Chicago), 'Papa's got a Brand New Bag (Charlotte, North Carolina), and 'I Got You' (Miami) introduce new concepts in rhythmic progression which owe nothing to King Records or indeed anyone else except Brown and his alter ego, the band.\n\nThis was JB's peak period of white acceptance; the years in which he scored his biggest \"pop\" hits. Although this was partly due to the compulsive attraction of his new style for dancers, it was as much a mood of the times, for this was during the first \"R&B boom\" when all black entertainers were suddenly the in thing. Being the most flamboyant, Brown got the lion's share of attention \u2013 until it was realised just how disturbing he really was. His most widely acclaimed hit from this time, 'It's A Man's, Man's Man's World' had little to do with the overall development of his music, being an intensely performed ballad, written by someone else and recorded with a large orchestra.\n\n(D) It's A New Day (May 1967 \u2013 Nov. 1969)\n\nAlfred Ellis takes over from Jones to help Brown complete his rejection of conventional music. The hits become loose two-part improvisations over which Brown is virtually scat singing. White audiences get confused and begin to lose interest, but his impact on black music is immense and can be heard today in a wide range of derivations, from street funk bands to calmer recordings like Ben E. King's 'Supernatural Thing'. At the same time, many of his lyrics reflect his involvement in social programmes and political manoeuvring.\n\nIn many ways this was Brown's peak. His music had become so individualistic that it defied categorization; personally he radiated the charisma of a crusading politician; he was expanding his small autonomous corporation to include various other business ventures; and there was seemingly nothing on the horizon to threaten him. In fact his conflicting, and often na\u00efve, political assertions started to backfire; some of his projects (a night club and a chain of restaurants) soon collapsed, and younger black musicians (Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone) were already making waves that would rock his boat.\n\nAlthough Soul Classics includes most of the essential tracks from the period, they destroy much of the evidence of his creativity by using Part One's only. A great many extended records, including some of Brown's, are indeed totally unnecessary \u2013 often just an easy alternative to finding a flip side. However, performances like \u2018Cold Sweat\u2019, \u2018Mother Popcorn\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s A New Day\u2019 have got to be heard in toto to be fully appreciated. You wouldn\u2019t expect to find the first couple of minutes of \u2018Sad Eyed Lady\u2019 on a Best Of Dylan album would you? Well Brown shouldn\u2019t have suffered similar treatment here. I realise that time is at a premium on a multi-track compilation; nevertheless, these were arguably some of the most important and influential black records of the '60s, and it\u2019s a pity Polydor haven\u2019t shown than appropriate respect.\n\n(E) Superbad (April 1970 - May 1971)\n\nA short but vital period when Brown employed younger black musicians to recover from political ambiguity and the sudden loss of the band that had supported him through the sixties. (They left to try for a solo career as Maceo & All The King\u2019s Men). In just over a year he recorded some of his finest sides \u2013 all dynamic Afro-rhythmic hits that reaffirmed his commitment to black roots and enhanced his, by then, legendary reputation.\n\nThe driving force behind this rejuvenation were the two Collins brothers (Phelps \"Cat Fish\" \u2013 gtr, William \" Bootsy\" \u2013 bass) who were groomed by Brown as part of the New Dapps, transferred to the major league in his own JB\u2019s, and then left to form their own group the House Guests before doing a stint with Funkadelic. Although they only appeared on about half a dozen sides, their fresh approach left its mark on many of Brown\u2019s subsequent recordings.\n\n(F) Make It Funky (July 1971 \u2013 present day)\n\nWith many new bands building successful careers on the styles that Brown introduced in the '60s, he adopts his \u2018Godfather\u2019 image. But although, as a personality, he has become something of a grand old man of black music, he has so far refused to abandon young black audiences and continues to aim his records at that market. Obviously aware that he is no longer ahead of the field, his music has become erratic again in search for a new direction. At his best he is still unapproachable: often he is just an imitation of younger musicians.\n\nPart of the trouble is that Brown got bored. After a decade and a half of challenge during which, step by determined step, he achieved more or less everything he could have hoped for, he had nothing left to fight \u2013 so his music reflected dulled emotions. Finding that he could still sell records without any greater effort he started playing games, including calling a nondescript flipside 'Parts 15 & 16' and issuing two versions of the same song as consecutive singles.\n\nAlso, modern techniques in recording have done nothing for the man whose greatest performances have stemmed from \"live-in-studio\" sessions with his own band. Increasing use of pre-recorded backing tracks, multi-overdubs, and various electronic gadgets have proved a poor substitute for spontaneous creativity.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t believe that Brown is about to fade gracefully away. Now that his box-office receipts are down, record sales are becoming unpredictable, and other bands are carrying on where he left off, he has something to prove again. I\u2019d hazard a guess that in another ten years someone else will be writing a similar piece about Soul Classics that have yet to be recorded.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 19, "api_path": "/songs/6166233", "artist_names": "Rolling Stone (Ft.

In addition to being two of the most famous pop songwriters in the world, Swift and McCartney have spent the past year on similar journeys. McCartney, isolated at home in the U.K., recorded McCartney III. Like his first solo album, in 1970, he played nearly all of the instruments himself, resulting in some of his most wildly ambitious songs in a long time. Swift also took some new chances, writing over email with the National\u2019s Aaron Dessner and recording the raw folklore, which abandons arena pop entirely in favor of rich character songs. It\u2019s the bestselling album of 2020.\n\nSwift listened to McCartney III as she prepared for today\u2019s conversation; McCartney delved into folkore. Before the photo shoot, Swift caught up with his daughters Mary (who would be photographing them) and Stella (who designed Swift\u2019s clothes; the two are close friends). \u201cI\u2019ve met Paul a few times, mostly onstage at parties, but we\u2019ll get to that later,\u201d Swift writes. \u201cSoon he walks in with his wife, Nancy. They\u2019re a sunny and playful pair, and I immediately feel like this will be a good day. During the shoot, Paul dances and takes almost none of it too seriously and sings along to Motown songs playing from the speakers. A few times Mary scolds, \u2018Daaad, try to stand still!\u2019 And it feels like a window into a pretty awesome family dynamic. We walk into his office for a chat, and after I make a nervous request, Paul is kind enough to handwrite my favorite lyric of his and sign it. He makes a joke about me selling it, and I laugh because it\u2019s something I know I\u2019ll cherish for the rest of my life. That\u2019s around the time when we start talking about music.\u201d\n\nTaylor Swift: I think it\u2019s important to note that if this year had gone the way that we thought it was going to go, you and I would have played Glastonbury this year, and instead, you and I both made albums in isolation.\nPaul McCartney: Yeah!\n\nSwift: And I remember thinking it would have been so much fun because the times that I\u2019ve run into you, I correlate with being some of the most fun nights of my life. I was at a party with you, when everybody just started playing music. And it was Dave Grohl playing, and you\u2026\nMcCartney: You were playing one of his songs, weren\u2019t you?\n\nSwift: Yes, I was playing his song called \u201cBest of You,\u201d but I was playing it on piano, and he didn\u2019t recognize it until about halfway through. I just remember thinking, \u201cAre you the catalyst for the most fun times ever?\u201d Is it your willingness to get up and play music that makes everyone feel like this is a thing that can happen tonight?\n\nMcCartney: I mean, I think it\u2019s a bit of everything, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ll tell you who was very \u2026 Reese Witherspoon was like, \u201cAre you going to sing?\u201d I said \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to, yeah!\u201d She\u2019s bossing me around. So I said, \u201cWhoa,\u201d so it\u2019s a bit of that.\n\nSwift: I love that person, because the party does not turn musical without that person.\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, that\u2019s true.\n\nSwift: If nobody says, \u201cCan you guys play music?\u201d we\u2019re not going to invite ourselves up onstage at whatever living-room party it is.\n\nMcCartney: I seem to remember Woody Harrelson got on the piano, and he starts playing \u201cLet It Be,\u201d and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cI can do that better.\u201d So I said, \u201cCome on, move over, Woody.\u201d So we\u2019re both playing it. It was really nice.\u2026 I love people like Dan Aykroyd, who\u2019s just full of energy and he loves his music so much, but he\u2019s not necessarily a musician, but he just wanders around the room, just saying, \u201cYou got to get up, got to get up, do some stuff.\u201d\n\nSwift: I listened to your new record. And I loved a lot of things about it, but it really did feel like kind of a flex to write, produce, and play every instrument on every track. To me, that\u2019s like flexing a muscle and saying, \u201cI can do all this on my own if I have to.\u201d\n\nMcCartney: Well, I don\u2019t think like that, I must admit. I just picked up some of these instruments over the years. We had a piano at home that my dad played, so I picked around on that. I wrote the melody to \u201cWhen I\u2019m 64\u201d when I was, you know, a teenager.\n\nSwift: Wow.\n\nMcCartney: When the Beatles went to Hamburg, there were always drum kits knocking around, so when there was a quiet moment, I\u2019d say, \u201cDo you mind if I have a knock around?\u201d So I was able to practice, you know, without practicing. That\u2019s why I play right-handed. Guitar was just the first instrument I got. Guitar turned to bass; it also turned into ukulele, mandolin. Suddenly, it\u2019s like, \u201cWow,\u201d but it\u2019s really only two or three instruments.\n\nSwift: Well, I think that\u2019s downplaying it a little bit. In my mind, it came with a visual of you being in the country, kind of absorbing the sort of do-it-yourself [quality] that has had to come with the quarantine and this pandemic. I found that I\u2019ve adapted a do-it-yourself mentality to a lot of things in my career that I used to outsource.  I\u2019m just wondering what a day of recording in the pandemic looked like for you.\n\nMcCartney: Well, I\u2019m very lucky because I have a studio that\u2019s, like, 20 minutes away from where I live. We were in lockdown on a farm, a sheep farm with my daughter Mary and her four kids and her husband. So I had four of my grandkids, I had Mary, who\u2019s a great cook, so I would just drive myself to the studio. And there were two other guys that could come in and we\u2019d be very careful and distanced and everything: my engineer Steve, and then my equipment guy Keith. So the three of us made the record, and I just started off. I had to do a little bit of film music \u2014 I had to do an instrumental for a film thing \u2014 so I did that. And I just kept going, and that turned into the opening track on the album. I would just come in, say, \u201cOh, yeah, what are we gonna do?\u201d [Then] have some sort of idea, and start doing it. Normally, I\u2019d start with the instrument I wrote it on, either piano or guitar, and then probably add some drums and then a bit of bass till it started to sound like a record, and then just gradually layer it all up. It was fun. What about yours? You\u2019re playing guitar and piano on yours.\nSwift: Yeah, on some of it, but a lot of it was made with Aaron Dessner, who\u2019s in a band called the National that I really love. And I had met him at a concert a year before, and I had a conversation with him, asking him how he writes. It\u2019s my favorite thing to ask people who I\u2019m a fan of. And he had an interesting answer. He said, \u201cAll the band members live in different parts of the world. So I make tracks. And I send them to our lead singer, Matt, and he writes the top line.\u201d I just remember thinking, \u201cThat is really efficient.\u201d And I kind of stored it in my brain as a future idea for a project. You know, how you have these ideas\u2026\u2009\u201cMaybe one day I\u2019ll do this.\u201d I always had in my head: \u201cMaybe one day I\u2019ll work with Aaron Dessner.\u201d\n\nSo when lockdown happened, I was in L.A., and we kind of got stuck there. It\u2019s not a terrible place to be stuck. We were there for four months maybe, and during that time, I sent an email to Aaron Dessner and I said, \u201cDo you think you would want to work during this time? Because my brain is all scrambled, and I need to make something, even if we\u2019re just kind of making songs that we don\u2019t know what will happen\u2026\u201d\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, that was the thing. You could do stuff \u2014 you didn\u2019t really worry it was going to turn into anything.\n\nSwift: Yeah, and it turned out he had been writing instrumental tracks to keep from absolutely going crazy during the pandemic as well, so he sends me this file of probably 30 instrumentals, and the first one I opened ended up being a song called \u201cCardigan,\u201d and it really happened rapid-fire like that. He\u2019d send me a track; he\u2019d make new tracks, add to the folder; I would write the entire top line for a song, and he wouldn\u2019t know what the song would be about, what it was going to be called, where I was going to put the chorus. I had originally thought, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll make an album in the next year, and put it out in January or something,\u201d but it ended up being done and we put it out in July. And I just thought there are no rules anymore, because I used to put all these parameters on myself, like, \u201cHow will this song sound in a stadium? How will this song sound on radio?\u201d If you take away all the parameters, what do you make? And I guess the answer is folklore.\n\nMcCartney: And it\u2019s more music for yourself than music that\u2019s got to go do a job. My thing was similar to that: After having done this little bit of film music, I had a lot of stuff that I had been working on, but I\u2019d said, \u201cI\u2019m just going home now,\u201d and it\u2019d be left half-finished. So I just started saying, \u201cWell, what about that? I never finished that.\u201d So we\u2019d pull it out, and we said, \u201cOh, well, this could be good.\u201d And because it didn\u2019t have to amount to anything, I would say, \u201cAh, I really want to do tape loops. I don\u2019t care if they fit on this song, I just want to do some.\u201d So I go and make some tape loops, and put them in the song, just really trying to do stuff that I fancy.\n\nI had no idea it would end up as an album; I may have been a bit less indulgent, but if a track was eight minutes long, to tell you the truth, what I thought was, \u201cI\u2019ll be taking it home tonight, Mary will be cooking, the grandkids will all be there running around, and someone, maybe Simon, Mary\u2019s husband, is going to say, \u2018What did you do today?\u2019 And I\u2019m going to go, \u2018Oh,\u2019 and then get my phone and play it for them.\u201d So this became the ritual.\n\nSwift: That\u2019s the coziest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nMcCartney: Well, it\u2019s like eight minutes long, and I said, \u201cI hate it when I\u2019m playing someone something and it finishes after three minutes.\u201d I kind of like that it just [continues] on.\n\nSwift: You want to stay in the zone.\n\nMcCartney: It just keeps going on. I would just come home, \u201cWell, what did you do today?\u201d \u201cOh, well, I did this. I\u2019m halfway through this,\u201d or, \u201cWe finished this.\u201d\n\nSwift: I was wondering about the numerology element to McCartney III. McCartney I, II, and III have all come out on years with zeroes.\n\nMcCartney: Ends of decades.\n\nSwift: Was that important?\nMcCartney: Yeah, well, this was being done in 2020, and I didn\u2019t really think about it. I think everyone expected great things of 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be great! Look at that number! 2020! Auspicious!\u201d Then suddenly Covid hit, and it was like, \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be auspicious all right, but maybe for the wrong reasons.\u201d Someone said to me, \u201cWell, you put out McCartney right after the Beatles broke up, and that was 1970, and then you did McCartney II in 1980.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to release this in 2020 just for whatever you call it, the numerology.\u2026\u201d\n\nSwift: The numerology, the kind of look, the symbolism. I love numbers. Numbers kind of rule my whole world. The numbers 13\u2009 \u2026 89 is a big one. I have a few others that I find\u2026\n\nMcCartney: Thirteen is lucky for some.\n\nSwift: Yeah, it\u2019s lucky for me. It\u2019s my birthday. It\u2019s all these weird coincidences of good things that have happened. Now, when I see it places, I look at it as a sign that things are going the way they\u2019re supposed to. They may not be good now, they could be painful now, but things are on a track. I don\u2019t know, I love the numerology.\n\nMcCartney: It\u2019s spooky, Taylor. It\u2019s very spooky. Now wait a minute: Where\u2019d you get 89?\n\nSwift: That\u2019s when I was born, in 1989, and so I see it in different places and I just think it\u2019s\u2026\n\nMcCartney: No, it\u2019s good. I like that, where certain things you attach yourself to, and you get a good feeling off them. I think that\u2019s great.\n\nSwift: Yeah, one of my favorite artists, Bon Iver, he has this thing with the number 22. But I was also wondering: You have always kind of seeked out a band or a communal atmosphere with like, you know, the Beatles and Wings, and then Egypt Station. I thought it was interesting when I realized you had made a record with no one else. I just wondered, did that feel natural?\n\nMcCartney: It\u2019s one of the things I\u2019ve done. Like with McCartney, because the Beatles had broken up, there was no alternative but to get a drum kit at home, get a guitar, get an amp, get a bass, and just make something for myself. So on that album, which I didn\u2019t really expect to do very well, I don\u2019t think it did. But people sort of say, \u201cI like that. It was a very casual album.\u201d It didn\u2019t really have to mean anything. So I\u2019ve done that, the play-everything-myself thing. And then I discovered synths and stuff, and sequencers, so I had a few of those at home. I just thought I\u2019m going to play around with this and record it, so that became McCartney II. But it\u2019s a thing I do. Certain people can do it. Stevie Wonder can do it. Stevie Winwood, I believe, has done it. So there are certain people quite like that.\n\nWhen you\u2019re working with someone else, you have to worry about their variances. Whereas your own variance, you kind of know it. It\u2019s just something I\u2019ve grown to like. Once you can do it, it becomes a little bit addictive. I actually made some records under the name the Fireman.\n\nSwift: Love a pseudonym.\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, for the fun! But, you know, let\u2019s face it, you crave fame and attention when you\u2019re young. And I just remembered the other day, I was the guy in the Beatles that would write to journalists and say [speaks in a formal voice]: \u201cWe are a semiprofessional rock combo, and I\u2019d think you\u2019d like [us].\u2026 We\u2019ve written over 100 songs (which was a lie), my friend John and I. If you mention us in your newspaper\u2026\u201d You know, I was always, like, craving the attention.\n\nSwift: The hustle! That\u2019s so great, though.\n\nMcCartney: Well, yeah, you need that.\n\nSwift: Yeah, I think, when a pseudonym comes in is when you still have a love for making the work and you don\u2019t want the work to become overshadowed by this thing that\u2019s been built around you, based on what people know about you. And that\u2019s when it\u2019s really fun to create fake names and write under them.\n\nMcCartney: Do you ever do that?\n\nSwift: Oh, yeah.\n\nMcCartney: Oh, yeah? Oh, well, we didn\u2019t know that! Is that a widely known fact?\n\nSwift: I think it is now, but it wasn\u2019t. I wrote under the name Nils Sj\u00f6berg because those are two of the most popular names of Swedish males. I wrote this song called \u201cThis Is What You Came For\u201d that Rihanna ended up singing. And nobody knew for a while. I remembered always hearing that when Prince wrote \u201cManic Monday,\u201d they didn\u2019t reveal it for a couple of months.\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, it also proves you can do something without the fame tag. I did something for Peter and Gordon; my girlfriend\u2019s brother and his mate were in a band called Peter and Gordon. And I used to write under the name Bernard Webb.\n\nSwift: [Laughs.] That\u2019s a good one! I love it.\n\nMcCartney: As Americans call it, Ber-nard Webb. I did the Fireman thing. I worked with a producer, a guy called Youth, who\u2019s this real cool dude. We got along great. He did a mix for me early on, and we got friendly. I would just go into the studio, and he would say, \u201cHey, what about this groove?\u201d and he\u2019d just made me have a little groove going. He\u2019d say, \u201cYou ought to put some bass on it. Put some drums on it.\u201d I\u2019d just spend the whole day putting stuff on it. And we\u2019d make these tracks, and nobody knew who Fireman was for a while. We must have sold all of 15 copies.\n\nSwift: Thrilling, absolutely thrilling.\n\nMcCartney: And we didn\u2019t mind, you know?\n\nSwift: I think it\u2019s so cool that you do projects that are just for you. Because I went with my family to see you in concert in 2010 or 2011, and the thing I took away from the show most was that it was the most selfless set list I had ever seen. It was completely geared toward what it would thrill us to hear. It had new stuff, but it had every hit we wanted to hear, every song we\u2019d ever cried to, every song people had gotten married to, or been brokenhearted to. And I just remembered thinking, \u201cI\u2019ve got to remember that,\u201d that you do that set list for your fans.\n\nMcCartney: You do that, do you?\n\nSwift: I do now. I think that learning that lesson from you taught me at a really important stage in my career that if people want to hear \u201cLove Story\u201d and \u201cShake It Off,\u201d and I\u2019ve played them 300 million times, play them the 300-millionth-and-first time. I think there are times to be selfish in your career, and times to be selfless, and sometimes they line up.\n\nMcCartney: I always remembered going to concerts as a kid, completely before the Beatles, and I really hoped they would play the ones I loved. And if they didn\u2019t, it was kind of disappointing. I had no money, and the family wasn\u2019t wealthy. So this would be a big deal for me, to save up for months to afford the concert ticket.\n\nSwift: Yeah, it feels like a bond. It feels like that person on the stage has given something, and it makes you as a crowd want to give even more back, in terms of applause, in terms of dedication. And I just remembered feeling that bond in the crowd, and thinking, \u201cHe\u2019s up there playing these Beatles songs, my dad is crying, my mom is trying to figure out how to work her phone because her hands are shaking so much.\u201d Because seeing the excitement course through not only me, but my family and the entire crowd in Nashville, it just was really special. I love learning lessons and not having to learn them the hard way. Like learning nice lessons I really value.\n\nMcCartney: Well, that\u2019s great, and I\u2019m glad that set you on that path. I understand people who don\u2019t want to do that, and if you do, they\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a jukebox show.\u201d I hear what they\u2019re saying. But I think it\u2019s a bit of a cheat, because the people who come to our shows have spent a lot of money. We can afford to go to a couple of shows and it doesn\u2019t make much difference. But a lot of ordinary working folks\u2009\u2026\u2009it\u2019s a big event in their life, and so I try and deliver. I also, like you say, try and put in a few weirdos.\n\nSwift: That\u2019s the best. I want to hear current things, too, to update me on where the artist is. I was wondering about lyrics, and where you were lyrically when you were making this record. Because when I was making folklore, I went lyrically in a total direction of escapism and romanticism. And I wrote songs imagining I was, like, a pioneer woman in a forbidden love affair [laughs]. I was completely\u2009\u2026\n\nMcCartney: Was this \u201cI want to give you a child\u201d? Is that one of the lines?\n\nSwift: Oh, that\u2019s a song called \u201cPeace.\u201d\n\nMcCartney: \u201cPeace,\u201d I like that one.\n\nSwift: \u201cPeace\u201d is actually more rooted in my personal life. I know you have done a really excellent job of this in your personal life: carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you\u2019ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living. I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives. I can\u2019t control if there\u2019s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow.\n\nMcCartney: So how does that go? Does your partner sympathize with that and understand?\n\nSwift: Oh, absolutely.\n\nMcCartney: They have to, don\u2019t they?\n\nSwift: But I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids. Whether that\u2019s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture \u2014 the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it\u2019s really just trying to find bits of normalcy. That\u2019s what that song \u201cPeace\u201d is talking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave? Stella always tells me that she had as normal a childhood as she could ever hope for under the circumstances.\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, it was very important to us to try and keep their feet on the ground amongst the craziness.\n\nSwift: She went to a regular school\u2009.\u2026\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, she did.\n\nSwift: And you would go trick-or-treating with them, wearing masks.\n\nMcCartney: All of them did, yeah. It was important, but it worked pretty well, because when they kind of reached adulthood, they would meet other kids who might have gone to private schools, who were a little less grounded.\n\nAnd they could be the budding mothers to [kids]. I remember Mary had a friend, Orlando. Not Bloom. She used to really counsel him. And it\u2019s \u2019cause she\u2019d gone through that. Obviously, they got made fun of, my kids. They\u2019d come in the classroom and somebody would sing, \u201cNa na na na,\u201d you know, one of the songs. And they\u2019d have to handle that. They\u2019d have to front it out.\n\nSwift: Did that give you a lot of anxiety when you had kids, when you felt like all this pressure that\u2019s been put on me is spilling over onto them, that they didn\u2019t sign up for it? Was that hard for you?\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, a little bit, but it wasn\u2019t like it is now. You know, we were just living a kind of semi-hippie life, where we withdrew from a lot of stuff. The kids would be doing all the ordinary things, and their school friends would be coming up to the house and having parties, and it was just great. I remember one lovely evening when it was Stella\u2019s birthday, and she brought a bunch of school kids up. And, you know, they\u2019d all ignore me. It happens very quickly. At first they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, yeah, he\u2019s like a famous guy,\u201d and then it\u2019s like [yawns]. I like that. I go in the other room and suddenly I hear this music going on. And one of the kids, his name was Luke, and he\u2019s doing break dancing.\n\nSwift: Ohhh!\n\nMcCartney: He was a really good break dancer, so all the kids are hanging out. That allowed them to be kind of normal with those kids. The other thing is, I don\u2019t live fancy. I really don\u2019t. Sometimes it\u2019s a little bit of an embarrassment, if I\u2019ve got someone coming to visit me, or who I know\u2026\n\nSwift: Cares about that stuff?\n\nMcCartney: Who\u2019s got a nice big house, you know. Quincy Jones came to see me and I\u2019m, like, making him a veggie burger or something. I\u2019m doing some cooking. This was after I\u2019d lost Linda, in between there. But the point I\u2019m making is that I\u2019m very consciously thinking, \u201cOh, God, Quincy\u2019s got to be thinking, \u2018What is this guy on? He hasn\u2019t got big things going on. It\u2019s not a fancy house at all. And we\u2019re eating in the kitchen! He\u2019s not even got the dining room going,\u2019\u201d you know?\n\nSwift: I think that sounds like a perfect day.\n\nMcCartney: But that\u2019s me. I\u2019m awkward like that. That\u2019s my kind of thing. Maybe I should have, like, a big stately home. Maybe I should get a staff. But I think I couldn\u2019t do that. I\u2019d be so embarrassed. I\u2019d want to walk around dressed as I want to walk around, or naked, if I wanted to.\n\nSwift: That can\u2019t happen in Downton Abbey.\n\nMcCartney: [Laughs.] Exactly.\n\nSwift: I remember what I wanted to know about, which is lyrics. Like, when you\u2019re in this kind of strange, unparalleled time, and you\u2019re making this record, are lyrics first? Or is it when you get a little melodic idea?\n\nMcCartney: It was a bit of both. As it kind of always is with me. There\u2019s no fixed way. People used to ask me and John, \u201cWell, who does the words, who does the music?\u201d I used to say, \u201cWe both do both.\u201d We used to say we don\u2019t have a formula, and we don\u2019t want one. Because the minute we get a formula, we should rip it up. I will sometimes, as I did with a couple of songs on this album, sit down at the piano and just start noodling around, and I\u2019ll get a little idea and start to fill that out. So the lyrics \u2014 for me, it\u2019s following a trail. I\u2019ll start [sings \u201cFind My Way,\u201d a song from McCartney III]: \u201cI can find my way. I know my left from right, da da da.\u201d And I\u2019ll just sort of fill it in. Like, we know this song, and I\u2019m trying to remember the lyrics. Sometimes I\u2019ll just be inspired by something. I had a little book which was all about the constellations and the stars and the orbits of Venus and.\u2026\n\nSwift: Oh, I know that song \u2014 \u201cThe Kiss of Venus\u201d?\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, \u201cThe Kiss of Venus.\u201d And I just thought, \u201cThat\u2019s a nice phrase.\u201d So I was actually just taking phrases out of the book, harmonic sounds. And the book is talking about the maths of the universe, and how when things orbit around each other, and if you trace all the patterns, it becomes like a lotus flower.\n\nSwift: Wow.\n\nMcCartney: It\u2019s very magical.\n\nSwift: That is magical. I definitely relate to needing to find magical things in this very not-magical time, needing to read more books and learn to sew, and watch movies that take place hundreds of years ago. In a time where, if you look at the news, you just want to have a panic attack \u2014 I really relate to the idea that you are thinking about stars and constellations.\n\nMcCartney: Did you do that on folklore?\n\nSwift: Yes. I was reading so much more than I ever did, and watching so many more films.\n\nMcCartney: What stuff were you reading?\n\nSwift: I was reading, you know, books like Rebecca, by Daphne du Maurier, which I highly recommend, and books that dealt with times past, a world that doesn\u2019t exist anymore. I was also using words I always wanted to use \u2014 kind of bigger, flowerier, prettier words, like \u201cepiphany,\u201d in songs. I always thought, \u201cWell, that\u2019ll never track on pop radio,\u201d but when I was making this record, I thought, \u201cWhat tracks? Nothing makes sense anymore. If there\u2019s chaos everywhere, why don\u2019t I just use the damn word I want to use in the song?\u201d\n\nMcCartney: Exactly. So you\u2019d see the word in a book and think, \u201cI love that word\u201d?\n\nSwift: Yeah, I have favorite words, like \u201celegies\u201d and \u201cepiphany\u201d and \u201cdivorc\u00e9e,\u201d and just words that I think sound beautiful, and I have lists and lists of them.\nMcCartney: How about \u201cmarzipan\u201d?\n\nSwift: Love \"marzipan.\"\n\nMcCartney: The other day, I was remembering when we wrote \u201cLucy in the Sky With Diamonds\u201d: \u201ckaleidoscope.\u201d\n\nSwift: \u201cKaleidoscope\u201d is one of mine! I have a song on 1989, a song called \u201cWelcome to New York,\u201d that I put the word \u201ckaleidoscope\u201d in just because I\u2019m obsessed with the word.\nMcCartney: I think a love of words is a great thing, particularly if you\u2019re going to try to write a lyric, and for me, it\u2019s like, \u201cWhat is this going to say to that person?\u201d I often feel like I\u2019m writing to someone who is not doing so well. So I\u2019m trying to write songs that might help. Not in a goody-goody, crusading kind of way, but just thinking there have been so many times in my life when I\u2019ve heard a song and felt so much better. I think that\u2019s the angle I want, that inspirational thing.\n\nI remember once, a friend of mine from Liverpool, we were teenagers and we were going to a fairground. He was a schoolmate, and we had these jackets that had a little fleck in the material, which was the cool thing at the time.\n\nSwift: We should have done matching jackets for this photo shoot.\n\nMcCartney: Find me a fleck, I\u2019m in. But we went to the fair, and I just remember \u2014 this is what happens with songs \u2014 there was this girl at the fair. This is just a little Liverpool fair \u2014 it was in a place called Sefton Park \u2014 and there was this girl, who was so beautiful. She wasn\u2019t a star. She was so beautiful. Everyone was following her, and it\u2019s like, \u201cWow.\u201d It\u2019s like a magical scene, you know? But all this gave me a headache, so I ended up going back to his house \u2014 I didn\u2019t normally get headaches. And we thought, \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d So we put on the Elvis song \u201cAll Shook Up.\u201d By the end of that song, my headache had gone. I thought, you know, \u201cThat\u2019s powerful.\u201d\n\nSwift: That really is powerful.\n\nMcCartney: I love that, when people stop me in the street and say, \u201cOh, I was going through an illness and I listened to a lot of your stuff, and I\u2019m better now and it got me through,\u201d or kids will say, \u201cIt got me through exams.\u201d You know, they\u2019re studying, they\u2019re going crazy, but they put your music on. I\u2019m sure it happens with a lot of your fans. It inspires them, you know?\n\nSwift: Yeah, I definitely think about that as a goal. There\u2019s so much stress everywhere you turn that I kind of wanted to make an album that felt sort of like a hug, or like your favorite sweater that makes you feel like you want to put it on.\n\nMcCartney: What, a \u201ccardigan\u201d?\n\nSwift: Like a good cardigan, a good, worn-in cardigan. Or something that makes you reminisce on your childhood. I think sadness can be cozy. It can obviously be traumatic and stressful, too, but I kind of was trying to lean into sadness that feels like somehow enveloping in not such a scary way \u2014 like nostalgia and whimsy incorporated into a feeling like you\u2019re not all right. Because I don\u2019t think anybody was really feeling like they were in their prime this year. Isolation can mean escaping into your imagination in a way that\u2019s kind of nice.\n\nMcCartney: I think a lot of people have found that. I would say to people, \u201cI feel a bit guilty about saying I\u2019m actually enjoying this quarantine thing,\u201d and people go, \u201cYeah, I know, don\u2019t say it to anyone.\u201d A lot of people are really suffering.\n\nSwift: Because there\u2019s a lot in life that\u2019s arbitrary. Completely and totally arbitrary. And [the quarantine] is really shining a light on that, and also a lot of things we have that we outsource that you can actually do yourself.\n\nMcCartney: I love that. This is why I said I live simply. That\u2019s, like, at the core of it. With so many things, something goes wrong and you go, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll get somebody to fix that.\u201d And then it\u2019s like, \u201cNo, let me have a look at it.\u2026\u201d\n\nSwift: Get a hammer and a nail.\n\nMcCartney: \u201cMaybe I can put that picture up.\u201d It\u2019s not rocket science. The period after the Beatles, when we went to live in Scotland on a really \u2014 talk about dumpy \u2014 little farm. I mean, I see pictures of it now and I\u2019m not ashamed, but I\u2019m almost ashamed. Because it\u2019s like, \u201cGod, nobody\u2019s cleaned up around here.\u201d\n\nBut it was really a relief. Because when I was with the Beatles, we\u2019d formed Apple Records, and if I wanted a Christmas tree, someone would just buy it. And I thought, after a while, \u201cNo, you know what? I really would like to go and buy our Christmas tree. Because that\u2019s what everyone does.\u201d So you go down \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll have that one\u201d \u2014 and you carried it back. I mean, it\u2019s little, but it\u2019s huge at the same time.\n\nI needed a table in Scotland and I was looking through a catalog and I thought, \u201cI could make one. I did woodwork in school, so I know what a dovetail joint is.\u201d So I just figured it out. I\u2019m just sitting in the kitchen, and I\u2019m whittling away at this wood and I made this little joint. There was no nail technology \u2014 it was glue. And I was scared to put it together. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to fit,\u201d but one day, I got my woodwork glue and thought, \u201cThere\u2019s no going back.\u201d But it turned out to be a real nice little table I was very proud of. It was that sense of achievement.\n\nThe weird thing was, Stella went up to Scotland recently and I said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it there?\u201d and she said, \u201cNo.\u201d Anyway, I searched for it. Nobody remembered it. Somebody said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a pile of wood in the corner of one of the barns, maybe that\u2019s it. Maybe they used it for firewood.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not firewood.\u201d Anyway, we found it, and do you know how joyous that was for me? I was like, \u201cYou found my table?!\u201d Somebody might say that\u2019s a bit boring.\n\nSwift: No, it\u2019s cool!\n\nMcCartney: But it was a real sort of great thing for me to be able to do stuff for yourself. You were talking about sewing. I mean normally, in your position, you\u2019ve got any amount of tailors.\n\nSwift: Well, there\u2019s been a bit of a baby boom recently; several of my friends have gotten pregnant.\n\nMcCartney: Oh, yeah, you\u2019re at the age.\n\nSwift: And I was just thinking, \u201cI really want to spend time with my hands, making something for their children.\u201d So I made this really cool flying-squirrel stuffed animal that I sent to one of my friends. I sent a teddy bear to another one, and I started making these little silk baby blankets with embroidery. It\u2019s gotten pretty fancy. And I\u2019ve been painting a lot.\n\nMcCartney: What do you paint? Watercolors?\n\nSwift: Acrylic or oil. Whenever I do watercolor, all I paint is flowers. When I have oil, I really like to do landscapes. I always kind of return to painting a lonely little cottage on a hill.\nMcCartney: It\u2019s a bit of a romantic dream. I agree with you, though, I think you\u2019ve got to have dreams, particularly this year. You\u2019ve got to have something to escape to. When you say \u201cescapism,\u201d it sounds like a dirty word, but this year, it definitely wasn\u2019t. And in the books you\u2019re reading, you\u2019ve gone into that world. That\u2019s, I think, a great thing. Then you come back out. I normally will read a lot before I go to bed. So I\u2019ll come back out, then I\u2019ll go to sleep, so I think it really is nice to have those dreams that can be fantasies or stuff you want to achieve.\n\nSwift: You\u2019re creating characters. This was the first album where I ever created characters, or wrote about the life of a real-life person. There\u2019s a song called \u201cthe last great american dynasty\u201d that\u2019s about this real-life heiress who lived just an absolutely chaotic, hectic\u2026\nMcCartney: She\u2019s a fantasy character?\n\nSwift: She\u2019s a real person. Who lived in the house that I live in.\nMcCartney: She\u2019s a real person? I listened to that and I thought, \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n\nSwift: Her name was Rebekah Harkness. And she lived in the house that I ended up buying in Rhode Island. That\u2019s how I learned about her. But she was a woman who was very, very talked about, and everything she did was scandalous. I found a connection in that. But I also was thinking about how you write \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d and go into that whole story about what all these people in this town are doing and how their lives intersect, and I hadn\u2019t really done that in a very long time with my music. It had always been so microscope personal.\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, \u2019cause you were writing breakup songs like they were going out of style.\n\nSwift: I was, before my luck changed [laughs]. I still write breakup songs. I love a good breakup song. Because somewhere in the world, I always have a friend going through a breakup, and that will make me write one.\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, this goes back to this thing of me and John: When you\u2019ve got a formula, break it. I don\u2019t have a formula. It\u2019s the mood I\u2019m in. So I love the idea of writing a character. And, you know, trying to think, \u201cWhat am I basing this on?\u201d So \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d was based on old ladies I knew as a kid. For some reason or other, I got great relationships with a couple of local old ladies. I was thinking the other day, I don\u2019t know how I met them, it wasn\u2019t like they were family. I\u2019d just run into them, and I\u2019d do their shopping for them.\n\nSwift: That\u2019s amazing.\n\nMcCartney: It just felt good to me. I would sit and talk, and they\u2019d have amazing stories. That\u2019s what I liked. They would have stories from the wartime \u2014 because I was born actually in the war \u2014 and so these old ladies, they were participating in the war. This one lady I used to sort of just hang out with, she had a crystal radio that I found very magical. In the war, a lot of people made their own radios \u2014 you\u2019d make them out of crystals [sings The Twilight Zone theme].\n\nSwift: How did I not know this? That sounds like something I would have tried to learn about.\n\nMcCartney: It\u2019s interesting, because there is a lot of parallels with the virus and lockdowns and wartime. It happened to everyone. Like, this isn\u2019t HIV, or SARS, or Avian flu, which happened to others, generally. This has happened to everyone, all around the world. That\u2019s the defining thing about this particular virus. And, you know, my parents \u2026 it happened to everyone in Britain, including the queen and Churchill. War happened. So they were all part of this thing, and they all had to figure out a way through it. So you figured out folklore. I figured out McCartney III.\n\nSwift: And a lot of people have been baking sourdough bread. Whatever gets you through!\n\nMcCartney: Some people used to make radios. And they\u2019d take a crystal \u2014 we should look it up, but it actually is a crystal. I thought, \u201cOh, no, they just called it a crystal radio,\u201d but it\u2019s actually crystals like we know and love.\n\nSwift: Wow.\n\nMcCartney: And somehow they get the radio waves \u2014 this crystal attracts them \u2014 they tune it in, and that\u2019s how they used to get their news. Back to \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d so I would think of her and think of what she\u2019s doing and then just try to get lyrical, just try to bring poetry into it, words you love, just try to get images like \u201cpicks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been,\u201d and Father McKenzie \u201cis darning his socks in the night.\u201d You know, he\u2019s a religious man, so I could\u2019ve said, you know, \u201cpreparing his Bible,\u201d which would have been more obvious. But \u201cdarning his socks\u201d kind of says more about him. So you get into this lovely fantasy. And that\u2019s the magic of songs, you know. It\u2019s a black hole, and then you start doing this process, and then there\u2019s this beautiful little flower that you\u2019ve just made. So it is very like embroidery, making something.\n\nSwift: Making a table.\n\nMcCartney: Making a table.\n\nSwift: Wow, it would\u2019ve been so fun to play Glastonbury for the 50th anniversary together.\n\nMcCartney: It would\u2019ve been great, wouldn\u2019t it? And I was going to be asking you to play with me.\n\nSwift: Were you going to invite me? I was hoping that you would. I was going to ask you.\n\nMcCartney: I would\u2019ve done \u201cShake It Off.\u201d\n\nSwift: Oh, my God, that would have been amazing.\n\nMcCartney: I know it, it\u2019s in C!\n\nSwift: One thing I just find so cool about you is that you really do seem to have the joy of it, still, just no matter what. You seem to have the purest sense of joy of playing an instrument and making music, and that\u2019s just the best, I think.\n\nMcCartney: Well, we\u2019re just so lucky, aren\u2019t we?\n\nSwift: We\u2019re really lucky.\n\nMcCartney: I don\u2019t know if it ever happens to you, but with me, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, my god, I\u2019ve ended up as a musician.\u201d\n\nSwift: Yeah, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s my job.\n\nMcCartney: I must tell you a story I told Mary the other day, which is just one of my favorite little sort of Beatles stories. We were in a terrible, big blizzard, going from London to Liverpool, which we always did. We\u2019d be working in London and then drive back in the van, just the four of us with our roadie, who would be driving. And this was a blizzard. You couldn\u2019t see the road. At one point, it slid off and it went down an embankment. So it was \u201cAhhh,\u201d a bunch of yelling. We ended up at the bottom. It didn\u2019t flip, luckily, but so there we are, and then it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, how are we going to get back up? We\u2019re in a van. It\u2019s snowing, and there\u2019s no way.\u201d We\u2019re all standing around in a little circle, and thinking, \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d And one of us said, \u201cWell, something will happen.\u201d And I thought that was just the greatest. I love that, that\u2019s a philosophy.\n\nSwift: \u201cSomething will happen.\u201d\n\nMcCartney: And it did. We sort of went up the bank, we thumbed a lift, we got the lorry driver to take us, and Mal, our roadie, sorted the van and everything. So that was kind of our career. And I suppose that\u2019s like how I ended up being a musician and a songwriter: \u201cSomething will happen.\u201d\n\nSwift: That\u2019s the best.\n\nMcCartney: It\u2019s so stupid it\u2019s brilliant. It\u2019s great if you\u2019re ever in that sort of panic attack: \u201cOh, my God,\u201d or, \u201cAhhh, what am I going to do?\u201d\n\nSwift: \u201cSomething will happen.\u201d\n\nMcCartney: All right then, thanks for doing this, and this was, you know, a lot of fun.\n\nSwift: You\u2019re the best. This was so awesome. Those were some quality stories!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/607604", "artist_names": "Van Morrison", "full_title": "Blue Money by\u00a0Van\u00a0Morrison",

the book of Revelations\nAnd if people would just get and read the Bible\nAnd read the book of Revelations\nThey would really turn around and straighten up\nThis is all we need to do, is just get the good book\nAnd read it and put it to everyday life\n\n[Spoken: Curtis Mayfield]\nSisters\nNiggers\nWhiteys\nJews\nCrackers\nDon't worry\nIf there's hell below\nWe're all\nGonna go\n[Vocal]\nSisters\nBrothers and the whiteys\nBlacks and the crackers\nPolice and their backers\nThey're all political actors\n\nHurry\nPeople running from their worries\nWhile the judge and his juries\nDictate the law that's partly flaw\n\nCat calling\nLove balling, fussing and a-cussing\nTop billing now is killing\nFor peace, no one is willing\nKind of make you get that feeling\n\nEverybody smoke\nUse the pill and the dope\nEducated fools\nFrom uneducated schools\nPimping people is the rule\nPolluted water in the pool\nAnd Nixon talking 'bout, \"Don't worry\"\nHe say, \"Don't worry\"\nHe say, \"Don't worry\"\nHe say, \"Don't worry\"\nBut they don't know\nThere can be no show\nAnd if there's hell below\nWe're all gonna go\nYou might also likeEverybody praying\nAnd everybody saying\nBut

At a time when we've got policy cases against the Republicans on tax cuts, environment, education... and *this* is what the campaign's going to be about.\n\nCONGRESSMAN WADE: Now, Leo, most of us are just hearing the news.

He'll sit here, which means they're gonna have to light the room from the outside the window. Do they know that?\n\nLARRY: We'll let them know.\n\nTOBY: The last time they didn't know.

What do you need?\n\nJOSH: Can I give you a quick brief?\n\nC.J.: Sure.\n\nJOSH: The Justice Department's run out of money in their suit against the tobacco companies.\n\nC.J.: The Justice Department's overmatched.\n\nJOSH: Yeah, by hundreds of millions of dollars. They're asking for $30 million and we think they should have it.\n\nC.J.: Who disagrees with us?\n\nJOSH: Eight of the fifteen members of the subcommittee that controls the budgets for Justice and Commerce, including Kalmbach, who has significant ties to tobacco, and Warren and Rossiter, who do not.\n\nC.J.: We lost two Democrats?\n\nJOSH: They have ideological objections.\n\nC.J.: Yeah, it's just not a good time to be losing Democrats.\n\nJOSH: You haven't been in my office this morning.\n\nC.J.: We'll get them back.\n\nThey walk-and-talk down the HALLWAY.\n\nJOSH: Anyway, uh, Leo felt pretty strongly that we ought to light a fire under it, so I wrote up a strongly worded release.\n\nC.J.

Sam, you understand this conversation isn't ruling out Bartlet as a candidate, it's just a 'what if?' We're party strategists, it's what we're paid for.\n\nSAM: Yeah.\n\nMAN: Hoynes is the only one that put together the money this fast.\n\nPHILLIPS: He's the most successful fundraiser this party's ever had.\n\nMAN: Though, obviously, it would be easier if Hoynes was running as an incumbent...\n\nSAM (has heard enough): Okay.\n\nPHILLIPS: Sam...\n\nSAM (shutting his portfolio): Thanks.\n\nPHILLIPS: No, it was an inappropriate...\n\nSAM: When I say 'okay,' that's it.

That means it has a surface wind speed of something.\n\nCHARLIE: Yes, sir.\n\nBARTLET: Isn't it strange to have a tropical storm in May?\n\nCHARLIE: I'm not certain.\n\nBARTLET: I'm pretty sure there's a season and this isn't it.\n\nCHARLIE: I could have someone find out for you, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET: I mean it's not a big deal.

LANDINGHAM\nEveryone says \"Our Father.\"\n\nJed picks up another file from her desk and they both walk out of her office\ninto the\nhallway. They pedeconference.\n\nJED\nCatholics don't.

I can't imagine that anyone in your\nfamily's on\nwork-study.\n\nJED\nNo, I-I get free tuition, so, you know, I guess it's a good idea to give\nsomething back.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nWhy do you call your father \"sir\"?\n\nJED\n[chuckles softly] Is this gonna be a whole afternoon of questions?\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nWell, actually, you've been talking for quite some time.\n\nJED\nI'm sorry. Am I boring you, Dolores?\n\nMRS.

PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS\nBartlet and Abbey are seated next to each other in the back seat. Bartlet,\nlooking very\npreoccupied and melancholy, stares out the window on his side. Abbey stares\nstraight\nahead. The silence between them is deafening. After a few moments, Abbey\nturns slowly\nto look at him.\n\nABBEY\n[gently] You know, they released the girl from the hospital this morning.\n\nBartlet acknowledges her words, but does not look at her. He barely turns\nhis eyes from\nthe window.\n\nBARTLET\nThe driver?\n\nABBEY\nYeah...She fractured her wrist, some stitches over her eye, and the other\ntwo had some\nscratches and bruises. [clears throat softly] It looks like they're gonna\ncharge her with\nvehicular manslaughter.\n\nAbbey looks over at him, but he doesn't respond. He just stares out the\nwindow. She\nlooks away, somewhat discouraged, but trying to figure out another way to\nreach him.\n\nABBEY\nFrank Mitchell, Joanna... Bill Carney... they told me they were in meetings\nall morning.\n\nBARTLET\n[absently] Yeah.\n\nAbbey pauses and glances at him tentatively. When she does speak, her manner\nand the look\non her face suggest that she doesn't fully agree with the viewpoint that\nshe describes.\n\nABBEY\nThe consensus seems to be that if you step back, and put your support behind\nHoynes,\nthere's a decent chance the Democrats can keep the White House.\n\nBartlet keeps staring out the window. After a long pause, he nods slightly.\n\nBARTLET\nThe world'll rest easier.\n\nAbbey seems a bit stunned by his response. She stares at him, wide eyed,\nfor several\nmoments, and then slowly looks away, resigned and sad. She looks almost like\nshe's\nabout to cry.\n\nBARTLET\nWe're here.\n\nCUT TO: EXT.

He lets her take it but doesn't react.\nThey walk inside.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Once\nBartlet and Abbey are seated, Monohan stands up. He is accompanied to the\npulpit by a\nlayperson.

go\nYou raise the left arm up and your right arm too\nLet me tell you just what to do, start both of 'em to flapping\nStart your feet to kicking, that's when you know\nYou doin' the funky chicken\n\nSlick and spasm, you got both arms up, across your face\nYou knees start wiggling, all over the place\nYou flap your arms and your feet start kicking\nThen you know you doin' the funky chicken\n\nOh, I'm feeling it now, I feel so unnecessary\nThis is the kind, this is the kind of stuff\nTo make you feel like you want to do something nasty\nLike waste some chicken gravy on your white shirt\nRight down front, here we go y'all\n\nYou work both arms and you work both feet\nUse a dab of gravy, you right on the beat\nYou flap your arms and your feet start kicking\nThe you know you doin' the funky chicken\n\nDoin' the funky chicken, y'all\nDoin' the funky chicken, y'all\nDoin' the funky chicken, y'allYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

Beard Script LyricsJERRY'S APARTMENT.\n\nJERRY: Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.\n\nELAINE: I know. I need a lesson.\n\nJERRY: You stink. You know you stink. What is this?\n\nELAINE: Oh. My ballet tickets.\n\nJERRY: Oh. Your ballet tickets.\nELAINE: Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?\n\nJERRY: No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.\n\nELAINE: You know, I'm going as a beard.\n\nJERRY: A beard?\n\nELAINE: Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.\n\nJERRY: Yes.\n\nELAINE: So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.\n\nJERRY: Why are you doing this?\n\nELAINE: Swan Lake, at the Met.\n\n(Kramer enters.)\n\nKRAMER: Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.\n\nELAINE: Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?\n\nJERRY: Yeah.\nELAINE: Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?\n\nKRAMER: I think he looks fantastic.\n\nELAINE: Oh, come on.\n\nKRAMER: No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.\n\n(George enters, wearing a toupee.)\n\nGEORGE: Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.\n\nELAINE: You look ridiculous in that thing.\n\nGEORGE: Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?\n\nELAINE: Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.\n\nGEORGE: Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.\n\nKRAMER: You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.\n\nJERRY: Well what about me?\n\nKRAMER: No I think he's got you beat buddy.\nGEORGE: So she's gorgeous.\n\nKRAMER: Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.\n\nGEORGE: Well have you got a picture?\n\nKRAMER: No.\n\nGEORGE: Well, I have to see her.\n\nKRAMER: Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.\n\nGEORGE: Really?\n\nKRAMER: Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.\n\nGEORGE: Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?\n\nKRAMER: Yeah, yeah. I think he will.\n\nJERRY: It sounds like an excellent idea.\n\nKRAMER: Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.\n\n(Jerry, George, and Kramer walking down the street.)\n\nGEORGE: Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.\n\nKRAMER: Here you go brother. Some food for you.\n\nHOMELESS MAN: Thank you. You're a good man. Bless you.\n\nKRAMER: Now are you going to be here in an hour?\n\nHOMELESS MAN: Where am I going?\n\nAT THE POLICE STATION.\n\nKRAMER: Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?\n\nLOU: Almond?\n\nKRAMER: Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.\n\nGEORGE: Pouty? I like that.\n\nJERRY: You can't go wrong with pouty.\n\nGEORGE: I'm excited about the pouty.\n\nLOU: All right I think that about does it.\n\nKRAMER: All right George, come on, take a look.\n\nGEORGE: Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.\n\nJERRY: Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?\n\nLOU: Oh, that's Sergeant Tierney. Nice officer. You want to meet her?\n\n(Walking down the street.)\n\nGEORGE: Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?\n\nJERRY: Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.\n\nKRAMER: Hey, man. Enjoy the food?\n\nHOMELESS MAN: Yes I did. Where did the Chinese learn to cook like that?\n\nKRAMER: Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.\n\nHOMELESS MAN: I don't think so.\n\nKRAMER: Woah, woah, that's mine.\n\nHOMELESS MAN: You gave it to me.\n\nKRAMER: No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.\n\nHOMELESS MAN: You should have said something.\n\nKRAMER: I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.\n\nAT THE BALLET.\n\nROBERT: I've really got to thank you for this.\n\nELAINE: Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.\n\nROBERT: Really. Would you excuse me? I have to run to the bathroom.\n\nBOSS' WIFE: So, um, you and Robert.\n\nELAINE: Yes indeed.\n\nBOSS: I'm surprised.\n\nELAINE: Really. Why?\n\nBOSS: No reason.\n\nELAINE: Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.\n\n(Robert comes back.)\n\nELAINE: Oh, hi honey.\n\n(Elaine grabs Robert and kisses him.)\n\nAT MONK'S.\n\nELAINE: Oh it was such a great night.\n\nJERRY: And did they suspect anything?\n\nELAINE: No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.\n\nJERRY: And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.\n\nELAINE: Oh it was such a great night. Oh.\n\nJERRY: You said that already.\n\nELAINE: Oh I did?\n\nJERRY: Yeah.\n\nELAINE: Oh.\n\nJERRY: Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?\n\nELAINE: He's incredible.\n\nJERRY: Yeah, but?\n\nELAINE: Yeah, I know.\n\nJERRY: So?\n\nELAINE: What?\n\nJERRY: Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?\n\nELAINE: Well it did occur to me.\n\nJERRY: You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.\n\nELAINE: Why? Is it irrevocable?\n\nJERRY: Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.\n\nELAINE: We've got a good team.\n\nJERRY: Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.\n\nELAINE: Why can't he play for us?\n\nJERRY: They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.\n\nELAINE: We just got along *so* great.\n\nJERRY: Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.\n\nELAINE: No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.\n\nJERRY: You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.\n\nELAINE: I realize that.\n\nJERRY: Are you that desperate?\n\nELAINE: Yes I am.\n\nAT JERRY'S APARTMENT. HE IS ON THE PHONE.\n\nJERRY: So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.\n\n(Kramer enters. He goes into the kitchen and starts searching.)\n\nJERRY: What are you looking for?\n\nKRAMER: Tupperware.\n\nJERRY: Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.\n\nKRAMER: I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.\n\nJERRY: What about a plastic bag?\n\nKRAMER: You must be kidding.\n\nJERRY: What is the difference?\n\nKRAMER: The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.\n\n(George enters.)\n\nGEORGE: So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.\n\nKRAMER: Oh yeah, you talked to her.\n\nGEORGE: Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.\n\nKRAMER: Yeah well we go way back.\n\nGEORGE: Why didn't anything happen between you two?\n\nKRAMER: Who's to say it didn't?\n\nJERRY: So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?\n\nGEORGE: Yes I did.\n\nJERRY: What did you say to her?\n\nGEORGE: What do you think I said?\n\nJERRY: I don't know.\n\nGEORGE: I told her the truth.\n\nJERRY: As you see it?\n\nGEORGE: Yes, as I see it.\n\nJERRY: Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?\n\nGEORGE: What hat?\n\nJERRY: You know, you're little hair hat there.\n\nGEORGE: No.\n\nJERRY: Don't you think she could tell?\n\nKRAMER: No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.\n\nJERRY: Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.\n\nGEORGE: You only think that because you know me.\n\nJERRY: Have you noticed people staring at your head?\n\nGEORGE: I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.\n\nJERRY: Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.\n\nKRAMER: No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.\n\nGEORGE: Look, I guarantee she won't know.\n\nKRAMER: Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.\n\nJERRY: Oh, I'll split a cab with you.\n\n(Walking down the street.)\n\nKRAMER: Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.\n\n(Kramer drops something into the man's cup.)\n\nHOMELESS MAN: Hey that's my coffee!\n\nAT THE POLICE STATION\n\nJERRY: Hi Sarge.\n\nTIERNEY: Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our lineup decoys didn't show. Hey any of you guys want to be in the lineup? Make a quick 50 bucks?\n\nKRAMER: Sure. I will.\n\nTIERNEY: Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert.\n\nIN THE LINEUP ROOM.\n\n(6 men stand there, one of which is Kramer.)\n\nSPEAKER: All of you, turn to the left.\n\n(Everyone turns left. Kramer turns right.)\n\nSPEAKER: The left.\n\n(Kramer turns left.)\n\nSPEAKER: Now turn to the right.\n\n(Kramer turns to the right doing a \"hokey pokey\" dance.)\n\nAT MONK'S.\n\nGEORGE: (thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.\n\nDENISE: George?\n\nGEORGE: Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.\n\nDENISE: Likewise. Have you been waiting long?\n\nGEORGE: No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.\n\nDENISE: Good, good.\n\nGEORGE: Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.\n\n(Camera is on George. Denise takes off her hat. The camera is still on George. His expression changes to surprise.)\n\nAT THE POLICE STATION.\n\nJERRY: What's that?\n\nTIERNEY: A polygraph. It's what you civilians call a lie detector test.\n\nJERRY: Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?\n\nTIERNEY: If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here. A certain cast member of Melrose Place.\n\nJERRY: Really.\n\nTIERNEY: Have you ever seen the show?\n\nJERRY: No.\n\nTIERNEY: You can admit it Jerry. It's okay.\n\nJERRY: I admit it. I don't watch it.\n\nTIERNEY: Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly.\n\nJERRY: The poly?\n\nTIERNEY: Yeah. I think you've seen it.\n\nJERRY'S APARTMENT.\n\nELAINE: Melrose Place?\n\nJERRY: Yes. Melrose Place.\n\nELAINE: I just didn't know you watched that.\n\nJERRY: Well I do.\n\nELAINE: I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.\n\nJERRY: Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.\n\nELAINE: You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...\n\nJERRY: And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.\n\nELAINE: Why? Why were you so embarrassed?\n\nJERRY: The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.\n\nELAINE: That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?\n\nJERRY: It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.\n\nELAINE: So what are you going to do?\n\nJERRY: I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.\n\nELAINE: Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?\n\nJERRY: Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?\n\n(Elaine takes a drink of something.)\n\nELAINE: Oh god this tastes terrible.\n\nJERRY: Did you shake it up?\n\nELAINE: No.\n\nJERRY: You gotta shake it up.\n\nELAINE: No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.\n\n(Jerry picks up the bottle and shakes it gently.)\n\nJERRY: Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.\n\nELAINE: So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.\n\nJERRY: So tonight are you going to make the move?\n\nELAINE: Yeah, I think I might.\n\n(George enters)\n\nJERRY: Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?\n\nGEORGE: That's an interesting question.\n\nJERRY: How so?\n\nGEORGE: How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!\n\nELAINE: What do you mean bald?\n\nGEORGE: What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.\n\nJERRY: She's bald?\n\nGEORGE: She's bald.\n\nELAINE: Oh come on.\n\nGEORGE: Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.\n\nELAINE: Well maybe she got a haircut or something.\n\nGEORGE: Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says \"Give me the Larry Fine.\"\n\nJERRY: Women go bald?\n\nELAINE: Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.\n\n(Kramer enters)\n\nJERRY: Hey.\n\nKRAMER: Hey.\n\nGEORGE: You fixed me up with a bald woman.\n\n(Kramer flinches)\n\nKRAMER: Bald?\n\nGEORGE: Yeah, that's right.\n\nELAINE: Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.\n\nGEORGE: So?\n\nELAINE: (puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!\n\nGEORGE: No I'm not. I *was* bald.\n\n(Elaine grabs at the toupee, George dodges the grab.)\n\nGEORGE: Elaine.\n\n(Elaine grabs again and misses. George turns around and opens the door trying to get out. Elaine grabs the toupee and runs to the window.)\n\nGEORGE: No, no, no Elaine.\n\nELAINE: (shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.\n\n(She tosses the toupee out the window)\n\nGEORGE: Nooooo.\n\n(He runs to the window, and the blind comes down on his head.)\n\nOUTSIDE.\n\n(The homeless man is walking down the street and sees the toupee. He puts it on.)\n\nAT ELAINE'S APARTMENT\n\nROBERT: Hahaha, why'd you start that fight with me?\n\nELAINE: Well I figured that's what couples do.\n\nROBERT: You almost convinced me we were a couple.\n\nELAINE: Well it was easy. Really.\n\nROBERT: Well good night, I'll call you tomorrow.\n\nELAINE: Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?\n\nROBERT: Upstairs?\n\nELAINE: Yeah. Upstairs?\n\nROBERT: Elaine...\n\nELAINE: I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?\n\nROBERT: Changing teams?\n\nELAINE: Have you ever thought about it?\n\nROBERT: But I'm a starting shortstop.\n\nELAINE: Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.\n\nAT MONK'S.\n\nGEORGE: I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.\n\nJERRY: Good to have you back.\n\nGEORGE: And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.\n\nJERRY: She's as good as anybody else.\n\nGEORGE: Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.\n\nJERRY: Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.\n\nGEORGE: Going to need a little more coffee here.\n\nJERRY: So George, how do I beat this lie detector?\n\nGEORGE: I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.\n\nJERRY: Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.\n\nGEORGE: Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, \"Teach me to sing like you.\"\n\nJERRY: All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.\n\nGEORGE: Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.\n\nOUTSIDE ON THE STREET. JERRY AND ELAINE WALKING TOWARD EACH OTHER.\n\nELAINE: Hey, I did it.\n\nJERRY: What?\n\nELAINE: I turned him. He defected.\n\nJERRY: Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?\n\nELAINE: Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.\n\nJERRY: Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said \"Too bad he's gay\".\n\nELAINE: Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.\n\nAT THE POLICE STATION.\n\n(Kramer is in the lineup again. He and five other people walk into the room. They stand there for a few moments. Kramer points with his eyes to the man on his left. He then tilts his head a few times to the man on his left.)\n\nELSEWHERE AT THE POLICE STATION.\n\n(Jerry is hooked up to the polygraph.)\n\nLOU: What's your name?\n\nJERRY: Jerry Seinfeld.\n\nLOU: What is your address?\n\nJERRY: 129 West 81st street.\n\nLOU: Did Kimberly steal Jo's baby?\n\nJERRY: I don't know.\n\n(Camera shot on the polygraph. The pen moves back and forth on the paper.)\n\nLOU: Did Billy sleep with Allison's best friend?\n\nJERRY: I don't know.\n\n(Camera shot on the polygraph. The pen moves back and forth on the paper. Lou and Sergeant Tierney look at each other.)\n\nLOU: Did Jane's finance kidnap Sydney and take her to Las Vegas? And if so, did she enjoy it?\n\nJERRY: I don't know.\n\nLOU: Did Jane sleep with Michael again?\n\nJERRY: (He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.\n\n(He picks up his coat and leaves.)\n\nJERRY'S APARTMENT.\n\nJERRY: He went back? What do you mean he went back?\n\nELAINE: He went back.\n\nJERRY: I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.\n\nELAINE: Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.\n\nJERRY: You can't. That's why they lose very few players.\n\nELAINE: Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.\n\nJERRY: Well there's always a place for you, on our team.\n\nELAINE: Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?\n\nJERRY: Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.\n\nELAINE: Okay.\n\n(George enters.)\n\nJERRY: Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.\n\nELAINE: Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.\n\nGEORGE: Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.\n\nELAINE: What is the matter?\n\nGEORGE: I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.\n\nKRAMER: Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?\n\nELAINE: I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.\n\nJERRY: All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.\n\n(Theme song of Melrose Place plays on the TV.)\n\nJERRY: Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.\n\nAT THE POLICE STATION. KRAMER IS IN THE LINEUP.\n\nKRAMER: Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one.

Appreciate a little help on the guitar, all right?\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, my daddy left home when I was three\nAnd he didn't leave much to ma and me\nJust this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze\nNow, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid\nBut the meanest thing that he ever did\nWas before he left, he went and named me \"Sue\"\n[Verse 2]\nWell, he must've thought that it was quite a joke\nAnd it got a lot of laughs from a lots of folks\nIt seems I had to fight my whole life through\nSome gal would giggle and I'd get red\nAnd some guy'd laugh then I'd bust his head\nI tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named \"Sue\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, I grew up quick and I grew up mean\nMy fists got hard and my wits got keen\nRoamed from town to town to hide my shame\nBut I made me a vow to the moon and stars\nI'd search the honky-tonks and bars\nAnd kill the man who gave me that awful name\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July\nAnd I just hit town and my throat was dry\nI thought I'd stop and have myself a brew\nAt an old saloon on a street of mud\nThere at a table, dealing stud\nSat the dirty, mangy dog that named me \"Sue\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nWell, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad\nFrom a worn-out picture that my mother'd had\nAnd I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye\nHe was big and bent and gray and old\nAnd I looked at him and my blood ran cold\nAnd I said, \"My name is Sue! How do you do?\nNow you're going to die!\"\nYeah, that's what I told him!\nYou might also like[Verse 6]\nWell, I hit him hard right between the eyes\nAnd he went down, but to my surprise\nHe come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear\nBut I busted a chair right across his teeth\nAnd we crashed through the wall and into the street\nKicking and a-gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer\n\n[Verse 7]\nI tell you, I've fought tougher men\nBut I really can't remember when\nHe kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile\nI heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss\nAnd he went for his gun and I pulled mine first\nHe stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile\n\n[Verse 8]\nAnd he said, \"Son, this world is rough\nAnd if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough\nAnd I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along\nSo I give you that name and I said goodbye\nI knew you'd have to get tough or die\nAnd it's that name that helped to make you strong\"\nYeah\n\n[Verse 9]\nHe said, \"Now you just fought one hell of a fight\nAnd I know you hate me, and you got the right\nTo kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do\nBut you ought to thank me, before I die\nFor the gravel in your guts and the spit in your eye\nBecause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue\"\n[Verse 10]\nI got all choked up and I threw down my gun\nAnd I called him my pa, and he called me his son\nAnd I came away with a different point of view\nAnd I think about him, now and then\nEvery time I try and every time I win\nAnd if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him\nBill or George!

NOLAN\nLadies and gentlemen, boys, the light of\nthe knowledge.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nOne hundred years ago, in 1859, forty-one boys sat in this room and were asked the same question that now greets you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?\n\nBOYS\nTradition! Honor! Discipline!\nExcellence!\n\nMR. NOLAN\nIn her first year, Welton Academy graduated five students. Last year we graduated fifty-one and more than seventy-five percent of those went on to the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught here. This is why you parents have been sending your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory school in the United States.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nAs you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English Department retired last term. You will have the opportunity later to meet his replacement Mr. John Keating, himself an honor's graduate of this school and who, for the past several years, has been teaching at the highly regarded Chester School in London.\n\nMR.

Keep your seats. Neil, I've just spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking too many extracurricular activities this semester. And I've decided that you should drop school annual.\n\nNEIL\nBut I'm the assistant editor this year.\n\nMR. PERRY\nWell, I'm sorry, Neil.\n\nNEIL\nBut, father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.\n\nMR.

PERRY\nAfter you've finished medical school and you're on your own, then you can do as you damn well please. But until then, you do as I tell you. Is that clear?\n\nNEIL\nYes, sir. I'm sorry.\n\nMR. PERRY\nYou know how much this means to your mother, don't you?\n\nNEIL\nYes, sir.\n\nNEIL\nYou know me. I'm always taking on too much.\n\nMR. PERRY\nWell, that's my boy. Now, listen. You need anything, you let us know, huh?\n\nNEIL\nYes, sir.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhy doesn't he let you do what you want?\n\nKNOX\nYeah. Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse.\n\nNEIL\nOh, that's rich! Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr. Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker?\n\nKNOX\nOkay, so I don't like it any more than you do.\n\nNEIL\nWell, stop telling me how to talk to my father. You guys are the same way.\n\nKNOX\nAll right, all right. Jesus. So what are you gonna do, then?\n\nNEIL\nWhat I have to do. Drop the annual.\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it. It's just a bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan.\n\nNEIL\nI don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it.\n\nMEEKS\nWell, uh, Latin, eight o'clock in my room?\n\nNEIL\nYeah.\n\nKNOX\nI guess so.\n\nMEEKS\nTodd, you're welcome to join us.\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah, come along, pal.\n\nTODD\nThanks.\n\nMcALLISTER\nSlow down, boys!

My Captain!\" Who knows where\nthat comes from? Anybody.\n\nKEATING\nNot a clue? It's from a poem by Walt\nWhitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now,\nthis class, you can either call me Mr.\nKeating, or, if you're slightly more\ndaring, \"O Captain! My Captain.\"\n\nKEATING\nNow let me dispel a few rumors, so they\ndon't fester into facts. Yes, I, too,\nattended Hellton and have survived. And\nno, at that time, I was not the mental\ngiant you see before you. I was the\nintellectual equivalent of a ninety-\neight-pound weakling. I would go to the\nbeach, and people would kick copies of\nByron in my face.\n\nKEATING\nNow, Mr. Pitts. That's rather\nunfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are\nyou?\n\nKEATING\nMr. Pitts, will you open your hymnal to\npage 542? Read the first stanza of the\npoem you find there.\n\nPITTS\n\"To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time\"?\n\nKEATING\nYes. That's the one. Somewhat\nappropriate, isn't it?\n\nPITTS\n\nGather ye rosebuds while ye may,\nOld time is still a-flying:\nAnd this same flowers that smiles today,\nTomorrow will be dying.\n\nKEATING\nThank you, Mr. Pitts. \"Gather ye\nrosebuds while ye may.\" The Latin term\nfor that sentiment is \"Carpe diem\". Now\nwho knows what that means?\n\nMEEKS\nCarpe diem. That's \"seize the day.\"\n\nKEATING\nVery good, Mr--\n\nMEEKS\nMeeks.\n\nKEATING\nMeeks. Another unusual name. Seize the\nday. \"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.\"\nWhy does the writer use these lines?\n\nCHARLIE\nBecause he's in a hurry.\n\nKEATING\nNo! Ding! Thank you for playing anyway.\nBecause we are food for worms, lads.\nBecause, believe it or not, each and\nevery one of us in this room is, one\nday, gonna stop breathing, turn cold,\nand die. I would like you to step\nforward over here and peruse some of the\nfaces from the past. You've walked past\nthem many times, but I don't think\nyou've really looked at them.\n\nKEATING\nThey're not that different from you, are\nthey? Same haircuts, full of hormones\njust like you. Invincible just like you\nfeel. The world is their oyster. They\nbelieve they're destined for great\nthings, just like many of you. Their\neyes are full of hope, just like you.\nDid they wait until it was too late to\nmake from their lives even one iota of\nwhat they were capable? Because, you\nsee, gentlemen, those boys are now\nfertilizing daffodils. But if you listen\nreal close, you can hear them whisper\ntheir legacy to you. Go on, lean in.\nListen. Do you hear it?\n\nKEATING\nCarpe. Hear it? Carpe. Carpe diem. Seize\nthe day, boys. Make your lives\nextraordinary.\n\nPITTS\nThat was weird.\n\nNEIL\nBut different.\n\nKNOX\nSpooky if you ask me.\n\nCAMERON\nHe'll test us on that stuff?\n\nCHARLIE\nOh, come on, Cameron. Don't you get\nanything?\n\nCAMERON\nWhat? What?\nTEACHER: Let's go, boys. Hustle up in\nhere. That means you, Dalton.\n\nMEEKS\nAll right, who's up for our study group\ntonight, guys?\n\nBOY 1\nSure.\n\nBOY 2\nMe.\n\nBOY 3\nMe, me, me.\n\nKNOX\nWell, I can't make it, guys. I have to\nhave dinner at the Danburrys' house\ntonight.\n\nCHARLIE\nOoh, the Danburrys.\n\nNEIL\nWho are the Danburrys?\n\nCHARLIE\nBig alums! How'd you swing that?\n\nKNOX\nFriends of my dad's. They're probably in\ntheir nineties or something. Sounds\ngreat, doesn't it?\n\nNEIL\nAnything's better than Hellton hash.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'll second that.\n\nMEEKS\nYeah, well, we'll see.\n\nNEIL\nHey! Want to come to the study group\ntonight?\n\nTODD\nUh, no. No. I've, I-I've got some\nhistory I wanna do.\n\nNEIL\nSuit yourself.\n\nHABER\nReady, Overstreet?\n\nKNOX\nReady to go, sir.\n\nMRS. DANBURRY\nChet, can you get that?\n\nCHET\nI can't, Mom.\n\nCHRIS\nI'll get it.\n\nCHRIS\nCan I help you?\n\nKNOX\nHi. K-Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager.\n\nCHRIS\nHi.\n\nKNOX\nThis is the Danburrys', right?\n\nCHRIS\nAre, are you here to see Chet?\n\nKNOX\nMrs. Danburry?\n\nCHRIS\nNo.\n\nMRS. DANBURRY\nI'm sorry. Thank you, Chris. I'm Mrs.\nDanburry. You must be Knox.\n\nKNOX\nYes.\n\nMRS. DANBURRY\nBack by nine? Please, come on in.\n\nCHET\nChris, come on. What are you doing?\n\nCHRIS\nChet, I'm coming.\n\nMR. DANBURRY\nKnox! How are you? Joe Danburry.\n\nKNOX\nNice to meet you, sir.\n\nMR. DANBURRY\nWell, he's the spitting image of his\nfather, isn't he? How is he? Come on in.\n\nKNOX\nHe's great. He just did a big case for\nG.M.\n\nMR. DANBURRY\nYeah, I know where you're headed. Like\nfather, like son, huh?\n\nBOY 1\nYes!\n\nBOY 2\nOh, sacrifice bishop to queen six.\n\nBOY 1\nAnother game?\n\nBOY 2\nWhat do you mean?\n\nPITTS\nBoo!\n\nCAMERON\nReplace, uh, these numbers here with X--\nFor X and Y.\n\nNEIL\nOf course.\n\nCAMERON\nOf course. So what's the problem?\n\nCHARLIE\nHow was dinner?\n\nKNOX\nHuh?\n\nCHARLIE\nHow was dinner?\n\nKNOX\nTerrible. Awful.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat? What happened?\n\nKNOX\nTonight I met the most beautiful girl I\nhave ever seen in my entire life.\n\nNEIL\nAre you crazy? What's wrong with that?\n\nKNOX\nShe's practically engaged. To Chet\nDanburry.\n\nCHARLIE\nThe guy could eat a football.\n\nPITTS\nToo bad.\n\nKNOX\nToo bad? It's worse than too bad, Pitts.\nIt's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in\nlove with such a jerk?\n\nPITTS\nAll the good ones go for jerks, you know\nthat.\n\nCAMERON\nYeah, forget her. Open your trig book\nand try and figure out problem five.\n\nKNOX\nI can't just forget her, Cameron. And I\ncertainly can't think about trig!\n\nPITTS\nWe got it!\n\nHABER\nAll right, gentlemen, five minutes.\nLet's go.\n\nCHARLIE\nDid you see her naked?\n\nKNOX\nVery funny, Dalton.\n\nHABER\nThat wouldn't be a, uh, radio in your\nlap, wouldn't it, Mr. Pitts?\n\nPITTS\nNo, sir. A science experiment. Radar.\n\nKEATING\nGentlemen, open your texts to page 21 of\nthis introduction. Mr. Perry, will you\nread the opening paragraph of the\npreface entitled \"Understanding Poetry\"?\n\nNEIL\n\"'Understanding Poetry,' by Dr. J. Evans\nPritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand\npoetry, we must first be fluent with its\nmeter, rhyme and figures of speech, then\nask two questions: 1) How artfully has\nthe objective of the poem been rendered\nand 2) How important is that objective?\nQuestion 1 rates the poem's perfection;\nquestion 2 rates its importance. And\nonce these questions have been answered,\ndetermining the poem's greatness becomes\na relatively simple matter.\"\n\nNEIL\n\"If the poem's score for perfection is\nplotted on the horizontal of a graph and\nits importance is plotted on the\nvertical, then calculating the total\narea of the poem yields the measure of\nits greatness.\"\n\nNEIL\n\"A sonnet by Byron might score high on\nthe vertical but only average on the\nhorizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on\nthe other hand, would score high both\nhorizontally and vertically, yielding a\nmassive total area, thereby revealing\nthe poem to be truly great. As you\nproceed through the poetry in this book,\npractice this rating method. As your\nability to evaluate poems in this matter\ngrows, so will, so will your enjoyment\nand understanding of poetry.\"\n\nKEATING\nExcrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.\nEvans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe.\nWe're talking about poetry. How can you\ndescribe poetry like American Bandstand?\n\"Oh, I like Byron. I give him a 42, but\nI can't dance to it.\" Now, I want you to\nrip out that page.\n\nKEATING\nGo on. Rip out the entire page. You\nheard me. Rip it out. Rip it out! Go on.\nRip it out!\n\nKEATING\nThank you, Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell\nyou what. Don't just tear out that page,\ntear out the entire introduction. I want\nit gone. History. Leave nothing of it.\nRip it out! Rip! Be gone, J. Evans\nPritchard, Ph.D. Rip. Shred. Tear. Rip\nit out! I want to hear nothing but\nripping of Mr. Pritchard. We'll\nperforate it, put it on a roll. It's not\nthe Bible. You're not gonna go to hell\nfor this.\n\nKEATING\nGo on. Make a clean tear. I want nothing\nleft of it.\n\nCAMERON\nWe shouldn't be doing this.\n\nKEATING\nRip! Rip! Rip! Rip it out! Rip!\n\nKEATING\nRip it out!\n\nMcALLISTER\nWhat the hell is going on here?\n\nKEATING\nI don't hear enough rips!\n\nMcALLISTER\nMr. Keating.\n\nKEATING\nMr. McAllister.\n\nMcALLISTER\nI'm sorry. I, I didn't know you were\nhere.\n\nKEATING\nI am. Ah.\n\nMcALLISTER\nSo you are. Excuse me.\n\nKEATING\nKeep ripping, gentlemen! This is a\nbattle. A war. And the casualties could\nbe your hearts and souls. Thank you,\nDalton. Armies of academics going\nforward, measuring poetry. No! We'll not\nhave that here. No more Mr. J. Evans\nPritchard. Now, my class, you will learn\nto think for yourselves again. You will\nlearn to savor words and language. No\nmatter what anybody tells you, words and\nideas can change the world. Now I see\nthat look in Mr. Pitts' eye, like 19th-\ncentury literature has nothing to do\nwith going to business school or medical\nschool. Right? Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you\nmay agree with him, thinking, \"Yes, we\nshould simply study our Mr. Pritchard\nand learn our rhyme and meter and go\nquietly about the business of achieving\nother ambitions.\" I've a little secret\nfor you. Huddle up. Huddle up!\n\nKEATING\nWe don't read and write poetry because\nit's cute. We read and write poetry\nbecause we are members of the human\nrace. And the human race is filled with\npassion. And medicine, law, business,\nengineering -- these are noble pursuits\nand necessary to sustain life. But\npoetry, beauty, romance, love -- these\nare what we stay alive for. To quote\nfrom Whitman\nO me! O life! of the question of these\nrecurring,\nOf the endless trains of the faithless,\nof cities fill'd with the foolish...\nWhat good amid these O me, O life?\nAnswer\nThat you are here--That life exists and\nidentity,\nThat the powerful play goes on, and you\nmay contribute a verse.\n\nKEATING\n\"That the powerful play goes on, and you\nmay contribute a verse.\" What will your\nverse be?\n\nBOYS\nFor what we are about to receive, may\nthe Lord make us truly grateful. Amen.\n\nMcALLISTER\nQuite an interesting class you gave\ntoday, Mr. Keating.\n\nKEATING\nSorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.\n\nMcALLISTER\nOh, there's no need to apologize. It was\nvery fascinated, misguided though it\nwas.\n\nKEATING\nYou think so?\n\nMcALLISTER\nYou take a big risk by encouraging them\nto become artists, John. When they\nrealize that they're not Rembrandts,\nShakespeares or Mozarts, they'll hate\nyou for it.\n\nKEATING\nWe're not talking artist, George. We're\ntalking free thinkers.\n\nMcALLISTER\nFree thinkers at seventeen?\n\nKEATING\nFunny. I never pegged you as a cynic.\n\nMcALLISTER\nNot a cynic. A realist. \"Show me the\nheart unfettered by foolish dreams and\nI'll show you a happy man.\"\n\nKEATING\n\"But only in their dreams can men be\ntruly free. 'Twas always thus, and\nalways thus will be.\"\n\nMcALLISTER\nTennyson?\n\nKEATING\nNo. Keating.\n\nNEIL\nHey, I found his senior annual in the\nlibrary.\n\nNEIL\nListen to this. \"Captain of the soccer\nteam, Editor of the school annual,\nCambridge bound, Thigh man, and Dead\nPoets Society.\"\n\nCAMERON\n\"Man most likely to do anything.\"\n\nCHARLIE\nThigh man! Mr.\"K\" was a hell-raiser.\n\nPITTS\nWhat's the Dead Poets Society?\n\nNEIL\nI don't know.\n\nMEEKS\nIs there a picture in the annual?\n\nCAMERON\nNo.\n\nNEIL\nNothing. No other mention of it.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nThat boy there, see me after lunch.\n\nNEIL\nMr. Keating! Mr. Keating! Sir?\n\nCHARLIE\nSay something.\n\nNEIL\nO Captain! My Captain!\n\nKEATING\nGentlemen.\n\nNEIL\nWe were just looking in your old annual.\n\nKEATING\nOh, my God. No, that's not me. Stanley\n\"The Tool\" Wilson.\n\nKEATING\nGod.\n\nNEIL\nWhat was the Dead Poets Society?\n\nKEATING\nI doubt the present administration would\nlook too favorably upon that.\n\nNEIL\nWhy? What was it?\n\nKEATING\nGentlemen, can you keep a secret?\n\nNEIL\nSure, yeah.\n\nKEATING\nThe Dead Poets was dedicated to \"sucking\nthe marrow out of life.\" That's a phrase\nfrom Thoreau we would invoke at the\nbeginning of every meeting. You see, we\nwould gather at the old Indian cave and\ntake turns reading from Thoreau,\nWhitman, Shelly -- the biggies -- even\nsome of our own verse. And, in the\nenchantment of the moment, we'd let\npoetry work its magic.\n\nKNOX\nYou mean, it was a bunch of guys sitting\naround reading poetry?\n\nKEATING\nNo, Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just guys.\nWe weren't a Greek organization. We were\nRomantics. We didn't just read poetry,\nwe let it drip from our tongues like\nhoney. Spirits soared, women swooned and\ngods were created, gentlemen. Not a bad\nway to spend an evening, eh? Thank you,\nMr. Perry, for this stroll down Amnesia\nLane. Burn that, especially my picture.\n\nNEIL\nDead Poets Society.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat?\n\nNEIL\nI say we go tonight.\n\nCHARLIE\nTonight?\n\nCAMERON\nNow, wait a minute.\n\nNEIL\nEverybody in?\n\nPITTS\nWhere's this cave he's talking about?\n\nNEIL\nIt's beyond the stream. I know where it\nis.\n\nPITTS\nThat's miles!\n\nCAMERON\nSounds boring to me.\n\nCHARLIE\nDon't come.\n\nCAMERON\nDo you know how many demerits we're\ntalking, Dalton?\n\nCHARLIE\nSo don't come. Please.\n\nCAMERON\nLook, all I'm saying is that we have to\nbe careful. We can't get caught.\n\nCHARLIE\nNo shit, Sherlock.\n\nHABER\nYou boys there, hurry up!\n\nNEIL\nAll right. Who's in?\n\nCAMERON\nOh, come on, Neil. Hager's the-\n\nNEIL\nForget Hager! No. Who's in?\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm in.\n\nHABER\nI'm warning you! Move!\n\nCAMERON\nMe, too.\n\nPITTS\nI don't know, Neil.\n\nNEIL\nWhat?\n\nCHARLIE\nPitts! Pittsie, come on!\n\nMEEKS\nHis grades are hurting, Charlie.\n\nNEIL\nYou can help him, Meeks.\n\nPITTS\nWhat is this, a midnight study group?\n\nNEIL\nForget it, Pitts, you're coming. Meeks,\nyour grades hurting, too?\n\nMEEKS\nI'll try anything once.\n\nCHARLIE\nExcept sex.\n\nCAMERON\nI'm in as long as we're careful.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat about you, Knox?\n\nKNOX\nI don't know, Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nCome on, Knox. I'll help you get Chris.\n\nKNOX\nYeah? How?\n\nCHARLIE\nWomen swoon!\n\nKNOX\nBut why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me\nwhy they swoon. Charlie!\n\nNEIL\nYou're not listening. Any questions?\nLook, you follow the stream to the\nwaterfall. It's right there. It's gotta\nbe like that.\n\nCAMERON\nI don't know. It's starting to sound\ndangerous.\n\nCHARLIE\nOh. Why don't you just stay home?\n\nCAMERON\nHey, you're crazy.\n\nMcALLISTER\nFor God's sake, stop chattering and sit\ndown!\n\nNEIL\nTodd, are you coming tonight?\n\nTODD\nNo.\n\nNEIL\nWhy not? God, you were there. You heard\nKeating. Don't you want to do something\nabout--\n\nTODD\nY-Yes, but--\n\nNEIL\nBut, but what?\n\nTODD\nKeating said that everybody took turns\nreading and I don't wanna do that.\n\nNEIL\nGosh. You really have a problem with\nthat, don't you?\n\nTODD\nN-No, I, I don't have a problem. Neil, I\njust-- I don't wanna do it, okay?\n\nNEIL\nAll right. What if you didn't have to\nread? What if you just came and\nlistened?\n\nTODD\nThat's not how it works.\n\nNEIL\nForget how it works! What if, what if\nthey said it was okay?\n\nTODD\nWhat? What, are you gonna go up and ask\nthem if-- No, no.\n\nNEIL\nI'll be right back.\n\nTODD\nNeil? Neil?\n\nMcALLISTER\nOh, shut up, will you?\n\nBOY 1\nIt's my stuff for my asthma, okay? Could\nyou give that back, please? Could you\ngive that back?\n\nBOY 2\nWhat's the matter? Don't you like\nsnakes?\n\nNEIL\nYou're in.\n\nBOY 1\nGet away from me, okay?\n\nBOY 3\nSpaz, why don't you check your pockets?\n\nBOY 4\nCome, Spaz. I have to brush my teeth.\n\nBOY 5\nHurry up! Get off.\n\nHABER\nCut out that racket in there.\n\nNEIL\nCome on. Let's get out. Go! Go!\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm a dead poet!\n\nMEEKS\nCharlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nGuys, over here!\n\nMEEKS\nYou're funny. You're real funny.\n\nPITTS\nIt's too wet.\n\nCAMERON\nCharlie, you trying to smoke us out of\nhere?\n\nNEIL\nNo, no, the smoke's going right up this\nopening.\n\nPITTS\nYou okay?\n\nMEEKS\nOh, God. Clods.\n\nNEIL\nAll right, all right. Forget the fire.\n\nCHARLIE\nForget it, forget it.\n\nNEIL\nLets go, gentlemen.\n\nMEEKS\nCan't light a swamp.\n\nNEIL\nI hereby reconvene the Dead Poets\nSociety, Welton Chapter. The, uh,\nmeetings will be conducted by myself and\nthe other new initiates now present. Uh,\nTodd Anderson, because he prefers not to\nread, will keep the minutes of the\nmeetings.\n\nNEIL\nI'll now read the traditional opening\nmessage by society member, Henry David\nThoreau. \"I went to the woods because I\nwanted to live deliberately. I wanted to\nlive deep and suck out all the marrow of\nlife.\"\n\nCHARLIE\nI'll second that.\n\nNEIL\n\"To put to rout all that was not life,\nand not, when I had come to die,\ndiscover that I had not lived.\"\n\nNEIL\nAnd, uh, Keating's marked a bunch of\nother pages.\n\nCHARLIE\nAll right, intermission. Dig deep. Right\nhere, right here, lay it down.\n\nMEEKS\nOn the mud? We're gonna put our food on\nthe mud?\n\nCHARLIE\nMeeks, put your coat down. Picnic\nblanket.\n\nMEEKS\nYes, sir! Excuse me.\n\nPITTS\nUse Meeks' coat.\n\nCHARLIE\nDon't keep anything back, either. You\nguys are always bumming my smokes.\n\nMEEKS\nRaisins?\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah. Wait a minute. Who gave us half a\nroll?\n\nCAMERON\nI'm eating the other half.\n\nCHARLIE\nCome on.\n\nCAMERON\nWhat? You want me to put it back?\n\nNEIL\nIt was a dark and rainy night. And this\nold lady, who had a passion for jigsaw\npuzzles, sat by herself in her house at\nher table to complete the new jigsaw\npuzzle. As she pieced the puzzle\ntogether, she realized to her\nastonishment that the image that was\nformed was her very own room, and the\nfigure in the center of the puzzle as\nshe completed it was herself. And with\ntrembling hands, she placed the last\nfour pieces and stared in horror at the\nface of a demented madman at the window.\nThe last thing that this old lady ever\nheard was the sound of breaking glass.\n\nKNOX\nNo shit.\n\nNEIL\nYes. This is true. This is true.\n\nCAMERON\nI've got one that's even better than\nthat. I do. There's a young married\ncouple and they're driving through the\nforest at night from a long trip. And\nthey run out of gas and there's a madman\non the loose.\n\nCHARLIE\nOh, that thing with the hands?\n\nPITTS\nThis is the madman on the roof?\n\nCAMERON\nI love that story.\n\nCHARLIE\nI told you that one.\n\nCAMERON\nYou did not. I got that in, uh, camp in\nsixth grade.\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah. Were you six last year?\n\nPITTS\n\"In a mean abode in the Shankill Road\nlived a man named William Bloat. Now he\nhad a wife, the plague of his life, who\ncontinually got his goat. And one day at\ndawn with her night shift on, he slit\nher bloody throat.\" Oh, and it gets\nworse.\n\nCHARLIE\nDo you wanna hear a real poem?\n\nMEEKS\nWant this?\n\nCHARLIE\nAll right? No, I don't need it. You take\nit.\n\nMEEKS\nWhat, did you bring one?\n\nNEIL\nYou memorized a poem?\n\nCHARLIE\nI didn't memorize a poem. Move up.\n\nMEEKS\nAn original piece by Charlie Dalton.\n\nKNOX\nAn original piece.\n\nPITTS\nTake center stage.\n\nNEIL\nYou know this is history. Right? This is\nhistory.\n\nMEEKS\nOh, wow.\n\nCAMERON\nWhere did you get that?\n\nCHARLIE\n\nTeach me to love? Go teach thyself more\nwit:\nI, chief professor, am of it.\nThe god of love, if such a thing there\nbe,\nMay learn to love from me.\n\nNEIL\nWow! Did you write that?\n\nCHARLIE\nAbraham Cowley. Okay, who's next?\n\nNEIL\nAlfred Lord Tennyson.\nCome my friends,\n'Tis not too late to seek a newer world\nfor my purpose holds to sail beyond the\nsunset.\nAnd though we are not now that strength\nwhich in old days\nMoved earth and heaven; that which we\nare, we are;--\nOne equal temper of heroic hearts,\nMade weak by time and fate, but strong\nin will.\nTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to\nyield.\n\nMEEKS\n\nThen I had religion, then I had a\nvision.\nI could not turn from their revel in\nderision.\nThen I saw the Congo creeping through\nthe black,\ncutting through the forest with a golden\ntrack.\nThen I saw the Congo creeping through\nthe black-\n\nCHARLIE\nMeeks, Meeks.\n\nMEEKS\n\n...cutting through the forest with a\ngolden track.\nThen I saw the Congo creeping through\nthe black,\ncutting through the forest with a golden\ntrack.\nThen I saw the Congo creeping through\nthe black,\ncutting through the forest with a golden\ntrack.\nThen I saw the Congo creeping through\nthe black,\ncutting through the forest with a golden\ntrack.\n\nBOYS\n\nThen I saw the Congo creeping through\nthe black,\ncutting through the forest wit...\n\nKNOX\nMorose?\n\nKEATING\nExactly! Morose. Now, language was\ndeveloped for one endeavor, and that is?\nMr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or\nan amoeba?\n\nKEATING\nMr. Perry?\n\nNEIL\nUh, to communicate.\n\nKEATING\nNo! To woo women. Today we're going to\nbe talking about William Shakespeare.\n\nBOY\nOh, God!\n\nKEATING\nI know. A lot of you looked forward to\nthis about as much as you look forward\nto root canal work. We're gonna talk\nabout Shakespeare as someone who writes\nsomething very interesting. Now, many of\nyou have seen Shakespeare done very much\nlike this, \"O Titus, bring your friend\nhither.\" But if any of you have seen Mr.\nMarlon Brando, you know, Shakespeare can\nbe different. \"Friend, Romans,\ncountrymen, lend me your ears.\" You can\nalso imagine, maybe, John Wayne as\nMacbeth going, \"Well, is this a dagger I\nsee before me?\"\n\nKEATING\n\"Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy\na good dog once in a while, sir. You can\nhave yourself a three-course meal from\none dog. Start with your canine\ncrudites, go to your Fido flambe for\nmain course and for dessert, a Pekingese\nparfait. And you can pick your teeth\nwith a little paw.\"\n\nKEATING\nWhy do I stand up here? Anybody?\n\nCHARLIE\nTo feel taller.\n\nKEATING\nNo! Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I\nstand upon my desk to remind yourself\nthat we must constantly look at things\nin a different way.\n\nKEATING\nYou see, the world looks very different\nfrom up here. You don't believe me? Come\nsee for yourself. Come on. Come on!\n\nKEATING\nJust when you think you know something,\nyou have to look at it in another way.\nEven though it may seem silly or wrong,\nyou must try! Now, when you read, don't\njust consider what the author thinks.\nConsider what you think.\n\nKEATING\nBoys, you must strive to find your own\nvoice. Because the longer you wait to\nbegin, the less likely you are to find\nit at all. Thoreau said, \"Most men lead\nlives of quiet desperation.\" Don't be\nresigned to that. Break out! Don't just\nwalk off the edge like lemmings. Look\naround you.\n\nKEATING\nThere! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank\nyou! Yes! Dare to strike out and find\nnew ground. Now, in addition to your\nessays, I would like you to compose a\npoem of your own, an original work.\n\nKEATING\nThat's right! You have to deliver it\naloud in front of the class on Monday.\nBonne chance, gentlemen.\n\nKEATING\nMr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't\nknow that this assignment scares the\nhell out of you, you mole.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nTake a power train in two! Three! Keep\nyour eyes in the boat!\n\nMEEKS\nWe got it, Pittsie. We got it! Radio\nFree American!\n\nNEIL\nI found it.\n\nTODD\nYou found what?\n\nNEIL\nWhat I wanna do right now. What's\nreally, really inside me.\n\nTODD\n\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"?\n\nNEIL\nThis is it.\n\nTODD\nWhat is this?\n\nNEIL\nIt's a play, dummy.\n\nTODD\nI know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have\nto do with you?\n\nNEIL\nRight. They're putting it on at Henley\nHall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts!\n\nTODD\nYes, so?\n\nNEIL\nSo, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna\nbe an actor! Ever since I can remember,\nI've wanted to try this. I even tried to\ngo to summer stock auditions last year,\nbut, of course, my father wouldn't let\nme. For the first time in my whole life\nI know what I wanna do, and for the\nfirst time I'm gonna do it whether my\nfather wants me to or not! Carpe diem!\n\nTODD\nNeil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are\nyou gonna be in a play if your father\nwon't let you?\n\nNEIL\nFirst I gotta get the part, then I can\nworry about that.\n\nTODD\nYeah, but won't he kill you if he finds\nout you went to an audition and didn't\neven tell him?\n\nNEIL\nNo, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned,\nhe won't have to know about any of this.\n\nTODD\nWell, that's impossible.\n\nNEIL\nBullshit! Nothing's impossible.\n\nTODD\nWell, why don't you just call him and\nask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes.\n\nNEIL\nThat's a laugh! If I don't ask him, at\nleast I won't be disobeying him.\n\nTODD\nYeah, but if he said--\n\nNEIL\nJesus, Todd! Whose side are you on?\n\nNEIL\nI mean, I haven't even gotten the part\nyet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a\nlittle while?\n\nNEIL\nYou're coming to the meeting this\nafternoon?\n\nTODD\nI don't know. Maybe.\n\nNEIL\nNothing Mr. Keating has to say means\nshit to you, does it, Todd?\n\nTODD\nW-What is that supposed to mean?\n\nNEIL\nYou're in the club! Being in the club\nmeans being stirred up by things. You\nlook about as stirred up as a cesspool.\n\nTODD\nS-- You want me out?\n\nNEIL\nNo! I want you in, but being in means\nyou gotta do something. Not just say\nyou're in.\n\nTODD\nWell, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this\nconcern, but I-I'm not like you. All\nright? You, you, you say thing and\npeople listen. I'm, I'm not like that.\n\nNEIL\nDon't you think you could be?\n\nTODD\nNo! I--I, I don't know, but that's not\nthe point. The, the, the point is that\nthere's nothing you can do about it, so\nyou can just butt out. I can take care\nof myself just fine. All right?\n\nNEIL\nNo.\n\nTODD\nWhat do you mean, \"no\"?\n\nNEIL\nNo.\n\nTODD\nGive me-- Neil. Neil, give that back.\n\nNEIL\n\"We are dreaming of a--\" Poetry! I'm\nbeing chased by Walt Whitman! Okay,\nokay.\n\nCAMERON\nWhat are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You\nsee this chemistry- Hey, give me-- Neil,\ngive me-- Don't be immature. Come on. I\nneed my-\n\nCHARLIE\nGive it to me! Give it to me!\n\nNEIL\nCharlie, help me.\n\nCOACH\nOkay, everybody on the bus. Let's go,\nboys. Come on, let's go. On the bus,\nboys. Now!\n\nKEATING\nNow, devotees may argue that one sport\nor game is inherently better than\nanother. For me, sport is actually a\nchance for us to have other human beings\npush us to excel. I want you all to come\nover here and take a slip of paper and\nline up single file.\n\nKEATING\nMr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth.\nMr. Pitts, rise above your name. I want\nyou to hand these out to the boys, one\napiece.\n\nKEATING\nYou know what to do, Pitts.\n\nPITTS\n\"Oh to struggle against great odds. To\nmeet enemies undaunted.\"\n\nKEATING\nSounds to me like you're daunted. Say it\nagain like you're undaunted.\n\nPITTS\n\"Oh to struggle against great odds. To\nmeet enemies undaunted.\"\n\nKEATING\nNow go on.\n\nKEATING\nYes! Next.\n\nBOY 1\n\"To be a sailor of the world, bound for\nall ports.\"\n\nKEATING\nNext. Louder!\n\nBOY 2\n\"Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not\na slave.\"\n\nBOY 3\n\"To mount the scaffolds. To advance to\nthe muzzle of guns with perfect\nnonchalance.\"\n\nKEATING\nCome on, Meeks! Listen to the music.\n\nMEEKS\n\"To dance, clap hands, exalt, shout,\nskip, roll on, float on.\"\n\nKEATING\nYes!\n\nHOPKINS\n\"Oh, to have life henceforth the poem of\nnew joys.\"\n\nKEATING\nOh! Boo! Come on, Charlie, let it fill\nyour soul!\n\nCHARLIE\n\"To indeed be a god!\"\n\nNEIL\nCharlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play\nPuck! I'm gonna play Puck!\n\nMEEKS\nWhat did he say?\n\nPITTS\nPuck?\n\nNEIL\nThat's the main part.\n\nKNOX\nGreat, Neil.\n\nNEIL\nCharlie, I got it!\n\nCHARLIE\nCongratulations. Good for you, Neil.\nGood for you.\n\nNEIL\nOkay, okay, okay, okay.\n\nTODD\nNeil, how are you gonna do this?\n\nNEIL\nThey need a letter of permission from my\nfather and Mr. Nolan.\n\nTODD\nYou're not gonna write it.\n\nNEIL\nOh yes, I am.\n\nTODD\nOh, Neil. Neil, you're crazy.\n\nNEIL\nOkay. \"I am writing to you on behalf of\nmy son Neil Perry.\" This is great.\n\nKNOX\n\"To Chris.\"\n\nBOY 1\nWho's Chris?\n\nBOY 2\nMmm, Chris.\n\nKNOX\n\nI see a sweetness in her smile.\nBlight light shines from her eyes.\nBut life is complete; contentment is\nmine,\nJust knowing that... just knowing that\nshe's alive.\n\nKNOX\nSorry, Captain. It's stupid.\n\nKEATING\nNo, no. It's not stupid. It's a good\neffort. It touched on one of the major\nthemes, love. A major theme not only in\npoetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were\nlaughing. You're up.\n\nHOPKINS\n\"The cat sat on the mat.\"\n\nKEATING\nCongratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is\nthe first poem to ever have a negative\nscore on the Pritchard scale. We're not\nlaughing at you, we're laughing near\nyou. I don't mind that your poem had a\nsimple theme. Sometimes the most\nbeautiful poetry can be about simple\nthings, like a cat, or a flower or rain.\nYou see, poetry can come from anything\nwith the stuff of revelation in it. Just\ndon't let your poems be ordinary. Now,\nwho's next?\n\nKEATING\nMr. Anderson, I see you sitting there in\nagony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put\nyou out of your misery.\n\nTODD\nI, I didn't do it. I didn't write a\npoem.\n\nKEATING\nMr. Anderson thinks that everything\ninside of him is worthless and\nembarrassing. Isn't that right, Todd?\nIsn't that your worst fear? Well, I\nthink you're wrong. I think you have\nsomething inside of you that is worth a\ngreat deal.\n\nKEATING\n\"I sound my barbaric yawp over the\nrooftops of the world.\" W. W. Uncle Walt\nagain. Now, for those of you who don't\nknow, a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now,\nTodd, I would like you to give us a\ndemonstration of a barbaric \"yawp.\" Come\non. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's\ngo. Come on. Up.\n\nKEATING\nYou gotta get in \"yawping\" stance.\n\nTODD\nA yawp.\n\nKEATING\nNo, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp.\n\nTODD\nYawp.\n\nKEATING\nCome on, louder.\n\nTODD\nYawp.\n\nKEATING\nNo, that's a mouse. Come on. Louder.\n\nTODD\nYawp.\n\nKEATING\nOh, good God, boy. Yell like a man!\n\nTODD\nYawp!\n\nKEATING\nThere it is. You see, you have a\nbarbarian in you, after all. Now, you\ndon't get away that easy.\n\nKEATING\nThe picture of Uncle Walt up there. What\ndoes he remind you of? Don't think.\nAnswer. Go on.\n\nTODD\nA m-m-madman.\n\nKEATING\nWhat kind of madman? Don't think about\nit. Just answer again.\n\nTODD\nA c-crazy madman.\n\nKEATING\nNo, you can do better than that. Free up\nyour mind. Use your imagination. Say the\nfirst thing that pops into your head,\neven if it's total gibberish. Go on, go\non.\n\nTODD\nUh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman.\n\nKEATING\nGood God, boy, there's a poet in you,\nafter all. There, close your eyes. Close\nyour eyes. Close 'em. Now, describe what\nyou see.\n\nTODD\nUh, I-I close my eyes.\n\nKEATING\nYes?\n\nTODD\nUh, and this image floats beside me.\n\nKEATING\nA sweaty-toothed madman?\n\nTODD\nA sweaty-toothed madman with a stare\nthat pounds my brain.\n\nKEATING\nOh, that's excellent. Now, give him\naction. Make him do something.\n\nTODD\nH-His hands reach out and choke me.\n\nKEATING\nThat's it. Wonderful. Wonderful.\n\nTODD\nAnd, and all the time he's mumbling.\n\nKEATING\nWhat's he mumbling?\n\nTODD\nM-Mumbling, \"Truth. Truth is like, like\na blanket that always leaves your feet\ncold.\"\n\nKEATING\nForget them, forget them. Stay with the\nblanket. Tell me about that blanket.\n\nTODD\nY-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll\nnever be enough. You kick at it, beat\nit, it'll never cover any of us. From\nthe moment we enter crying to the moment\nwe leave dying, it will just cover your\nface as you wail and cry and scream.\n\nKEATING\nDon't you forget this.\n\nCHARLIE\nAttaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply.\n\nMEEKS\nMy dad collects a lot of pipes.\n\nCHARLIE\nReally? Mine's got thirty.\n\nPITTS\nYour parents collect pipes? Oh, that's\nreally interesting.\n\nCHARLIE\nCome on, Knox. Join in.\n\nMEEKS\nYeah, Knox, we're from the government.\nWe're here to help, man.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat's wrong?\n\nPITTS\nIt's Chris. Here's a picture of Chris\nfor you.\n\nMEEKS\nSmoke that. Put that in your pipe and\nsmoke it.\n\nKNOX\nThat's not funny.\n\nCHARLIE\nKnock it off. Smoke your pipes.\n\nMEEKS\nNeil!\n\nNEIL\nFriend, scholar, Welton men.\n\nMEEKS\nWhat is that, Neil?\n\nPITTS\nDuh. It's a lamp, Meeks.\n\nNEIL\nNo. This is the god of the cave.\n\nMEEKS\nThe god of the cave.\n\nPITTS\nCharlie, what are you doing?\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat do you say we start this meeting?\n\nBOY 1\nY-Yeah, just-- I need a light. I just\ngotta-\n\nBOY 2\nGot my earplugs?\n\nCHARLIE\nGentlemen, \"Poetrusic\" by Charles\nDalton.\n\nBOY 3\nOh, boy. He's gonna play.\nBOY:Oh, no.\n\nCHARLIE\nLaughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling.\nGotta do more. Gotta be more.\n\nCHARLIE\nChaos screaming, chaos dreaming. Gotta\ndo more! Gotta be more!\n\nMEEKS\nWow!\n\nPITTS\nThat was nice. That was great. Where did\nyou learn to play like that?\n\nCHARLIE\nMy parents made me take the clarinet for\nyears.\n\nCAMERON\nI love the clarinet.\n\nCHARLIE\nI hated it. The saxophone. The saxophone\nis more sonorous.\n\nCAMERON\nOh.\n\nMEEKS\nVocabulary.\n\nKNOX\nI can't take it anymore. If I don't have\nChris, I'm gonna kill myself.\n\nCHARLIE\nKnoxious, you've gotta calm down.\n\nKNOX\nNo, Charlie. That's just my problem.\nI've been calm all my life. I'll do\nsomething about that.\n\nNEIL\nWhere are you going?\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\nKNOX\nI'm gonna call her. Yes!\n\nCHRIS\nHello?\n\nKNOX\nShe's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will\nhate me. My parents will kill me.\n\nKNOX\nAll right, goddamn it. You're right.\n\"Carpe diem.\" Even if it kills me.\n\nCHRIS\nHello?\n\nKNOX\nHello, Chris?\n\nCHRIS\nYes.\n\nKNOX\nHi. This is Knox Overstreet.\n\nCHRIS\nOh, yes. Knox. Glad you called.\n\nKNOX\nShe's glad I called.\n\nCHRIS\nListen, Chet's parents are going out of\ntown this weekend, so he's having a\nparty. Would you like to come?\n\nKNOX\nWould I like to come to a party?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes. Say, yes.\n\nCHRIS\nFriday? Um-\n\nKNOX\nWell, sure.\n\nCHRIS\nAbout seven?\n\nKNOX\nOkay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris.\n\nCHRIS\nOkay.\n\nKNOX\nFriday night at the Danburrys'. O-Okay.\nThank you.\n\nCHRIS\nOkay. Bye.\n\nKNOX\nThank you. I'll see you. Bye.\n\nKNOX\nYawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna\ncall me. She invited me to a party with\nher.\n\nCHARLIE\nAt Chet Danburrys' house.\n\nKNOX\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nWell?\n\nKNOX\nSo?\n\nCHARLIE\nSo, you don't really think she means\nyou're going with her?\n\nKNOX\nWell, of course not, Charlie. But that's\nnot the point. That's not the point at\nall.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat is the point?\n\nKNOX\nThe point, Charlie, is, uh--\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah?\n\nKNOX\n-- that she was thinking about me. I've\nonly met her once, and already she's\nthinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna\nhappen, guys. I feel it. She is going to\nbe mine. Carpe. Carpe!\n\nKEATING\nNo grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take\na stroll.\n\nKEATING\nThere it is.\n\nKEATING\nI don't know, but I've been told--\n\nBOYS\nI don't know, but I've been told--\n\nKEATING\nDoing poetry is old--\n\nBOYS\nDoing poetry is old--\n\nKEATING\nLeft, left, left-right-left. Left, left,\nleft-right-left. Left, halt!\n\nKEATING\nThank you, gentlemen. If you noticed,\neveryone started off with their own\nstride, their own pace. Mr. Pitts,\ntaking his time. He knew he'll get there\none day. Mr. Cameron, you could see him\nthinking, \"Is this right? It might be\nright. It might be right. I know that.\nMaybe not. I don't know.\" Mr.\nOverstreet, driven by deeper force. Yes.\nWe know that.\nAll right. Now, I didn't bring them up\nhere to ridicule them. I brought them up\nhere to illustrate the point of\nconformity: the difficulty in\nmaintaining your own beliefs in the face\nof others. Now, those of you -- I see\nthe look in your eyes like, \"I would've\nwalked differently.\" Well, ask\nyourselves why you were clapping. Now,\nwe all have a great need for acceptance.\nBut you must trust that your beliefs are\nunique, your own, even though others may\nthink them odd or unpopular, even though\nthe herd may go, \"That's bad.\" Robert\nFrost said, \"Two roads diverged in a\nwood and I, I took the one less traveled\nby, and that has made all the\ndifference.\" Now, I want you to find\nyour own walk right now. Your own way of\nstriding, pacing. Any direction.\nAnything you want. Whether it's proud,\nwhether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen,\nthe courtyard is yours.\n\nKEATING\nYou don't have to perform. Just make it\nfor yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining\nus?\n\nCHARLIE\nExercising the right not to walk.\n\nKEATING\nThank you, Mr. Dalton. You just\nillustrated the point. Swim against the\nstream.\n\nNEIL\nTodd? Hey.\n\nTODD\nHey.\n\nNEIL\nWhat's going on?\n\nTODD\nNothing. Today's my birthday.\n\nNEIL\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday.\n\nTODD\nThanks.\n\nNEIL\nWhat's you get?\n\nTODD\nMy parents gave me this.\n\nNEIL\nIsn't this the same desk set-\n\nTODD\nYeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing\nas last year.\n\nNEIL\nOh.\n\nTODD\nOh.\n\nNEIL\nMaybe they thought you needed another\none.\n\nTODD\nMaybe they weren't thinking about\nanything at all. Uh, the funny thing is\nabout this is I, I didn't even like it\nthe first time.\n\nNEIL\nTodd, I think you're underestimating the\nvalue of this desk set. I mean, who\nwould want a football or a baseball, or-\n-\n\nTODD\nOr a car.\n\nNEIL\nOr a car if they could have a desk set\nas wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if\nI were ever going to buy a, a desk set\ntwice, I would probably buy this one\nboth times. In fact, its, its shape is,\nit's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can\nfeel it. This desk set wants to fly.\n\nNEIL\nTodd? The world's first unmanned flying\ndesk set.\n\nTODD\nOh, my!\n\nNEIL\nWell, I wouldn't worry. You'll get\nanother one next year.\n\nBOYS\n\"To live deep and suck out all the\nmarrow of life. To put to rout all that\nwas not life\"\n\nCAMERON\nOh, my God!\n\nGLORIA\nIs this it?\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah, this is it. Go ahead, go on in.\nIt's my cave.

What's ol' Mutter been up to, huh?\n\nKNOX\nI don't really know Mutt.\n\nBUBBA\nTo Mighty Mutt.\n\nGUY 1\nTo Mighty Mutt.\n\nKNOX\nTo Mighty Mutt.\n\nBUBBA\nWell, listen, I gotta go find Patsy. Say\nhello to Mutt for me, okay?\n\nKNOX\nWill do.\n\nGUY 1\nYeah. Hell of a guy, your brother Mutt.\n\nCHARLIE\nWe gonna have a meeting or what?\n\nGLORIA\nYeah.

I'm so sorry.\n\nCHRIS\nIt's okay. It-It's okay.\n\nCHET\nNext time I see you, you die.\n\nTINA\nGo ahead, pass it around.\n\nMEEKS\nMe and Pitts are working on a hi-fi\nsystem. It shouldn't be that hard to,\nuh, to put together.\n\nPITTS\nYeah. Uh, I might be going to Yale. Uh,\nuh, but, I, I might not.\n\nGLORIA\nDon't you guys miss having girls around\nhere?\n\nMEEKS\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nThat's part of what this club is about.\nIn fact, I'd like to announce I\npublished an article in the school\npaper, in the name of the Dead Poets.\n\nCAMERON\nWhat?\n\nCHARLIE\nDemanding girls be admitted to Welton.\n\nPITTS\nYou didn't.\n\nCHARLIE\nSo we can all stop beating off.\n\nNEIL\nHow did you do that?\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm one of the proofers. I slipped the\narticle in.\n\nMEEKS\nLook, uh, it's, it's over now.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhy? Nobody knows who we are.\n\nCAMERON\nWell, don't you think they're gonna\nfigure out who wrote it? They're gonna\ncome to you and ask to know what the\nDead Poets Society is. Charlie, you had\nno right to do something like that.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's Nuwanda, Cameron.\n\nGLORIA\nThat's right. It's Nuwanda.\n\nCHARLIE\nAre we just playing around out here, or\ndo we mean what we say? For all we do is\ncome together and reach a bunch of poems\nto each other. What the hell are we\ndoing?\n\nNEIL\nAll right, but you still shouldn't have\ndone it, Charlie. This could mean\ntrouble. You don't speak for the club.\n\nCHARLIE\nHey, would you not worry about your\nprecious little neck? If they catch me,\nI'll tell them I made it up.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nSit.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nIn this week of Welton's Honor there\nappeared a profane and unauthorized\narticle. Rather than spend my valuable\ntime ferreting out the guilty persons --\nand let me assure you I will find them -\n- I'm asking any and all students who\nknows anything about this article to\nmake themselves known here and now.\nWhoever the guilty persons are, this is\nyour only chance to avoid expulsion from\nthis school.\n\nCHARLIE\nWelton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just\na moment. Mr. Nolan, it's for you. It's\nGod. He says we should have girls at\nWelton.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nWipe that smirk off your face. If you\nthink, Mr. Dalton, that you're the first\nto try to get thrown out of this school,\nthink again. Others have had similar\nnotions and have failed just as surely\nas you will fail. Assume the position.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nCount aloud, Mr. Dalton.\n\nCHARLIE\nOne. Two. Three. Four. Five.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nWhat is this Dead Poets Society? I want\nnames.\n\nNEIL\nYou kicked out?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo.\n\nNEIL\nSo what happened?\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm to turn everybody in, apologize to\nthe school and all will be forgiven.\n\nNEIL\nSo, what are you gonna do? Charlie!\n\nCHARLIE\nDamn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nExcuse me. May we have a word, Mr.\nKeating?\n\nKEATING\nCertainly.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nThis was my first classroom, John. Did\nyou know that? My first desk.\n\nKEATING\nDidn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nEnglish. Oh, long before your time. It\nwas hard giving it up, I can tell you.\nI'm hearing rumors, John, about some\nunorthodox teaching methods in your\nclassroom. I'm not saying they've\nanything to do with the Dalton boy's\noutburst. But I don't think I have to\nwarn you boys his age are very\nimpressionable.\n\nKEATING\nWell, your reprimand made quite an\nimpression, I'm sure.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nWhat was going on in the courtyard the\nother day?\n\nKEATING\nCourtyard?\n\nMR. NOLAN\nYeah. Boys marching, clapping in unison.\n\nKEATING\nOh, that. That was an exercise to prove\na point. Dangers of conformity.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nWell, John, the curriculum here is set.\nIt's proven it works. If you question,\nwhat's to prevent them from doing the\nsame?\n\nKEATING\nI always thought the idea of educating\nwas to learn to think for yourself.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nAt these boys' ages? Not on your life!\nTradition, John. Discipline. Prepare\nthem for college, and the rest will take\ncare of itself.\n\nCHARLIE\nCreak. He started walking around towards\nmy left. Creak. Creak. \"Assume the\nposition, Mr. Dalton.\"\n\nKEATING\nIt's all right, gentlemen.\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. Keating.\n\nKEATING\nMr. Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt\nyou pulled today.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about\nCarpe diem and sucking all the marrow\nout of life and all that?\n\nKEATING\nSucking the marrow out of life doesn't\nmean choking on the bone. Sure there's a\ntime for daring and there's a time for\ncaution, and a wise man understands\nwhich is called for.\n\nCHARLIE\nBut I thought you'd like that.\n\nKEATING\nNo. You being expelled from school is\nnot daring to me. It's stupid, 'cause\nyou'll miss some golden opportunities.\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah. Like what?\n\nKEATING\nLike, if nothing else, the opportunity\nto attend my classes. Got it, Ace?\n\nCHARLIE\nAye, aye, Captain.\n\nKEATING\nKeep your head about you. That goes for\nthe lot of you.\n\nBOYS\nYes, Captain.\n\nKEATING\nPhone call from God. If it had been\ncollect, it wouldn't been daring.\n\nCHARLIE\nAll right. Go on, play.\n\nDIRECTOR\nWe're trying to rehearse, okay? Start.\n\nLYSANDER\nA good persuasion, therefore hear me,\nHermia.\n\nDIRECTOR\nWait, please. Excitement. I don't hear\nany excitement about this play. And take\nher hand. Bring her down the stage and\nstop. And \"There, gentle Hermia.\" Okay?\nTry again.\n\nBOY 1\nWhat's for dinner?\n\nBOY 2\nSpaghetti and meatballs!\n\nNEIL\nSave some for me. \"But, room, Fairy!\nHere comes Oberon.\"\n\nNEIL\nFather.\n\nMR. PERRY\nNeil.\n\nNEIL\nWait a minute. Before you say anything,\nplease let me ex-\n\nMR. PERRY\nDon't you dare talk back to me! It's bad\nenough that you've wasted your time with\nthis, this absurd acting business. But\nyou deliberately deceived me! How, how,\nhow did you expect to get away with\nthis? Answer me. Who put you up to it?\nWas it this new man? This, uh, Mr.\nKeating?\n\nNEIL\nNo. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you.\nI've gotten all A's in every class.\n\nMR. PERRY\nDid you think I wasn't going to find\nout? \"Oh, my niece is in a play with\nyour son,\" says Mrs. Marks. \"No, no,\nno,\" I say, \"you must be mistaken. My\nson's not in a play.\" You made me a liar\nof me, Neil! Now, tomorrow you go to\nthem and you tell them that you're\nquitting.\n\nNEIL\nNo, I can't. I have the main part. The\nperformance is tomorrow night.\n\nMR. PERRY\nI don't care if the world comes to an\nend tomorrow night. You are through with\nthat play. Is that clear? Is that clear?\n\nNEIL\nYes, sir.\n\nMR. PERRY\nI made a great many sacrifices to get\nyou here, Neil, and you will not let me\ndown.\n\nNEIL\nNo, sir.\n\nKEATING\nIt's open.\n\nKEATING\nNeil, what's up?\n\nNEIL\nCan I speak to you a minute?\n\nKEATING\nCertainly. Sit down.\n\nNEIL\nI'm sorry. Here.\n\nKEATING\nExcuse me. Get you some tea?\n\nNEIL\nTea. Sure.\n\nKEATING\nLike some milk or sugar in that?\n\nNEIL\nNo, thanks.\n\nNEIL\nGosh, they don't give you much room\naround here.\n\nKEATING\nNo, it's part of the monastic oath. They\ndon't want worldly things distracting me\nfrom my teaching.\n\nNEIL\nShe's pretty.\n\nKEATING\nShe's also in London. Makes it a little\ndifficult.\n\nNEIL\nHow can you stand it?\n\nKEATING\nStand what?\n\nNEIL\nYou can go anywhere. You can do\nanything. How can you stand being here?\n\nKEATING\n'Cause I love teaching. I don't wanna be\nanywhere else.\n\nKEATING\nWhat's up?\n\nNEIL\nI just talked to my father. He's making\nme quit the play at Henley Hall.\nActing's everything to me. I-- But he\ndoesn't know. He-- I can see his point.\nWe're not a rich family like Charlie's,\nand we-- But he's planning the rest of\nmy life for me, and I-- H-He's never\nasked me what I want.\n\nKEATING\nHave you ever told your father what you\njust told me? About your passion for\nacting. You ever show him that?\n\nNEIL\nI can't.\n\nKEATING\nWhy not?\n\nNEIL\nI can't talk to him this way.\n\nKEATING\nThen you're acting for him, too. You're\nplaying the part of the dutiful son. I\nknow this sounds impossible, but you\nhave to talk to him. You have to show\nhim who you are, what your heart is.\n\nNEIL\nI know what he'll say. He'll tell me\nthat acting's a whim, and I should\nforget it. That how they're counting on\nme. He'll just tell me to put it out of\nmy mind, \"for my own good.\"\n\nKEATING\nYou are not an indentured servant. If\nit's not a whim for you, you prove it to\nhim by your conviction and your passion.\nYou show him that And if he still\ndoesn't believe you, well, by then\nyou'll be out of school and you can do\nanything you want.\n\nNEIL\nNo. What about the play? The show's\ntomorrow night.\n\nKEATING\nWell, you have to talk to him before\ntomorrow night.\n\nNEIL\nIsn't there an easier way?\n\nKEATING\nNo.\n\nNEIL\nI'm trapped.\n\nKEATING\nNo, you're not.\n\nKNOX\nChris!\n\nKNOX\nChris Noel. Do you know where she is?\n\nGIRL\nUm, I think she's in room 111.\n\nKNOX\nThanks.\n\nKNOX\nExcuse me. Chris.\n\nCHRIS\nKnox, what are you doing here?\n\nKNOX\nI came to apologize for the other night.\nI brought you these and a poem I wrote\nfor you.\n\nCHRIS\nKnox, don't you know that, if Chet finds\nyou here he'll kill you?\n\nKNOX\nI can't care. I love you, Chris.\n\nCHRIS\nKnox, you're crazy.\n\nKNOX\nLook, I acted like a jerk and I know it.\nPlease, accept these. Please.\n\nCHRIS\nNo. No-- I, I can't. Forget it.\n\nCHRIS\nKnox, I don't believe this.\n\nKNOX\nAll I'm asking you to do is listen.\nThe heavens made a girl named Chris\nWith hair and skin of gold.\nTo touch her would be paradise.\n\nCHARLIE\nGet out of here. Cameron, you fool. Hey,\nhow'd it go? Did you read it to her?\n\nKNOX\nYeah.\n\nPITTS\nWhat'd she say?\n\nKNOX\nNothing.\n\nCHARLIE\nNothing. What do you mean, nothing?\n\nKNOX\nNothing. But I did it.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat did she say? I know she had to say\nsomething.\n\nPITTS\nCome here, Knox.\n\nKNOX\nSeize the day!\n\nKEATING\nDid you talk to your father?\n\nNEIL\nUh, he didn't like it one bit, but at\nleast he's letting me stay in the play.\nHe won't be able to make, make it. He's\nin Chicago. But, uh, I think he's gonna\nlet me stay with acting.\n\nKEATING\nReally? You told him what you told me?\n\nNEIL\nYeah. He wasn't happy. But he'll be gone\nat least four days. I don't think he'll\nmake the show, but I think he'll let me\nstay with it. \"Keep up the school work.\"\nThanks.\n\nPITTS\nBeautiful baby.\n\nMEEKS\nBeautiful baby. Henley Hall, here I\ncome.\n\nCAMERON\nExcuse me, just a moment. Yes. You're so\ncute. Come on, Todd. I'm trying to fix\nthis.\n\nTODD\nCome on, Nuwanda. You're gonna miss\nNeil's entrance.\n\nPITTS\nHe said something about getting red\nbefore we left.\n\nCAMERON\nGetting red? What does that mean?\n\nPITTS\nI, uh-- Well, you know Charlie.\n\nTODD\nSo, Charlie, what's this \"getting red\"\nbit?\n\nTODD\nW-What is that?\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's an Indian warrior symbol for\nvirility. Makes me feel potent, like it\ncan drive girls crazy.\n\nTODD\nOh, come on, Charlie. The girls are\nwaiting.\n\nKNOX\nChris.\n\nKNOX\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nKEATING\nGentlemen, let's go.\n\nKNOX\nGo ahead, guys. I'll catch up.\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah, come on, guys.\n\nKNOX\nChris, you can't be in here. I-If they\ncatch you, we're both gonna be in big\ntrouble.\n\nCHRIS\nOh, but it's fine--\n\nCHRIS\nIt's fine for you to come barging into\nmy school and make a complete fool out\nof me?\n\nKNOX\nI don't mean to make a fool out of you.\n\nCHRIS\nWell, you did. Chet found out. And it\ntook everything I could do to keep him\nfrom coming here and killing you. Knox,\nyou have got to stop this stuff.\n\nKNOX\nI can't, Chris. I love you.\n\nCHRIS\nKnox, you say that over and over. You\ndon't, you don't even know me.\n\nKEATING\nWill you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?\n\nKNOX\nGo ahead, Captain. I'll walk.\n\nCHRIS\nKnox, Knox, it just so happens that I\ncould care less about you?\n\nKNOX\nThen you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.\n\nCHRIS\nI have to go. I'm gonna be late for the play.\n\nKNOX\nAre you going with him?\n\nCHRIS\nChet? To a play? Are you kidding?\n\nKNOX\nThen come with me.\n\nCHRIS\nKnox, you are so infuriating.\n\nKNOX\nCome on, Chris. Just give me one chance. If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.\n\nCHRIS\nUh-huh.\n\nKNOX\nI promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come with me tonight. And then, if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.\n\nCHRIS\nYou know what would happen if Chet found out?\n\nKNOX\nHe won't know anything. We'll sit in the back and sneak away as soon as it's over.\n\nCHRIS\nAnd I suppose you would promise that this would be the end of it.\n\nKNOX\nDead Poets Honor.\n\nCHRIS\nWhat is that?\n\nKNOX\nMy word.\n\nCHRIS\nYou are so infuriating.\n\nCHARLIE\nHey, there he is!

Tomorrow I'm withdrawing you from Welton and enrolling you in Braden Military School. You're going to Harvard and you're gonna be a doctor.\n\nNEIL\nBut that's ten more years. Father, that's a lifetime!\n\nMR. PERRY\nOh, stop it. Don't be so dramatic. You make it sound like a prison term. You don't understand, Neil. You have opportunities that I never even dreamt of and I am not going to let you waste them.\n\nNEIL\nI've got to tell you what I feel.\n\nMRS. PERRY\nWe've been so worried about--\n\nMR. PERRY\nWhat? What? Tell me what you feel. What\nis it?\n\nMR. PERRY\nIs it more of this, this acting business? Because you can forget that.\nWhat?\n\nNEIL\nNothing.\n\nMR. PERRY\nNothing. Well, then, let's go to bed.\n\nNEIL\nI was good. I was really good.\n\nMRS. PERRY\nGo on, get some sleep.\n\nMR. PERRY\nIt's all right. It's going to be all\nright.\n\nMR. PERRY\nWhat was that?\n\nMRS. PERRY\nWhat?\n\nMR. PERRY\nThat sound.\n\nMRS. PERRY\nWhat sound? Tom?\n\nMRS. PERRY\nWhat is it? What's wrong?\n\nMR. PERRY\nNeil.\n\nMRS. PERRY\nTom, what is it? What's wrong? Neil?\n\nMR. PERRY\nNeil?\n\nMRS. PERRY\nI'll look outside. Neil?\n\nMR. PERRY\nNo!\n\nMR. PERRY\nOh, Neil! Oh, my God!\n\nMRS. PERRY\nOh! No!\n\nMR. PERRY\nOh, my son!\n\nMRS. PERRY\nHe's all right.\n\nMR. PERRY\nMy son! My poor son!\n\nMRS. PERRY\nHe's all right! He's all right! He's all right! He's all right! He's all right! He's all right!\n\nMR. PERRY\nStop it!

It's okay, Todd.\n\nPITTS\nCalm down.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's all right, Todd.\n\nPITTS\nTodd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's all right. Now, listen.\n\nTODD\nHe wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it.\n\nMEEKS\nYou can't explain it, Todd.\n\nTODD\nIt was his father!\n\nCHARLIE\nNo!\n\nTODD\nHe wouldn't have left us. If he knew--\nHe wouldn't have.

NOLAN\nThe death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He was a fine student. One of Welton's best. And he will be missed. We've contacted each of your parents to explain the situation. Naturally, they're all quite concerned. At the request of Neil's family, I intend to conduct a thorough inquiry into this matter. Your complete cooperation is expected.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou told him about this meeting?\n\nPITTS\nTwice.\n\nCHARLIE\nThat's it, guys. We're all fried.\n\nPITTS\nHow do you mean?\n\nCHARLIE\nCameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office right now, finking.\n\nPITTS\nAbout what?\n\nCHARLIE\nThe club, Pissie. Think about it. The board of directors, the trustees and Mr. Nolan. Do you think for one moment they're gonna let this thing just blow over? Schools go down because of things like this. They need a scapegoat.\n\nCAMERON\nWhat's going on, guys?\n\nCHARLIE\nYou finked, didn't you, Cameron?\n\nCAMERON\nFinked? I didn't know what the hell you're talking about.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou told Nolan everything about the club is what I'm talking about.\n\nCAMERON\nLook, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton, there's something called an honor code at this school, all right? If a teacher asks you a question, you tell the truth or you're expelled.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou little punk!\n\nMEEKS\nCharlie!\n\nCHARLIE\nHe's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes, so he rattled to save himself.\n\nKNOX\nDon't touch him, Charlie. You do and you're out.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm out anyway!\n\nKNOX\nYou don't know that, not yet.\n\nCAMERON\nHe's right there, Charlie. And if you guys are smart, you will do exactly what I did and cooperate. They're not after us. We're the victims. Us and Neil.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat's that mean? Who are they after?\n\nCAMERON\nWhy, Mr. Keating, of course. The \"Captain\" himself. I mean, you guys didn't really think he could avoid responsibility, did you?\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is that what they're saying?\n\nCAMERON\nWell, who else do you think, dumb ass? The administration? Mr. Perry? Mr. Keating put us up to all this crap, didn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating, Neil would be cozied up in his room right now, studying his chemistry and dreaming of being called doctor.\n\nTODD\nThat is not true, Cameron. You know that. He didn't put us to anything. Neil loved acting.\n\nCAMERON\nBelieve what you want, but I say let Keating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives?\n\nKNOX\nCharlie.\n\nCAMERON\nYou just signed your expulsion papers, Nuwanda.\n\nCAMERON\nAnd if the rest of you are smart, you'll do exactly what I did. They know everything anyway. You can't save Keating, but you can save yourselves.\n\nHABER\nKnox Overstreet.\n\nTODD\nMeeks?\n\nMEEKS\nGo away. I have to study.\n\nTODD\nWhat happened to Nuwanda?\n\nMEEKS\nExpelled.\n\nTODD\nWhat'd you tell 'em?\n\nMEEKS\nNothing they didn't already know.\n\nHABER\nTodd Anderson.\n\nMR. ANDERSON\nHello, son.\n\nMRS. ANDERSON\nHello, darling.\n\nTODD\nMom.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nHave a seat, Mr. Anderson.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nMr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well put together what's happened here. You do admit to being a part of this Dead Poets Society?\n\nMR. ANDERSON\nAnswer him, Todd.\n\nTODD\nYes, sir.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nI have here a detailed description of what occurred at your meetings. It describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, encouraged you boys to organize this club and to use it as a source of inspiration for reckless and self- indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. Keating, both in and out of the classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to follow his obsession with acting when he knew all along it was against the explicit order of Neil's parents. It was Mr. Keating's blatant abuse of his position as teacher that led directly to Neil Perry's death.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nRead that document carefully, Todd. Very carefully.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nIf you've nothing to add or amend, sign it.\n\nTODD\nWhat's gonna happen to Mr. Keating?\n\nMR. ANDERSON\nI've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd.\n\nMcALLISTER\nGrass is gramen or herba. Lapis is stone. The entire building is aedificium.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nSit. I'll be teaching this class through exams. We'll find a permanent English teacher during the break. Who will tell me where you are in the Pritchard textbook?\n\nMR. NOLAN\nMr. Anderson.\n\nTODD\nUh, in the, in the Pr-\n\nMR. NOLAN\nI can't hear you, Mr. Anderson.\n\nTODD\nIn the, in the, in the Pritchard?\n\nMR. NOLAN\nKindly inform me, Mr. Cameron.\n\nCAMERON\nWe skipped around a lot, sir. We covered the Romantics and some of the chapters on Post Civil War literature.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nWhat about the Realists?\n\nCAMERON\nI believe we skipped most of that, sir.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nAll right, then, we'll start over. What\nis poetry?\n\nMR. NOLAN\nCome.\n\nKEATING\nExcuse me. I came for my personals. Should I come back after class?\n\nMR. NOLAN\nGet them now, Mr. Keating.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nGentlemen, turn to page 21 of the introduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on \"Understanding Poetry.\"\n\nCAMERON\nThat page has been ripped out, sir.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nWell, borrow somebody else's book.\n\nCAMERON\nThey're all ripped out, sir.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nWhat do you mean, they're all ripped out?\n\nCAMERON\nSir, we, uh-\n\nMR. NOLAN\nNever mind.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nRead!\n\nCAMERON\n\"Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then ask two questions: 1) How artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered and 2)...\"\n\nCAMERON\n... How important is that objective? Question 1 rates the poem's perfection; question 2 rates its importance. And once these questions have been answered, determining the poem's greatness becomes a relatively simple matter. If the poem's score for perfection is plotted on the horizontal of a graph--\n\nTODD\nMr. Keating! They made everybody sign it.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nQuiet, Mr. Anderson.\n\nTODD\nYou gotta believe me. It's true.\n\nKEATING\nI do believe you, Todd.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nLeave, Mr. Keating.\n\nTODD\nBut it wasn't his fault!\n\nMR. NOLAN\nSit down, Mr. Anderson! One more outburst from you or anyone else, and you're out of this school! Leave, Mr. Keating. I said leave, Mr. Keating.\n\nTODD\nO Captain! My Captain!\n\nMR. NOLAN\nSit down, Mr. Anderson!\n\nMR. NOLAN\nDo you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This is your final warning, Anderson. How dare you? Do you hear me?\n\nKNOX\nO Captain! My Captain!\n\nMR. NOLAN\nMr. Overstreet, I warn you! Sit down!\n\nMR. NOLAN\nSit down! Sit down. All of you. I want you seated. Sit down. Leave, Mr. Keating.\n\nMR. NOLAN\nAll of you, down. I want you seated. Do you hear me?\n\nMR. NOLAN\nSit down!\n\nKEATING\nThank you, boys. Thank you.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/7732070", "artist_names": "Gradient", "full_title": "Ultimatum (I Ate 'Em) by\u00a0Gradient", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5e4fdb3ee2bbaa9704a52e951a76e8c2.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5e4fdb3ee2bbaa9704a52e951a76e8c2.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 7732070, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 290137, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1645576215, "path": "/Gradient-ultimatum-i-ate-em-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Gradient-ultimatum-i-ate-em-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2022, "month": 2, "day": 22}, "release_date_for_display": "February 22, 2022", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 22, 2022", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5e4fdb3ee2bbaa9704a52e951a76e8c2.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5e4fdb3ee2bbaa9704a52e951a76e8c2.1000x1000x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Ultimatum (I Ate \u2019Em)", "title_with_featured": "Ultimatum (I Ate 'Em)", "updated_by_human_at": 1646251027, "url": "https://genius.com/Gradient-ultimatum-i-ate-em-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/74175", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0b02c13630201324000f93730c4e8678.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 74175, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3116f2ac2a0336e8e5cae941bdc116af.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Gradient", "slug": "Gradient", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Gradient"}, "artist": "Gradient", "lyrics": "Ultimatum (I Ate \u2019Em) Lyrics[Verse 1:]\nI can describe my rivals with a single word: unimpressive\nEvaluate your own shortcomings, I\u2019m done assessin\u2019\nBeatles on the rooftop, I\u2019m a public blessin\u2019\nThey feed us Elvis Presley while we needin\u2019 Billy Preston\nGet Back to bling and Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It\nI\u2019m local, you\u2019re not in the scene, you ain\u2019t hot wit it\nI leave \u2018em stupefied, you leave \u2018em in a lifeless stupor\nYou don\u2019t ride for your city just 'cause you drive for Uber\nAnd you ain\u2019t stackin\u2019 a stupid amount in salaries\nI\u2019m gettin\u2019 fat from refusal of countin\u2019 calories\nMy waistline is on some ramen embrace time\nI\u2019m still iconic as a Chili Peppers bassline\n[Hook:]\nTwo little devils try to whisper in my ear\nWhat I do might depend on which one that I hear\nOne is tellin\u2019 me, \"play the nice guy for a while\"\nWhile the other\u2019s sayin\u2019 \"save your energy, don\u2019t ever smile\"\nUltimatum!\nThese fishes takin\u2019 the bait until I fileted \u2018em\nNo more chickens are cluckin\u2019 after I ate \u2018em\n\n[Verse 2:]\nSo go and make your thesis claim\nYou pick my pronoun!

ease\nMy troubled mind\nMmm, listen\nMy father didn't know\nThe meaning of work\nHe disrespected Mama\nAnd treated us like dirt\nI left home seeking a job\nThat I never did find\nDepressed and

pride\nI'll sacrifice for you\nDedicate my life to you\nI will go where you lead\nAlways there in time of need\n[Pre-Chorus: Marvin Gaye]\nAnd when I lose my will\nYou'll be there to push me up the hill\n\n[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]\nThere's no, no looking back for us\nWe got love sure 'nough, that's enough\nYou're all, You're all I need to get by\n\n[Verse 3: Marvin Gaye]\nLike an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best\nStand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me\n\n[Verse 4: Tammi Terrell & Marvin Gaye]\nDarling in you I found\nStrength where I was torn down\nDon't know what's in store but together we can open any door\nJust to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher\nI know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal\n\n[Outro: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]\nCause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination\nYou're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more\nYou're all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one\nYou're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need to get byYou might also like5Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

understand\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou know understanding is a mighty powerful thing\nThat's why it makes me so sad\nWhen I see my friends wandering around through the world\nNever knowing the meaning of the word\nUnderstanding, so in the next few minutes, I'm going to\nTry to explain just exactly what it means\nNow wait a minute, listen, for instance, you take me\nAnd my old lady, we got to good thing going\nBecause I know If I don't work and pay the rent and the\nBills and buy her fine pretty clothes to wear well\nThere are fifteen other guys just waiting round the\nCorner, and I don't care how much that woman loves me\nShe's going to go out and find herself one of them who\nWill and that's why I believe that\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow listen I don't want you to think that this is a\nOne sided affair, no no\nBecause my old lady also understands that a man must\nHave respect\nWhat I mean is, if she must play around don't let me\nCatch her, because what I don't see can't hurt me, you\nUnderstand? but on the other hand, If I should ever\nCatch her I'm not gonna talk about-a\nAnd call her a bunch of bad names like you all might\nNo no mh\nWhat I'm going to do, I'm going to go down-town to the\nHardware store and buy myself a double blade axe\nCome back, square off, and believe her soul's going to\nBelong to the good lord\nBecause her head's gonna belong to me, and I\nGuarantee she'll know what I mean when I'll say\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[To end]You might also likeEmbed"}]
