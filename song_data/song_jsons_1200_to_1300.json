still climbing, even here inside these walls\nBreaking each others hearts and we don\u2019t care 'cause we\u2019re so\n\n[Chorus]\nIn too deep, can\u2019t think about giving it up\nBut I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack\nIt\u2019s killing me, swear I never cried so much\n'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad\nThe worst pain that I ever had\nOh woah, never knew love, oh woah\nWould hurt this fucking bad\nThe worst pain that I ever had\n[Verse 2]\nAll the times when I know I should be smiling\nSeem to be the time that I frown the most\nCan't believe that we're still surviving\n'Cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close\nAnd if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who\nWho I gave my love to\nThat's the reason I stay around\nEven though I fell way\n\n[Chorus]\nIn too deep, can\u2019t think about giving it up\nBut I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack\nIt\u2019s killing me, swear I never cried so much\n'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad\nThe worst pain that I ever had\nOh woah, never knew love, oh woah\nWould hurt this fucking bad\nThe worst pain that I ever had\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd it hurts 'cause I wanna leave\nAnd you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together\nAnd if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to\nThat's the reason I stay around, even though I fell way\nYou might

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI spent 20 years trying to get out of this place\nI was looking for something I couldn't replace\nI was running away from the only thing I've ever known\nLike a blind dog without a bone\nI was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone\nI hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold\nI been there, done that and I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown\nSaving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone\nWho says you can't go home?\n[Chorus]\nWho says you can't go home?\nThere's only one place they call me one of their own\nJust a hometown boy, born a rolling stone\nWho says you can't go home?\nWho says you can't go back?\nBeen all around the world and as a matter of fact\nThere's only one place left I want to go\nWho says you can't go home?\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright\n\n[Verse 2]\nI went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face\nThere isn't one of these lines that I would erase\nI lived a million miles of memories on that road\nWith every step I take I know that I'm not alone\nYou take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home\nThese are my streets, the only life I've ever known\nWho says you can't go home\n\n[Chorus]\nWho says you can't go home?\nThere's only one place they call me one of their own\nJust a hometown boy, born a rolling stone\nWho says you can't go home?\nWho says you can't go back?\nBeen all around the world and as a matter of fact\nThere's only one place left I want to go\nWho says you can't go home?\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI been there, done that and I ain't looking back\nIt's been a long long road\nFeels like I never left, that's how the story goes\nIt doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter where you go\nIf it's a million miles aways or just a mile up the road\nTake it in, take it with you when you go\nWho says you can't go home?\n\n[Chorus]\nWho says you can't go home?\nThere's only one place they call me one of their own\nJust a hometown boy, born a rolling stone\nWho says you can't go home?\nWho says you can't go back?\nBeen all around the world and as a matter of fact\nThere's only one place left I want to go\nWho says you can't go home?\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright,

for all the clean, decent women\n[Cee-Lo] Lay it on me girl\n[T-Dubl] Pay Close Attention\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nShe put that sugar on my tongue\nShes gonna\nGimme gimme some\nShe put it right there on my tongue (Sweet Sweet)\nRight there on my tongue (She turns me on, like no other)\n[Trick Daddy]\nAnd gimme some of your butter pecan\nPut it right there on tip of my tongue, hold it\nRight jeeeah\nCuz baby, if I bite you\nI bet you'll like it\nFrench Vanilla's a hell of a flavor for me\nWith strawberries, two cherries and whipped cream\nThe best things are the wet dreams\nAnd uh, the rest is just a flick without a sex scene\nOrally, I speak the truth\nCuz the blacker the berry\nThe sweeter the juice\nCuz, Florida oranges and Georgia peaches\nWhen they nice and ripe, they the best for eatin'\nSouthern boys we crave for old slice of pie after they main course\nSo if you game for it\nI came for it\nI got a thing for ya\nThat I can't ignore\n\n[Hook] - 2X\n\n[Ludacris]\nShe put that sugar on my tongue, tongue\nYippie Yippie, Yum Yum\nGoodie goodie gum drop\nPut me in a tongue lock\nDid it till my body went numb, numb\nLaid her on her back, back\nTurned her round, gave her bottom a smack, smack\nShe's a woman from the block with the best of weave\nBut I won't stop till I'm pullin out tracks, tracks\nIt was lust at first sight\nAnd she couldn't help sayin that she wanted to get with me\nAnd my size was just right\nCuz she wanted a man with a little sec-ur-ity\nSaid I been around the world twice\nAnd my name ring bells from Atlanta to Sic-i-ly\nSaid she wanted it all night\nSo put the bubbles in the tub and Luda-christen me\nYou might also like[Hook] - 2X\n\nYeah Yeah Yeah Yeeeah Yeeeah Yeah\nYeah Yeah\n\n[Trick Daddy]\nSweetie you look so incredible\nSo delicious and so damn edible\nAll I need is some honey or syrup\nWith a lil' butter to rub down all your curves\nAnd no need for the lemonade\nJust a twist of lime and some grape Kool-Aid\nCan I call you Caramel?\nCuz I'm bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs\nOne bowl ought to fill me up\nBut that milk gotta be cold enough\nSo supper time that'll hold me up\nI might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but\nHoney, you look like a honeydew melon\nOr strawberry with the whipped cream filling\nOf the top part of the peach cobbler\nBut uh, the fruit platter ought to do me better\n\n[Hook] -

Fabolous]\nI can't really explain it\nI'm so into you now, I want to be more than a friend of you now\nWhen they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now\nAnd I don't bring the problems from the '90s into 2 thou'\nThere's no reason to have a friend or two now\n'Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vows\nMaybe, I'm speakin' general now\nBut girl I'ma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now\nWhere I go, they wear bikinis in the winter too now\nWhat you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now\nWhy wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'\nOn Fifth Ave. shoppin' sprees, and them dinners to Chow's\nI ain't concerned what other men would do now\nAs long as when I slide up in you, you growl\nAnd any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now\nAnd I ain't jealous, it's the principle now\nI'm so into you\n[Chorus: Ashanti]\nI really like what you've done to me\nI can't really explain it\nI'm so into you\nI really like what you've done to me\nI can't

you can hear when the water be splashin'\nThe drop top three and a quarter we dashin'\nThe flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'\nThe money, we oughta be stashin'\nI make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it\nMy friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'\nWhat kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks you be sippin'\nSweet thing, just to think of you dippin'\nWould have me with the blue's so hard, you would think I was Crippin'\nNow, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits\nSo you don't worry about maxin' when you spend\nEver since you've been askin' 'bout the friends\nHow'd you like it if, both our name's had Jackson on the ends, uh\nYou might also like[Chorus: Ashanti]\nI really like what you've done to me\nI

cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris\nYou love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is\nWith you, it ain't because my whips is roofless\nOr sit on chrome dipped dub deuces\nAnd you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'\nOther ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes\nYou don't let them kinda numbers impress you\nEven though I was somewhat successful\nBein' a player was becomin' too stressful\nBut every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue\nMy winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special\nLet's fly to St. Bart, while the villa be painted\nJust so we can get really acquainted\nThe love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted\nBut I can't really explain it, uh, yeah\n[Chorus: Ashanti]\nI really like what

knew they'd all be magnified\n\n[Hook]\nAnd it feels alright\nAnd it feels alright\n\n[Verse 4]\nCame around after dark\nYou are nothing but a lark\nKnow I snuck in like a narc\nI knew I had to leave

couldn't keep\n[Pre-Chrous 1]\nIt seems no one can help me now\nI'm in too deep\nThere's no way out\nThis time I have really led myself astray\n\n[Chorus]\nRunaway train never going back\nWrong way on

did I get so jaded?\nLife's mystery seems so faded\n\nI can go where no one else can go\nI know what no one else knows\nHere I am, just drowning in the rain\nWith a ticket for a runaway

that you've done to me\nBut it's caused me to act in such a crazy way\nWhatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing\nIt's a feeling that I want to stay\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause my heart starts beating triple time\nWith thoughts of loving you on my mind\nI can't figure out just what to do\nWhen the cause and cure is you\n[Chorus]\nI get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)\nI lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)\nIn a daze and it's so amazing (Amaze)\nIt's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)\nBy my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)\nYour love is so sweet\nIt knocks me right off of my feet\nCan't explain why your lovin' makes me weak\n\n[Verse 2]\nTime after time, after time I try to fight it\nBut your love is strong, it keeps on holding on\nResistance is down when you're around, cries fading\nIn my condition, I don't want to be alone\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause my heart starts beating triple time\nWith thoughts of loving you on my mind\nI can't figure out just what to do\nWhen the cause and cure is you, ohh\n\n[Chorus]\nI get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)\nI

swallow my pride (My pride)\nYour love is so sweet\nIt knocks me right off of my feet\nCan't explain why your lovin' makes me weak\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nI try hard to fight it\nNo way can I

feet\nCan't explain why your lovin' makes me weak\n\n[Verse 3]\n(I get so weak)\nBlood starts racing through my veins\n(I get so weak)\nBoy, it's something I can't explain\n(I get so weak)\nSomething 'bout the way you do\nThe things you do, it\n(Knocks me right off of my feet)\nOhh, off my feet, I\nCan't explain why your lovin' makes me weak\n[Chorus]\nI get so weak in the knees, I can hardly

drummer on a grey tour bus\nI got there in the nick of time\nBefore he got his hands across your state line\n[Verse 2]\nNow it's the middle of the night on the open road\nAnd the heater don't work and it's oh so cold\nYou're looking tired, you're looking kind of beat\nThe rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou didn't know how rock and roll looked\nUntil you caught your sister with the guys from the group\nHalf way home in the parking lot\nBy the look in her eye she was giving what she got\n\n[Chorus]\nMy, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby\nMy, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby\nMy, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby\n\n[Verse 3]\nWoman you're a mess going to die in your sleep\nThere's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat\nCan't keep you home, you're messing around\nMy best friend told me you're the best lick in town\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou didn't know that rock and roll burned\nSo you bought a candle and you lived and you learned\nYou got the rhythm you got the speed\nMama's little baby likes it short and sweet\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nMy, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby\nMy, my, my, I'm once bitten,

only one\nBut look at you now, it's dark as it's dumb\n\n[Chorus]\nMy, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby\nMy, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby\nMy, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy,

cause you're on my mind\nYou're the one I think about most every time\nAnd when you crack a smile in everything you do\nDon't you understand, girl? This love is true\nYou\u2019re soft, silky hand long, sweet and thin\nThat candlelight complexion upon your skin\nIt lightens up my day, and that's oh so true\nTogether, we're one, separated we're two\nTo make you all mine, all mine is my desire\nCause you contain a quality that I admire\nYou're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world\nSo try to understand\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm in love, girl\nI'm in so love, girl\nI'm just in love, girl\nAnd this is true\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl, you know it's true\nOoh, ooh, ooh, I love you\nYes, you know it's true\nOoh, ooh, ooh, I love you\nGirl, you know it's true\nMy love is for you\nGirl, you know it's true\nMy love is for you\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain\nMy emotion starts up when I hear your name\nMaybe your sweet sweet voice would ring in my ear\nThen delay my system, girl, when you are near\nCome with your positive emotion, love, making enjoyin\nThat's for me to bust it's like a girl and a boy\nThese feelings I get I often wonder why\nSo I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I\nNow what you're wearing I don't care, as I've said before\nNo reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are\nIf I said I'd think about it, you rule my world\nSo try to understand\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm in love, girl\nI'm in so love, girl\nI'm just in love, girl\nAnd this is true\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl, you know it's true\nOoh, ooh, ooh, I love you\nYes, you know it's true\nOoh, ooh, ooh, I love you\nGirl, you know it's true\nMy love is for you\nGirl, you know it's true\nMy love is for you\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm in love wit' you, girl\nI'm in love wit' you, girl, girl, girl, girl\nI'm in love wit' you, I'm in love wit' you\nI'm in love wit' you\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl, you know it's true\nMy love is for you (Girl, you know it's true)\nGirl\nOoh, ooh, ooh, I love you\nYes, you know it's true, g-g-g-g-girl\nOoh, ooh, ooh, I love you4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0,
