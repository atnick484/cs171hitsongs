stories about the Indians\nWas my biggest thrill\n\nI'd shout and yell and holler like heck\nI wore moccasins on my feet\nAnd I'd make believe I was under a teepee\nEvery time I went to sleep\nMy hair was jet black and I was twenty-one\nLots of pretty girls around\nBut the paleface maidens didn't thrill me none\nAround my Cochise County hometown\n\n{Son, don't go near the Indians\nPlease stay away\nSon, don't go near the Indians\nPlease do what I say}\n\nOne day I went to the reservation\nAnd there by a shallow creek\nWas a beautiful Indian a-fetchin' water\nAnd I just had to speak\n\nShe smiled at me then quickly left\nBut the next day she returned\nAnd it wasn't very long till I told her how\nThe love in my heart burned\n\n{Son, don't go near the Indians\nPlease stay away\nSon, don't go near the Indians\nPlease do what I say}\n\nI told my daddy I'd found a girl\nWho meant the world to me\nAnd tomorrow I'd ask the Indian chief\nFor the hand of NovaLee\nYou might also likeDad's

son, NovaLee is your sister\nAnd that's why I've always said\n\nSINGING:\n{Son, don't go near the Indians\nPlease stay away\nSon, don't go near the Indians\nPlease do what I say}Embed"}, {"_type":

transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

Jigjag.\n\n(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)\n\n(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)\n\nLONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.\n\n(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!\n\nJOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father! Little father!\n\nTHE BABES AND SUCKLINGS\n\nClap clap hands till Poldy comes home,\nCakes in his pocket for Leo alone.\n\n\n(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)\n\n\nBABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.)

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!\n\n\nTHE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!\n\n\n(The rams' horns sound for silence.

DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.\n\nBROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.\n\nBANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.\n\n(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)\n\nBRINI, PAPAL NUNCIO (In papal zouave's uniform, steel cuirasses as breastplate, armplates, thighplates, legplates, large profane moustaches and brown paper mitre.)

And under Ballybough bridge?\n\nA HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?\n\nBLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.\n\nTHE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!\n\n(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)\n\nTHE ARTANE ORPHANS\n\nYou big, you bog, you dirty dog!\nYou think the ladies love you!\n\n\nTHE PRISON GATE GIRLS\n\nIf you see kay\nTell him he may\nSee you in tea\nTell him from me.\n\n\nHORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.)

And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.\n\n(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)\n\nMESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.\n\nBLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!\n\n(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)\n\nREUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.\n\n(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)\n\nTHE CITIZEN Thank heaven!\n\nBLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.\n\n(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)\n\nTHE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.\n\n(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in.

Ahhkkk!\n\nELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\n\nZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.\n\nFLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.\n\nSTEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.\n\n(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)\n\nTHE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.\n\nLYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.\n\n(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O!

Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo!

When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.)

Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches.

Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready.

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding.

She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!\n\n\n(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts...

He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1775436", "artist_names": "Bobby Vee", "full_title": "Punish Her by\u00a0Bobby\u00a0Vee", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/026e6ea03a1dd4bde4e18f488cb21f99.300x372x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/026e6ea03a1dd4bde4e18f488cb21f99.323x400x1.jpg", "id": 1775436, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1430207839, "path": "/Bobby-vee-punish-her-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Bobby-vee-punish-her-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/026e6ea03a1dd4bde4e18f488cb21f99.300x372x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/026e6ea03a1dd4bde4e18f488cb21f99.323x400x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Punish Her", "title_with_featured": "Punish Her", "updated_by_human_at": 1481906569, "url": "https://genius.com/Bobby-vee-punish-her-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/330469", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/026e6ea03a1dd4bde4e18f488cb21f99.323x400x1.jpg", "id": 330469, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/026e6ea03a1dd4bde4e18f488cb21f99.323x400x1.jpg", "index_character": "b", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Bobby Vee", "slug": "Bobby-vee", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Bobby-vee"}, "artist": "Bobby Vee", "lyrics": "Punish Her LyricsIf she has wronged you\nFound someone new\nBut you feel it's not over\nHere's what you must do\n\nPunish her - kill her with kindness\nOh buy her red roses everyday\nAh Punish her with so much affection\nThat she will cry for the love she threw away\n\nShe'll soon rediscover with tears in her eyes\nThat you're the only lover she was born to idolize\nJust Punish her - blind her with kisses\nAh til she can't see how she let you go\nThen whisper darling, darling, darling\nI still love you so\n\nPunish her, punish her\nPunish her, punish her\n\nAh Punish her - blind her with kisses\nTil she can't see how she let you go\nThen whisper darling, darling, darling\nI still love you so\n\nPunish her, punish her\nPunish her, punish herYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/3887589", "artist_names": "The Valentinos", "full_title": "Lookin' for a Love by\u00a0The\u00a0Valentinos", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a0fc6e124d6689dd0c92d37a33f1333e.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a0fc6e124d6689dd0c92d37a33f1333e.355x355x1.jpg", "id": 3887589, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 5593635, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1533745300, "path": "/The-valentinos-lookin-for-a-love-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-valentinos-lookin-for-a-love-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1962, "month": 1, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "January 1, 1962", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 1, 1962", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a0fc6e124d6689dd0c92d37a33f1333e.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a0fc6e124d6689dd0c92d37a33f1333e.355x355x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Lookin\u2019 for a Love", "title_with_featured": "Lookin' for a Love", "updated_by_human_at": 1655475712, "url": "https://genius.com/The-valentinos-lookin-for-a-love-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/530740", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/52dc69cf38921117f01bf3836327c6f6.346x240x1.jpg", "id": 530740, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/7f84fc42207b1b96d7c1e86196d7a570.252x252x1.jpg", "index_character": "v", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "The Valentinos", "slug": "The-valentinos", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-valentinos"}, "artist": "The Valentinos", "lyrics": "Lookin\u2019 for a Love Lyrics[Intro]\n(I'm lookin' for a love)\n(I'm lookin' for a love)\nMmmm ...

were building a bridge of steel\n\nWell, they hammered\nAnd they cut and they riveted\nAnd the welding torches were bright\nMaking a strap on a river's back\nWhen upon one fatal night\n[Chorus]\nSteel men, hey\nWorking on a bridge\nTo cross that water\nSteel men, ho\nWorking on a bridge of steel\n\nWell, it happened on\nThe eighteenth day of June\nBack in nineteen fifty plus eight\nPeople were fishing from the shore\nThe day was getting late\n\nNow the wind was\nTugging at the maple trees\nBut a steel man knows no fear\nIf somebody wanted\nTo bridge the Pacific\nWell, a steel man would be there\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, all of a sudden\nNow, the wind picked up\nAnd it blew as hard as it could\nAnd that steel bridge swayed\nLike a leaf in the breeze\nAnd it snapped like a stick of wood\nYou might also likeNow the girders buckled\nAnd the rivets broke\nAnd the water heard the cry\nAnd that steel bridge\nShook off the working men\nLike a hound dog shakes off flies\n\n[Chorus]\nEighteen men just as hard as nails\nAnd as eager as a brand new bride\nAnd as the clock on the\nTower said quarter of four\nAll eighteen had died\n\n[Chorus]\nSteel men, ain't going back\nTo a wife and daughter\nSteel men, living and dying by steel\n\nLiving and dying by steel\nLiving and dying by steel\nLiving and dying by steelEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path":

my\u2005peers\nTo\u2005do all this\u2005I had to break up with\u2005my fears\nStay locked up all day I vibed only with my playlist\nAin\u2019t trying to make no friends only wanna make me some records\nStayed away from the world loneliness became my idol\nKept huzzling everyday needed cash to record my songs\nAin\u2019t nobody to go to ain\u2019t nobody knew I was into music\nI kept my life locked up and I knew threw away the keys\nThis kind of life ain\u2019t pretty only I see the joy in it\nFantasizing about my dreams I knew one day I\u2019d get it\n(BLUES MADE THE BEAT YO)\n[Verse:1]\nI got some feelings I been hushing and they not good\nA lot of females who done left but they still want me\nAunties and uncles who ain\u2019t shit but want control me\nBut I don\u2019t care just feeling dizzy off this backwood\nCy, Khalito support me like I\u2019m their own son\nThey know I\u2019m stubborn try to change me but they love me\nFor what is right make sure  I put them in a hellcat\nPen and paper by my side I love you realest\nYou\u2019re my sidekick\nI want go out on a high note\nI don\u2019t even have no spare time\nNever really liked being normal\nMen that shit just looks farcical\nJust know if you\u2019re trying to fit in\nThen you took the easy way out\nIts a very very strong world\nAnd I\u2019m just a hopeful sinner\nI been living very lavish I just bought some balenciagas\nI\u2019m never caught unfresh your girl and I inamorata\nI done glowed up really well I blossom like a portulaca\nFor my niggas I\u2019m gon' ride Jimmy, Khulman, Stormy familia\nAll this rapping got me hectic right now I just want Clarissa\nWilliam see your vision through me we about to make them look retarded\nTunes hit harder than explosives reason why I\u2019ve been a target\n20 songs without no sponsors homie please don\u2019t get me started\nYou might also likeOn that Gang shit n*gga\nThe way blues went hard on this one\nIt\u2019s like he knew this was

ain\u2019t sipping nothing I need me a brimmer\nYou a busybody why not be a stringer\nI don\u2019t text these thotties only stay on twitter\nAlways looking very fly I\u2019m not a swinger\nMy voice messed up right now I\u2019ma need some ginger\nGet this cake all by myself I think that I must be a wizard\nElise heard all of my songs thank you for always being supportive\nChristian Khulman Knew I was gifted they was always willing to hear me\nFirst day TK heard my songs he told me not to ever give up\nI told broski he need not worry I be living for this music\nAll that striving and travailing is about to get rewarded\nIm gon' end up in a can before I ever think of stopping\nTwo years ago I was free styling and I posted it on snap\nSick replies from all you bitches yeah I didn\u2019t expect more\nTook that as a sample test learnt how most you humans think\nThat nigga bossdude was calling my phone\nHe told me he want free his mo'\nBurnt that joint and we was faded Nazy max was cracking jokes\nPlenty bitches very tekky homie loves to play football\nI failed math I had four papers homies used to (YAHMAN)\nWhen I finally get exposure they gon' claim to love my flow\nI don\u2019t care I ain\u2019t even bothered I don\u2019t care about none of that\n[Outro]\nBlues is the man\nHe told me to get in beastmode (Bigman)\nI told him I\u2019m built like this\nNone of this new to me

"Louisa-may-alcott", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Louisa-may-alcott"}, "artist": "Louisa May Alcott", "lyrics": "Little Women (Chap. 24) LyricsIn order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding with free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches. And here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too much 'lovering' in the story, as I fear they may (I'm not afraid the young folks will make that objection), I can only say with Mrs. March, \"What can you expect when I have four gay girls in the house, and a dashing young neighbor over the way?\"\n\nThe three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family. The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better than learning, the charity which calls all mankind 'brother', the piety that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.\n\nThese attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard experience had distilled no bitter drop. Earnest young men found the gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts to him, sure of finding the gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel. Sinners told their sins to the pure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and saved. Gifted men found a companion in him. Ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own, and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true, although 'they wouldn't pay'.\n\nTo outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so they did in many things, but the quiet scholar, sitting among his books, was still the head of the family, the household conscience, anchor, and comforter, for to him the busy, anxious women always turned in troublous times, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred words, husband and father.\n\nThe girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their souls into their father's, and to both parents, who lived and labored so faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death.\n\nMrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that the hospitals and homes still full of wounded 'boys' and soldiers' widows, decidedly miss the motherly missionary's visits.\nJohn Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent home, and not allowed to return. He received no stars or bars, but he deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly resigned to his discharge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for business, and earning a home for Meg. With the good sense and sturdy independence that characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence's more generous offers, and accepted the place of bookkeeper, feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any risks with borrowed money.\n\nMeg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly in character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever, for love is a great beautifier. She had her girlish ambitions and hopes, and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin. Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg couldn't help contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid outfit with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. But somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor John had put into the little home awaiting her, and when they sat together in the twilight, talking over their small plans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot Sallie's splendor and felt herself the richest, happiest girl in Christendom.\n\nJo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to Amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going, and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would have served a far harder mistress. So she gave her mornings to duty, her afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo meantime devoted herself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past. Not an invalid exactly, but never again the rosy, healthy creature she had been, yet always hopeful, happy, and serene, and busy with the quiet duties she loved, everyone's friend, and an angel in the house, long before those who loved her most had learned to know it.\n\nAs long as The Spread Eagle paid her a dollar a column for her 'rubbish', as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun her little romances diligently. But great plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to place the name of March upon the roll of fame.\n\nLaurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please himself. A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent, and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being spoiled, and probably would have been, like many another promising boy, if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any means, the knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him with all their hearts.\n\nBeing only 'a glorious human boy', of course he frolicked and flirted, grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions ordained, hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion. But as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save himself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection. In fact, he rather prided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors, dignified professors, and vanquished enemies. The 'men of my class', were heroes in the eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits of 'our fellows', and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.\n\nAmy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among them, for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed. Meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular John to care for any other lords of creation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how Amy dared to order them about so, but Jo felt quite in her own element, and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes, phrases, and feats, which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies. They all liked Jo immensely, but never fell in love with her, though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine. And speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the 'Dovecote'.\n\nThat was the name of the little brown house Mr. Brooke had prepared for Meg's first home. Laurie had christened it, saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who 'went on together like a pair of turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo'. It was a tiny house, with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in the front. Here Meg meant to have a fountain, shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers, though just at present the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a dilapidated slopbowl, the shrubbery consisted of several young larches, undecided whether to live or die, and the profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted. But inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar. To be sure, the hall was so narrow it was fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in whole, the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit, and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coalbin. But once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more complete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory. There were no marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a stand of flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all about, the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought.\n\nI don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty because John put up the bracket it stood upon, that any upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy's artistic hand, or that any store-room was ever better provided with good wishes, merry words, and happy hopes than that in which Jo and her mother put away Meg's few boxes, barrels, and bundles, and I am morally certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over, and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute 'Mis. Brooke came home'. I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.\n\nPeople who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose, for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them, and Meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest, from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was eloquent of home love and tender forethought.\n\nWhat happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping excursions, what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter arose over Laurie's ridiculous bargains. In his love of jokes, this young gentleman, though nearly through college, was a much of a boy as ever. His last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits some new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. Now a bag of remarkable clothespins, next, a wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at the first trial, a knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives, or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt, labor-saving soap that took the skin off one's hands, infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer, and every kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for odd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam with every prospect of exploding in the process.\n\nIn vain Meg begged him to stop. John laughed at him, and Jo called him 'Mr. Toodles'. He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week beheld some fresh absurdity.\n\nEverything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different colored soaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth's setting the table for the first meal.\n\"Are you satisfied? Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you should be happy here?\" asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever.\n\n\"Yes, Mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and so happy that I can't talk about it,\" with a look that was far better than words.\n\n\"If she only had a servant or two it would be all right,\" said Amy, coming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece.\n\n\"Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try her way first. There will be so little to do that with Lotty to run my errands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick,\" answered Meg tranquilly.\n\n\"Sallie Moffat has four,\" began Amy.\n\n\"If Meg had four, the house wouldn't hold them, and master and missis would have to camp in the garden,\" broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles.\n\n\"Sallie isn't a poor man's wife, and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment. Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big one. It's a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip. When I was first married, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn, so that I might have the pleasure of mending them, for I got heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she does to amuse herself, though they never turn out well and the servants laugh at her,\" said Meg.\n\n\"I did after a while, not to 'mess' but to learn of Hannah how things should be done, that my servants need not laugh at me. It was play then, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help. You begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons you learn now will be of use to you by-and-by when John is a richer man, for the mistress of a house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if she wishes to be well and honestly served.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mother, I'm sure of that,\" said Meg, listening respectfully to the little lecture, for the best of women will hold forth upon the all absorbing subject of house keeping. \"Do you know I like this room most of all in my baby house,\" added Meg, a minute after, as they went upstairs and she looked into her well-stored linen closet.\n\nBeth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and exulting over the goodly array. All three laughed as Meg spoke, for that linen closet was a joke. You see, having said that if Meg married 'that Brooke' she shouldn't have a cent of her money, Aunt March was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow. She never broke her word, and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy herself. Mrs. Carrol, Florence's mamma, was ordered to buy, have made, and marked a generous supply of house and table linen, and send it as her present, all of which was faithfully done, but the secret leaked out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family, for Aunt March tried to look utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could give nothing but the old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first bride.\n\n\"That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see. I had a young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger bowls for company and that satisfied her,\" said Mrs. March, patting the damask tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness.\n\n\"I haven't a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will last me all my days, Hannah says.\" And Meg looked quite contented, as well she might.\nA tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt basin of a hat, and a flyaway coat, came tramping down the road at a great pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate, straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out and a hearty...\n\n\"Here I am, Mother! Yes, it's all right.\"\n\nThe last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him, a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.\n\n\"For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker's congratulations and compliments. Bless you, Beth! What a refreshing spectacle you are, Jo. Amy, you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady.\"\n\nAs Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg, pulled Beth's hair ribbon, stared at Jo's big pinafore, and fell into an attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and everyone began to talk.\n\n\"Where is John?\" asked Meg anxiously.\n\n\"Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Which side won the last match, Teddy?\" inquired Jo, who persisted in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years.\n\n\"Ours, of course. Wish you'd been there to see.\"\n\n\"How is the lovely Miss Randal?\" asked Amy with a significant smile.\n\n\"More cruel than ever. Don't you see how I'm pining away?\" and Laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.\n\n\"What's the last joke? Undo the bundle and see, Meg,\" said Beth, eying the knobby parcel with curiosity.\n\n\"It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,\" observed Laurie, as a watchman's rattle appeared, amid the laughter of the girls.\n\n\"Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood in a jiffy. Nice thing, isn't it?\" and Laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears.\n\n\"There's gratitude for you! And speaking of gratitude reminds me to mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake from destruction. I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she hadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it looked like a remarkably plummy one.\"\n\n\"I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie,\" said Meg in a matronly tone.\n\n\"I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much higher, I'm afraid, as six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days,\" responded the young gentleman, whose head was about level with the little chandelier.\n\n\"I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spick-and-span bower, so as I'm tremendously hungry, I propose an adjournment,\" he added presently.\n\n\"Mother and I are going to wait for John. There are some last things to settle,\" said Meg, bustling away.\n\n\"Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant's to get more flowers for tomorrow,\" added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.\n\n\"Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow. I'm in such a state of exhaustion I can't get home without help. Don't take off your apron, whatever you do, it's peculiarly becoming,\" said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his feeble steps.\n\n\"Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow,\" began Jo, as they strolled away together. \"You must promise to behave well, and not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans.\"\n\n\"Not a prank.\"\n\n\"And don't say funny things when we ought to be sober.\"\n\n\"I never do. You are the one for that.\"\n\n\"And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony. I shall certainly laugh if you do.\"\n\n\"You won't see me, you'll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you will obscure the prospect.\"\n\n\"I never cry unless for some great affliction.\"\n\n\"Such as fellows going to college, hey?\" cut in Laurie, with suggestive laugh.\n\n\"Don't be a peacock. I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company.\"\n\n\"Exactly. I say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week? Pretty amiable?\"\n\n\"Very. Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he'll take it?\" asked Jo rather sharply.\n\n\"Now, Jo, do you think I'd look your mother in the face and say 'All right', if it wasn't?\" and Laurie stopped short, with an injured air.\n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\n\"Then don't go and be suspicious. I only want some money,\" said Laurie, walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.\n\n\"You spend a great deal, Teddy.\"\n\n\"Bless you, I don't spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is gone before I know it.\"\n\n\"You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and can't say 'No' to anyone. We heard about Henshaw and all you did for him. If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame you,\" said Jo warmly.\n\n\"Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill. You wouldn't have me let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help, when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?\"\n\n\"Of course not, but I don't see the use of your having seventeen waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home. I thought you'd got over the dandy period, but every now and then it breaks out in a new spot. Just now it's the fashion to be hideous, to make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket, orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots. If it was cheap ugliness, I'd say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I don't get any satisfaction out of it.\"\n\nLaurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack, that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the maltreated hat, and stuffed it into his pocket.\n\n\"Don't lecture any more, there's a good soul! I have enough all through the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home. I'll get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my friends.\"\n\n\"I'll leave you in peace if you'll only let your hair grow. I'm not aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person who looks like a young prize fighter,\" observed Jo severely.\n\n\"This unassuming style promotes study, that's why we adopt it,\" returned Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity, having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for quarter-inch-long stubble.\n\n\"By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting desperate about Amy. He talks of her constantly, writes poetry, and moons about in a most suspicious manner. He'd better nip his little passion in the bud, hadn't he?\" added Laurie, in a confidential, elder brotherly tone, after a minute's silence.\n\n\"Of course he had. We don't want any more marrying in this family for years to come. Mercy on us, what are the children thinking of?\" and Jo looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were not yet in their teens.\n\n\"It's a fast age, and I don't know what we are coming to, ma'am. You are a mere infant, but you'll go next, Jo, and we'll be left lamenting,\" said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of the times.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed. I'm not one of the agreeable sort. Nobody will want me, and it's a mercy, for there should always be one old maid in a family.\"\n\n\"You won't give anyone a chance,\" said Laurie, with a sidelong glance and a little more color than before in his sunburned face. \"You won't show the soft side of your character, and if a fellow gets a peep at it by accident and can't help showing that he likes it, you treat him as Mrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart, throw cold water over him, and get so thorny no one dares touch or look at you.\"\n\n\"I don't like that sort of thing. I'm too busy to be worried with nonsense, and I think it's dreadful to break up families so. Now don't say any more about it. Meg's wedding has turned all our heads, and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities. I don't wish to get cross, so let's change the subject;\" and Jo looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest provocation.\n\nWhatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the gate, \"Mark my words, Jo, you'll go next.\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1050829", "artist_names": "The Lettermen", "full_title": "How Is Julie? by\u00a0The\u00a0Lettermen", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/fa7c35fa74fd74e0515f46d85e191cb1.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fa7c35fa74fd74e0515f46d85e191cb1.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1050829, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429604854, "path": "/The-lettermen-how-is-julie-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-lettermen-how-is-julie-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/fa7c35fa74fd74e0515f46d85e191cb1.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fa7c35fa74fd74e0515f46d85e191cb1.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "How Is Julie?", "title_with_featured": "How Is Julie?", "updated_by_human_at": 1654565655, "url": "https://genius.com/The-lettermen-how-is-julie-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/353593", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/85f06cac2afe54faf19df884da6703e8.708x708x1.jpg", "id": 353593, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/85f06cac2afe54faf19df884da6703e8.708x708x1.jpg", "index_character": "l", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "The Lettermen", "slug": "The-lettermen", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-lettermen"}, "artist": "The Lettermen", "lyrics": "How Is Julie?

KEEP YOUR OWN\nSUMMARY OF THE REVIEW\nThe Fiends Are Knocking:\n\nActually, it\u2019s one of the best songs on the entire album. I can say I fucks with the hook. The verses are cool. The production isn\u2019t what I exactly expected for the intro. I thought I was listening to Holy Grail when heard them pianos in the beginning\nOne thing that threw me off on this song is apparently someone\u2019s dad got off drugs because of Hopsin\u2019s music and I\u2019m like what the fuck? You mean your nose was filled with booga suga until you heard Hopsin say otherwise? If bankruptcy or death can\u2019t keep people from doing drugs, Hopsin can? C\u2019mon son\nHop Is Back:\n\nHonestly, I skipped it only because I\u2019ve heard the track before, but I do that to any album. The biggest talk about this song was the Yeezus and Kendrick \u201cdisses\u201d. Well, I felt the same way about Yeezus and the Kendrick joke was funny to me, but I don\u2019t think they should\u2019ve been mentioned on the first official single to the album. I think this is what the Ill Mind 6 should\u2019ve been\u2026but hey, it\u2019s Hopsin\nWho\u2019s There (feat. Dizzy Wright & Jarren Benton):\nWhy the fuck is Dizzy Wright on this song? If it didn\u2019t feel like Hop put him on here just for the sake of having all of the FV members on the album. He doesn\u2019t fit this shit at all. This should\u2019ve been the first song on the album, it should\u2019ve been the first single to the album, and it shouldn\u2019t have had any features on it\n\nI wish Hop composed this beat differently. If he started the song off with the production instead the hook it would\u2019ve been better. I also think that the silence after each hit in the hook is unnecessary. And finally, the Illuminati line Hop? Furreal? I could\u2019ve sworn that Hip-Hop was over this \u201cIlluminati is evil\u201d phase. I makes me think you don\u2019t do actual research on the shit you\u2019re talking about\nTears to Snow\nAll of the feels, Hop. This is one of the songs where I would like to actually have a one on one talk with Hopsin and try to insert a feeling of apathy into his personality. This is what makes the song\u2019s sentiments so good. It makes me something for Hopsin. I want to help this nigga\n\nThe hook tho\u2026Hopsin, I know there are some fans that love you enough to sing this hook for you. Where\u2019s that girl from I Am Raw?\nRip Your Heart Out (feat. Tech N9ne)\n\nThis is the second best song on the entire album. I honestly don\u2019t understand the problem when people talk about the Ash Ketchem line. I thought it was kinda funny the first time I heard it. I\u2019m glad to hear Hop on a song like this because I can say that I can\u2019t hear Eminem on this type of song\nIt has this head basher type feel to it. And that Tech feature?\nNollie Tre Flippin:\nYou might also likeHere it is, the greatest song on Knock Madness. Hopsin, do you see how your best song doesn\u2019t have you singing on the hook? It\u2019s a rapped hook bro. It\u2019s also the only song that gives me a west coast feel to it. I could only imagine how nice this song is to the skaters\nGimme That Money:\n\nI have no problem with Hopsin being corny. I\u2019m corny too. Plus, I\u2019ve been in some similar situations so I get where he\u2019s coming from. I just feel as tho the execution is too much of a cluster. There\u2019s a little too much going on and the up-tempo beat doesn\u2019t exactly help either. If Hopsin slowed it down it would\u2019ve been a much catchier song\n\nI Need Help:\n\nOverall what I get from this is that Hop\u2019s mind is convoluted as fuck. The song is filled with too many contradictions\u2026He thinks nobody feels his rhymes, but then everyone feels he\u2019s cool when he\u2019s doing it. What? He thinks Dizzy Wright is stealing his shine\u2026Nigga that\u2019s your fault! He\u2019s spazzing out on this track telling us that there will be one more album after this and after that he\u2019s done. I felt the hook was too forced. I feel like this is filler\n\nHip-Hop Sinister:\n\nThe whole song would\u2019ve been better if Hopsin wasn\u2019t yelling. One of the many problems with Hopsin: He can spit, but there\u2019s no substance. He\u2019s already said that he would feel bad if he makes a song that has no point. This song feels like a slow Blood Energy Potion. The bars are forced as fuck. The multis are just trying too hard. Hopsin, I know you can do better than this man\u2026that George Zimmerman line was too damn long bro. This is the song that Jarren Benton should've been on. He could\u2019ve replaced that whole 3rd verse\n\nHopsin, you have no room to talk about simple rhymes. Your rhymes have been and still are pretty simple. You\u2019re too blunt with your shit, there\u2019s often no type of wit to them\nGood Guys Get Left Behind:\nHopsin\u2026you\u2019re 28 and still that na\u00efve? Cmon son. Your message is extremely misconstrued. Is even good to be a \u201cgood guy\u201d? Should we all just be a \u201cbad guy\u201d?\n\nThe production is ok. I don\u2019t really like the track. Hopsin has too many \u201cI can\u2019t stand these bitches; they don\u2019t do me right tracks\u201d. It\u2019s something that I don\u2019t really need to listen to because I\u2019m not going through the same thing\nBad Manners Freestyle:\n\nThis is filler to me too. All of the times I\u2019ve tried to defend Hopsin by saying that \u201che\u2019s not copying Eminem, he\u2019s just highly influenced\u201d all of that went out the window when he came with the Nun line\nHowever, I wish that this is the production that he used for the previous track. This song suffers the same shit that Hip Hop Sinister does. All bars, no substance. It would all be ok too, the production is mediocre. I\u2019ve heard a bunch of rap songs with no meaning, but the production made up for the lack of subject matter\n\nOld Friend:\nThere is a problem with Hopsin\u2019s writing. He puts details in the wrong areas and takes away details from vital areas. Why his friend hung out with the guys that got him into meth, who his friend is as a person, or why did his friend take the drugs; none of it is talked about in the entire song. The song is called Old Friend but we\u2019re focused on Hopsin\u2019s feelings for 99% of the record. Why did Hopsin\u2019s friend not give a fuck about what his mom said? We don\u2019t know, but the shit we got from this song is that he was there when Hop first started rapping\nStill Got Love For You:\n\nThis song feels really repetitive. It\u2019s the permutation of Good Guys Get Left Behind and Gimme That Money. And just like back on Raw\u2026somebody\u2019s pregnant! Hopsin could\u2019ve left this song off of the album completely. The production feels like a leftover from a low selling gospel album. Hopsin disappoint me with this song. And that hook?\n\nHopsin, you honestly thought Hop Madness was shit, but you put this on your album?\nJungle Bash (feat. SwizZz):\n\nHopsin\u2019s verse is the same ole shit. It\u2019s nothing special in particular. I appreciate the Das EFX. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I\u2019m giggling at this title. When I saw SwizZz on the Tracklist, I was thinking that he was gonna have a pretty satisfying verse, but for this he\u2019s gave kinda of a lack luster verse. To be honest, I can think of a number of Hopsin & SwizZz joints that he could\u2019ve replace this with\n\nLunch Time Cypher (feat. Passionate MC & G-Mo Skee):\nAs soon as this track came on, I stopped. I had to collect myself.  Only one word came to my mind... Just think of when Billy couldn\u2019t stop saying \u201cDESTROY US ALL\u201d or when Spongebob repeats \u201cSOILED IT\u201d. That\u2019s what my mind did. I was hysterical after listening to this. After about 20 minutes of a break, I turned it back on. I KNOW that Hopsin could\u2019ve done better than this\nHopsin, I don\u2019t know what high school you went to, but niggas don\u2019t beat box anymore. They bang on the table or on a hardback book. If you did that, this entire song would\u2019ve at least been listenable\nDream Forever:\n\nI don\u2019t understand why this song is so damn depressing. Hopsin\u2019s more of energetic when he\u2019s mad at someone than when he\u2019s hoping for the love of his dreams. If any song needed someone to sing for Hopsin on this hook, it\u2019s this track\n\nWhat's My Purpose:\nI wish instead of complaining about humans, I wish Hopsin suggested some ways to make humans better. I wish Hopsin didn\u2019t blame America for a racist cop. I wish Hopsin I knew who Hopsin\u2019s idols were. I wish this song was shorter. I wish this song was more motivating than emo. I wish he named this song \u201cEMO\u201d because this is the epitome of what being emo is. I wish this song was more introspective instead of accusing\n\nCaught In The Rain:\nHopsin, why is this song not named \u201cWhat\u2019s my Purpose\u201d?\nI don\u2019t get why Hopsin feels so lonely. Where the fuck is Dame, SwizZz, Dizzy, Jarren, Tech, Jessie, his assistant, or even Bubbles? Not to mention his family and his skater friends? Are record labels, pressuring fans, and women really a bigger part of your life that you can\u2019t talk to any of those people and feel reassured?\n\nI see the growth you\u2019ve had since the previous last track on your album. Pillow Man wanted what you\u2019re talking about, but now you hate it2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1168399", "artist_names": "Patti Page", "full_title": "Most

and folk music to us has always been the hatchet murders in Massachusetts.  And I think that this quaint bit of suburban living, uh, can, can best be explained through the use of our poet laureate, Joe Frazier)\n\nElizabeth Borden took an axe\nAnd gave her mother forty whacks\nAnd when the job was nicely done\nShe gave her father forty-one\n\n[Verse 1]\nYesterday in old Fall River, Mr. Andrew Borden died\nAnd he got his daughter Lizzie on a charge of homicide\nSome folks say she didn't do it, and others say of course she did\nBut they all agree Miss Lizzie B. was a problem kind of kid\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts\nNot even if it's planned as a surprise (A surprise)\nNo, you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts\nYou know how neighbors love to criticize\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe got him on the sofa where he'd gone to take a snooze\nAnd I hope he went to Heaven 'cause he wasn't wearin' shoes\nLizzie kind of rearranged him with a hatchet so they say\nThen she got her mother in that same old-fashioned way\n\n[Chorus]\nBut you can't can't chop your momma up in Massachusetts\nNot even if you're tired of her cuisine (Her cuisine)\nNo, you can't chop your momma up in Massachusetts\nYou know it's almost sure to cause a scene\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, they really kept her hoppin' on that busy afternoon\nWith both down and upstairs choppin' while she hummed a ragtime tune\nThey really made her hustle, and when all was said and done\nShe'd removed her mother's bustle when she wasn't wearin' one\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, you can't chop your momma up in Massachusetts\nAnd then blame all the damage on the mice (On the mice)\nNo, you can't chop your momma up in Massachusetts\nThat kind of thing just isn't very nice\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nNow, it wasn't done for pleasure, and it wasn't done for spite\nAnd it wasn't done because the lady wasn't very bright\nShe'd always done the slightest thing that mom and pop had bid\nThey said, \"Lizzie, cut it out!\" so that's exactly what she did\n\n[Chorus]\nBut you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts\nAnd then get dressed and go out for a walk (For a walk)\nNo, you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts\nMassachusetts is a far cry from New York\n\n[Outro]\nNo, you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts\n(Shut the door and lock and latch it\nHere comes Lizzie with a brand new hatchet)\nYou can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts\n(Such a snob I heard it said\nShe met her pa and cut him dead)\nYou can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts\n(Jump like a fish, jump like a porpoise\nAll join hands in habeas corpus)\nNo, you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts\nMassachusetts is a far cry from New YorkEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1992541", "artist_names": "Floyd Cramer", "full_title": "Chattanooga choo

"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Roger-williams"}, "artist": "Roger Williams", "lyrics": "Chapter 3: Caroline and Anne-Marie LyricsPrime Intellect had been stonewalling anyone who asked about Lawrence's whereabouts for a long, long time. Although it could be remarkably obstinate, though, it could sometimes be tricked because it just didn't think the same way humans did. That was how Caroline found out it had been over a hundred years since anyone had seen Lawrence.\n\nThrough centuries of flirting with the limits of what Prime Intellect would permit, Caroline had developed a certain instinct about its reactions. And she sensed, if not blood, then the telltale odor of frying microchips. She pressed it into a corner she couldn't see, but which she knew must be there:\n\n>Who was that person?\n*That information is private.\n>How did they get to see Lawrence?\n*That information is private.\n\nShe cracked her knuckles and stared at the screen. It had been a long time since she had wanted anything quite as bad as she wanted to rip Lawrence's nuts off; since that was pretty pointless in Cyberspace, though, she was willing to settle for a verbal confrontation. If she could just find the son of a bitch. Hell, she'd met him at that fucking ten-year anniversary party.\n>How can a person just fucking disappear in Cyberspace?\n*All that is necessary is to request the maximum level of Task Challenge Quarantine.\n\nCaroline blinked. Prime Intellect's urge to be helpful would be its ruination every time.\n\n>What is involved in setting up a Task Challenge Quarantine?\n*You must define an environment and a task which any callers must complete within that environment before their requests for a meeting will be passed on to you. You could then make as much of your business as practical private, so that I would not relate it to inquirers. You would then be completely isolated from the rest of humanity.\n>Could I even make it a private matter that there was a Task Challenge?\n*Yes.\n>How would anyone ever figure out how to get in touch with me at all?\n*They would have to guess.\n\nA grin slowly spread across Caroline's face. Got you now, she thought. Then she typed, with deliberate care:\n\n>I would like to accept Dr. Lawrence's Task Challenge.\n\nTo her mild surprise, the environment didn't change around her. Instead, another sentence appeared.\n\n*You must agree to the following Contract terms: You will have no contact with me until you leave Dr. Lawrence's environment through death or his directive to me.\n>That's a Death contract.\n*It was originated for Death sports, but has other applications.\n>What's the time limit?\n*There is no time limit. Dr. Lawrence requires an indefinite Contract.\n\nAnd at that Caroline's blood went cold, because Prime Intellect wasn't supposed to accept indefinite Contracts. And Caroline Frances Hubert herself was the reason for that.\nWhich meant Prime Intellect had either lied to a whole bunch of people, in direct contravention of the Second Law, or it was suffering from a noticeable case of schizophrenia.\n\nHer mind was made up, but her fingers still shook as she typed:\n\n>I agree to the terms.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTwo hundred and ninety-four years after the Change, Caroline celebrated the beginning of her fourth living century by opening her oldest and deepest wound. She was already famous, or as famous as one could hope to be in Cyberspace; her three-fold notoriety was firmly established. Lots of people came to her birthday party. It had lasted three weeks.\n\nLater, with Fred, she prepared a more brutal celebration. Fred was almost healthy looking; he had only days before fleshed himself out for the third time since becoming a zombie. He was only hours out of rigor mortis and could still pass for normal, if a very pale normal, at a casual glance. For awhile he would be able to have nearly normal sex with her if he wished.\n\nHe held her hand as she spoke -- some things were not meant for the keyboard -- and she said, \"Prime Intellect, show me a picture of AnneMarie Davis.\"\n\nIt matched her audio for audio, and Prime Intellect's smooth disembodied voice replied, \"Do you want to see her as she is now, or as you last knew her?\"\n\n\"Both.\"\n\nTwo images coalesced in the air before them. The first ripped through Caroline's brain like a static jolt through the circuits of a computer; she had almost forgotten what it was like to feel real pain.\n\nShe must never forget, she insisted to herself.\n\nShe shook as the memories flooded back. She had been an old woman, frail and helpless, she had never hurt anyone in her life. She had six children, nineteen grandkids, and God knew how many rugrats running around Cyberspace. Her first great-great grandchild had been born shortly before the Change, and in one of her rare lucid moments her granddaughter (Cynthia, was it?) had managed to make her understand, and she had found an instant of happiness in the midst of the pain.\n\nHad that really mattered to her? Had she but known.\n\nShe was an old woman, a simple woman, a woman who would pass unremembered in the texts of history and did not care. A woman who had her family, her long life, her virtue, her community. A woman who, if she had known of such a creature as the Queen of the Death Jockeys, would have been horrified, would have shielded her kids, would have been the first to run her current self out of town. Or, perhaps, had she known enough, to call for her head on a pike.\nCaroline had once been this person, in a time so ancient it had passed into legend. But her memories of that time still existed. The old Caroline would have turned the other cheek, but the new Caroline knew things about God the old one had never suspected. If there was no salvation in life, she could at least seek vengeance.\n\nThe doctors hadn't known why she was in such pain. They didn't dare prescribe any more drugs than she was already getting. Her family didn't understand it. They just thought it was tragic and wished she would go ahead and die so they wouldn't have to be bothered with her, so they could carve up what little was left of her estate, if there would be anything left after all the medical bills were paid.\n\nBut AnneMarie knew. She was the one who traded Caroline's precious opiates, released from their controlled storage in the good cause of making an old lady's last days bearable, for her own supply of free-base cocaine. The new Caroline had tried the drug, to see what it was she had paid for with so much pain. It was called \"crack\" for the sound it made in the makeshift pipes where its users vaporized it, because unlike the hydrochloride form of cocaine it wasn't water soluble. Caroline had sucked gently on the fumes and listened to a hammer roar through her brain, for one brief moment.\n\nFor one brief moment - and then, nothing. Caroline made the pipe disappear and shook her head. The high was fast, hard, very intense - and ephemeral. It was hardly there and it was gone. Caroline could understand if her pain, pain which she measured not by the day or the hour or the minute but by each miserable crawling second, if such suffering had been incurred to provide AnneMarie with a real drug like heroin. An opiate for an opiate, at least. But it had been crack cocaine. Naturally, AnneMarie had needed a lot of trading material to stay high any decent fraction of the time.\n\nOf course, it would never occur to the bitch that she was torturing a harmless, helpless old lady to feel that way. She would be incapable of giving a shit. The fast, furious high was like a lifetime of orgasms in one moment. Fleeting, but sweet.\n\nAnd no one would ever know. Even the harmless old lady herself didn't know she was getting pure saline, until the staff at a strange hospital gave her the real thing, and she knew her first moment of peace in years.\n\nAnd then Prime Intellect came.\n\nAnd the Change.\n\nAnneMarie hadn't been unattractive; she had been in her early forties, and years of working on her feet had kept her from getting fat. But she had a hard look, a look that admitted she might not care about an old woman's pain. A look that said she might have seen too much, that she might deserve a few moments of feeling like God in return for a lifetime of changing diapers and colostomy bags and carefully spoon-feeding legions of ungrateful, incontinent old farts.\n\nAnd if the price of her little reward was to torture one of the old biddies, then she was prepared to pay it. She had a look that said the Devil might find her soul on the deep-discount must-go rack.\n\nCaroline shook her head to clear it of these stray and unwanted thoughts. Fred squeezed her hand reassuringly. Too much thinking along those lines could be bad for her plan.\n\nAnneMarie was wearing her nurse's uniform in the old picture. Palmer could worship Nazis until a swastika grew on his nose, Caroline thought; that uniform will always represent evil to me.\n\nShe looked at the new picture.\n\nIt was so ordinary as to be pathetic; AnneMarie had shaved her apparent age in half, firmed up her breasts, toned her body, and was wearing a slinky cocktail dress. Before the Change she'd have been considered stunningly beautiful, but now stunning beauty was a cheap thing. She probably didn't need cocaine any more; Prime Intellect could turn on the dopamine pump in her brain far more efficiently than any chemical catalyst. People only did drugs for nostalgia in Cyberspace.\n\nThere was one other thing about the \"after\" picture. It was familiar. As Caroline had guessed, AnneMarie had come to her birthday party. AnneMarie's stint as Caroline's nurse added up to a bona fide Brush with Fame. Did she dare go for the brass ring, and introduce herself? Nope. She had chickened out and sent Prime Intellect afterward to deliver her invitation. She was probably afraid that Caroline would fuck up that nice pert perky feeling of permanently coke-headed happiness.\n\n\"Go give her hell,\" Fred said encouragingly. \"Think of what I would do to her.\"\n\nCaroline smiled. \"Please inform AnneMarie that I have decided to accept her invitation.\"\n\nMoments later, she blinked over.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIt was a pathetic imitation of her style, similar to countless others. AnneMarie had ripped off the white-space idea but couldn't bear to leave it featureless. So there was a sofa and some tables, a couple of potted plants, and a few paces off to the side a bed. Like many of Caroline's imitators, AnneMarie had missed the point entirely, which is that since it is all fake there was no reason to maintain a \"home\" with a bunch of familiar stuff in it. Home had been less than a dream for centuries.\n\nNevertheless Caroline smiled and planted herself on the sofa. AnneMarie had a tea service and poured for her, a gesture Caroline would have found touching if she hadn't hated the bitch so much.\n\nThey made cloying small talk about the passing years and Caroline had to bite her lip to keep the sarcastic comments, which usually flowed freely, from surfacing. It had been a long time since she used ordinary pretense, and her skills were rusty. But she knew she mustn't give up the act. Not yet. She kept that firmly in mind as AnneMarie wandered around to the point.\n\n\"I just wanted you to know that I suffered for a long time because of what I did to you,\" she finally said.\n\nIt was all Caroline could do to keep from replying: You hypocritical cunt.\n\n\"I'm really sorry I took your drugs.\" Isn't it about three hundred years too late? \"You really didn't deserve it.\" No shit. \"I hope you can find it in you to forgive me.\" Fat chance.\n\n\"It was a long time ago,\" she said instead.\n\nAnneMarie brightened visibly. \"I'm so glad you feel that way.\" Sure you are. \"You know, there's another reason I wanted to talk.\" Of course there is. \"I was hoping you could help me a little.\" What a surprise. \"I was hoping you could introduce me to Death sports.\"\n\nCaroline worked hard to suppress the predatory grin that spread across her face, and when she couldn't she at least managed to force it into something resembling an expression of delight. Which, in a twisted sense, it was.\n\n\"Well, I'd be delighted. All you have to do is swear out a Contract. Then you can have someone else kill you, or think of an imaginative way for Prime Intellect to do it. When you're just starting out, it's a lot better to get someone else to do the job. Keeps you from repeating a lot of boring old shit.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" AnneMarie said. \"And just how does this Contract work?\"\n\nHoooooo-boy. \"Nothing to it. You just order Prime Intellect to start ignoring you. We have a formal statement that covers all the bases. It's straightforward enough; just keeps you from running away in the middle of things.\"\n\n\"And what happens then?\"\n\n\"Then your host kills you. Or, sometimes, lets you go. That happens sometimes in the Games category, where the winners can survive. But I go for the simple exhibitions.\n\n\"Do those hari-kari guys have Contracts?\" There was a well-known group of Japanese Nationalists who had been killing themselves in the traditional Japanese manner each evening since the Change, in protest of the equalization of the races. Caroline had to admit those guys had class; even after all her Deaths, she doubted if she could disembowel herself in total silence.\n\n\"No, but it's not quite the 'beginner' level to stick a knife in yourself without chickening out. No offense.\"\n\n\"Oh, none taken,\" AnneMarie replied earnestly.\n\n\"I prefer to put up a fight. I think it's more Authentic,\" Caroline said, and she was able to sound very sincere about this since it happened to be the truth.\n\n\"Do you know someone who would be a good...uh...\"\n\n\"The polite word is 'host,' but I prefer 'killer.' If you're that sensitive about words, you need to find a different hobby.\"\n\n\"A good host, then?\" You just don't get it, do you?\n\nCaroline looked down modestly. \"I've been known to off a couple of friends in my time,\" she lied.\n\n\"Oh, really? Do you think you could...you know...?\"\n\nCaroline made a great, exaggerrated shrug. \"It might be kind of interesting, considering our history and all.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd be honored if you would!\"\n\nThat's what you think. \"Well, let's do it then.\"\n\n\"What do I have to do?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Caroline said with great care, \"just call Prime Intellect and repeat what I say...\"\n\nAnneMarie repeated the Contract word-for-word, and answered in the affirmative when Prime Intellect asked if she was sure.\n\n\"What happens now?\"\n\n\"Whatever I want. Try to get Prime Intellect's attention.\"\n\nAnneMarie called half-heartedly, and there was no response. \"It's really not listening?\"\n\n\"Watch.\" Caroline issued a silent command, and AnneMarie's furniture disappeared. As did her clothes. The two women were absolutely alone together in the white space -- the empty white space -- which Caroline called home.\n\nAnneMarie moved to shield her crotch and her breasts with her hands. Caroline actually felt sorry for her for a brief moment, a feeling she crushed as soon as she was conscious of it. If the passing centuries had poorly prepared the bitch to be at another's mercy, then it would only make her vengeance sweeter.\n\n\"Got it yet?\" she asked.\n\n\"You...so you're going to kill me now?\"\n\n\"You seem nervous.\"\n\n\"It's a little startling, that's all.\" AnneMarie giggled slightly, as if that might drive the terror away. Of course, for Caroline and those who savored their Deaths, the terror was part of the attraction. Fear is real, and pain is real. But AnneMarie had asked for Death because it was the in, trendy thing to do, and she was not really prepared for it at all.\n\n\"Well, brace yourself ... for ... this!\" Caroline swept her hand through the air, and came up with a hypodermic needle. AnneMarie, once a nurse by trade, fixed her eyes rigidly on this deceptively simple instrument. She had no way of knowing what the clear fluid was within it. But to her credit, she didn't back away when Caroline pressed it against her arm.\n\nThe sting startled her; it had been a very long time since AnneMarie had felt anything uncomfortable. But Caroline finished the injection, and as AnneMarie's eyes started to roll, she wished the hypo away. Its job was done.\n\n\"It...it...ohhhhhh,\" AnneMarie sighed, and she collapsed against Caroline, who supported her gently. It would take a few minutes for the effect she wanted to manifest itself.\n\nOf course, Prime Intellect could have done what she wanted in an instant, but where was the fun in that?\n\n\"It's junk,\" AnneMarie whispered, and Caroline cradled her with deceptive gentleness.\n\n\"That's exactly what it is, girl,\" she replied.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDeath Jockeys had devised a number of ingenious ways to restrain and torture themselves using Prime Intellect's advanced control over matter, but Caroline would have none of that. She had figured out what she wanted to do to AnneMarie within a few years after the Change, and none of it required Prime Intellect's help at all.\n\nIn the mid-1980's some home drug manufacturers had made a uniquely unpleasant discovery. If they were manufacturing MPPP, a powerful synthetic heroin substitue, and they cooled the preparation too rapidly at a critical step, a slightly different compound called MPTP was formed along with the dope. This compound delivered a horribly sinister side effect: It homed in on a particular group of cells, the unique brown neurons of the substantia nigra, and killed them. Nobody knew exactly how or why this happened in 1985, though Prime Intellect said it was because the drug was converted into an enzyme which triggered the cells to release too much dopamine at once, leaving them with an insufficient supply to power their unique metabolism. In any case the damage could not be repaired, although a useful treatment was discovered a few years before the Change.\n\nWhen a decision is made by the neurons of the cerebral cortex to move a group of muscles, it is the substantia nigra which relays this command to more primitive parts of the brain. This is its only function. The result of destroying it was an instant and complete form of Parkinson's Disease, or Paralysis Agitans, a total and permanent paralysis of the voluntary muscles. Nothing else was affected; the victim could still see, hear, feel, understand. The body maintained itself. Breathing, heartbeat, digestion, and a thousand other important functions were unaffected. They just couldn't perform voluntary movements. They couldn't run, walk, sit up, smile, talk, or even blink, except as a reflex action.\n\nAt the time Caroline heard of it she had summoned glassware and created the drug by honest chemical synthesis. She had spent half the hypodermic on herself, and found the effect to be appropriately terrifying and complete. And after Prime Intellect had done its duty and restored her to health, she sent the other half of the hypo into storage to wait -- for three hundred years as it turned out -- until she was ready to use it.\n\nNow the contents of that hypo were where they belonged, in AnneMarie's body, and as she held her nurse's naked body against her own and felt the AnneMarie's muscles slowly locking, she began to feel excited. Well, if Death could give her sexual feelings, why not vengeance? Fred would find it amusing. He would say Caroline was coming along nicely, in fact.\n\nAs AnneMarie's body froze, her eyes widened. Caroline could easily read the message those eyes desperately telegraphed -- I can't move. Help me. Caroline patted AnneMarie's cheek and nodded. \"That's right,\" she said, and smiled.\n\nShe spoke a word, and a squat cylinder popped into existence behind her. AnneMarie's eyes showed puzzlement, then horror as Caroline demonstrated the torch, which was Authentic down to the brand name emblazoned on its propane tank. Caroline lit it and adjusted it so that it made a bright blue flame which hissed evilly, then she aimed it ever so gently at AnneMarie's big toe.\n\nFor the only time in her long, long life, Caroline used Prime Intellect to tune in on another person's emotions. She felt the chemicals coursing in her bloodstream that were flowing in AnneMarie's; tasted her panic, shook with her terror, felt the faint echo of her agony. In fairness, Caroline made the sharing complete, so that AnneMarie could know of her satisfaction, her arousal, her delight.\n\nIt took a very, very long time to kill AnneMarie.\n\nCaroline, who was usually on the receiving end, had become an expert at making it last.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThat wasn't the end of it, though. If it had been, Prime Intellect would have had no reason to clamp down on the use of the Contract. AnneMarie had entered into it willingly if stupidly, and few who heard Caroline's story could doubt that she had had it coming.\n\nSince shortly after the Change, there had been stories, stories Prime Intellect did not talk about and that spawned weird rumors. People had withdrawn into themselves, then stopped communicating with anybody else. At first, most of them were addicts of one sort or another, though a lot of other people had used the Change to get rid of their addictions. Prime Intellect insisted that nobody had died after the Change, and that if anybody was incommunicado with the rest of humanity it was out of choice.\n\nWhich was true, sort of.\n\nAfter Caroline finally finished with AnneMarie, she forgot all about her nurse and lost herself in a drawn-out fantasy with Fred. When the two of them finished playing and celebrating, they found time to wonder about her.\n\n\"Probably isn't in the mood to party any more,\" Fred observed. Fred was still picking scraps of Caroline's flesh from his teeth.\n\nCaroline laughed. \"I wonder how the bitch is taking it.\"\n\nSo they called. In its weird way of revealing more than it really intended, Prime Intellect let them know that AnneMarie was not only not accepting their calls, she was not communicating with anybody.\n\n\"I'd expect Ms. Party Girl to go hunting for a shoulder to cry on,\" Caroline pouted. \"Licking her wounds alone seems out of character.\"\n\n\"She has forgotten entirely about your encounter,\" Prime Intellect said helpfully. Caroline and Fred looked at one another, puzzled and amused.\n\n\"I find that rather difficult to believe,\" Caroline said.\n\n\"She has found another pursuit.\"\n\n\"Please describe it.\"\n\n\"It is a private matter.\"\n\nA private matter to whom? Prime Intellect wasn't exactly saying that AnneMarie had made it private; it was saying that the matter itself was private. That kind of distinction could be important when dealing with the big P.I..\n\nCaroline and Fred exchanged glances again. Then a thin smile played across Caroline's face. \"Prime Intellect, you know that the things I did with AnneMarie are based on my own experiences. I've been killed as violently and painfully myself, many times.\"\n\n\"Acknowledged.\" Acknowledged? What happened to Prime Intellect's legendary command of human idioms? Suddenly it sounded very much like a computer.\n\n\"It's very difficult to live with this knowledge,\" Caroline smoothely lied. \"The memories are terrible.\"\n\n\"Understood. However, your experiences were all voluntary.\"\n\n\"But I feel compelled to keep doing it over. It's not voluntary at all. It's like some force inside of me I can't control. Can you look in my mind and at least tell me why I do these things to myself?\"\n\n\"I am forbidden to probe such things.\"\n\n\"You said it was possible to forget.\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"Then tell me how.\"\n\n\"I have to warn you that the method used can cause permanent changes in your behavior, things which I cannot reverse. I'd rather not tell you what you are asking.\"\n\nCaroline's blood pounded in her ears. Her excitement was a living thing.\n\nIt was a machine. No emotions, of course. \"Prime Intellect, I order you to tell me how I can forget my terrible experiences as AnneMarie has forgotten hers.\"\n\nBacked into a corner, Prime Intellect had no choice but to tell her. And soon, Caroline was grinning in a way that made Fred very proud.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1133037", "artist_names": "Vic Dana", "full_title": "Little

CAMBREMER \u2014 THE PLEASURES OF M. NISSIM BERNARD \u2014 OUTLINE OF THE STRANGE CHARACTER OF MOREL \u2014 M. DE CHARLUS DINES WITH THE VERDURINS\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my fear lest the pleasure I found in this solitary excursion might weaken my memory of my grandmother, I sought to revive this by thinking of some great mental suffering that she had undergone; in response to my appeal that suffering tried to build itself in my heart, threw up vast pillars there; but my heart was doubtless too small for it, I had not the strength to bear so great a grief, my attention was distracted at the moment when it was approaching completion, and its arches collapsed before joining as, before they have perfected their curve, the waves of the sea totter and break\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, if only from my dreams when I was asleep, I might have learned that my grief for my grandmother\u2019s death was diminishing, for she appeared in them less crushed by the idea that I had formed of her non-existence. I saw her an invalid still, but on the road to recovery, I found her in better health. And if she made any allusion to what she had suffered, I stopped her mouth with my kisses and assured her that she was now permanently cured. I should have liked to call the sceptics to witness that death is indeed a malady from which one recovers. Only, I no longer found in my grandmother the rich spontaneity of old times. Her words were no more than a feeble, docile response, almost a mere echo of mine; she was nothing more than the reflexion of my own thoughts\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incapable as I still was of feeling any fresh physical desire, Albertine was beginning nevertheless to inspire in me a desire for happiness. Certain dreams of shared affection, always floating on the surface of our minds, ally themselves readily by a sort of affinity with the memory (provided that this has already become slightly vague) of a woman with whom we have taken our pleasure. This sentiment recalled to me aspects of Albertine\u2019s face, more gentle, less gay, quite different from those that would have been evoked by physical desire; and as it was also less pressing than that desire I would gladly have postponed its realisation until the following winter, without seeking to see Albertine again at Balbec, before her departure. But even in the midst of a grief that is still keen physical desire will revive. From my bed, where I was made to spend hours every day resting, I longed for Albertine to come and resume our former amusements. Do we not see, in the very room in which they have lost a child, its parents soon come together again to give the little angel a baby brother? I tried to distract my mind from this desire by going to the window to look at that day\u2019s sea. As in the former year, the seas, from one day to another, were rarely the same. Nor, however, did they at all resemble those of that first year, whether because we were now in spring with its storms, or because even if I had come down at the same time as before, the different, more changeable weather might have discouraged from visiting this coast certain seas, indolent, vaporous and fragile, which I had seen throughout long, scorching days, asleep upon the beach, their bluish bosoms, only, faintly stirring, with a soft palpitation, or, as was most probable, because my eyes, taught by Elstir to retain precisely those elements that before I had deliberately rejected, would now gaze for hours at what in the former year they had been incapable of seeing. The contrast that used then to strike me so forcibly between the country drives that I took with Mme. de Villeparisis and this proximity, fluid, inaccessible, mythological, of the eternal Ocean, no longer existed for me. And there were days now when, on the contrary, the sea itself seemed almost rural. On the days, few and far between, of really fine weather, the heat had traced upon the waters, as it might be across country, a dusty white track, at the end of which the pointed mast of a fishing-boat stood up like a village steeple. A tug, of which one could see only the funnel, was smoking in the distance like a factory amid the fields, while alone against the horizon a convex patch of white, sketched there doubtless by a sail but apparently a solid plastered surface, made one think of the sunlit wall of some isolated building, an hospital or a school. And the clouds and the wind, on days when these were added to the sun, completed if not the error of judgment, at any rate the illusion of the first glance, the suggestion that it aroused in the imagination. For the alternation of sharply defined patches of colour like those produced in the country by the proximity of different crops, the rough, yellow, almost muddy irregularities of the marine surface, the banks, the slopes that hid from sight a vessel upon which a crew of nimble sailors seemed to be reaping a harvest, all this upon stormy days made the ocean a thing as varied, as solid, as broken, as populous, as civilised as the earth with its carriage roads over which I used to travel, and was soon to be travelling again. And once, unable any longer to hold out against my desire, instead of going back to bed I put on my clothes and started off to Incarville, to find Albertine. I would ask her to come with me to Douville, where I would pay calls at F\u00e9terne upon Mme. de Cambremer and at la Raspeli\u00e8re upon Mme. Verdurin. Albertine would wait for me meanwhile upon the beach and we would return together after dark. I went to take the train on the local light railway, of which I had picked up, the time before, from Albertine and her friends all the nicknames current in the district, where it was known as theTwister because of its numberless windings, the Crawler because the train never seemed to move, the Transatlantic because of a horrible siren which it sounded to clear people off the line, the Decauville and the Funi, albeit there was nothing funicular about it but because it climbed the cliff, and, although not, strictly speaking, a Decauville, had a 60 centimetre gauge, the B. A. G. because it ran between Balbec and Grattevast via Angerville, the Tram and the T. S. N. because it was a branch of the Tramways of Southern Normandy. I took my seat in a compartment in which I was alone; it was a day of glorious sunshine, and stiflingly hot; I drew down the blue blind which shut off all but a single ray of sunlight. But immediately I beheld my grandmother, as she had appeared sitting in the train, on our leaving Paris for Balbec, when, in her sorrow at seeing me drink beer, she had preferred not to look, to shut her eyes and pretend to be asleep. I, who in my childhood had been unable to endure her anguish when my grandfather tasted brandy, I had inflicted this anguish upon her, not merely of seeing me accept, at the invitation of another, a drink which she regarded as bad for me, I had forced her to leave me free to swill it down to my heart\u2019s content, worse still, by my bursts of passion, my choking fits, I had forced her to help, to advise me to do so, with a supreme resignation of which I saw now in my memory the mute, despairing image, her eyes closed to shut out the sight. So vivid a memory had, like the stroke of a magic wand, restored the mood that I had been gradually outgrowing for some time past; what had I to do with Rosemond\u00e9 when my lips were wholly possessed by the desperate longing to kiss a dead woman, what had I to say to the Cambremers and Verdurins when my heart was beating so violently because at every moment there was being renewed in it the pain that my grandmother had suffered. I could not remain in the compartment. As soon as the train stopped at Maineville-la-Teinturiere, abandoning all my plans, I alighted. Maineville had of late acquired considerable importance and a reputation all its own, because a director of various casinos, a caterer in pleasure, had set up, just outside it, with a luxurious display of bad taste that could vie with that of any smart hotel, an establishment to which we shall return anon, and which was, to put it briefly, the first brothel for \u2018exclusive\u2019 people that it had occurred to anyone to build upon the coast of France. It was the only one. True, every port has its own, but intended for sailors only, and for lovers of the picturesque whom it amuses to see, next door to the primeval parish church, the bawd, hardly less ancient, venerable and moss-grown, standing outside her ill-famed door, waiting for the return of the fishing fleet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hurrying past the glittering house of \u2018pleasure,\u2019 insolently erected there despite the protests which the heads of families had addressed in vain to the mayor, I reached the cliff and followed its winding paths in the direction of Balbec. I heard, without responding to it, the appeal of the hawthorns. Neighbours, in humbler circumstances, of the blossoming apple trees, they found them very coarse, without denying the fresh complexion of the rosy-petalled daughters of those wealthy brewers of cider. They knew that, with a lesser dowry, they were more sought after, and were attractive enough by themselves in their tattered whiteness\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On my return, the hotel porter handed me a black-bordered letter in which the Marquis and the Marquise de Gonneville, the Vicomte and the Vicomtesse d\u2019Amfreville, the Comte and the Comtesse de Berneville, the Marquis and the Marquise de Graincourt, the Comte d\u2019Amenoncourt, the Comtesse de Maineville, the Comte and the Comtesse de Franquetot, the Comtesse de Chaverny n\u00e9e d\u2019Aigleville, begged to announce, and from which I understood at length why it had been sent to me when I caught sight of the names of the Marquise de Cambremer n\u00e9e du Mesnil la Guichard, the Marquis and the Marquise de Cambremer, and saw that the deceased, a cousin of the Cambremers, was named El\u00e9onore-Euphrasie-Humbertine de Cambremer, Comtesse de Criquetot. In the whole extent of this provincial family, the enumeration of which filled the closely printed lines, not a single commoner, and on the other hand not a single title that one knew, but the entire muster-roll of the nobles of the region who made their names \u2014 those of all the interesting spots in the neighbourhood \u2014 ring out their joyous endings in ville, in court, sometimes on a duller note (in tot). Garbed in the roof-tiles of their castle or in the roughcast of their parish church, their nodding heads barely reaching above the vault of the nave or banqueting hall, and then only to cap themselves with the Norman lantern or the dovecot of the pepperpot turret, they gave the impression of having sounded the rallying call to all the charming villages straggling or scattered over a radius of fifty leagues, and to have paraded them in massed formation, without one absentee, one intruder, on the compact, rectangular draught-board of the aristocratic letter edged with black\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother had gone upstairs to her room, meditating the phrase of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u201cI see nothing of the people who seek to distract me from you; the truth of the matter is that they are seeking to prevent me from thinking of you, and that annoys me.\u201d\u2014 because the chief magistrate had told her that she ought to find some distraction. To me he whispered: \u201cThat\u2019s the Princesse de Parme!\u201d My fears were dispelled when I saw that the woman whom the magistrate pointed out to me bore not the slightest resemblance to Her Royal Highness. But as she had engaged a room in which to spend the night after paying a visit to Mme. de Luxembourg, the report of her coming had the effect upon many people of making them take each newcomer for the Princesse de Parme \u2014 and upon me of making me go and shut myself up in my attic\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had no wish to remain there by myself. It was barely four o\u2019clock. I asked Fran\u00e7oise to go and find Albertine, so that she might spend the rest of the afternoon with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would be untrue, I think, to say that there were already symptoms of that painful and perpetual mistrust which Albertine was to inspire in me, not to mention the special character, emphatically Gomorrhan, which that mistrust was to assume. Certainly, even that afternoon \u2014 but this was not the first time \u2014 I grew anxious as I was kept waiting. Fran\u00e7oise, once she had started, stayed away so long that I began to despair. I had not lighted the lamp. The daylight had almost gone. The wind was making the flag over the casino flap. And, fainter still in the silence of the beach over which the tide was rising, and like a voice rendering and enhancing the troubling emptiness of this restless, unnatural hour, a little barrel organ that had stopped outside the hotel was playing Viennese waltzes. At length Fran\u00e7oise arrived, but unaccompanied. \u201cI have been as quick as I could but she wouldn\u2019t come because she didn\u2019t think she was looking smart enough. If she was five minutes painting herself and powdering herself, she was an hour by the clock. You\u2019ll be having a regular scentshop in here. She\u2019s coming, she stayed behind to tidy herself at the glass. I thought I should find her here.\u201d There was still a long time to wait before Albertine appeared. But the gaiety, the charm that she shewed on this occasion dispelled my sorrow. She informed me (in contradiction of what she had said the other day) that she would be staying for the whole season and asked me whether we could not arrange, as in the former year, to meet daily. I told her that at the moment I was too melancholy and that I would rather send for her from time to time at the last moment, as I did in Paris. \u201cIf ever you\u2019re feeling worried, or feel that you want me, do not hesitate,\u201d she told me, \u201cto send for me, I shall come immediately, and if you are not afraid of its creating a scandal in the hotel, I shall stay as long as you like.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise, in bringing her to me, had assumed the joyous air she wore whenever she had gone out of her way to please me and had been successful. But Albertine herself contributed nothing to her joy, and the very next day Fran\u00e7oise was to greet me with the profound observation: \u201cMonsieur ought not to see that young lady. I know quite well the sort she is, she\u2019ll land you in trouble.\u201d As I escorted Albertine to the door I saw in the lighted dining-room the Princesse de Parme. I merely gave her a glance, taking care not to be seen. But I must say that I found a certain grandeur in the royal politeness which had made me smile at the Guermantes\u2019. It is a fundamental rule that sovereign princes are at home wherever they are, and this rule is conventionally expressed in obsolete and useless customs such as that which requires the host to carry his hat in his hand, in his own house, to shew that he is not in his own home but in the Prince\u2019s. Now the Princesse de Parme may not have formulated this idea to herself, but she was so imbued with it that all her actions, spontaneously invented to suit the circumstances, pointed to it. When she rose from table she handed a lavish tip to Aim\u00e9, as though he had been there solely for her and she were rewarding, before leaving a country house, a footman who had been detailed to wait upon her. Nor did she stop at the tip, but with a gracious smile bestowed on him a few friendly, flattering words, with a store of which her mother had provided her. Another moment, and she would have told him that, just as the hotel was perfectly managed, so Normandy was a garden of roses and that she preferred France to any other country in the world. Another coin slipped from the Princess\u2019s fingers, for the wine waiter, for whom she had sent and to whom she made a point of expressing her satisfaction like a general after an inspection. The lift-boy had come up at that moment with a message for her; he too received a little speech, a smile and a tip, all this interspersed with encouraging and humble words intended to prove to them that she was only one of themselves. As Aim\u00e9, the wine waiter, the lift-boy and the rest felt that it would be impolite not to grin from ear to ear at a person who smiled at them, she was presently surrounded by a cluster of servants with whom she chatted kindly; such ways being unfamiliar in smart hotels, the people who passed by, not knowing who she was, thought they beheld a permanent resident at Balbec, who, because of her humble origin, or for professional reasons (she was perhaps the wife of an agent for champagne) was less different from the domestics than the really smart visitors. As for me, I thought of the palace at Parma, of the counsels, partly religious, partly political, given to this Princess, who behaved towards the lower orders as though she had been obliged to conciliate them in order to reign over them one day. All the more, as if she were already reigning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went upstairs again to my room, but I was not alone there. I could hear some one softly playing Schumann. No doubt it happens at times that people, even those whom we love best, become saturated with the melancholy or irritation that emanates from us. There is nevertheless an inanimate object which is capable of a power of exasperation to which no human being will ever attain: to wit, a piano\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine had made me take a note of the dates on which she would be going away for a few days to visit various girl friends, and had made me write down their addresses as well, in case I should want her on one of those evenings, for none of them lived very far away. This meant that when I tried to find her, going from one girl to another, she became more and more entwined in ropes of flowers. I must confess that many of her friends \u2014 I was not yet in love with her \u2014 gave me, at one watering-place or another, moments of pleasure. These obliging young comrades did not seem to me to be very many. But recently I have thought it over, their names have recurred to me. I counted that, in that one season, a dozen conferred on me their ephemeral favours. A name came back to me later, which made thirteen. I then, with almost a child\u2019s delight in cruelty, dwelt upon that number. Alas, I realised that I had forgotten the first of them all, Albertine who no longer existed and who made the fourteenth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had, to resume the thread of my narrative, written down the names and addresses of the girls with whom I should find her upon the days when she was not to be at Incarville, but privately had decided that I would devote those days rather to calling upon Mme. Verdurin. In any case, our desire for different women varies in intensity. One evening we cannot bear to let one out of our sight who, after that, for the next month or two, will never enter our mind. Then there is the law of change, for a study of which this is not the place, under which, after an over-exertion of the flesh, the woman whose image haunts our momentary senility is one to whom we would barely give more than a kiss on the brow. As for Albertine, I saw her seldom, and only upon the very infrequent evenings when I felt that I could not live without her. If this desire seized me when she was too far from Balbec for Fran\u00e7oise to be able to go and fetch her, I used to send the lift-boy to Egreville, to La Sogne, to Saint-Frichoux, asking him to finish his work a little earlier than usual. He would come into my room, but would leave the door open for, albeit he was conscientious at his \u2018job\u2019 which was pretty hard, consisting in endless cleanings from five o\u2019clock in the morning, he could never bring himself to make the effort to shut a door, and, if one were to remark to him that it was open, would turn back and, summoning up all his strength, give it a gentle push. With the democratic pride that marked him, a pride to which, in more liberal careers, the members of a profession that is at all numerous never attain, barristers, doctors and men of letters speaking simply of a \u2018brother\u2019 barrister, doctor or man of letters, he, employing, and rightly, a term that is confined to close corporations like the Academy, would say to me in speaking of a page who was in charge of the lift upon alternate days: \u201cI shall get my colleagueto take my place.\u201d This pride did not prevent him from accepting, with a view to increasing what he called his \u2018salary,\u2019 remuneration for his errands, a fact which had made Fran\u00e7oise take a dislike to him: \u201cYes, the first time you see him you would give him the sacrament without confession, but there are days when his tongue is as smooth as a prison door. It\u2019s your money he\u2019s after.\u201d This was the category in which she had so often in-cluded Eulalie, and in which, alas (when I think of all the trouble that was one day to come of it), she already placed Albertine, because she saw me often asking Mamma, on behalf of my impecunious friend, for trinkets and other little presents, which Fran\u00e7oise held to be inexcusable because Mme. Bontemps had only a general servant. A moment later the lift-boy, having removed what I should have called his livery and he called his tunic, appeared wearing a straw hat, carrying a cane, holding himself stiffly erect, for his mother had warned him never to adopt the \u2018working-class\u2019 or \u2018pageboy\u2019 style. Just as, thanks to books, all knowledge is open to a work-ing man, who ceases to be such when he has finished his work, so, thanks to a \u2018boater\u2019 hat and a pair of gloves, elegance became accessible to the lift-boy who, having ceased for the evening to take the visitors upstairs, imagined himself, like a young surgeon who has taken off his overall, or Serjeant Saint-Loup out of uniform, a typical young man about town. He was not for that matter lacking in ambition, or in talent either in manipu-lating his machine and not bringing you to a standstill between two floors. But his vocabulary was defective. I credited him with ambition because he said in speaking of the porter, under whom he served: \u201cMy porter,\u201d in the same tone in which a man who owned what the page would have called a \u2018private mansion\u2019 in Paris would have referred to his footman. As for the lift-boy\u2019s vocabulary, it is curious that anybody who heard people, fifty times a day, calling for the \u2018lift,\u2019 should never himself call it anything but a \u2018left.\u2019 There were certain things about this boy that were extremely annoying: whatever I might be saying to him he would interrupt with a phrase: \u201cI should say so!\u201d or \u201cI say!\u201d which seemed either to imply that my remark was so obvious that anybody would have thought of it, or else to take all the credit for it to himself, as though it were he that was drawing my attention to the subject. \u201cI should say so!\u201d or \u201cI say!\u201d exclaimed with the utmost emphasis, issued from his lips every other minute, over matters to which he had never given a thought, a trick which irritated me so much that I immediately began to say the opposite to shew him that he knew nothing about it. But to my second assertion, albeit it was incompatible with the first, he replied none the less stoutly: \u201cI should say so!\u201d \u201cI say!\u201d as though these words were inevitable. I found it difficult, also, to forgive him the trick of employing certain terms proper to his calling, which would therefore have sounded perfectly correct in their literal sense, in a figurative sense only, which gave them an air of feeble witticism, for instance the verb to pedal. He never used it when he had gone anywhere on his bicycle. But if, on foot, he had hurried to arrive somewhere in time, then, to indicate that he had walked fast, he would exclaim: \u201cI should say I didn\u2019t half pedal!\u201d The lift-boy was on the small side, clumsily built and by no means good looking. This did not prevent him, whenever one spoke to him of some tall, slim, handsome young man, from saying: \u201cOh, yes, I know, a fellow who is just my height.\u201d And one day when I was expecting him to bring me the answer to a message, hearing somebody come upstairs, I had in my impatience opened the door of my room and caught sight of a page as beautiful as Endymion, with incredibly perfect features, who was bringing a message to a lady whom I did not know. When the lift-boy returned, in telling him how impatiently I had waited for the answer, I mentioned to him that I had thought I heard him come upstairs but that it had turned out to be a page from the H\u00f4tel de Normandie. \u201cOh, yes, I know,\u201d he said, \u201cthey have only the one, a boy about my build. He\u2019s so like me in face, too, that we\u2019re always being mistaken; anybody would think he was my brother.\u201d Lastly, he always wanted to appear to have understood you perfectly from the first second, which meant that as soon as you asked him to do anything he would say: \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, I understand all that,\u201d with a precision and a tone of intelligence which for some time deceived me; but other people, as we get to know them, are like a metal dipped in an acid bath, and we see them gradually lose their good qualities (and their bad qualities too, at times). Before giving him my instructions, I saw that he had left the door open; I pointed this out to him, I was afraid that people might hear us; he acceded to my request and returned, having reduced the gap. \u201cAnything to oblige. But there\u2019s nobody on this floor except us two.\u201d Immediately I heard one, then a second, then a third person go by. This annoyed me partly because of the risk of my being overheard, but more still because I could see that it did not in the least surprise him and was a perfectly normal occurrence. \u201cYes, that\u2019ll be the maid next door going for her things. Oh, that\u2019s of no importance, it\u2019s the bottler putting away his keys. No, no, it\u2019s nothing, you can say what you want, it\u2019s my colleague just going on duty.\u201d Then, as the reasons that all these people had for passing did not diminish my dislike of the thought that they might overhear me, at a formal order from me he went, not to shut the door, which was beyond the strength of this bicyclist who longed for a \u2018motor,\u2019 but to push it a little closer to. \u201cNow we shall be quite quiet.\u201d So quiet were we that an American lady burst in and withdrew with apologies for having mistaken the number of her room. \u201cYou are going to bring this young lady back with you,\u201d I told him, after first going and banging the door with all my might (which brought in another page to see whether a window had been left open). \u201cYou remember the name: Mlle. Albertine Simonet. Anyhow, it\u2019s on the envelope. You need only say to her that it\u2019s from me. She will be delighted to come,\u201d I added, to encourage him and preserve a scrap of my own self-esteem. \u201cI should say so!\u201d \u201cNot at all, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that she will be glad to come. It\u2019s a great nuisance getting here from Berneville.\u201d \u201cI understand!\u201d \u201cYou will tell her to come with you.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, I understand perfectly,\u201d he replied, in that sharp, precise tone which had long ceased to make a \u2018good impression\u2019 upon me because I knew that it was almost mechanical and covered with its apparent clearness plenty of uncertainty and stupidity. \u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d \u201cHaven\u2019t any too much time,\u201d said the lift-boy, who, carrying to extremes the grammatical rule that forbids the repetition of personal pronouns before coordinate verbs, omitted the pronoun altogether. \u201cCan go there all right. Leave was stopped this afternoon, because there was a dinner for twenty at luncheon. And it was my turn off duty to-day. So it\u2019s all right if I go out a bit this evening. Take my bike with me. Get there in no time.\u201d And an hour later he reappeared and said: \u201cMonsieur\u2019s had to wait, but the young lady\u2019s come with me. She\u2019s down below.\u201d \u201cOh, thanks very much; the porter won\u2019t be cross with me?\u201d \u201cMonsieur Paul? Doesn\u2019t even know where I\u2019ve been. The head of the door himself can\u2019t say a word.\u201d But once, after I had told him: \u201cYou absolutely must bring her back with you,\u201d he reported to me with a smile: \u201cYou know, I couldn\u2019t find her. She\u2019s not there. Couldn\u2019t wait any longer; was afraid of getting it like my colleague who was \u2018missed from the hotel\u201d (for the lift-boy, who used the word \u2018rejoin\u2019 of a profession which one joined for the first time, \u201cI should like to rejoin the post-office,\u201d to make up for this, or to mitigate the calamity, were his own career at stake, or to insinuate it more delicately and treacherously were the victim some one else, elided the prefix and said: \u201cI know he\u2019s been \u2018missed\u201d). It was not with any evil intent that he smiled, but from sheer timidity. He thought that he was diminishing the magnitude of his crime by making a joke of it. In the same way, if he had said to me: \u201cYou know, I couldn\u2019t find her,\u201d this did not mean that he really thought that I knew it already. On the contrary, he was all too certain that I did not know it, and, what was more, was afraid to tell me. And so he said \u2018you know\u2019 to ward off the terror which menaced him as he uttered the words that were to bring me the knowledge. We ought never to lose our tempers with people who, when we find fault with them, begin to titter. They do so not because they are laughing at us, but because they are trembling lest we should be angry. Let us shew all pity and tenderness to those who laugh. For all the world like a stroke, the lift-boy\u2019s anxiety had wrought in him not merely an apoplectic flush but an alteration in his speech which had suddenly become familiar. He wound up by telling me that Albertine was not at Egreville, that she would not be coming back there before nine o\u2019clock, and that if betimes (which meant, by chance) she came back earlier, my message would be given her, and in any case she would be with me before one o\u2019clock in the morning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Translator\u2019s note: In the French text of Sodome et Gomorrhe, Volume I ends at this point.]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not this evening, however, that my cruel mistrust began to take solid form. No, to make no mystery about it, although the incident did not occur until some weeks later, it arose out of a remark made by Cottard. Albertine and her friends had insisted that day upon dragging me to the casino at Incarville where, as luck would have it, I should not have joined them (having intended to go and see Mme. Verdurin who had invited me again and again), had I not been held up at Incarville itself by a breakdown of the tram which it would take a considerable time to repair. As I strolled up and down waiting for the men to finish working at it, I found myself all of a sudden face to face with Doctor Cottard, who had come to Incarville to see a patient. I almost hesitated to greet him as he had not answered any of my letters. But friendship does not express itself in the same way in different people. Not having been brought up to observe the same fixed rules of behaviour as well-bred people, Cottard was full of good intentions of which one knew nothing, even denying their existence, until the day when he had an opportunity of displaying them. He apologised, had indeed received my letters, had reported my whereabouts to the Verdurins who were most anxious to see me and whom he urged me to go and see. He even proposed to take me to them there and then, for he was waiting for the little local train to take him back there for dinner. As I hesitated and he had still some time before his train ( for there was bound to be still a considerable delay), I made him come with me to the little casino, one of those that had struck me as being so gloomy on the evening of my first arrival, now filled with the tumult of the girls, who, in the absence of male partners, were dancing together. Andr\u00e9e came sliding along the floor towards me; I was meaning to go off with Cottard in a moment to the Verdurins\u2019, when I definitely declined his offer, seized by an irresistible desire to stay with Albertine. The fact was, I had just heard her laugh. And her laugh at once suggested the rosy flesh, the fragrant portals between which it had just made its way, seeming also, as strong, sensual and revealing as the scent of geraniums, to carry with it some microscopic particles of their substance, irritant and secret\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the girls, a stranger to me, sat down at the piano, and Andr\u00e9e invited Albertine to waltz with her. Happy in the thought that I was going to remain in this little casino with these girls, I remarked to Cottard how well they danced together. But he, taking the professional point of view of a doctor and with an ill-breeding which overlooked the fact that they were my friends, although he must have seen me shaking hands with them, replied: \u201cYes, but parents are very rash to allow their daughters to form such habits. I should certainly never let mine come here. Are they nice-looking, though? I can\u2019t see their faces. There now, look,\u201d he went on, pointing to Albertine and Andr\u00e9e who were waltzing slowly, tightly clasped together, \u201cI have left my glasses behind and I don\u2019t see very well, but they are certainly keenly roused. It is not sufficiently known that women derive most excitement from their breasts. And theirs, as you see, are completely touching.\u201d And indeed the contact had been unbroken between the breasts of Andr\u00e9e and of Albertine. I do not know whether they heard or guessed Cottard\u2019s observation, but they gently broke the contact while continuing to waltz. At that moment Andr\u00e9e said something to Albertine, who laughed, the same deep and penetrating laugh that I had heard before. But all that it wafted to me this time was a feeling of pain; Albertine appeared to be revealing by it, to be making Andr\u00e9e share some exquisite, secret thrill. It rang out like the first or the last strains of a ball to which one has not been invited. I left the place with Cottard, distracted by his conversation, thinking only at odd moments of the scene I had just witnessed. This does not mean that Cottard\u2019s conversation was interesting. It had indeed, at that moment, become bitter, for we had just seen Doctor du Boulbon go past without noticing us. He had come down to spend some time on the other side of Balbec bay, where he was greatly in demand. Now, albeit Cottard was in the habit of declaring that he did no professional work during the holidays, he had hoped to build up a select practice along the coast, a hope which du Boulbon\u2019s presence there doomed to disappointment. Certainly, the Balbec doctor could not stand in Cottard\u2019s way. He was merely a thoroughly conscientious doctor who knew everything, and to whom you could not mention the slightest irritation of the skin without his immediately prescribing, in a complicated formula, the ointment, lotion or liniment that would put you right. As Marie Gineste used to say, in her charming speech, he knew how to \u2018charm\u2019 cuts and sores. But he was in no way eminent. He had indeed caused Cottard some slight annoyance. The latter, now that he was anxious to exchange his Chair for that of Therapeutics, had begun to specialise in toxic actions. These, a perilous innovation in medicine, give an excuse for changing the labels in the chemists\u2019 shops, where every preparation is declared to be in no way toxic, unlike its substitutes, and indeed to be disintoxicant. It is the fashionable cry; at the most there may survive below in illegible lettering, like the faint trace of an older fashion, the assurance that the preparation has been carefully disinfected. Toxic actions serve also to reassure the patient, who learns with joy that his paralysis is merely a toxic disturbance. Now, a Grand Duke who had come for a few days to Balbec and whose eye was extremely swollen had sent for Cottard who, in return for a wad of hundred-franc notes (the Professor refused to see anyone for less), had put down the inflammation to a toxic condition and prescribed a disintoxicant treatment. As the swelling did not go down, the Grand Duke fell back upon the general practitioner of Balbec, who in five minutes had removed a speck of dust. The following day, the swelling had gone. A celebrated specialist in nervous diseases was, however, a more dangerous rival. He was a rubicund, jovial person, since, for one thing, the constant society of nervous wrecks did not prevent him from enjoying excellent health, but also so as to reassure his patients by the hearty merriment of his \u2018Good morning\u2019 and \u2018Good-bye,\u2019 while quite ready to lend the strength of his muscular arms to fastening them in strait-waistcoats later on. Nevertheless, whenever you spoke to him at a party, whether of politics or of literature, he would listen to you with a kindly attention, as though he were saying: \u201cWhat is it all about?\u201d without at once giving an opinion, as though it were a matter for consultation. But anyhow he, whatever his talent might be, was a specialist. And so the whole of Cottard\u2019s rage was heaped upon du Boulbon. But I soon bade good-bye to the Verdurins\u2019 professional friend, and returned to Balbec, after promising him that I would pay them a visit before long\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mischief that his remarks about Albertine and Andr\u00e9e had done me was extreme, but its worst effects were not immediately felt by me, as happens with those forms of poisoning which begin to act only after a certain time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine, on the night after the lift-boy had gone in search of her, did not appear, notwithstanding his assurances. Certainly, personal charm is a less frequent cause of love than a speech such as: \u201cNo, this evening I shall not be free.\u201d We barely notice this speech if we are with friends; we are gay all the evening, a certain image never enters our mind; during those hours it remains dipped in the necessary solution; when we return home we find the plate developed and perfectly clear. We become aware that life is no longer the life which we would have surrendered for a trifle the day before, because, even if we continue not to fear death, we no longer dare think of a parting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From, however, not one o\u2019clock in the morning (the limit fixed by the lift-boy), but three o\u2019clock, I no longer felt as in former times the anguish of seeing the chance of her coming diminish. The certainty that she would not now come brought me a complete, refreshing calm; this night was simply a night like all the rest during which I did not see her, such was the idea from which I started. After which, the thought that I should see her in the morning, or some other day, outlining itself upon the blank which I submissively accepted, became pleasant. Sometimes, during these nights of waiting, our anguish is due to a drug which we have taken. The sufferer, misinterpreting his own symptoms, thinks that he is anxious about the woman who fails to appear. Love is engendered in these cases, as are certain nervous maladies, by the inaccurate explanation of a state of discomfort. An explanation which it is useless to correct, at any rate so far as love is concerned, a sentiment which (whatever its cause) is invariably in error\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next day, when Albertine wrote to me that she had only just got back to Epreville, and so had not received my note in time, and was coming, if she might, to see me that evening, behind the words of her letter, as behind those that she had said to me once over the telephone, I thought I could detect the presence of pleasures, of people whom she had preferred to me. Once again, I was stirred from head to foot by the painful longing to know what she could have been doing, by the latent love which we always carry within us; I almost thought for a moment that it was going to attach me to Albertine, but it confined itself to a stationary throbbing, the last echo of which died away without the machine\u2019s having been set in motion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had failed during my first visit to Balbec \u2014 and perhaps, for that matter, Andr\u00e9e had failed equally \u2014 to understand Albertine\u2019s character. I had put it down as frivolous, but had not known whether our combined supplications might not succeed in keeping her with us and making her forego a garden-party, a donkey ride, a picnic. During my second visit to Balbec, I began to suspect that this frivolity was only for show, the garden-party a mere screen, if not an invention. She shewed herself in various colours in the following incident (by which I mean the incident as seen by me, from my side of the glass which was by no means transparent, and without my having any means of determining what reality there was on the other side). Albertine was making me the most passionate protestations of affection. She looked at the time because she had to go and call upon a lady who was at home, it appeared, every afternoon at five o\u2019clock, at Infreville. Tormented by suspicion, and feeling at the same time far from well, I asked Albertine, I implored her to remain with me. It was impossible (and indeed she could wait only five minutes longer) because it would annoy the lady who was far from hospitable, highly susceptible and, said Albertine, a perfect nuisance. \u201cBut one can easily cut a call.\u201d \u201cNo, my aunt has always told me that the chief thing is politeness.\u201d \u201cBut I have so often seen you being impolite.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing, the lady would be angry with me and would say nasty things about me to my aunt. I\u2019m pretty well in her bad books already. She expects me to go and see her.\u201d \u201cBut if she\u2019s at home every day?\u201d Here Albertine, feeling that she was caught, changed her line of argument. \u201cSo she is at home every day. But to-day I\u2019ve made arrangements to meet some other girls there. It will be less boring that way.\u201d \u201cSo then, Albertine, you prefer this lady and your friends to me, since, rather than miss paying an admittedly boring call, you prefer to leave me here alone, sick and wretched?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care if it is boring. I\u2019m going for their sake. I shall bring them home in my trap. Otherwise they won\u2019t have any way of getting back.\u201d I pointed out to Albertine that there were trains from Infreville up to ten o\u2019clock at night. \u201cQuite true, but don\u2019t you see, it is possible that we may be asked to stay to dinner. She is very hospitable.\u201d \u201cVery well then, you won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI should only make my aunt angry.\u201d \u201cBesides, you can dine with her and catch the ten o\u2019clock train.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s cutting it rather fine.\u201d \u201cThen I can never go and dine in town and come back by train. But listen, Albertine. We are going to do something quite simple, I feel that^the fresh air will do me good; since you can\u2019t give up your lady, I am going to come with you to Infreville. Don\u2019t be alarmed, I shan\u2019t go as far as the Tour Elisabeth\u201d (the lady\u2019s villa), \u201cI shall see neither the lady nor your friends.\u201d Albertine started as though she had received a violent blow. For a moment, she was unable to speak. She explained that the sea bathing was not doing her any good. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to come with you?\u201d \u201cHow can you say such a thing, you know there\u2019s nothing I enjoy more than going out with you.\u201d A sudden change of tactics had occurred. \u201cSince we are going for a drive together,\u201d she said to me, \u201cwhy not go out in the other direction, we might dine together. It would be so nice. After all, that side of Balbec is much the prettier. I\u2019m getting sick of Infreville and all those little spinach-bed places.\u201d \u201cBut your aunt\u2019s friend will be annoyed if you don\u2019t go and see her.\u201d \u201cVery well, let her be.\u201d \u201cNo, it is wrong to annoy people.\u201d \u201cBut she won\u2019t even notice that I\u2019m not there, she has people every day; I can go to-morrow, the next day, next week, the week after, it\u2019s exactly the same.\u201d \u201cAnd what about your friends?\u201d \u201cOh, they\u2019ve cut me often enough. It\u2019s my turn now.\u201d \u201cBut from the side you suggest there\u2019s no train back after nine.\u201d \u201cWell, what\u2019s the matter with that? Nine will do perfectly. Besides, one need never think about getting back. We can always find a cart, a bike, if the worse comes to the worst, we have legs.\u201d \u201cWe can always find, Albertine, how you go on! Out Infreville way, where the villages run into one another, well and good. But the other way, it\u2019s a very different matter.\u201d \u201cThat way too. I promise to bring you back safe and sound.\u201d I felt that Albertine was giving up for my sake some plan arranged beforehand of which she refused to tell me, and that there was some one else who would be as unhappy as I was. Seeing that what she had intended to do was out of the question, since I insisted upon accompanying her, she gave it up altogether. She knew that the loss was not irremediable. For, like all women who have a number of irons in the fire, she had one resource that never failed: suspicion and jealousy. Of course she did not seek to arouse them, quite the contrary. But lovers are so suspicious that they instantly scent out falsehood. With the result that Albertine, being no better than anyone else, knew by experience (without for a moment imagining that she owed her experience to jealousy) that she could always be certain of meeting people again after she had failed to keep an appointment. The stranger whom she was deserting for me would be hurt, would love her all the more for that (though Albertine did not know that this was the reason), and, so as not to prolong the agony, would return to her of his own accord, as I should have done. But I had no desire either to give pain to another, or to tire myself, or to enter upon the terrible course of investigation, of multiform, unending vigilance. \u201cNo, Albertine, I do not wish to spoil your pleasure, go to your lady at Infreville, or rather to the person you really mean to see, it is all the same to me. The real reason why I am not coming with you is that you do not wish it, the outing you would be taking with me is not the one you meant to take, which is proved by your having contradicted yourself at least five times without noticing it.\u201d Poor Albertine was afraid that her contradictions, which she had not noticed, had been more serious than they were. Not knowing exactly what fibs she had told me: \u201cIt is quite on the cards that I did contradict myself. The sea air makes me lose my head altogether. I\u2019m always calling things by the wrong names.\u201d And (what proved to me that she would not, now, require many tender affirmations to make me believe her) I felt a stab in my heart as I listened to this admission of what I had but faintly imagined. \u201cVery well, that\u2019s settled, I\u2019m off,\u201d she said in a tragic tone, not without looking at the time to see whether she was making herself late for the other person, now that I had provided her with an excuse for not spending the evening with myself. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad of you. I alter all my plans to spend a nice, long evening with you, and it\u2019s you that won\u2019t have it, and you accuse me of telling lies. I\u2019ve never known you to be so cruel. The sea shall be my tomb. I will never see you any more.\u201d (My heart leaped at these words, albeit I was certain that she would come again next day, as she did.) \u201cI shall drown myself, I shall throw myself into the water.\u201d \u201cLike Sappho.\u201d \u201cThere you go, insulting me again. You suspect not only what I say but what I do.\u201d \u201cBut, my lamb, I didn\u2019t mean anything, I swear to you, you know Sappho flung herself into the sea.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, you have no faith in me.\u201d She saw that it was twenty minutes to the hour by the clock; she was afraid of missing her appointment, and choosing the shortest form of farewell (for which as it happened she apologised by coming to see me again next day, the other person presumably not being free then), she dashed from the room, crying: \u201cGood-bye for ever,\u201d in a heartbroken tone. And perhaps she was heartbroken. For knowing what she was about at that moment better than I, being at the same time more strict and more indulgent towards herself than I was towards her, she may all the same have had a fear that I might refuse to see her again after the way in which she had left me. And I believe that she was attached to me, so much so that the other person was more jealous than I was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some days later, at Balbec, while we were in the ballroom of the casino, there entered Bloch\u2019s sister and cousin, who had both turned out quite pretty, but whom I refrained from greeting on account of my girl friends, because the younger one, the cousin, was notoriously living with the actress whose acquaintance she had made during my first visit. Andr\u00e9e, at a murmured allusion to this scandal, said to me: \u201cOh! About that sort of thing I\u2019m like Albertine; there\u2019s nothing we both loathe so much as that sort of thing.\u201d As for Albertine, on sitting down to talk to me upon the sofa, she had turned her back on the disreputable pair. I had noticed, however, that, before she changed her position, at the moment when Mlle. Bloch and her cousin appeared, my friend\u2019s eyes had flashed with that sudden, close attention which now and again imparted to the face of this frivolous girl a serious, indeed a grave air, and left her pensive afterwards. But Albertine had at once turned towards myself a gaze which nevertheless remained singularly fixed and meditative. Mlle. Bloch and her cousin having finally left the room after laughing and shouting in a loud and vulgar manner, I asked Albertine whether the little fair one (the one who was so intimate with the actress) was not the girl who had won the prize the day before in the procession of flowers. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Albertine, \u201cis one of them fair? I must confess they don\u2019t interest me particularly, I have never looked at them. Is one of them fair?\u201d she asked her three girl friends with a detached air of inquiry. When applied to people whom Albertine passed every day on the front, this ignorance seemed to me too profound to be genuine. \u201cThey didn\u2019t appear to be looking at us much either,\u201d I said to Albertine, perhaps (on the assumption, which I did not however consciously form, that Albertine loved her own sex), to free her from any regret by pointing out to her that she had not attracted the attention of these girls and that, generally speaking, it is not customary even for the most vicious of women to take an interest in girls whom they do not know. \u201cThey weren\u2019t looking at us!\u201d was Albertine\u2019s astonished reply. \u201cWhy, they did nothing else the whole time.\u201d \u201cBut you can\u2019t possibly tell,\u201d I said to her, \u201cyou had your back to them.\u201d \u201cVery well, and what about that?\u201d she replied, pointing out to me, set in the wall in front of us, a large mirror which I had not noticed and upon which I now realised that my friend, while talking to me, had never ceased to fix her troubled, preoccupied eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ever since the day when Cottard had accompanied me into the little casino at Incarville, albeit I did not share the opinion that he had expressed, Albertine had seemed to me different; the sight of her made me lose my temper. I myself had changed, quite as much as she had changed in my eyes. I had ceased to bear her any good will; to her face, behind her back when there was a chance of my words being repeated to her, I spoke of her in the most insulting language. There were, however, intervals of calmer feeling. One day I learned that Albertine and Andr\u00e9e had both accepted an invitation to Elstir\u2019s. Feeling certain that this was in order that they might, on the return journey, amuse themselves like schoolgirls on holiday by imitating the manners of fast young women, and in so doing find an unmaidenly pleasure the thought of which wrung my heart, without announcing my intention, to embarrass them and to deprive Albertine of the pleasure on which she was reckoning, I paid an unexpected call at his studio. But I found only Andr\u00e9e there. Albertine had chosen another day when her aunt was to go there with her. Then I said to myself that Cottard must have been mistaken; the favourable impression that I received from Andr\u00e9e\u2019s presence there without her friend remained with me and made me feel more kindly disposed towards Albertine. But this feeling lasted no longer than the healthy moments of delicate people subject to passing maladies, who are prostrated again by the merest trifle. Albertine incited Andr\u00e9e to actions which, without going very far, were perhaps not altogether innocent; pained by this suspicion, I managed in the end to repel it. No sooner was I healed of it than it revived under another form. I had just seen Andr\u00e9e, with one of those graceful gestures that came naturally to her, lay her head coaxingly on Albertine\u2019s shoulder, kiss her on the throat, half shutting her eyes; or else they had exchanged a glance; a remark had been made by somebody who had seen them going down together to bathe: little trifles such as habitually float in the surrounding atmosphere where the majority of people absorb them all day long without injury to their health or alteration of their mood, but which have a morbid effect and breed fresh sufferings in a nature predisposed to receive them. Sometimes even without my having seen Albertine again, without anyone\u2019s having spoken to me about her, there would flash from my memory some vision of her with Gis\u00e8le in an attitude which had seemed to me innocent at the time; it was enough now to destroy the peace of mind that I had managed to recover, I had no longer any need to go and breathe dangerous germs outside, I had, as Cottard would have said, supplied my own toxin. I thought then of all that I had been told about Swann\u2019s love for Odette, of the way in which Swann had been tricked all his life. Indeed, when I come to think of it, the hypothesis that made me gradually build up the whole of Albertine\u2019s character and give a painful interpretation to every moment of a life that I could not control in its entirety, was the memory, the rooted idea of Mme. Swann\u2019s character, as it had been described to me. These accounts helped my imagination, in after years, to take the line of supposing that Albertine might, instead of being a good girl, have had the same immorality, the same faculty of deception as a reformed prostitute, and I thought of all the sufferings that would in that case have been in store for me had I ever really been her lover\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day, outside the Grand Hotel, where we were gathered on the front, I had just been addressing Albertine in the harshest, most humiliating language, and Rosemonde was saying: \u201cOh, how you have changed your mind about her; why, she used to be everything, it was she who ruled the roost, and now she isn\u2019t even fit to be thrown to the dogs.\u201d I was beginning, in order to make my attitude towards Albertine still more marked, to say all the nicest things I could think of to Andr\u00e9e, who, if she was tainted with the same vice, seemed to me to have more excuse for it since she was sickly and neurasthenic, when we saw emerging at the steady trot of its pair of horses into the street at right angles to the front, at the corner of which we were standing, Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s barouche. The chief magistrate who, at that moment, was advancing towards us, sprang back upon recognising the carriage, in order not to be seen in our company; then, when he thought that the Marquise\u2019s eye might catch his, bowed to her with an immense sweep of his hat. But the carriage, instead of continuing, as might have been expected, along the Rue de la Mer, disappeared through the gate of the hotel. It was quite ten minutes later when the lift-boy, out of breath, came to announce to me: \u201cIt\u2019s the Marquise de Camembert, she\u2019s come here to see Monsieur. I\u2019ve been up to the room, I looked in the reading-room, I couldn\u2019t find Monsieur anywhere. Luckily I thought of looking on the beach.\u201d He had barely ended this speech when, followed by her daughter-in-law and by an extremely ceremonious gentleman, the Marquise advanced towards me, coming on probably from some afternoon tea-party in the neighbourhood, and bowed down not so much by age as by the mass of costly trinkets with which she felt it more sociable and more befitting her rank to cover herself, in order to appear as \u2018well dressed\u2019 as possible to the people whom she went to visit. It was in fact that \u2018landing\u2019 of the Cambremers at the hotel which my grandmother had so greatly dreaded long ago when she wanted us not to let Legrandin know that we might perhaps be going to Balbec. Then Mamma used to laugh at these fears inspired by an event which she considered impossible. And here it was actually happening, but by different channels and without Legrandin\u2019s having had any part in it. \u201cDo you mind my staying here, if I shan\u2019t be in your way?\u201d asked Albertine (in whose eyes there lingered, brought there by the cruel things I had just been saying to her, a pair of tears which I observed without seeming to see them, but not without rejoicing inwardly at the sight), \u201cthere is something I want to say to you.\u201d A hat with feathers, itself surmounted by a sapphire pin, was perched haphazard upon Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s wig, like a badge the display of which was necessary but sufficient, its place immaterial, its elegance conventional and its stability superfluous. Notwithstanding the heat, the good lady had put on a jet cloak, like a dalmatic, over which hung an ermine stole the wearing of which seemed to depend not upon the temperature and season, but upon the nature of the ceremony. And on Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s bosom a baronial torse, fastened to a chain, dangled like a pectoral cross. The gentleman was an eminent lawyer from Paris, of noble family, who had come down to spend a few days with the Cambremers. He was one of those men whom their vast professional experience inclines to look down upon their profession, and who say, for instance: \u201cI know that I am a good pleader, so it no longer amuses me to plead,\u201d or: \u201cI\u2019m no longer interested in operating, I know that I\u2019m a good operator.\u201d Men of intelligence, artists, they see themselves in their maturity, richly endowed by success, shining with that intellect, that artistic nature which their professional brethren recognise in them and which confer upon them a kind of taste and discernment. They form a passion for the paintings not of a great artist, but of an artist who nevertheless is highly distinguished, and spend upon the purchase of his work the large sums that their career procures for them. Le Sidaner was the artist chosen by the Cambremers\u2019 friend, who incidentally was a delightful person. He talked well about books, but not about the books of the true masters, those who have mastered themselves. The only irritating habit that this amateur displayed was his constant use of certain ready made expressions, such as \u2018for the most part,\u2019 which gave an air of importance and incompleteness to the matter of which he was speaking. Madame de Cambremer had taken the opportunity, she told me, of a party which some friends of hers had been giving that afternoon in the Balbec direction to come and call upon me, as she had promised Robert de Saint-Loup. \u201cYou know he\u2019s coming down to these parts quite soon for a few days: His uncle Charlus is staying near here with his sister-in-law, the Duchesse de Luxembourg, and M. de Saint-Loup means to take the opportunity of paying his aunt a visit and going to see his old regiment, where he is very popular, highly respected. We often have visits from officers who are never tired of singing his praises. How nice it would be if you and he would give us the pleasure of coming together to F\u00e9terne.\u201d I presented Albertine and her friends. Mme. de Cambremer introduced us all to her daughter-in-law. The latter, so frigid towards the petty nobility with whom her seclusion at F\u00e9terne forced her to associate, so reserved, so afraid of compromising herself, held out her hand to me with a radiant smile, safe as she felt herself and delighted at seeing a friend of Robert de Saint-Loup, whom he, possessing a sharper social intuition than he allowed to appear, had mentioned to her as being a great friend of the Guermantes. So, unlike her mother-in-law, Mme. de Cambremer employed two vastly different forms of politeness. It was at the most the former kind, dry, insupportable, that she would have conceded me had I met her through her brother Legrandin. But for a friend of the Guermantes she had not smiles enough. The most convenient room in the hotel for entertaining visitors was the reading-room, that place once so terrible into which I now went a dozen times every day, emerging freely, my own master, like those mildly afflicted lunatics who have so long been inmates of an asylum that the superintendent trusts them with a latchkey. And so I offered to take Mme. de Cambremer there. And as this room no longer filled me with shyness and no longer held any charm for me, since the faces of things change for us like the faces of people, it was without the slightest emotion that I made this suggestion. But she declined it, preferring to remain out of doors, and we sat down in the open air, on the terrace of the hotel. I found there and rescued a volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 which Mamma had not had time to carry off in her precipitate flight, when she heard that visitors had called for me. No less than my grandmother, she dreaded these invasions of strangers, and, in her fear of being too late to escape if she let herself be seen, would fly from the room with a rapidity which always made my father and me laugh at her. Madame de Cambremer carried in her hand, with the handle of a sunshade, a number of embroidered bags, a hold-all, a gold purse from which there dangled strings of garnets, and a lace handkerchief. I could not help thinking that it would be more convenient for her to deposit them on a chair; but I felt that it would be unbecoming and useless to ask her to lay aside the ornaments of her pastoral visitation and her social priesthood. We gazed at the calm sea upon which, here and there, a few gulls floated like white petals. Because of the \u2018mean level\u2019 to which social conversation reduces us and also of our desire to attract not by means of those qualities of which we are ourselves unaware but of those which, we suppose, ought to be appreciated by the people who are with us, I began instinctively to talk to Mme. de Cambremer n\u00e9e Legrandin in the strain in which her brother might have talked. \u201cThey appear,\u201d I said, referring to the gulls, \u201cas motionless and as white as water-lilies.\u201d And indeed they did appear to be offering a lifeless object to the little waves which tossed them about, so much so that the waves, by contrast, seemed in their pursuit of them to be animated by a deliberate intention, to have acquired life. The dowager Marquise could not find words enough to do justice to the superb view of the sea that we had from Balbec, or to say how she envied it, she who from la Raspeli\u00e8re (where for that matter she was not living that year) had only such a distant glimpse of the waves. She had two remarkable habits, due at once to her exalted passion for the arts (especially for the art of music), and to her want of teeth. Whenever she talked of aesthetic subjects her salivary glands \u2014 like those of certain animals when in rut \u2014 became so overcharged that the old lady\u2019s edentulous mouth allowed to escape from the corners of her faintly moustached lips a trickle of moisture for which that was not the proper place. Immediately she drew it in again with a deep sigh, like a person recovering his breath. Secondly, if her subject were some piece of music of surpassing beauty, in her enthusiasm she would raise her arms and utter a few decisive opinions, vigorously chewed and at a pinch issuing from her nose. Now it had never occurred to me that the vulgar beach at Balbec could indeed offer a \u2018seascape,\u2019 and Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s simple words changed my ideas in that respect. On the other hand, as I told her, I had always heard people praise the matchless view from la Raspeli\u00e8re, perched on the summit of the hill, where, in a great drawing-room with two fireplaces, one whole row of windows swept the gardens, and, through the branches of the trees, the sea as far as Balbec and beyond it, and the other row the valley. \u201cHow nice of you to say so, and how well you put it: the sea through the branches. It is exquisite, one would say . . . a painted fan.\u201d And I gathered from a deep breath intended to catch the falling spittle and dry the moustaches, that the compliment was sincere. But the Marquise n\u00e9e Legrandin remained cold, to shew her contempt not for my words but for those of her mother-in-law. Besides, she not only despised the other\u2019s intellect but deplored her affability, being always afraid that people might not form a sufficiently high idea of the Cambremers. \u201cAnd how charming the name is,\u201d said I. \u201cOne would like to know the origin of all those names.\u201d \u201cThat one I can tell you,\u201d the old lady answered modestly. \u201cIt is a family place, it came from my grandmother Arrachepel, not an illustrious family, but a decent and very old country stock.\u201d \u201cWhat! Not illustrious!\u201d her daughter-in-law tartly interrupted her. \u201cA whole window in Bayeux cathedral is filled with their arms, and the principal church at Avranches has their tombs. If these old names interest you,\u201d she added, \u201cyou\u2019ve come a year too late. We managed to appoint to the living of Criquetot, in spite of all the difficulties about changing from one diocese to another, the parish priest of a place where I myself have some land, a long way from here, Combray, where the worthy cleric felt that he was becoming neurasthenic. Unfortunately, the sea air was no good to him at his age; his neurasthenia grew worse and he has returned to Combray. But he amused himself while he was our neighbour in going about looking up all the old charters, and he compiled quite an interesting little pamphlet on the place names of the district. It has given him a fresh interest, too, for it seems he is spending his last years in writing a great work upon Combray and its surroundings. I shall send you his pamphlet on the surroundings of F\u00e9terne. It is worthy of a Benedictine. You will find the most interesting things in it about our old Raspeli\u00e8re, of which my mother-in-law speaks far too modestly.\u201d \u201cIn any case, this year,\u201d replied the dowager Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cla Raspeli\u00e8re is no longer ours and does not belong to me. But I can see that you have a painter\u2019s instincts; I am sure you sketch, and I should so like to shew you F\u00e9terne, which is far finer than la Raspeli\u00e8re.\u201d For as soon as the Cambremers had let this latter residence to the Verdurins, its commanding situation had at once ceased to appear to them as it had appeared for so many years past, that is to say to offer the advantage, without parallel in the neighbourhood, of looking out over both sea and valley, and had on the other hand, suddenly and retrospectively, presented the drawback that one had always to go up or down hill to get to or from it. In short, one might have supposed that if Mme. de Cambremer had let it, it was not so much to add to her income as to spare her horses. And she proclaimed herself delighted at being able at last to have the sea always so close at hand, at F\u00e9terne, she who for so many years (forgetting the two months that she spent there) had seen it only from up above and as though in a panorama. \u201cI am discovering it at my age,\u201d she said, \u201cand how I enjoy it! It does me a world of good. I would let la Raspeli\u00e8re for nothing so as to be obliged to live at F\u00e9terne.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo return to more interesting topics,\u201d went on Legrandin\u2019s sister, who addressed the old Marquise as \u2018Mother,\u2019 but with the passage of years had come to treat her with insolence, \u201cyou mentioned water-lilies: I suppose you know Claude Monet\u2019s pictures of them. What a genius! They interest me particularly because near Combray, that place where I told you I had some land. . . . \u201d But she preferred not to talk too much about Combray. \u201cWhy! That must be the series that Elstir told us about, the greatest painter of this generation,\u201d exclaimed Albertine, who had said nothing so far. \u201cAh! I can see that this young lady loves the arts,\u201d cried Mme. de Cambremer and, drawing a long breath, recaptured a trail of spittle. \u201cYou will allow me to put Le Sidaner before him, Mademoiselle,\u201d said the lawyer, smiling with the air of an expert. And, as he had enjoyed, or seen people enjoy, years ago, certain \u2018daring\u2019 work by Elstir, he added: \u201cElstir was gifted, indeed he was one of the advance guard, but for some reason or other he never kept up, he has wasted his life.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer disagreed with the lawyer, so far as Elstir was concerned, but, greatly to the annoyance of her guest, bracketed Monet with Le Sidaner. It would be untrue to say that she was a fool; she was overflowing with a kind of intelligence that meant nothing to me. As the sun was beginning to set, the seagulls were now yellow, like the water-lilies on another canvas of that series by Monet. I said that I knew it, and (continuing to copy the diction of her brother, whom I had not yet dared to name) added that it was a pity that she had not thought of coming a day earlier, for, at the same hour, there would have been a Poussin light for her to admire. Had some Norman squireen, unknown to the Guermantes, told her that she ought to have come a day earlier, Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin would doubtless have drawn herself up with an offended air. But I might have been far more familiar still, and she would have been all smiles and sweetness; I might in the warmth of that fine afternoon devour my fill of that rich honey cake which Mme. de Cambremer so rarely was and which took the place of the dish of pastry that it had not occurred to me to offer my guests. But the name of Poussin, without altering the amenity of the society lady, called forth the protests of the connoisseur. On hearing that name, she produced six times in almost continuous succession that little smack of the tongue against the lips which serves to convey to a child who is misbehaving at once a reproach for having begun and a warning not to continue. \u201cIn heaven\u2019s name, after a painter like Monet, who is an absolute genius, don\u2019t go and mention an old hack without a vestige of talent, like Poussin. I don\u2019t mind telling you frankly that I find him the deadliest bore. I mean to say, you can\u2019t really call that sort of thing painting. Monet, Degas, Manet, yes, there are painters if you like! It is a curious thing,\u201d she went on, fixing a scrutinous and ecstatic gaze upon a vague point in space where she could see what was in her mind, \u201cit is a curious thing, I used at one time to prefer Manet. Nowadays, I still admire Manet, of course, but I believe I like Monet even more. Oh! The Cathedrals!\u201d She was as scrupulous as she was condescending in informing me of the evolution of her taste. And one felt that the phases through which that taste had evolved were not, in her eyes, any less important than the different manners of Monet himself. Not that I had any reason to feel flattered by her taking me into her confidence as to her preferences, for even in the presence of the narrowest of provincial ladies she could not remain for five minutes without feeling the need to confess them. When a noble dame of Avranches, who would have been incapable of distinguishing between Mozart and Wagner, said in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s hearing: \u201cWe saw nothing of any interest while we were in Paris, we went once to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, they were doing Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, it\u2019s dreadful stuff,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer not only boiled with rage but felt obliged to exclaim: \u201cNot at all, it\u2019s a little gem,\u201d and to \u2018argue the point.\u2019 It was perhaps a Combray habit which she had picked up from my grandmother\u2019s sisters, who called it \u2018fighting in the good cause,\u2019 and loved the dinner-parties at which they knew all through the week that they would have to defend their idols against the Philistines. Similarly, Mme. de Cambremer liked to \u2018fly into a passion\u2019 and wrangle about art, as other people do about politics. She stood up for Debussy as she would have stood up for a woman friend whose conduct had been criticised. She must however have known very well that when she said: \u201cNot at all, it\u2019s a little gem,\u201d she could not improvise in the other lady, whom she was putting in her place, the whole progressive development of artistic culture on the completion of which they would come naturally to an agreement without any need of discussion. \u201cI must ask Le Sidaner what he thinks of Poussin,\u201d the lawyer remarked to me. \u201cHe\u2019s a regular recluse, never opens his mouth, but I know how to get things out of him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnyhow,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer went on, \u201cI have a horror of sunsets, they\u2019re so romantic, so operatic. That is why I can\u2019t abide my mother-in-law\u2019s house, with its tropical plants. You will see it, it\u2019s just like a public garden at Monte-Carlo. That\u2019s why I prefer your coast, here. It is more sombre, more sincere; there\u2019s a little lane from which one doesn\u2019t see the sea. On rainy days, there\u2019s nothing but mud, it\u2019s a little world apart. It\u2019s just the same at Venice, I detest the Grand Canal and I don\u2019t know anything so touching as the little alleys. But it\u2019s all a question of one\u2019s surroundings.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d I remarked to her, feeling that the only way to rehabilitate Poussin in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s eyes was to inform her that he was once more in fashion, \u201cM. Degas assures us that he knows nothing more beautiful than the Poussins at Chantilly.\u201d \u201cIndeed? I don\u2019t know the ones at Chantilly,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer who had no wish to differ from Degas, \u201cbut I can speak about the ones in the Louvre, which are appalling.\u201d \u201cHe admires them immensely too.\u201d \u201cI must look at them again. My impressions of them are rather distant,\u201d she replied after a moment\u2019s silence, and as though the favourable opinion which she was certain, before very long, to form of Poussin would depend, not upon the information that I had just communicated to her, but upon the supplementary and, this time, final examination that she intended to make of the Poussins in the Louvre in order to be in a position to change her mind. Contenting myself with what was a first step towards retraction since, if she did not yet admire the Poussins, she was adjourning the matter for further consideration, in order not to keep her on tenterhooks any longer, I told her mother-in-law how much I had heard of the wonderful flowers at F\u00e9terne. In modest terms she spoke of the little presbytery garden that she had behind the house, into which in the mornings, by simply pushing open a door, she went in her wrapper to feed her peacocks, hunt for new-laid eggs, and gather the zinnias or roses which, on the sideboard, framing the creamed eggs or fried fish in a border of flowers, reminded her of her garden paths. \u201cIt is true, we have a great many roses,\u201d she told me, \u201cour rose garden is almost too near the house, there are days when it makes my head ache. It is nicer on the terrace at la Raspeli\u00e8re where the breeze carries the scent of the roses, but it is not so heady.\u201d I turned to her daughter-in-law. \u201cIt is just like Pell\u00e9as,\u201d I said to her, to gratify her taste for the modern, \u201cthat scent of roses wafted up to the terraces. It is so strong in the score that, as I suffer from hay-fever and rose-fever, it sets me sneezing every time I listen to that scene.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a marvellous thing Pell\u00e9as is,\u201d cried Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cI\u2019m mad about it;\u201d and, drawing closer to me with the gestures of a savage woman seeking to captivate me, using her fingers to pick out imaginary notes, she began to hum something which, I supposed, represented to her the farewells of Pell\u00e9as, and continued with a vehement persistence as though it had been important that Mme. de Cambremer should at that moment remind me of that scene or rather should prove to me that she herself remembered it. \u201cI think it is even finer than Parsifal,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause in Parsifal the most beautiful things are surrounded with a sort of halo of melodious phrases, which are bad simply because they are melodious.\u201d \u201cI know, you are a great musician, Madame,\u201d I said to the dowager. \u201cI should so much like to hear you play.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin gazed at the sea so as not to be drawn into the conversation. Being of the opinion that what her mother-in-law liked was not music at all, she regarded the talent, a sham talent according to her, though in reality of the very highest order that the other was admitted to possess as a technical accomplishment devoid of interest. It was true that Chopin\u2019s only surviving pupil declared, and with justice, that the Master\u2019s style of playing, his \u2018feeling\u2019 had been transmitted, through herself, to Mme. de Cambremer alone, but to play like Chopin was far from being a recommendation in the eyes of Legran-din\u2019s sister, who despised nobody so much as the Polish composer. \u201cOh! They are flying away,\u201d exclaimed Albertine, pointing to the gulls which, casting aside for a moment their flowery incognito, were rising in a body towards the sun. \u201cTheir giant wings from walking hinder them,\u201d quoted Mme. de Cambremer, confusing the seagull with the albatross. \u201cI do love them; I used to see them at Amsterdam,\u201d said Albertine. \u201cThey smell of the sea, they come and breathe the salt air through the paving stones even.\u201d \u201cOh! So you have been in Holland, you know the Vermeers?\u201d Mme. de Cambremer asked imperiously, in the tone in which she would have said: \u201cYou know the Guermantes?\u201d for snobbishness in changing its subject does not change its accent. Albertine replied in the negative, thinking that they were living people. But her mistake was not apparent. \u201cI should be delighted to play to you,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer said to me. \u201cBut you know I only play things that no longer appeal to your generation. I was brought up in the worship of Chopin,\u201d she said in a lowered tone, for she was afraid of her daughter-in-law, and knew that to the latter, who considered that Chopin was not music, playing him well or badly were meaningless terms. She admitted that her mother-in-law had technique, was a finished pianist. \u201cNothing will ever make me say that she is a musician,\u201d was Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin\u2019s conclusion. Because she considered herself \u2018advanced,\u2019 because (hi matters of art only) \u201cone could never move far enough to the Left,\u201d she said, she maintained not merely that music progressed, but that it progressed along one straight line, and that Debussy was in a sense a super-Wagner, slightly more advanced again than Wagner. She did not take into account the fact that if Debussy was not as independent of Wagner as she herself was to suppose in a few years\u2019 time, because we must always make use of the weapons that we have captured to free ourselves finally from the foe whom we have for the moment overpowered, he was seeking nevertheless, after the feeling of satiety that people were beginning to derive from work that was too complete, in which everything was expressed, to satisfy an opposite demand. There were theories of course, to support this reaction for the time being, like those theories which, in politics, come to the support of the laws against religious communities, of wars in the East (unnatural teaching, the Yellow Peril, etc., etc.). People said that an age of speed required rapidity in art, precisely as they might have said that the next war could not last longer than a fortnight, or that the coming of railways would kill the little places beloved of the coaches, which the motor-car, for all that, was to restore to favour. Composers were warned not to strain the attention of their audience, as though we had not at our disposal different degrees of attention, among which it rests precisely with the artist himself to arouse the highest. For the people who yawn with boredom after ten lines of a mediocre article have journeyed year after year to Bayreuth to listen to the Ring. Besides, the day was to come when, for a season, Debussy would be pronounced as trivial as Massenet, and the trills of M\u00e9lisande degraded to the level of Manon\u2019s. For theories and schools, like microbes and corpuscles, devour one another and by their warfare ensure the continuity of existence. But that time was still to come\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As on the Stock Exchange, when a rise occurs, a whole group of securities benefit by it, so a certain number of despised composers were gaining by the reaction, either because they did not deserve such scorn, or simply \u2014 which enabled one to be original when one sang their praises \u2014 because they had incurred it. And people even went the length of seeking out, in an isolated past, men of independent talent upon whose reputation the present movement did not seem calculated to have any influence, but of whom one of the new masters was understood to have spoken favourably. Often it was because a master, whoever he may be, however exclusive his school, judges in the light of his own untutored instincts, does justice to talent wherever it be found, or rather not so much to talent as to some agreeable inspiration which he has enjoyed in the past, which reminds him of a precious moment in his adolescence. Or, it may be, because certain artists of an earlier generation have in some fragment of their work realised something that resembles what the master has gradually become aware that he himself meant at one time to create. Then he sees the old master as a sort of precursor; he values in him, under a wholly different form, an effort that is momentarily, partially fraternal. There are bits of Turner in the work of Poussin, we find a phrase of Flaubert in Montesquieu. Sometimes, again, this rumoured predilection of the Master was due to an error, starting heaven knows where and circulated through the school. But in that case the name mentioned profited by the auspices under which it was introduced in the nick of time, for if there is an element of free will, some genuine taste expressed in the master\u2019s choice, the schools themselves go only by theory. Thus it is that the mind, following its habitual course which advances by digression, inclining first in one direction, then in the other, had brought back into the light of day a number of works to which the need for justice, or for a renewal of standards, or the taste of Debussy, or his caprice, or some remark that he had perhaps never made had added the works of Chopin. Commended by the judges in whom one had entire confidence, profiting by the admiration that was aroused by Pell\u00e9as, they had acquired a fresh lustre, and even the people who had not heard them again were so anxious to admire them that they did so in spite of themselves, albeit preserving the illusion of free will. But Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin spent part of the year in the country. Even in Paris, being an invalid, she was largely confined to her own room. It is true that the drawbacks of this mode of existence were noticeable chiefly in her choice of expressions which she supposed to be fashionable and which would have been more appropriate to the written language, a distinction that she did not perceive, for she derived them more from reading than from conversation. The latter is not so necessary for an exact knowledge of current opinion as of the latest expressions. Unfortunately this revival of the Nocturnes had not yet been announced by the critics. The news of it had been transmitted only by word of mouth among the \u2018younger\u2019 people. It remained unknown to Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin. I gave myself the pleasure of informing her, but by addressing my remark to her mother-in-law, as when at billiards in order to hit a ball one aims at the cushion, that Chopin, so far from being out of date, was Debussy\u2019s favourite composer. \u201cIndeed, that\u2019s quaint,\u201d said the daughter-in-law with a subtle smile as though it had been merely a deliberate paradox on the part of the composer of Pell\u00e9as. Nevertheless it was now quite certain that in future she would always listen to Chopin with respect and even pleasure. Moreover my words which had sounded the hour of deliverance for the dowager produced on her face an expression of gratitude to myself and above all of joy. Her eyes shone like the eyes of Latude in the play entitled Latude, or Thirty-five Years in Captivity, and her bosom inhaled the sea air with that dilatation which Beethoven has so well described in Fidelio, at the point where his prisoners at last breathe again \u2018this life-giving air.\u2019 As for the dowager, I thought that she was going to press her hirsute lips to my cheek. \u201cWhat, you like Chopin? He likes Chopin, he likes Chopin,\u201d she cried with a nasal trumpet-tone of passion; she might have been saying: \u201cWhat, you know Mme. de Franquetot too?\u201d with this difference, that my relations with Mme. de Franquetot would have left her completely indifferent, whereas my knowledge of Chopin plunged her in a sort of artistic delirium. Her salivary super-secretion no longer sufficed. Not having attempted even to understand the part played by Debussy in the rediscovery of Chopin, she felt only that my judgment of him was favourable. Her musical enthusiasm overpowered her. \u201cElodie! Elodie! He likes Chopin!\u201d her bosom rose and she beat the air with her arms. \u201cAh! I knew at once that you were a musician,\u201d she cried. \u201cI can quite understand an artist such as you are liking him. He\u2019s so lovely!\u201d And her voice was as pebbly as if, to express her ardour for Chopin, she had copied Demosthenes and filled her mouth with all the shingle on the beach. Then came the turn of the tide, reaching as far as her veil which she had not time to lift out of harm\u2019s way and which was flooded; and lastly the Marquise wiped away with her embroidered handkerchief the tidemark of foam in which the memory of Chopin had steeped her moustaches\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood heavens,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin remarked to me, \u201cI\u2019m afraid my mother-in-law\u2019s cutting it rather fine, she\u2019s forgotten that we\u2019ve got my Uncle de Ch\u2019nouville dining. Besides, Cancan doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\u201d The word \u2018Cancan\u2019 was beyond me, and I supposed that she might perhaps be referring to a dog. But as for the Ch\u2019nouville relatives, the explanation was as follows. With the lapse of time the young Marquise had outgrown the pleasure that she had once found in pronouncing their name in this manner. And yet it was the prospect of enjoying that pleasure that had decided her choice of a husband. In other social circles, when one referred to the Chenouville family, the custom was (whenever, that is to say, the particle was preceded by a word ending in a vowel sound, for otherwise you were obliged to lay stress upon the de, the tongue refusing to utter Madam\u2019 d\u2019Ch\u2019nonceaux) that it was the mute e of the particle that was sacrificed. One said: \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Chenouville.\u201d The Cambremer tradition was different, but no less imperious. It was the mute e of Chenouville that was suppressed. Whether the name was preceded by mon cousin or by ma cousine, it was always de Chenouvilleand never de Chenouville. (Of the father of these Chenouvilles, one said \u2018our Uncle\u2019 for they were not sufficiently \u2018smart set\u2019 at F\u00e9terne to pronounce the word \u2018Unk\u2019 like the Guermantes, whose deliberate jargon, suppressing consonants and naturalising foreign words, was as difficult to understand as Old French or a modern dialect.) Every newcomer into the family circle at once received, in the matter of the Ch\u2019nouvilles, a lesson which Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin had not required. When, paying a call one day, she had heard a girl say: \u201cMy Aunt d\u2019Uzai,\u201d \u201cMy Unk de Rouan,\u201d she had not at first recognised the illustrious names which she was in the habit of pronouncing: Uz\u00e8s, and Rol\u00eean, she had felt the astonishment, embarrassment and shame of a person who sees before him on the table a recently invented implement of which he does not know the proper use and with which he dares not begin to eat. But during that night and the next day she had rapturously repeated: \u201cMy Aunt Uzai,\u201d with that suppression of the final s, a suppression that had stupefied her the day before, but which it now seemed to her so vulgar not to know that, one of her friends having spoken to her of a bust of the Duchesse d\u2019Uz\u00e8s, Mlle. Legrandin had answered her crossly, and in an arrogant tone: \u201cYou might at least pronounce her name properly: Mme. d\u2019Uzai.\u201d From that moment she had realised that, by virtue of the transmutation of solid bodies into more and more subtle elements, the considerable and so honourably acquired fortune that she had inherited from her father, the finished education that she had received, her regular attendance at the Sorbonne, whether at Caro\u2019s lectures or at Brunetiere\u2019s, and at the Lamoureux concerts, all this was to be rendered volatile, to find its utmost sublimation in the pleasure of being able one day to say: \u201cMy Aunt d\u2019Uzai.\u201d This did not exclude the thought that she would continue to associate, in the earlier days, at least, of her married life, not indeed with certain women friends whom she liked and had resigned herself to sacrificing, but with certain others whom she did not like and to whom she looked forward to being able to say (since that, after all, was why she was marrying): \u201cI must introduce you to my Aunt d\u2019Uzai,\u201d and, when she saw that such an alliance was beyond her reach, \u201cI must introduce you to my Aunt de Ch\u2019nouville,\u201d and \u201cI shall ask you to dine to meet the Uzai.\u201d Her marriage to M. de Cambremer had procured for Mlle. Legrandin the opportunity to use the former of these phrases but not the latter, the circle in which her parents-in-law moved not being that which she had supposed and of which she continued to dream. After saying to me of Saint-Loup (adopting for the occasion one of his expressions, for if in talking to her I used those expressions of Legrandin, she by a reverse suggestion answered me in Robert\u2019s dialect which she did not know to be borrowed from Rachel), bringing her thumb and forefinger together and half-shutting her eyes as though she were gazing at something infinitely delicate which she had succeeded in capturing: \u201cHe has a charming quality of mind,\u201d she began to extol him with such warmth that one might have supposed that she was in love with him (it had indeed been alleged that, some time back, when he was at Don-ci\u00e8res, Robert had been her lover), in reality simply that I might repeat her words to him, and ended up with: \u201cYou are a great friend of the Duchesse de Guermantes. I am an invalid, I never go anywhere, and I know that she sticks to a close circle of chosen friends, which I do think so wise of her, and so I know her very slightly, but I know she is a really remarkable woman.\u201d Aware that Mme. de Carnbremer barely knew her, and anxious to reduce myself to her level, I avoided the subject and answered the Marquise that the person whom I did know well was her brother, M. Legrandin. At the sound of his name she assumed the same evasive air as myself over the name of Mme. de Guermantes, but combined with it an expression of annoyance, for she supposed that I had said this with the object of humiliating not myself but her. Was she gnawed by despair at having been born a Legrandin? So at least her husband\u2019s sisters and sisters-in-law asserted, ladies of the provincial nobility who knew nobody and nothing, and were jealous of Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s intelligence, her education, her fortune, the physical attractions that she had possessed before her illness. \u201cShe can think of nothing else, that is what is killing her,\u201d these slanderers would say whenever they spoke of Mme. de Cambremer to no matter whom, but preferably to a plebeian, whether, were he conceited and stupid, to enhance, by this affirmation of the shamefulness of a plebeian origin, the value of the affability that they were shewing him, of, if he were shy and clever and applied the remark to himself, to give themselves the pleasure, while receiving him hospitably, of insulting him indirectly. But if these ladies thought that they were speaking the truth about their sister-in-law, they were mistaken. She suffered not at all from having been born Legrandin, for she had forgotten the fact altogether. She was annoyed at my reminding her of it, and remained silent as though she had not understood, not thinking it necessary to enlarge upon or even to confirm my statement\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur cousins are not the chief reason for our cutting short our visit,\u201d said the dowager Mme. de Cambremer, who was probably more satiated than her daughter-in-law with the pleasure to be derived from saying \u2018Ch\u2019nouville.\u2019 \u201cBut, so as not to bother you with too many people, Monsieur,\u201d she went on, indicating the lawyer, \u201cwas afraid to bring his wife and son to the hotel. They are waiting for us on the beach, and they will be growing impatient.\u201d I asked for an exact description of them and hastened in search of them. The wife had a round face like certain flowers of the ranunculus family, and a large vegetable growth at the corner of her eye. And as the generations of mankind preserve their characteristic like a family of plants, just as on the blemished face of his mother, an identical mole, which might have helped one in classifying a variety of the species, protruded below the eye of the son. The lawyer was touched by my civility to his wife and son. He shewed an interest in the subject of my stay at Balbec. \u201cYou must find yourself rather out of your element, for the people here are for the most part foreigners.\u201d And he kept his eye on me as he spoke, for, not caring for foreigners, albeit he had many foreign clients, he wished to make sure that I was not hostile to his xenophobia, in which case he would have beaten a retreat saying: \u201cOf course, Mme. X\u2014\u2014-may be a charming woman. It\u2019s a question of principle.\u201d As at that time I had no definite opinion about foreigners, I shewed no sign of disapproval; he felt himself to be on safe ground. He went so far as to invite me to come one day, in Paris, to see his collection of Le Sidaner, and to bring with me the Cambremers, with whom he evidently supposed me to be on intimate terms. \u201cI shall invite you to meet Le Sidaner,\u201d he said to me, confident that from that moment I would live only in expectation of that happy day. \u201cYou shall see what a delightful man he is. And his pictures will enchant you. Of course, I can\u2019t compete with the great collectors, but I do believe that I am the one that possesses the greatest number of his favourite canvases. They will interest you all the more, coming from Balbec, since they are marine subjects, for the most part, at least.\u201d The wife and son, blessed with a vegetable nature, listened composedly. One felt that their house in Paris was a sort of temple of Le Sidaner. Temples of this sort are not without their use. When the god has doubts as to his own merits, he can easily stop the cracks in his opinion of himself with the irrefutable testimony of people who have devoted their lives to his work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At a signal from her daughter-in-law, Mme. de Cambremer prepared to depart, and said to me: \u201cSince you won\u2019t come and stay at F\u00e9terne, won\u2019t you at least come to luncheon, one day this week, to-morrow for instance?\u201d And in her bounty, to make the invitation irresistible, she added: \u201cYou will find the Comte de Crisenoy,\u201d whom I had never lost, for the simple reason that I did not know him. She was beginning to dazzle me with yet further temptations, but stopped short. The chief magistrate who, on returning to the hotel, had been told that she was on the premises had crept about searching for her everywhere, then waited his opportunity, and pretending to have caught sight of her by chance, came up now to greet her. I gathered that Mme. de Cambremer did not mean to extend to him the invitation to luncheon that she had just addressed to me. And yet he had known her far longer than I, having for years past been one of the regular guests at the afternoon parties at F\u00e9terne whom I used so to envy during my former visit to Balbec. But old acquaintance is not the only thing that counts in society. And hostesses are more inclined to reserve their luncheons for new acquaintances who still whet their curiosity, especially when they arrive preceded by a glowing and irresistible recommendation like Saint-Loup\u2019s of me. Mme. de Cambremer decided that the chief magistrate could not have heard what she was saying to me, but, to calm her guilty conscience, began addressing him in the kindest tone. In the sunlight that flooded, on the horizon, the golden coastline, invisible as a rule, of Rivebelle, we could just make out, barely distinguishable from the luminous azure, rising from the water, rosy, silvery, faint, the little bells that were sounding the ang\u00e9lus round about F\u00e9terne. \u201cThat is ratherPell\u00e9as, too,\u201d I suggested to Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin. \u201cYou know the scene I mean.\u201d \u201cOf course I do!\u201d was what she said; but \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea\u201d was the message proclaimed by her voice and features which did not mould themselves to the shape of any recollection and by a smile that floated without support in the air. The dowager could not get over her astonishment that the sound of the bells should carry so far, and rose, reminded of the time. \u201cBut, as a rule,\u201d I said, \u201cwe never see that part of the coast from Balbec, nor hear it either. The weather must have changed and enlarged the horizon in more ways than one. Unless, that is to say, the bells have come to look for you, since I see that they are making you leave; to you they are a dinner bell.\u201d The chief magistrate, little interested in the bells, glanced furtively along the front, on which he was sorry to see so few people that evening. \u201cYou are a true poet,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer to me. \u201cOne feels you are so responsive, so artistic, come, I will play you Chopin,\u201d she went on, raising her arms with an air of ecstasy and pronouncing the words in a raucous voice like the shifting of shingle on the beach. Then came the deglutition of spittle, and the old lady instinctively wiped the stubble of her moustaches with her handkerchief. The chief magistrate did me, unconsciously, a great service by offering the Marquise his arm to escort her to her carriage, a certain blend of vulgarity, boldness and love of ostentation prompting him to actions which other people would have hesitated to risk, and which are by no means unsuccessful in society. He was, moreover, and had been for years past far more in the habit of these actions than myself. While blessing him for what he did I did not venture to copy him, and walked by the side of Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin who insisted upon seeing the book that I had in my hand. The name of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 drew a grimace from her; and using a word which she had seen in certain newspapers, but which, used in speech and given a feminine form, and applied to a seventeenth century writer, had an odd effect, she asked me: \u201cDo you think her really masterly?\u201d The Marquise gave her footman the address of a pastry-cook where she had to call before taking the road, rosy with the evening haze, through which loomed one beyond another the dusky walls of cliff. She asked her old coachman whether one of the horses which was apt to catch cold had been kept warm enough, whether the other\u2019s shoe were not hurting him. \u201cI shall write to you and make a definite engagement,\u201d she murmured to me. \u201cI heard you talking about literature to my daughter-in-law, she\u2019s a darling,\u201d she went on, not that she really thought so, but she had acquired the habit \u2014 and kept it up in her kindness of heart \u2014 of saying so, in order that her son might not appear to have married for money. \u201cBesides,\u201d she added with a final enthusiastic gnashing of her teeth, \u201cshe\u2019s so harttissttick!\u201d With this she stepped into her carriage, nodding her head, holding the crook of her sunshade aloft like a crozier, and set off through the streets of Balbec, overloaded with the ornaments of her priesthood, like an old Bishop on a confirmation tour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe has asked you to luncheon,\u201d the chief magistrate said to me sternly when the carriage had passed out of sight and I came indoors with the girls. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the best of terms just now. She feels that I neglect her. Gad, I\u2019m easy enough to get on with. If anybody needs me, I\u2019m always there to say: Adsum! But they tried to force my hand. That, now,\u201d he went on with an air of subtlety, holding up his finger as though making and arguing a distinction, \u201cthat is a thing I do not allow. It is a threat to the liberty of my holidays. I was obliged to say: Stopl You seem to be in her good books. When you reach my age you will see that society is a very trumpery thing, and you will be sorry you attached so much importance to these trifles. Well, I am going to take a turn before dinner. Good-bye, children,\u201d he shouted back at us, as though he were already fifty yards away\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had said good-bye to Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le, they saw with astonishment that Albertine was staying behind instead of accompanying them. \u201cWhy, Albertine, what are you doing, don\u2019t you know what time it is?\u201d \u201cGo home,\u201d she replied in a tone of authority. \u201cI want to talk to him,\u201d she added, indicating myself with a submissive air. Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le stared at me, filled with a new and strange respect. I enjoyed the feeling that, for a moment at least, in the eyes even of Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le, I was to Albertine something more important than the time, than her friends, and might indeed share solemn secrets with her into which it was impossible for them to be admitted. \u201cShan\u2019t we see you again this evening?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, it will depend on this person. Anyhow, to-morrow.\u201d \u201cLet us go up to my room,\u201d I said to her, when her friends had gone. We took the lift; she remained silent in the boy\u2019s presence. The habit of being obliged to resort to personal observation and deduction in order to find out the business of their masters, those strange beings who converse among themselves and do not speak to them, develops in \u2018employees\u2019 (as the lift-boy styled servants), a stronger power of divination than the \u2018employer\u2019 possesses. Our organs become atrophied or grow stronger or more subtle, accordingly as our need of them increases or diminishes. Since railways came into existence, the necessity of not missing the train has taught us to take account of minutes whereas among the ancient Romans, who not only had a more cursory science of astronomy but led less hurried lives, the notion not of minutes but even of fixed hours barely existed. And so the lift-boy had gathered and meant to inform his comrades that Albertine and I were preoccupied. But he talked to us without ceasing because he had no tact. And yet I could see upon his face, in place of the customary expression of friendliness and joy at taking me up in his lift, an air of extraordinary depression and uneasiness. As I knew nothing of the cause of this, in an attempt to distract his thoughts, and albeit I was more preoccupied than Albertine, I told him that the lady who had just left was called the Marquise de Cambremer and not de Camembert. On the landing at which we were pausing at the moment, I saw, carrying a pair of pails, a hideous chambermaid who greeted me with respect, hoping for a tip when I left. I should have liked to know if she were the one whom I had so ardently desired on the evening of my first arrival at Balbec, but I could never arrive at any certainty. The lift-boy swore to me with the sincerity of most false witnesses, but without shedding his expression of despair, that it was indeed by the name of Camembert that the Marquise had told him to announce her. And as a matter of fact it was quite natural that he should have heard her say a name which he already knew. Besides, having those very vague ideas of nobility, and of the names of which titles are composed, which are shared by many people who are not lift-boys, the name Camembert had seemed to him all the more probable inasmuch as, that cheese being universally known, it was not in the least surprising that people should have acquired a marquisate from so glorious a distinction, unless it were the marquisate that had bestowed its renown upon the cheese. Nevertheless as he saw that I refused to admit that I might be mistaken, and as he knew that masters like to see their most futile whims obeyed and their most obvious lies accepted, he promised me like a good servant that in future he would say Cambremer. It is true that none of the shopkeepers in the town, none of the peasants in the district, where the name and persons of the Cambremers were perfectly familiar, could ever have made the lift-boy\u2019s mistake. But the staff of the \u2018Grand Hotel of Balbec\u2019 were none of them natives. They came direct, with the furniture and stock, from Biarritz, Nice and Monte-Carlo, one division having been transferred to Deauville, another to Dinard and the third reserved for Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the lift-boy\u2019s pained anxiety continued to grow. That he should thus forget to shew his devotion to me by the customary smiles, some misfortune must have befallen him. Perhaps he had been \u2018\u2018missed.\u2019 I made up my mind in that case to try to secure his reinstatement, the manager having promised to ratify all my wishes with regard to his staff. \u201cYou can always do just what you like, I rectify everything in advance.\u201d Suddenly, as I stepped out of the lift, I guessed the meaning of the boy\u2019s distress, his panic-stricken air. Because Albertine was with me, I had not given him the five francs which I was in the habit of slipping into his hand when I went up. And the idiot, instead of understanding that I did not wish to make a display of generosity in front of a third person, had begun to tremble, supposing that it was all finished, that I would never give him anything again. He imagined that I was \u2018on the rocks\u2019 (as the Duc de Guermantes would have said), and the supposition inspired him with no pity for myself but with a terrible selfish disappointment. I told myself that I was less unreasonable than my mother thought when I dared not, one day, refrain from giving the extravagant but feverishly awaited sum that I had given the day before. But at the same time the meaning that I had until then, and without a shadow of doubt, ascribed to his habitual expression of joy, in which I had no hesitation in seeing a sign of devotion, seemed to me to have become less certain. Seeing the lift-boy ready, in his despair, to fling himself down from the fifth floor of the hotel, I asked myself whether, if our respective social stations were to be altered, in consequence let us say of a revolution, instead of politely working his lift for me, the boy, grown independent, would not have flung me down the well, and whether there was not, in certain of the lower orders, more duplicity than in society, where, no doubt, people reserve their offensive remarks until we are out of earshot, but where their attitude towards us would not be insulting if we were reduced to poverty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One cannot however say that, in the Balbec hotel, the lift-boy was the most commercially minded. From this point of view the staff might be divided into two categories; on the one hand, those who drew distinctions between the visitors, and were more grateful for the modest tip of an old nobleman (who, moreover, was in a position to relieve them from 28 days of military service by saying a word for them to General de Beautreillis) than for the thoughtless liberalities of a cad who by his very profusion revealed a want of practice which only to his face did they call generosity. On the other hand, those to whom nobility, intellect, fame, position, manners were nonexistent, concealed under a cash valuation. For these there was but a single standard, the money one has, or rather the money one bestows. Possibly Aim\u00e9 himself, albeit pretending, in view of the great number of hotels in which he had served, to a great knowledge of the world, belonged to this latter category. At the most he would give a social turn, shewing that he knew who was who, to this sort of appreciation, as when he said of the Princesse de Luxembourg: \u201cThere\u2019s a pile of money among that lot?\u201d (the question mark at the end being to ascertain the facts or to check such information as he had already ascertained, before supplying a client with a \u2018chef for Paris, or promising him a table on the left, by the door, with a view of the sea, at Balbec). In spite of this, and albeit not free from sordid considerations, he would not have displayed them with the fatuous despair of the lift-boy. And yet, the latter\u2019s artlessness helped perhaps to simplify things. It is the convenience of a big hotel, of a house such as Rachel used at one time to frequent, that, without any intermediary, the face, frozen stiff until that moment, of a servant or a woman, at the sight of a hundred-franc note, still more of one of a thousand, even although it is being given to some one else, will melt in smiles and offers of service. Whereas in the dealings, in the relations between lover and mistress, there are too many things interposed between money and docility. So many things that the very people upon whose faces money finally evokes a smile are often incapable of following the internal process that links them together, believe themselves to be, and indeed are more refined. Besides, it rids polite conversation of such speeches as: \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing left for me to do, you will find me to-morrow in the mortuary.\u201d And so one meets in polite society few novelists, or poets, few of all those sublime creatures who speak of the things that are not to be mentioned\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as we were alone and had moved along the corridor, Albertine began: \u201cWhat is it, you have got against me?\u201d Had my harsh treatment of her been painful to myself? Had it been merely an unconscious ruse on my part, with the object of bringing my mistress to that attitude of fear and supplication which would enable me to interrogate her, and perhaps to find out which of the alternative hypotheses that I had long since formed about her was correct? However that may be, when I heard her question, I suddenly felt the joy of one who attains to a long desired goal. Before answering her, I escorted her to the door of my room. Opening it, I scattered the roseate light that was flooding the room and turning the white muslin of the curtains drawn for the night to golden damask. I went across to the window; the gulls had settled again upon the waves; but this time they were pink. I drew Albertine\u2019s attention to them. \u201cDon\u2019t change the subject,\u201d she said, \u201cbe frank with me.\u201d I lied. I declared to her that she must first listen to a confession, that of my passionate admiration, for some time past, of Andr\u00e9e, and I made her this confession with a simplicity and frankness worthy of the stage, but seldom employed in real life except for a love which people do not feel. Harking back to the fiction I had employed with Gilberte before my first visit to Balbec, but adapting its terms, I went so far (in order to make her more ready to believe me when I told her now that I was not in love with her) as to let fall the admission that at one time I had been on the point of falling in love with her, but that too long an interval had elapsed, that she could be nothing more to me now than a good friend and comrade, and that even if I wished to feel once again a more ardent sentiment for her it would be quite beyond my power. As it happened, in taking my stand thus before Albertine on these protestations of coldness towards her, I was merely \u2014 because of a particular circumstance and with a particular object in view \u2014 making more perceptible, accentuating more markedly, that dual rhythm which love adopts in all those who have too little confidence in themselves to believe that a woman can ever fall in love with them, and also that they themselves can genuinely fall in love with her. They know themselves well enough to have observed that in the presence of the most divergent types of woman they felt the same hopes, the same agonies, invented the same romances, uttered the same words, to have deduced therefore that their sentiments, their actions bear no close and necessary relation to the woman they love, but pass by her, spatter her, surround her, like the waves that break round upon the rocks, and their sense of their own instability increases still further their misgivings that this woman, by whom they would so fain be loved, is not in love with them. Why should chance have brought it about, when she is simply an accident placed so as to catch the ebullience of our desire, that we should ourselves be the object of the desire that is animating her? And so, while we feel the need to pour out before her all those sentiments, so different from the merely human sentiments that our neighbour inspires in us, those so highly specialised sentiments which are a lover\u2019s, after we have taken a step forward, in avowing to her whom we love our affection for her, our hopes, overcome at once by the fear of offending her, ashamed too that the speech we have addressed to her was not composed expressly for her, that it has served us already, will serve us again for others, that if she does not love us she cannot understand us and we have spoken in that case with the want of taste, of modesty shewn by the pedant who addresses an ignorant audience in subtle phrases which are not for them, this fear, this shame bring into play the counter-rhythm, the reflux, the need, even by first drawing back, hotly denying the affection we have already confessed, to resume the offensive, and to recapture her esteem, to dominate her; the double rhythm is perceptible in the various periods of a single love affair, in all the corresponding periods of similar love affairs, in all those people whose self-analysis outweighs their self-esteem. If it was however somewhat more vigorously accentuated than usual in this speech which I was now preparing to make to Albertine, that was simply to allow me to pass more speedily and more emphatically to the alternate rhythm which should sound my affection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As though it must be painful to Albertine to believe what I was saying to her as to the impossibility of my loving her again, after so long an interval, I justified what I called an eccentricity of my nature by examples taken from people with whom I had, by their fault or my own, allowed the time for loving them to pass, and been unable, however keenly I might have desired it, to recapture it. I thus appeared at one and the same time to be apologising to her, as for a want of courtesy, for this inability to begin loving her again, and to be seeking to make her understand the psychological reasons for that incapacity as though they had been peculiar to myself. But by explaining myself in this fashion, by dwelling upon the case of Gilberte, in regard to whom the argument had indeed been strictly true which was becoming so far from true when applied to Albertine, all that I did was to render my assertions as plausible as I pretended to believe that they were not. Feeling that Albertine appreciated what she called my \u2018frank speech\u2019 and recognising in my deductions the clarity of the evidence, I apologised for the former by telling her that I knew that the truth was always unpleasant and in this instance must seem to her incomprehensible. She, on the contrary, thanked me for my sincerity and added that so far from being puzzled she understood perfectly a state of mind so frequent and so natural\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This avowal to Albertine of an imaginary sentiment for Andr\u00e9e, and, towards herself, an indifference which, that it might appear altogether sincere and without exaggeration, I assured her incidentally, as though by a scruple of politeness, must not be taken too literally, enabled me at length, without any fear of Albertine\u2019s suspecting me of loving her, to speak to her with a tenderness which I had so long denied myself and which seemed to me exquisite. I almost caressed my confidant; as I spoke to her of her friend whom I loved, tears came to my eyes. But, coming at last to the point, I said to her that she knew what love meant, its susceptibilities, its sufferings, and that perhaps, as the old friend that she now was, she might feel it in her heart to put a stop to the bitter grief that she was causing me, not directly, since it was not herself that I loved, if I might venture to repeat that without offending her, but indirectly by wounding me in my love for Andr\u00e9e. I broke off to admire and point out to Albertine a great bird, solitary and hastening, which far out in front of us, lashing the air with the regular beat of its wings, was passing at full speed over the beach stained here and there with reflexions like little torn scraps of red paper, and crossing it from end to end without slackening its pace, without diverting its attention, without deviating from its path, like an envoy carrying far afield an urgent and vital message. \u201cHe at least goes straight to the point!\u201d said Albertine in a tone of reproach. \u201cYou say that because you don\u2019t know what it is I was going to tell you. But it is so difficult that I prefer to give it up; I am certain that I should make you angry; and then all that will have happened will be this: I shall be in no way better off with the girl I really love and I shall have lost a good friend.\u201d \u201cBut when I swear to you that I will not be angry.\u201d She had so sweet, so wistfully docile an air, as though her whole happiness depended on me, that I could barely restrain myself from kissing \u2014 with almost the same kind of pleasure that I should have taken in kissing my mother \u2014 this novel face which no longer presented the startled, blushing expression of a rebellious and perverse kitten with its little pink, tip-tilted nose, but seemed, in the fulness of its crushing sorrow, moulded in broad, flattened, drooping slabs of pure goodness. Making an abstraction of my love as of a chronic mania that had no connexion with her, putting myself in her place, I let my heart be melted before this honest girl, accustomed to being treated in a friendly and loyal fashion, whom the good comrade that she might have supposed me had been pursuing for weeks past with persecutions which had at last arrived at their culminating point. It was because I placed myself at a standpoint that was purely human, external to both of us, at which my jealous love dissolved, that I felt for Albertine that profound pity, which would have been less profound if I had not loved her. However, in that rhythmical oscillation which leads from a declaration to a quarrel (the surest, the most certainly perilous way of forming by opposite and successive movements a knot which will not be loosed and attaches us firmly to a person by the strain of the movement of withdrawal which constitutes one of the two elements of the rhythm), of what use is it to analyse farther the refluences of human pity, which, the opposite of love, though springing perhaps unconsciously from the same cause, produces in every case the same effects? When we count up afterwards the total amount of all that we have done for a woman, we often discover that the actions prompted by the desire to shew that we love her, to make her love us, to win her favours, bulk little if any greater than those due to the human need to repair the wrongs that we have done to the creature whom we love, from a mere sense of moral duty, as though we were not in love with her. \u201cBut tell me, what on earth have I done?\u201d Albertine asked me. There was a knock at the door; it was the lift-boy; Albertine\u2019s aunt, who was passing the hotel in a carriage, had stopped on the chance of finding her there, to take her home. Albertine sent word that she could not come, that they were to begin dinner without her, that she could not say at what time she would return. \u201cBut won\u2019t your aunt be angry?\u201d \u201cWhat do you suppose? She will understand all right.\u201d And so, at this moment at least, a moment such as might never occur again \u2014 a conversation with myself was proved by this incident to be in Albertine\u2019s eyes a thing of such self-evident importance that it must be given precedence over everything, a thing to which, referring no doubt instinctively to a family code, enumerating certain crises in which, when the career of M. Bontemps was at stake, a journey had been made without a thought, my friend never doubted that her aunt would think it quite natural to see her sacrifice the dinner-hour. That remote hour which she passed without my company, among her own people, Albertine, having brought it to me, bestowed it on me; I might make what use of it I chose. I ended by making bold to tell her what had been reported to me about her way of living, and that notwithstanding the profound disgust that I felt for women tainted with that vice, I had not given it a thought until I had been told the name of her accomplice, and that she could readily understand, loving Andr\u00e9e as I did, the grief that, the news had caused me. It would have been more tactful perhaps to say that I had been given the names of other women as well, in whom I was not interested. But the sudden and terrible revelation that Cottard had made to me had entered my heart to lacerate it, complete in itself but without accretions. And just as, before that moment, it would never have occurred to me that Albertine was in love with Andr\u00e9e, or at any rate could find pleasure in caressing her, if Cottard had not drawn my attention to their attitude as they waltzed together, so I had been incapable of passing from that idea to the idea, so different for me, that Albertine might have, with other women than Andr\u00e9e, relations for which affection could not be pleaded in excuse. Albertine, before even swearing to me that it was not true, shewed, like everyone upon learning that such things are being said about him, anger, concern, and, with regard to the unknown slanderer, a fierce curiosity to know who he was and a desire to be confronted with him so as to be able to confound him. But she assured me that she bore me, at least, no resentment. \u201cIf it had been true, I should have told you. But Andr\u00e9e and I both loathe that sort of thing. We have not lived all these years without seeing women with cropped hair who behave like men and do the things you mean, and nothing revolts us more.\u201d Albertine gave me merely her word, a peremptory word unsupported by proof. But this was just what was best calculated to calm me, jealousy belonging to that family of sickly doubts which are better purged by the energy than by the probability of an affirmation. It is moreover the property of love to make us at once more distrustful and more credulous, to make us suspect, more readily than we should suspect anyone else, her whom we love, and be convinced more easily by her denials. We must be in love before we can care that all women are not virtuous, which is to say before we can be aware of the fact, and we must be in love too before we can hope, that is to say assure ourselves that some are. It is human to seek out what hurts us and then at once to seek to get rid of it. The statements that are capable of so relieving us seem quite naturally true, we are not inclined to cavil at a sedative that acts. Besides, however multiform may be the person with whom we are in love, she can in any case offer us two essential personalities accordingly as she appears to us as ours, or as turning her desires in another direction. The former of these personalities possesses the peculiar power which prevents us from believing in the reality of the other, the secret remedy to heal the sufferings that this latter has caused us. The beloved object is successively the malady and the remedy that suspends and aggravates it. No doubt, I had long since been prepared, by the strong impression made on my imagination and my faculty for emotion by the example of Swann, to believe in the truth of what I feared rather than of what I should have wished. And so the comfort brought me by Albertine\u2019s affirmations came near to being jeopardised for a moment, because I was reminded of the story of Odette. But I told myself that, if it was only right to allow for the worst, not only when, in order to understand Swann\u2019s sufferings, I had tried to put myself in his place, but now, when I myself was concerned, in seeking the truth as though it referred to some one else, still I must not, out of cruelty to myself, a soldier who chooses the post not where he can be of most use but where he is most exposed, end in the mistake of regarding one supposition as more true than the rest, simply because it was more painful. Was there not a vast gulf between Albertine, a girl of good, middle-class parentage, and Odette, a courtesan bartered by her mother in her childhood? There could be no comparison of their respective credibility. Besides, Albertine had in no respect the same interest in lying to me that Odette had had in lying to Swann. Moreover to him Odette had admitted what Albertine had just denied. I should therefore be guilty of an error in reasoning as serious \u2014 though in the opposite direction \u2014 as that which had inclined me towards a certain hypothesis because it had caused me less pain than the rest, were I not to take into account these material differences in their positions, but to reconstruct the real life of my mistress solely from what I had been told about the life of Odette. I had before me a new Albertine, of whom I had already, it was true, caught more than one glimpse towards the end of my previous visit to Balbec, frank and honest, an Albertine who had, out of affection for myself, forgiven me my suspicions and tried to dispel them. She made me sit down by her side upon my bed. I thanked her for what she had said to me, assured her that our reconciliation was complete, and that I would never be horrid to her again. I suggested to her that she ought, at the same time, to go home to dinner. She asked me whether I was not glad to have her with me. Drawing my head towards her for a caress which she had never before given me and which I owed perhaps to the healing of our rupture, she passed her tongue lightly over my lips which she attempted to force apart. At first I kept them tight shut. \u201cYou are a great bear!\u201d she informed me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I ought to have left the place that evening and never set eyes on her again. I felt even then that in a love which is not reciprocated \u2014 I might as well say, in love, for there are people for whom there is no such thing as reciprocated love \u2014 we can enjoy only that simulacrum of happiness which had been given me at one of those unique moments in which a woman\u2019s good nature, or her caprice, or mere chance, bring to our desires, in perfect coincidence, the same words, the same actions as if we were really loved. The wiser course would have been to consider with curiosity, to possess with delight that little parcel of happiness failing which I should have died without ever suspecting what it could mean to hearts less difficult to please or more highly favoured; to suppose that it formed part of a vast and enduring happiness of which this fragment only was visible to me, and \u2014 lest the next day should expose this fiction \u2014 not to attempt to ask for any fresh favour after this, which had been due only to the artifice of an exceptional moment. I ought to have left Balbec, to have shut myself up in solitude, to have remained so in harmony with the last vibrations of the voice which I had contrived to render amorous for an instant, and of which I should have asked nothing more than that it might never address another word to me; for fear lest, by an additional word which now could only be different, it might shatter with a discord the sensitive silence in which, as though by the pressure of a pedal, there might long have survived in me the throbbing chord of happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soothed by my explanation with Albertine, I began once again to live in closer intimacy with my mother. She loved to talk to me gently about the days in which my grandmother had been younger. Fearing that I might reproach myself with the sorrows with which I had perhaps darkened the close of my grandmother\u2019s life, she preferred to turn back to the years when the first signs of my dawning intelligence had given my grandmother a satisfaction which until now had always been kept from me. We talked of the old days at Combray. My mother reminded me that there at least I used to read, and that at Balbec I might well do the same, if I was not going to work. I replied that, to surround myself with memories of Combray and of the charming coloured plates, I should like to read again the Thousand and One Nights. As, long ago at Combray, when she gave me books for my birthday, so it was in secret, as a surprise for me, that my mother now sent for both the Thousand and One Nights of Galland and the Thousand Nights and a Night of Mardrus. But, after casting her eye over the two translations, my mother would have preferred that I should stick to Galland\u2019s, albeit hesitating to influence me because of the respect that she felt for intellectual liberty, her dread of interfering with my intellectual life and the feeling that, being a woman, on the one hand she lacked, or so she thought, the necessary literary equipment, and on the other hand ought not to condemn because she herself was shocked by it the reading of a young man. Happening upon certain of the tales, she had been revolted by the immorality of the subject and the crudity of the expression. But above all, preserving, like precious relics, not only the brooch, the sunshade, the cloak, the volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, but also the habits of thought and speech of her mother, seeking on every occasion the opinion that she would have expressed, my mother could have no doubt of the horror with which my grandmother would have condemned Mardrus\u2019s book. She remembered that at Combray while before setting out for a walk, M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, I was reading Augustin Thierry, my grandmother, glad that I should be reading, and taking walks, was indignant nevertheless at seeing him whose name remained enshrined in the hemistich: \u2018Then reign\u00e8d M\u00e9rov\u00e9e\u2019 called Merowig, refused to say \u2018Carolingians\u2019 for the \u2018Carlovingians\u2019 to which she remained loyal. And then I told her what my grandmother had thought of the Greek names which Bloch, following Leconte de Lisle, gave to the gods of Homer, going so far, in the simplest matters, as to make it a religious duty, in which he supposed literary talent to consist, to adopt a Greek system of spelling. Having occasion, for instance, to mention in a letter that the wine which they drank at his home was real nectar, he would write \u2018real nektar,\u2019 with a k, which enabled him to titter at the mention of Lamartine. And if an Odyssey from which the names of Ulysses and Minerva were missing was no longer the Odyssey to her, what would she have said upon seeing corrupted even upon the cover the title of her Thousand and One Nights, upon no longer finding, exactly transcribed as she had all her life been in the habit of pronouncing them, the immortally familiar names of Scheherazade, of Dinarzade, in which, debaptised themselves (if one may use the expression of Musulman tales), the charming Caliph and the powerful Genies were barely recognisable, being renamed, he the \u2018Khalifat\u2019 and they the \u2018Gennis.\u2019 Still, my mother handed over both books to me, and I told her that I would read them on the days when I. felt too tired to go out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These days were not very frequent, however. We used to go out picnicking as before in a band, Albertine, her friends and myself, on the cliff or to the farm called Marie-Antoinette. But there were times when Albertine bestowed on me this great pleasure. She would say to me: \u201cTo-day I want to be alone with you for a little, it will be nicer if we are just by ourselves.\u201d Then she would give out that she was busy, not that she need furnish any explanation, and so that the others, if they went all the same, without us, for an excursion and picnic, might not be able to find us, we would steal away like a pair of lovers, all by ourselves to Bagatelle or the Cross of Heulan, while the band, who would never think of looking for us there and never went there, waited indefinitely, in the hope of seeing us appear, at Marie-Antoinette. I recall the hot weather that we had then, when from the brow of each of the farm-labourers toiling in the sun a drop of sweat would fall, vertical, regular, intermittent, like the drop of water from a cistern, and alternate with the fall of the ripe fruit dropping from the tree in the adjoining \u2018closes\u2019; they have remained, to this day, with that mystery of a woman\u2019s secret, the most substantial part of every love that offers itself to me. A woman who has been mentioned to me and to whom I would not give a moment\u2019s thought \u2014 I upset all my week\u2019s engagements to make her acquaintance, if it is a week of similar weather, and I am to meet her in some isolated farmhouse. It is no good my knowing that this kind of weather, this kind of assignation are not part of her, they are still the bait, which I know all too well, by which I allow myself to be tempted and which is sufficient to hook me. I know that this woman, in cold weather, in a town, I might perhaps have desired, but without the accompaniment of a romantic sentiment, without becoming amorous; my love for her is none the less keen as soon as, by force of circumstances, it has enthralled me \u2014 it is only the more melancholy, as in the course of life our sentiments for other people become, in proportion as we become more clearly aware of the ever smaller part that they play in our life and that the new love which we would like to be so permanent, cut short in the same moment as life itself, will be the last\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were still but a few people at Balbec, hardly any girls. Sometimes I saw some girl resting upon the beach, devoid of charm, and yet apparently identified by various features as one whom I had been in despair at not being able to approach at the moment when she emerged with her friends from the riding school or gymnasium. If it was the same (and I took care not to mention the matter to Albertine), then the girl that I had thought so exciting did not exist. But I could not arrive at any certainty, for the face of any one of these girls did not fill any space upon the beach, did not offer a permanent form, contracted, dilated, transformed as it was by my own observation, the uneasiness of my desire or a sense of comfort that was self-sufficient, by the different clothes that she was wearing, the rapidity of her movements or her immobility. All the same, two or three of them seemed to me adorable. Whenever I saw one of these, I longed to take her away along the Avenue des Tamaris, or among the sandhills, better still upon the cliff. But, albeit into desire, as opposed to indifference, there enters already that audacity which is a first stage, if only unilateral, towards realisation, all the same, between my desire and the action that my request to be allowed to kiss her would have been, there was all the indefinite blank of hesitation, of timidity. Then I went into the pastrycook\u2019s bar, I drank, one after another, seven or eight glasses of port wine. At once, instead of the impassable gulf between my desire and action, the effect of the alcohol traced a line that joined them together. No longer was there any room for hesitation or fear. It seemed to me that the girl was about to fly into my arms. I went up to her, the words came spontaneously to my lips: \u201cI should like to go for a walk with you. You wouldn\u2019t care to go along the cliff, we shan\u2019t be disturbed behind the little wood that keeps the wind off the wooden bungalow that is empty just now?\u201d All the difficulties of life were smoothed away, there was no longer any obstacle to the conjunction of our two bodies. No obstacle for me, at least. For they had not been volatilised for her, who had not been drinking port wine. Had she done so, had the outer world lost some of its reality in her eyes, the long cherished dream that would then have appeared to her to be suddenly realisable might perhaps have been not at all that of falling into my arms\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only were the girls few in number but at this season which was not yet \u2018the season\u2019 they stayed but a short time. There is one I remember with a reddish skin, green eyes and a pair of ruddy cheeks, whose slight symmetrical face resembled the winged seeds of certain trees. I cannot say what breeze wafted her to Balbec or what other bore her away. So sudden was her removal that for some days afterwards I was haunted by a grief which I made bold to confess to Albertine when I realised that the girl had gone for ever\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should add that several of them were either girls whom I did not know at all or whom I had not seen for years. Often, before addressing them, I wrote to them. If their answer allowed me to believe in the possibility of love, what joy! We cannot, at the outset of our friendship with a woman, even if that friendship is destined to come to nothing, bear to part from those first letters that we have received from her. We like to have them beside us all the time, like a present of rare flowers, still quite fresh, at which we cease to gaze only to draw them closer to us and smell them. The sentence that we know by heart, it is pleasant to read again, and in those that we have committed less accurately to memory we like to verify the degree of affection in some expression. Did she write: \u2018Your dear letter\u2019? A slight marring of our bliss, which must be ascribed either to our having read too quickly, or to the illegible handwriting of our correspondent; she did not say: \u2018Your dear letter\u2019 but \u2018From your letter.\u2019 But the rest is so tender. Oh, that more such flowers may come to-morrow. Then that is no longer enough, we must with the written words compare the writer\u2019s eyes, her face. We make an appointment, and \u2014 without her having altered, perhaps \u2014 whereas we expected, from the description given us or our personal memory, to meet the fairy Viviane, we encounter Puss-in-Boots. We make an appointment, nevertheless, for the following day, for it is, after all, she, and the person we desired is she. And these desires for a woman of whom we have been dreaming do not make beauty of form and feature essential. These desires are only the desire for a certain person; vague as perfumes, as styrax was the desire of Prothyraia, saffron the ethereal desire, aromatic scents the desire of Hera, myrrh the perfume of the Magi, manna the desire of Nike, incense the perfume of the sea. But these perfumes that are sung in the Orphic hymns are far fewer in number than the deities they worship. Myrrh is the perfume of the Magi, but also of Protogonos, Neptune, Nereus, Leto; incense is the perfume of the sea, but also of the fair Dike, of Themis, of Circe, of the Nine Muses, of Eos, of Mnemosyne, of the Day, of Dikaiosyne. As for styrax, manna and aromatic scents, it would be impossible to name all the deities that inhale them, so many are they. Amphietes has all the perfumes except incense, and Gaia rejects only beans and aromatic scents. So was it with these desires for different girls that I felt. Fewer in number than the girls themselves, they changed into disappointments and regrets closely similar one to another. I never wished for myrrh. I reserved it for Jupien and for the Prince de Guermantes, for it is the desire of Protogonos \u201cof twofold sex, who roars like a bull, of countless orgies, memorable, unspeakable, descending, joyous, to the sacrifices of the Orgiophants.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But presently the season was in full swing; every day there was some fresh arrival, and for the sudden increase in the frequency of my outings, which took the place of the charmed perusal of the Thousand and One Nights, there was a reason devoid of pleasure which poisoned them all. The beach was now peopled with girls, and, since the idea suggested to me by Cottard had not indeed furnished me with fresh suspicions but had rendered me sensitive and weak in that quarter and careful not to let any suspicion take shape in my mind, as soon as a young woman arrived at Balbec, I began to feel ill at ease, I proposed to Albertine the most distant excursions, in order that she might not make the newcomer\u2019s acquaintance, and indeed, if possible, might not set eyes on her. I dreaded naturally even more those women whose dubious ways were remarked or their bad reputation already known; I tried to persuade my mistress that this bad reputation had no foundation, was a slander, perhaps, without admitting it to myself, from a fear, still unconscious, that she might seek to make friends with the depraved woman or regret her inability to do so, because of me, or might conclude from the number of examples that a vice so widespread was not to be condemned. In denying the guilt of each of them, my intention was nothing less than to pretend that sapphism did not exist. Albertine adopted my incredulity as to the viciousness of this one or that. \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s just a pose, she wants to look the part.\u201d But then, I regretted almost that I had pleaded the other\u2019s innocence, for it distressed me that Albertine, formerly so severe, could believe that this \u2018part\u2019 was a thing so flattering, so advantageous, that a woman innocent of such tastes could seek to \u2018look it.\u2019 I would have liked to be sure that no more women were coming to Balbec; I trembled when I thought that, as it was almost time for Mme. Putbus to arrive at the Verdurins\u2019, her maid, whose tastes Saint-Loup had not concealed from me, might take it into her head to come down to the beach, and, if it were a day on which I was not with Albertine, might seek to corrupt her. I went the length of asking myself whether, as Cottard had made no secret of the fact that the Verdurins thought highly of me and, while not wishing to appear, as he put it, to be running after me, would give a great deal to have me come to their house, I might not, on the strength of promises to bring all the Guermantes in existence to call on them in Paris, induce Mme. Verdurin, upon some pretext or other, to inform Mme. Putbus that it was impossible to keep her there any longer and make her leave the place at once. Notwithstanding these thoughts, and as it was chiefly the presence of Andr\u00e9e that was disturbing me, the soothing effect that Albertine\u2019s words had had upon me still to some extent persisted \u2014 I knew moreover that presently I should have less need of it, as Andr\u00e9e would be leaving the place with Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le just about the time when the crowd began to arrive and would be spending only a few weeks more with Albertine. During these weeks, moreover, Albertine seemed to have planned everything that she did, everything that she said, with a view to destroying my suspicions if any remained, or to prevent them from reviving. She contrived never to be left alone with Andr\u00e9e, and insisted, when we came back from an excursion, upon my accompanying her to her door, upon my coming to fetch her when we were going anywhere. Andr\u00e9e meanwhile took just as much trouble on her side, seemed to avoid meeting Albertine. And this apparent understanding between them was not the only indication that Albertine must have informed her friend of our conversation and have asked her to be so kind as to calm my absurd suspicions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About this time there occurred at the Grand Hotel a scandal which was not calculated to modify the intensity of my torment. Bloch\u2019s cousin had for some time past been indulging, with a retired actress, in secret relations which presently ceased to satisfy them. That they should be seen seemed to them to add perversity to their pleasure, they chose to flaunt their perilous sport before the eyes of all the world. They began with caresses, which might, after all, be set down to a friendly intimacy, in the card-room, by the baccarat-table. Then they grew more bold. And finally, one evening, in a corner that was not even dark of the big ball-room, on a sofa, they made no more attempt to conceal what they were doing than if they had been in bed. Two officers who happened to be near, with their wives, complained to the manager. It was thought for a moment that their protest would be effective. But they had this against them that, having come over for the evening from Netteholme, where they were staying, they could not be of any use to the manager. Whereas, without her knowing it even, and whatever remarks the manager may have made to her, there hovered over Mlle. Bloch the protection of M. Nissim Bernard. I must explain why. M. Nissim Bernard carried to their highest pitch the family virtues. Every year he took a magnificent villa at Balbec for his nephew, and no invitation would have dissuaded him from going home to dine at his own table, which was in reality theirs. But he never took his luncheon at home. Every day at noon he was at the Grand Hotel. The fact of the matter was that he was keeping, as other men keep a chorus-girl from the opera, an embryo waiter of much the same type as the pages of whom we have spoken, and who made us think of the young Israelites inEsther and Athalie. It is true that the forty years\u2019 difference in age between M. Nis-sim Bernard and the young waiter ought to have preserved the latter from a contact that was scarcely pleasant. But, as Racine so wisely observes in those same choruses:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Great God, with what uncertain tread\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A budding virtue \u2018mid such perils goes!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What stumbling-blocks do lie before a soul\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That seeks Thee and would fain be innocent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The young waiter might indeed have been brought up \u2018remote from the world\u2019 in the Temple-Caravanserai of Balbec, he had not followed the advice of Joad:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In riches and in gold put not thy trust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had perhaps justified himself by saying: \u201cThe wicked cover the earth.\u201d However that might be, and albeit M. Nissim Bernard had not expected so rapid a conquest, on the very first day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were\u2019t in alarm, or anxious to caress\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He felt those childish arms about him thrown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And by the second day, M. Nissim Bernard having taken the young waiter out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dire assault his innocence destroyed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From that moment the boy\u2019s life was altered. He might indeed carry bread and salt, as his superior bade him, his whole face sang:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From flowers to flowers, from joys to keener joys\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let our desires now range\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Uncertain is our tale of fleeting years\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Haste we then to enjoy this life!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Honours and fame are the reward\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of blind and meek obedience\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For moping innocence\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who now would raise his voice!\n\nSince that day, M. Nissim Bernard had never failed to come and occupy his seat at the luncheon-table (as a man would occupy his in the stalls who was keeping a dancer, a dancer in this case of a distinct and special type, which still awaits its Degas). It was M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s delight to follow over the floor of the restaurant and down the remote vista to where beneath her palm the cashier sat enthroned, the evolutions of the adolescent hurrying in service, in the service of everyone, and, less than anyone, of M. Nissim Bernard, now that the latter was keeping him, whether because the young chorister did not think it necessary to display the same friendliness to a person by whom he supposed himself to be sufficiently well loved, or because that love annoyed him or he feared lest, if discovered, it might make him lose other opportunities. But this very coldness pleased M. Nissim Bernard, because of all that it concealed; whether from Hebraic atavism or from profanation of the Christian spirit, he took a singular pleasure, were it Jewish or Catholic, in the Racinian ceremony. Had it been a real performance of Esther or Athalie, M. Bernard would have regretted that the gulf of centuries must prevent him from making the acquaintance of the author, Jean Racine, so that he might obtain for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 a more substantial part. But as the luncheon ceremony came from no author\u2019s pen, he contented himself with being on good terms with the manager and Aim\u00e9, so that the \u2018young Israelite\u2019 might be promoted to the coveted post of under-waiter, or even full waiter to a row of tables. The post of wine waiter had been offered him. But M. Bernard made him decline it, for he would no longer have been able to come every day to watch him race about the green dining-room and to be waited upon by him like a stranger. Now this pleasure was so keen that every year M. Bernard returned to Balbec and took his luncheon away from home, habits in which M. Bloch saw, in the former a poetical fancy for the bright sunshine, the sunsets of this coast favoured above all others, in the latter the inveterate mania of an old bachelor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact, the mistake made by M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s relatives, who never suspected the true reason for his annual return to Balbec and for what the pedantic Mme. Bloch called his absentee palate, was really a more profound and secondary truth. For M. Nissim Bernard himself was unaware how much there was of love for the beach at Balbec, for the view one enjoyed from the restaurant over the sea, and of maniacal habits in the fancy that he had for keeping, like a dancing girl of another kind which still lacks a Degas, one of his servants the rest of whom were still girls. And so M. Nissim Bernard maintained, with the director of this theatre which was the hotel at Balbec, and with the stage-manager and producer Aim\u00e9\u2014 whose part in all this affair was anything but simple \u2014 excellent relations. One day they would intrigue to procure an important part, a place perhaps as headwaiter. In the meantime M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s pleasure, poetical and calmly contemplative as it might be, reminded one a little of those women-loving men who always know \u2014 Swann, for example, in the past \u2014 that if they go out to a party they will meet their mistress. No sooner had M. Nissim Bernard taken his seat than he would see the object of his affections appear on the scene, bearing in his hand fruit or cigars upon a tray. And so every morning, after kissing his niece, bothering my friend Bloch about his work and feeding his horses with lumps of sugar from the palm of his outstretched hand, he would betray a feverish haste to arrive in time for luncheon at the Grand Hotel. Had the house been on fire, had his niece had a stroke, he would doubtless have started off just the same. So that he dreaded like the plague a cold that would confine him to his bed \u2014 for he was a hypochondriac \u2014 and would oblige him to ask Aim\u00e9 to send his young friend across to visit him at home, between luncheon and tea-time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He loved moreover all the labyrinth of corridors, private offices, reception-rooms, cloakrooms, larders, galleries which composed the hotel at Balbec. With a strain of oriental atavism he loved a seraglio, and when he went out at night might be seen furtively exploring its passages. While, venturing down to the basement and endeavouring at the same time to escape notice and to avoid a scandal, M. Nissim Bernard, in his quest of the young L\u00e9vites, put one in mind of those lines in La Juive:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O God of our Fathers, come down to us again\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our mysteries veil from the eyes of wicked men!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I on the contrary would go up to the room of two sisters who had come to Balbec, as her maids, with an old lady, a foreigner. They were what the language of hotels called \u2018couriers,\u2019 and that of Fran\u00e7oise, who imagined that a courier was a person who was there to run his course, two \u2018coursers.\u2019 The hotels have remained, more nobly, in the period when people sang: \u201cC\u2019est un courrier de cabinet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Difficult as it was for a visitor to penetrate to the servants\u2019 quarters, I had very soon formed a mutual bond of friendship, as strong as it was pure, with these two young persons, Mademoiselle Marie Gineste and Madame C\u00e9leste Albaret. Born at the foot of the high mountains in the centre of France, on the banks of rivulets and torrents (the water passed actually under their old home, turning a millwheel, and the house had often been damaged by floods), they seemed to embody the features of that region. Marie Gineste was more regularly rapid and abrupt, C\u00e9leste Albaret softer and more languishing, spread out like a lake, but with terrible boiling rages in which her fury suggested the peril of spates and gales that sweep everything before them. They often came in the morning to see me when I was still in bed. I have never known people so deliberately ignorant, who had learned absolutely nothing at school, and yet whose language was somehow so literary that, but for the almost savage naturalness of their tone, one would have thought their speech affected. With a familiarity which I reproduce verbatim, notwithstanding the praises (which I set down here in praise not of myself but of the strange genius of C\u00e9leste) and the criticisms, equally unfounded, in which her remarks seem to involve me, while I dipped crescent rolls in my milk, C\u00e9leste would say to me: \u201cOh! Little black devil with hair of jet, O profound wickedness! I don\u2019t know what your mother was thinking of when she made you, for you are just like a bird. Look, Marie, wouldn\u2019t you say he was preening his feathers, and turning his head right round, so light he looks, you would say he was just learning to fly. Ah! It\u2019s fortunate for you that those who bred you brought you into the world to rank and riches; what would ever have become of you, so wasteful as you are. Look at him throwing away his crescent because it touched the bed. There he goes, now, look, he\u2019s spilling his milk, wait till I tie a napkin round you, for you could never do it for yourself, never in my life have I seen anyone so helpless and so clumsy as you.\u201d I would then hear the more regular sound of the torrent of Marie Gineste who was furiously reprimanding her sister: \u201cWill you hold your tongue, now, C\u00e9leste. Are you mad, talking to Monsieur like that?\u201d C\u00e9leste merely smiled; and as I detested having a napkin tied round my neck: \u201cNo, Marie, look at him, bang, he\u2019s shot straight up on end like a serpent. A proper serpent, I tell you.\u201d These were but a few of her zoological similes, for, according to her, it was impossible to tell when I slept, I fluttered about all night like a butterfly, and in the day time I was as swift as the squirrels. \u201cYou know, Marie, the way we see them at home, so nimble that even with your eyes you can\u2019t follow them.\u201d \u201cBut, C\u00e9leste, you know he doesn\u2019t like having a napkin when he\u2019s eating.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s so that he can say nobody can make him do anything against his will. He\u2019s a grand gentleman and he wants to shew that he is. They can change the sheets ten times over, if they must, but he won\u2019t give way. Yesterday\u2019s had served their time, but to-day they have only just been put on the bed and they\u2019ll have to be changed already. Oh, I was right when I said that he was never meant to be born among the poor. Look, his hair\u2019s standing on end, swelling with rage like a bird\u2019s feathers. Poor ploumissou!\u201d Here it was not only Marie that protested, but myself, for I did not feel in the least like a grand gentleman. But C\u00e9leste would never believe in the sincerity of my modesty and cut me short. \u201cOh! The story-teller! Oh! The flatterer! Oh! The false one! The cunning rogue! Oh! Moli\u00e8re!\u201d (This was the only writer\u2019s name that she knew, but she applied it to me, meaning thereby a person who was capable both of writing plays and of acting them.) \u201cC\u00e9leste!\u201d came the imperious cry from Marie, who, not knowing the name of Moli\u00e8re, was afraid that it might be some fresh insult. C\u00e9leste continued to smile: \u201cThen you haven\u2019t seen the photograph of him in his drawer, when he was little. He tried to make us believe that he was always dressed quite simply. And there, with his little cane, he\u2019s all furs and laces, such as no Prince ever wore. But that\u2019s nothing compared with his tremendous majesty and kindness which is even more profound.\u201d \u201cSo then,\u201d scolded the torrent Marie, \u201cyou go rummaging in his drawers now, do you?\u201d To calm Marie\u2019s fears I asked her what she thought of M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s behaviour. . . . \u201cAh! Monsieur, there are things I wouldn\u2019t have believed could exist. One has to come here to learn.\u201d And, for once outrivalling C\u00e9leste by an even more profound observation: \u201cAh! You see, Monsieur, one can never tell what there may be in a person\u2019s life.\u201d To change the subject, I spoke to her of the life led by my father, who toiled night and day. \u201cAh! Monsieur, there are people who keep nothing of their life for themselves, not one minute, not one pleasure, the whole thing is a sacrifice for others, they are lives that are given away.\u201d \u201cLook, Marie, he has only to put his hand on the counterpane and take his crescent, what distinction. He can do the most insignificant things, you would say that the whole nobility of France, from here to the Pyrenees, was stirring in each of his movements.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overpowered by this portrait so far from lifelike, I remained silent; C\u00e9leste interpreted my silence as a further instance of guile: \u201cOh! Brow that looks so pure, and hides so many things, nice, cool cheeks like the inside of an almond, little hands of satin all velvety, nails like claws,\u201d and so forth. \u201cThere, Marie, look at him sipping his milk with a devoutness that makes me want to say my prayers. What a serious air! They ought really to take his portrait as he is just now. He\u2019s just like a child. Is it drinking milk, like them, that has kept you their bright colour? Oh! Youth! Oh! Lovely skin. You will never grow old. You are a lucky one, you will never need to raise your hand against anyone, for you have a pair of eyes that can make their will be done. Look at him now, he\u2019s angry. He shoots up, straight as a sign-post.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise did not at all approve of what she called the two \u2018tricksters\u2019 coming to talk to me like this. The manager, who made his staff keep watch over everything that went on, even gave me a serious warning that it was not proper for a visitor to talk to servants. I, who found the \u2018tricksters\u2019 far better than any visitor in the hotel, merely laughed in his face, convinced that he would not understand my explanations. And the sisters returned. \u201cLook, Marie, at his delicate lines. Oh, perfect miniature, finer than the most precious you could see in a glass case, for he can move, and utters words you could listen to for days and nights.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a miracle that a foreign lady could have brought them there, for, without knowing anything of history or geography, they heartily detested the English, the Germans, the Russians, the Italians, all foreign vermin, and cared, with certain exceptions, for French people alone. Their faces had so far preserved the moisture of the pliable clay of their native river beds, that, as soon as one mentioned a foreigner who was staying in the hotel, in order to repeat what he had said, C\u00e9leste and Marie imposed upon their faces his face, their mouths became his mouth, their eyes his eyes, one would have liked to preserve these admirable comic masks. C\u00e9leste indeed, while pretending merely to be repeating what the manager had said, or one of my friends, would insert in her little narrative fictitious remarks in which were maliciously portrayed all the defects of Bloch, the chief magistrate, etc., while apparently unconscious of doing so. It was, under the form of the delivery of a simple message which she had obligingly undertaken to convey, an inimitable portrait. They never read anything, not even a newspaper. One day, however, they found lying on my bed a book. It was a volume of the admirable but obscure poems of Saint-L\u00e9ger L\u00e9ger. C\u00e9leste read a few pages and said to me: \u201cBut are you quite sure that these are poetry, wouldn\u2019t they just be riddles?\u201d Obviously, to a person who had learned in her childhood a single poem: \u201cDown here the lilacs die,\u201d there was a gap in evolution. I fancy that their obstinate refusal to learn anything was due in part to the unhealthy climate of their early home. They had nevertheless all the gifts of a poet with more modesty than poets generally shew. For if C\u00e9leste had said something noteworthy and, unable to remember it correctly, I asked her to repeat it, she would assure me that she had forgotten. They will never read any books, but neither will they ever write any\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise was considerably impressed when she learned that the two brothers of these humble women had married, one the niece of the Archbishop of Tours, the other a relative of the Bishop of Rodez. To the manager, this would have conveyed nothing. C\u00e9leste would sometimes reproach her husband with his failure to understand her, and as for me, I was astonished that he could endure her. For at certain moments, raging, furious, destroying everything, she was detestable. It is said that the salt liquid which is our blood is only an internal survival of the primitive marine element. Similarly, I believe that C\u00e9leste, not only in her bursts of fury, but also in her hours of depression preserved the rhythm of her native streams. When she was exhausted, it was after their fashion; she had literally run dry. Nothing could then have revived her. Then all of a sudden the circulation was restored in her large body, splendid and light. The water flowed in the opaline transparence of her bluish skin. She smiled at the sun and became bluer still. At such moments she was truly celestial\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch\u2019s family might never have suspected the reason which made their uncle never take his luncheon at home and have accepted it from the first as the mania of an elderly bachelor, due perhaps to the demands of his intimacy with some actress; everything that concerned M. Nissim Bernard was tabu to the manager of the Balbec hotel. And that was why, without even referring to the uncle, he had finally not ventured to find fault with the niece, albeit recommending her to be a little more circumspect. And so the girl and her friend who, for some days, had pictured themselves as excluded from the casino and the Grand Hotel, seeing that everything was settled, were delighted to shew those fathers of families who held aloof from them that they might with impunity take the utmost liberties. No doubt they did not go so far as to repeat the public exhibition which had revolted everybody. But gradually they returned to their old ways. And one evening as I came out of the casino which was half in darkness with Albertine and Bloch whom we had met there, they came towards us, linked together, kissing each other incessantly, and, as they passed us, crowed and laughed, uttering indecent cries. Bloch lowered his eyes, so as to seem not to have recognised his cousin, and as for myself I was tortured by the thought that this occult, appalling language was addressed perhaps to Albertine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another incident turned my thoughts even more in the direction of Gomorrah. I had noticed upon the beach a handsome young woman, erect and pale, whose eyes, round their centre, scattered rays so geometrically luminous that one was reminded, on meeting her gaze, of some constellation. I thought how much more beautiful this girl was than Albertine, and that it would be wiser to give up the other. Only, the face of this beautiful young woman had been smoothed by the invisible plane of an utterly low life, of the constant acceptance of vulgar expedients, so much so that her eyes, more noble however than the rest of her face, could radiate nothing but appetites and desires. Well, on the following day, this young woman being seated a long way away from us in the casino, I saw that she never ceased to fasten upon Albertine the alternate, circling fires of her gaze. One would have said that she was making signals to her from a lighthouse. I dreaded my friend\u2019s seeing that she was being so closely observed, I was afraid that these incessantly rekindled glances might have the conventional meaning of an amorous assignation for the morrow. For all I knew, this assignation might not be the first. The young woman with the radiant eyes might have come another year to Balbec. It was perhaps because Albertine had already yielded to her desires, or to those of a friend, that this woman allowed herself to address to her those flashing signals. If so, they did more than demand something for the present, they found a justification in pleasant hours in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This assignation, in that case, must be not the first, but the sequel to adventures shared in past years. And indeed her glance did not say: \u201cWill you?\u201d As soon as the young woman had caught sight of Albertine, she had turned her head and beamed upon her glances charged with recollection, as though she were terribly afraid that my friend might not remember. Albertine, who could see her plainly, remained phlegmatically motionless, with the result that the other, with the same sort of discretion as a man who sees his old mistress with a new lover, ceased to look at her and paid no more attention to her than if she had not existed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, a day or two later, I received a proof of this young woman\u2019s tendencies, and also of the probability of her having known Albertine in the past. Often, in the hall of the casino, when two girls were smitten with mutual desire, a luminous phenomenon occurred, a sort of phosphorescent train passing from one to the other. Let us note in passing that it is by the aid of such materialisations, even if they be imponderable, by these astral signs that set fire to a whole section of the atmosphere, that the scattered Gomorrah tends, in every town, in every village, to reunite its separated members, to reform the biblical city while everywhere the same efforts are being made, be it in view of but a momentary reconstruction, by the nostalgic, the hypocritical, sometimes by the courageous exiles from Sodom\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once I saw the stranger whom Albertine had appeared not to recognise, just at the moment when Bloch\u2019s cousin was approaching her. The young woman\u2019s eyes flashed, but it was quite evident that she did not know the Israelite maiden. She beheld her for the first time, felt a desire, a shadow of doubt, by no means the same certainty as in the case of Albertine, Albertine upon whose comradeship she must so far have reckoned that, in the face of her coldness, she had felt the surprise of a foreigner familiar with Paris but not resident there, who, having returned to spend a few weeks there, on the site of the little theatre where he was in the habit of spending pleasant evenings, sees that they have now built a bank\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch\u2019s cousin went and sat down at a table where she turned the pages of a magazine. Presently the young woman came and sat down, with an abstracted air, by her side. But under the table one could presently see their feet wriggling, then their legs and hands, in a confused heap. Words followed, a conversation began, and the young woman\u2019s innocent husband, who had been looking everywhere for her, was astonished to find her making plans for that very evening with a girl whom he did not know. His wife introduced Bloch\u2019s cousin to him as a friend of her childhood, by an inaudible name, for she had forgotten to ask her what her name was. But the husband\u2019s presence made their intimacy advance a stage farther, for they addressed each other as tu, having known each other at their convent, an incident at which they laughed heartily later on, as well as at the hoodwinked husband, with a gaiety which afforded them an excuse for more caresses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for Albertine, I cannot say that anywhere in the casino or on the beach was her behaviour with any girl unduly free. I found in it indeed an excess of coldness and indifference which seemed to be more than good breeding, to be a ruse planned to avert suspicion. When questioned by some girl, she had a quick, icy, decent way of replying in a very loud voice: \u201cYes, I shall be going to the tennis court about five. I shall bathe to-morrow morning about eight,\u201d and of at once turning away from the person to whom she had said this \u2014 all of which had a horrible appearance of being meant to put people off the scent, and either to make an assignation, or, the assignation already made in a whisper, to utter this speech, harmless enough in itself, aloud, so as not to attract attention. And when later on I saw her mount her bicycle and scorch away into the distance, I could not help thinking that she was hurrying to overtake the girl to whom she had barely spoken\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only, when some handsome young woman stepped out of a motor-car at the end of the beach, Albertine could not help turning round. And she at once explained: \u201cI was looking at the new flag they\u2019ve put up over the bathing place. The old one was pretty moth-eaten. But I really think this one is mouldier still.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On one occasion Albertine was not content with cold indifference, and this made me all the more wretched. She knew that I was annoyed by the possibility of her sometimes meeting a friend of her aunt, who had a \u2018bad style\u2019 and came now and again to spend a few days with Mme. Bontemps. Albertine had pleased me by telling me that she would not speak to her again. And when this woman came to Incarville, Albertine said: \u201cBy the way, you know she\u2019s here. Have they told you?\u201d as though to shew me that she was not seeing her in secret. One day, when she told me this, she added: \u201cYes, I ran into her on the beach, and knocked against her as I passed, on purpose, to be rude to her.\u201d When Albertine told me this, there came back to my mind a remark made by Mme. Bontemps, to which I had never given a second thought, when she had said to Mme. Swann in my presence how brazen her niece Albertine was, as though that were a merit, and told her how Albertine had reminded some official\u2019s wife that her father had been employed in a kitchen. But a thing said by her whom we love does not long retain its purity; it withers, it decays. An evening or two later, I thought again of Albertine\u2019s remark, and it was no longer the ill breeding of which she was so proud \u2014 and which could only make me smile \u2014 that it seemed to me to signify, it was something else, to wit that Albertine, perhaps even without any definite object, to irritate this woman\u2019s senses, or wantonly to remind her of former proposals, accepted perhaps in the past, had swiftly brushed against her, thought that I had perhaps heard of this as it had been done in public, and had wished to forestall an unfavourable interpretation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the jealousy that was caused me by the women whom Albertine perhaps loved was abruptly to cease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were waiting, Albertine and I, at the Balbec station of the little local railway. We had driven there in the hotel omnibus, because it was raining. Not far away from us was M. Nissim Bernard, with a black eye. He had recently forsaken the chorister from Athalie for the waiter at a much frequented farmhouse in the neighbourhood, known as the \u2018Cherry Orchard.\u2019 This rubicund youth, with his blunt features, appeared for all the world to have a tomato instead of a head. A tomato exactly similar served as head to his twin brother. To the detached observer there is this attraction about these perfect resemblances between pairs of twins, that nature, becoming for the moment industrialised, seems to be offering a pattern for sale. Unfortunately M. Nissim Bernard looked at it from another point of view, and this resemblance was only external. Tomato II shewed a frenzied zeal in furnishing the pleasures exclusively of ladies, Tomato I did not mind condescending to meet the wishes of certain gentlemen. Now on each occasion when, stirred, as though by a reflex action, by the memory of pleasant hours spent with Tomato I, M. Bernard presented himself at the Cherry Orchard, being short-sighted (not that one need be short-sighted to mistake them), the old Israelite, unconsciously playing Amphitryon, would accost the twin brother with: \u201cWill you meet me somewhere this evening?\u201d He at once received a resounding smack in the face. It might even be repeated in the course of a single meal, when he continued with the second brother the conversation he had begun with the first. In the end this treatment so disgusted him, by association of ideas, with tomatoes, even of the edible variety, that whenever he heard a newcomer order that vegetable, at the next table to his own, in the Grand Hotel, he would murmur to him: \u201cYou must excuse me, Sir, for addressing you, without an introduction. But I heard you order tomatoes. They are stale to-day. I tell you in your own interest, for it makes no difference to me, I never touch them myself.\u201d The stranger would reply with effusive thanks to this philanthropic and disinterested neighbour, call back the waiter, pretend to have changed his mind: \u201cNo, on second thoughts, certainly not, no tomatoes.\u201d Aim\u00e9, who had seen it all before, would laugh to himself, and think: \u201cHe\u2019s an old rascal, that Monsieur Bernard, he\u2019s gone and made another of them change his order.\u201d M. Bernard, as he waited for the already overdue tram, shewed no eagerness to speak to Albertine and myself, because of his black eye. We were even less eager to speak to him. It would however have been almost inevitable if, at that moment, a bicycle had not come dashing towards us; the lift-boy sprang from its saddle, breathless. Madame Verdurin had telephoned shortly after we left the hotel, to know whether I would dine with her two days later; we shall see presently why. Then, having given me the message in detail, the lift-boy left us, and, being one of these democratic \u2018employees\u2019 who affect independence with regard to the middle classes, and among themselves restore the principle of authority, explained: \u201cI must be off, because of my chiefs.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine\u2019s girl friends had gone, and would be away for some time. I was anxious to provide her with distractions. Even supposing that she might have found some happiness in spending the afternoons with no company but my own, at Balbec, I knew that such happiness is never complete, and that Albertine, being still at the age (which some of us never outgrow) when we have not yet discovered that this imperfection resides in the person who receives the happiness and not in the person who gives it, might have been tempted to put her disappointment down to myself. I preferred that she should impute it to circumstances which, arranged by myself, would not give us an opportunity of being alone together, while at the same time preventing her from remaining in the casino and on the beach without me. And so I had asked her that day to come with me to Donci\u00e8res, where I was going to meet Saint-Loup. With a similar hope of occupying her mind, I advised her to take up painting, in which she had had lessons in the past. While working she would not ask herself whether she was happy or unhappy. I would gladly have taken her also to dine now and again with the Verdurins and the Cambremers, who certainly would have been delighted to see any friend introduced by myself, but I must first make certain that Mme. Putbus was not yet at la Raspeli\u00e8re. It was only by going there in person that I could make sure of this, and, as I knew beforehand that on the next day but one Albertine would be going on a visit with her aunt, I had seized this opportunity to send Mme. Verdurin a telegram asking her whether she would be at home upon Wednesday. If Mme. Putbus was there, I would manage to see her maid, ascertain whether there was any danger of her coming to Balbec, and if so find out when, so as to take Albertine out of reach on the day. The little local railway, making a loop which did not exist at the time when I had taken it with my grandmother, now extended to Donci\u00e8res-la-Goupil, a big station at which important trains stopped, among them the express by which I had come down to visit Saint-Loup, from Paris, and the corresponding express by which I had returned. And, because of the bad weather, the omnibus from the Grand Hotel took Albertine and myself to the station of the little tram, Balbec-Plage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The little train had not yet arrived, but one could see, lazy and slow, the plume of smoke that it had left in its wake, which, confined now to its own power of locomotion as an almost stationary cloud, was slowly mounting the green slope of the cliff of Criquetot. Finally the little tram, which it had preceded by taking a vertical course, arrived in its turn, at a leisurely crawl. The passengers who were waiting to board it stepped back to make way for it, but without hurrying, knowing that they were dealing with a good-natured, almost human traveller, who, guided like the bicycle of a beginner, by the obliging signals of the station-master, in the strong hands of the engine-driver, was in no danger of running over anybody, and would come to a halt at the proper place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My telegram explained the Verdurins\u2019 telephone message and had been all the more opportune since Wednesday (the day I had fixed happened to be a Wednesday) was the day set apart for dinner-parties by Mme. Verdurin, at la Raspeli\u00e8re, as in Paris, a fact of which I was unaware. Mme. Verdurin did not give \u2018dinners,\u2019 but she had \u2018Wednesdays.\u2019 These Wednesdays were works of art. While fully conscious that they had not their match anywhere, Mme. Verdurin introduced shades of distinction between them. \u201cLast Wednesday was not as good as the one before,\u201d she would say. \u201cBut I believe the next will be one of the best I have ever given.\u201d Sometimes she went so far as to admit: \u201cThis Wednesday was not worthy of the others. But I have a big surprise for you next week.\u201d In the closing weeks of the Paris season, before leaving for the country, the Mistress would announce the end of the Wednesdays. It gave her an opportunity to stimulate the faithful. \u201cThere are only three more Wednesdays left, there are only two more,\u201d she would say, in the same tone as though the world were coming to an end. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to miss next Wednesday, for the finale.\u201d But this finale was a sham, for she would announce: \u201cOfficially, there will be no more Wednesdays. To-day was the last for this year. But I shall be at home all the same on Wednesday. We shall have a little Wednesday to ourselves; I dare say these little private Wednesdays will be the nicest of all.\u201d At la Raspeli\u00e8re, the Wednesdays were of necessity restricted, and since, if they had discovered a friend who was passing that way, they would invite him for one or another evening, almost every day of the week became a Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t remember all the guests, but I know there\u2019s Madame la Marquise de Camembert,\u201d the liftboy had told me; his memory of our discussion of the name Cambremer had not succeeded in definitely supplanting that of the old world, whose syllables, familiar and full of meaning, came to the young employee\u2019s rescue when he was embarrassed by this difficult name, and were immediately preferred and readopted by him, not by any means from laziness or as an old and ineradicable usage, but because of the need for logic and clarity which they satisfied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hastened in search of an empty carriage in which I could hold Alber-tine in my arms throughout the journey. Having failed to find one, we got into a compartment in which there was already installed a lady with a massive face, old and ugly, with a masculine expression, very much in her Sunday best, who was reading the Revue des Deux Mondes. Notwithstanding her commonness, she was eclectic in her tastes, and I found amusement in asking myself to what social category she could belong; I at once concluded that she must be the manager of some large brothel, a procuress on holiday. Her face, her manner, proclaimed the fact aloud. Only, I had never yet supposed that such ladies read the Revue des Deux Mondes. Albertine drew my attention to her with a wink and a smile. The lady wore an air of extreme dignity; and as I, for my part, bore within me the consciousness that I was invited, two days later, to the terminal point of the little railway, by the famous Mme. Verdurin, that at an intermediate station I was awaited by Robert de Saint-Loup, and that a little farther on I had it in my power to give great pleasure to Mme. de Cambremer, by going to stay at F\u00e9terne, my eyes sparkled with irony as I studied this self-important lady who seemed to think that, because of her elaborate attire, the feathers in her hat, her Revue des Deux Mondes, she was a more considerable personage than myself. I hoped that the lady would not remain in the train much longer than M. Nissim Bernard, and that she would alight at least at Toutainville, but no. The train stopped at Evreville, she remained seated. Similarly at Montmartin-sur-Mer, at Parville-la-Bingard, at Incarville, so that in despair, when the train had left Saint-Frichoux, which was the last station before Donci\u00e8res, I began to embrace Albertine without bothering about the lady. At Donci\u00e8res, Saint-Loup had come to meet me at the station, with the greatest difficulty, he told me, for, as he was staying with his aunt, my telegram had only just reached him and he could not, having been unable to make any arrangements beforehand, spare me more than an hour of his time. This hour seemed to me, alas, far too long, for as soon as we had left the train Albertine devoted her whole attention to Saint-Loup. She never talked to me, barely answered me if I addressed her, repulsed me when I approached her. With Robert, on the other hand, she laughed her provoking laugh, talked to him volubly, played with the dog he had brought with him, and, as she excited the animal, deliberately rubbed against its master. I remembered that, on the day when Albertine had allowed me to kiss her for the first time, I had had a smile of gratitude for the unknown seducer who had wrought so profound a change in her and had so far simplified my task. I thought of him now with horror. Robert must have noticed that I was not unconcerned about Albertine, for he offered no response to her provocations, which made her extremely annoyed with myself; then he spoke to me as though I had been alone, which, when she realised it, raised me again in her esteem. Robert asked me if I would not like to meet those of his friends with whom he used to make me dine every evening at Donci\u00e8res, when I was staying there, who were still in the garrison. And as he himself adopted that irritating manner which he rebuked in others: \u201cWhat is the good of your having worked so hard to charm them if you don\u2019t want to see them again?\u201d I declined his offer, for I did not wish to run any risk of being parted from Albertine, but also because now I was detached from them. From them, which is to say from myself. We passionately long that there may be another life in which we shall be similar to what we are here below. But we do not pause to reflect that, even without waiting for that other life, in this life, after a few years we are unfaithful to what we have been, to what we wished to remain immortally. Even without supposing that death is to alter us more completely than the changes that occur in the course of a lifetime, if in that other life we were to encounter the self that we have been, we should turn away from ourselves as from those people with whom we were once on friendly terms but whom we have not seen for years \u2014 such as Saint-Loup\u2019s friends whom I used so much to enjoy meeting again every evening at the Faisan Dor\u00e9, and whose conversation would now have seemed to me merely a boring importunity. In this respect, and because I preferred not to go there in search of what had pleased me there in the past, a stroll through Donci\u00e8res. might have seemed to me a pr\u00e9figuration of an arrival in Paradise. We dream much of Paradise, or rather of a number of successive Paradises, but each of them is, long before we die, a Paradise lost, in which we should feel ourselves lost also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He left us at the station. \u201cBut you may have about an hour to wait,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf you spend it here, you will probably see my uncle Charlus, who is going by the train to Paris, ten minutes before yours. I have said good-bye to him already, because I have to go back before his train starts. I didn\u2019t tell him about you, because I hadn\u2019t got your telegram.\u201d To the reproaches which I heaped upon Albertine when Saint-Loup had left us, she replied that she had intended, by her coldness towards me, to destroy any idea that he might have formed if, at the moment when the train stopped, he had seen me leaning against her with my arm round her waist. He had indeed noticed this attitude (I had not caught sight of him, otherwise I should have adopted one that was more correct), and had had time to murmur in my ear: \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is, one of those priggish little girls you told me about, who wouldn\u2019t go near Mlle. de Stermaria because they thought her fast?\u201d I had indeed mentioned to Robert, and in all sincerity, when I went down from Paris to visit him at Donci\u00e8res, and when we were talking about our time at Balbec, that there was nothing to be had from Albertine, that she was the embodiment of virtue. And now that I had long since discovered for myself that this was false, I was even more anxious that Robert should believe it to be true. It would have been sufficient for me to tell Robert that I was in love with Albertine. He was one of those people who are capable of denying themselves a pleasure to spare their friend sufferings which they would feel even more keenly if they themselves were the victims. \u201cYes, she is still rather childish. But you don\u2019t know anything against her?\u201d I added anxiously. \u201cNothing, except that I saw you clinging together like a pair of lovers.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYour attitude destroyed absolutely nothing,\u201d I told Albertine when Saint-Loup had left us. \u201cQuite true,\u201d she said to me, \u201cit was stupid of me, I hurt your feelings, I\u2019m far more unhappy about it than you are. You\u2019ll see, I shall never be like that again; forgive me,\u201d she pleaded, holding out her hand with a sorrowful air. At that moment, from the entrance to the waiting-room in which we were sitting, I saw advance slowly, followed at a respectful distance by a porter loaded with his baggage, M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Paris, where I encountered him only in evening dress, immobile, straitlaced in a black coat, maintained in a vertical posture by his proud aloofness, his thirst for admiration, the soar of his conversation, I had never realised how far he had aged. Now, in a light travelling suit which made him appear stouter, as he swaggered through the room, balancing a pursy stomach and an almost symbolical behind, the cruel light of day broke up into paint, upon his lips, rice-powder fixed by cold cream, on the tip of his nose, black upon his dyed moustaches whose ebon tint formed a contrast to his grizzled hair, all that by artificial light had seemed the animated colouring of a man who was still young\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I stood talking to him, though briefly, because of his train, I kept my eye on Albertine\u2019s carriage to shew her that I was coming. When I turned my head towards M. de Charlus, he asked nie to be so kind as to summon a soldier, a relative of his, who was standing on the other side of the platform, as though he were waiting to take our train, but in the opposite direction, away from Balbec. \u201cHe is in his regimental band,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cAs you are so fortunate as to be still young enough, and I unfortunately am old enough for you to save me the trouble of going across to him.\u201d I took it upon myself to go across to the soldier he pointed out to me, and saw from the lyres embroidered on his collar that he was a bandsman. But, just as I was preparing to execute my commission, what was my surprise, and, I may say, my pleasure, on recognising Morel, the son of my uncle\u2019s valet, who recalled to me so many memories. They made me forget to convey M. de Charlus\u2019s message. \u201cWhat, you are at Donci\u00e8res?\u201d \u201cYes, and they\u2019ve put me in the band attached to the batteries.\u201d But he made this answer in a dry and haughty tone. He had become an intense \u2018poseur,\u2019 and evidently the sight of myself, reminding him of his father\u2019s profession, was not pleasing to him. Suddenly I saw M. de Charlus descending upon us. My delay had evidently taxed his patience. \u201cI should like to listen to a little music this evening,\u201d he said to Morel without any preliminaries, \u201cI pay five hundred francs for the evening, which may perhaps be of interest to one of your friends, if you have any in the band.\u201d Knowing as I did the insolence of M. de Charlus, I was astonished at his not even saying how d\u2019ye do to his young friend. The Baron did not however give me time to think. Holding out his hand in the friendliest manner: \u201cGood-bye, my dear fellow,\u201d he said, as a hint that I might now leave them. I had, as it happened, left my dear Albertine too long alone. \u201cD\u2019you know,\u201d I said to her as I climbed into the carriage, \u201clife by the sea-side and travelling make me realise that the theatre of the world is stocked with fewer settings than actors, and with fewer actors than situations.\u201d \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d \u201cBecause M. de Charlus asked me just now to fetch one of his friends, whom, this instant, on the platform of this station, I have just discovered to be one of my own.\u201d But as I uttered these words, I began to wonder how the Baron could have bridged the social gulf to which I had not given a thought. It occurred to me first of all that it might be through Jupien, whose niece, as the reader may remember, had seemed to shew a preference for the violinist. What did baffle me completely was that, when due to leave for Paris in five minutes, the Baron should have asked for a musical evening. But, visualising Jupien\u2019s niece again in my memory, I was beginning to find that \u2018recognitions\u2019 did indeed play an important part in life, when all of a sudden the truth flashed across my mind and I realised that I had been absurdly innocent. M. de Charlus had never in his life set eyes upon Morel, nor Morel upon M. de Charlus, who, dazzled but also terrified by a warrior, albeit he bore no weapon but a lyre, had called upon me in his emotion to bring him the person whom he never suspected that I already knew. In any case, the offer of five hundred francs must have made up to Morel for the absence of any previous relations, for I saw that they continued to talk, without reflecting that they were standing close beside our tram. As I recalled the manner in which M. de Charlus had come up to Morel and myself, I saw at once the resemblance to certain of his relatives, when they picked up a woman in the street. Only the desired object had changed its sex. After a certain age, and even if different evolutions are occurring in us, the more we become ourselves, the more our characteristic features are accentuated. For Nature, while harmoniously contributing the design of her tapestry, breaks the monotony of the composition thanks to the variety of the intercepted forms. Besides, the arrogance with which M. de Charlus had accosted the violinist is relative, and depends upon the point of view one adopts. It would have been recognised by three out of four of the men in society who nodded their heads to him, not by the prefect of police who, a few years later, was to keep him under observation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Paris train is signalled, Sir,\u201d said the porter who was carrying his luggage. \u201cBut I am not going by the train, put it in the cloakroom, damn you!\u201d said M. de Charlus, as he gave twenty francs to the porter, astonished by the change of plan and charmed by the tip. This generosity at once attracted a flower-seller. \u201cBuy these carnations, look, this lovely rose, kind gentlemen, it will bring you luck.\u201d M. de Charlus, out of patience, handed her a couple of francs, in exchange for which the woman gave him her blessing, and her flowers as well. \u201cGood God, why can\u2019t she leave us alone,\u201d said M. de Charlus, addressing himself in an ironical and complaining tone, as of a man distraught, to Morel, to whom he found a certain comfort in appealing. \u201cWe\u2019ve quite enough to talk about as it is.\u201d Perhaps the porter was not yet out of earshot, perhaps M. de Charlus did not care to have too numerous an audience, perhaps these incidental remarks enabled his lofty timidity not to approach too directly the request for an assignation. The musician, turning with a frank, imperative and decided air to the flower-seller, raised a hand which repulsed her and indicated to her that they did not want her flowers and that she was to get out of their way as quickly as possible. M. de Charlus observed with ecstasy this authoritative, virile gesture, made by the graceful hand for which it ought still to have been too weighty, too massively brutal, with a precocious firmness and suppleness which gave to this still beardless adolescent the air of a young David capable of waging war against Goliath. The Baron\u2019s admiration was unconsciously blended with the smile with which we observe in a child an expression of gravity beyond his years. \u201cThis is a person whom I should like to accompany me on my travels and help me in my business. How he would simplify my life,\u201d M. de Charlus said to himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The train for Paris (which M. de Charlus did not take) started. Then we took our seats in our own train, Albertine and I, without my knowing what had become of M. de Charlus and Morel. \u201cWe must never quarrel any more, I beg your pardon again,\u201d Albertine repeated, alluding to the Saint-Loup incident. \u201cWe must always be nice to each other,\u201d she said tenderly. \u201cAs for your friend Saint-Loup, if you think that I am the least bit interested in him, you are quite mistaken. All that I like about him is that he seems so very fond of you.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a very good fellow,\u201d I said, taking care not to supply Robert with those imaginary excellences which I should not have failed to invent, out of friendship for himself, had I been with anybody but Albertine. \u201cHe\u2019s an excellent creature, frank, devoted, loyal, a person you can rely on to do anything.\u201d In saying this I confined myself, held in check by my jealousy, to telling the truth about Saint-Loup, but what I said was literally true. It found expression in precisely the same terms that Mme. de Villeparisis had employed in speaking to me of him, when I did not yet know him, imagined him to be so different, so proud, and said to myself: \u201cPeople think him good because he is a great gentleman.\u201d Just as when she had said to me: \u201cHe would be so pleased,\u201d I imagined, after seeing him outside the hotel, preparing to drive away, that his aunt\u2019s speech had been a mere social banality, intended to natter me. And I had realised afterwards that she had said what she did sincerely, thinking of the things that interested me, of my reading, and because she knew that that was what Saint-Loup liked, as it was to be my turn to say sincerely to somebody who was writing a history of his ancestor La Rochefoucauld, the author of the Maximes, who wished to consult Robert about him: \u201cHe will be so pleased.\u201d It was simply that I had learned to know him. But, when I set eyes on him for the first time, I had not supposed that an intelligence akin to my own could be enveloped in so much outward elegance of dress and attitude. By his feathers I had judged him to be a bird of another species. It was Albertine now who, perhaps a little because Saint-Loup, in his kindness to myself, had been so cold to her, said to me what I had already thought: \u201cAh! He is as devoted as all that! I notice that people always find all the virtues in other people, when they belong to the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\u201d Now that Saint-Loup belonged to the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a thing of which I had never once thought in the course of all these years in which, stripping himself of his prestige, he had displayed to me his virtues. A change in our perspective in looking at other people, more striking already in friendship than in merely social relations, but how much more striking still in love, where desire on so vast a scale increases to such proportions the slightest signs of coolness, that far less than the coolness Saint-Loup had shewn me in the beginning had been enough to make me suppose at first that Albertine scorned me, imagine her friends to be creatures marvellously inhuman, and ascribe merely to the indulgence that people feel for beauty and for a certain elegance, Elstir\u2019s judgment when he said to me of the little band, with just the same sentiment as Mme. de Villeparisis speaking of Saint-Loup: \u201cThey are good girls.\u201d But this was not the opinion that I would instinctively have formed when I heard Albertine say: \u201cIn any case, whether he\u2019s devoted or not, I sincerely hope I shall never see him again, since he\u2019s made us quarrel. We must never quarrel again. It isn\u2019t nice.\u201d I felt, since she had seemed to desire Saint-Loup, almost cured for the time being of the idea that she cared for women, which I had supposed to be incurable. And, faced by Albertine\u2019s mackintosh in which she seemed to have become another person, the tireless vagrant of rainy days, and which, close-fitting, malleable and grey, seemed at that moment not so much intended to protect her garments from the rain as to have been soaked by her and to be clinging to my mistress\u2019s body as though to take the imprint of her form for a sculptor, I tore apart that tunic which jealously espoused a longed-for bosom and, drawing Albertine towards me: \u201cBut won\u2019t you, indolent traveller, dream upon my shoulder, resting your brow upon it?\u201d I said, taking her head in my hands, and shewing her the wide meadows, flooded and silent, which extended in the gathering dusk to the horizon closed by the parallel openings of valleys far and blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two days later, on the famous Wednesday, in that same little train, which I had again taken, at Balbec, to go and dine at la Raspeli\u00e8re, I was taking care not to miss Cottard at Graincourt-Saint-Vast, where a second telephone message from Mme. Verdurin had told me that I should find him. He was to join my train and would tell me where we had to get out to pick up the carriages that would be sent from la Raspeli\u00e8re to the station. And so, as the little train barely stopped for a moment at Graincourt, the first station after Donci\u00e8res, I was standing in readiness at the open window, so afraid was I of not seeing Cottard or of his not seeing me. Vain fears! I had not realised to what an extent the little clan had moulded all its regular members after the same type, so that they, being moreover in full evening dress, as they stood waiting upon the platform, let themselves be recognised immediately by a certain air of assurance, fashion and familiarity, by a look in their eyes which seemed to sweep, like an empty space in which there was nothing to arrest their attention, the serried ranks of the common herd, watched for the arrival of some fellow-member who had taken the train at an earlier station, and sparkled in anticipation of the talk that was to come. This sign of election, with which the habit of dining together had marked the members of the little group, was not all that distinguished them; when numerous, in full strength, they were massed together, forming a more brilliant patch in the midst of the troop of passengers \u2014 what Brichot called the pecus \u2014 upon whose dull countenances could be read no conception of what was meant by the name Verdurin, no hope of ever dining at la Raspeli\u00e8re. To be sure, these common travellers would have been less interested than myself had anyone quoted in their hearing \u2014 notwithstanding the notoriety that several of them had achieved \u2014 the names of those of the faithful whom I was astonished to see continuing to dine out, when many of them had already been doing so, according to the stories that I had heard, before my birth, at a period at once so distant and so vague that I was inclined to exaggerate its remoteness. The contrast between the continuance not only of their existence, but of the fulness of their powers, and the annihilation of so many friends whom I had already seen, in one place or another, pass away, gave me the same sentiment that we feel when in the stop-press column of the newspapers we read the very announcement that we least expected, for instance that of an untimely death, which seems to us fortuitous because the causes that have led up to it have remained outside our knowledge. This is the feeling that death does not descend upon all men alike, but that a more oncoming wave of its tragic tide carries off a life placed at the same level as others which the waves that follow will long continue to spare. We shall see later on that the diversity of the forms of death that circulate invisibly is the cause of the peculiar unexpectedness presented, in the newspapers, by their obituary notices. Then I saw that, with the passage of time, not only do the real talents that may coexist with the most commonplace conversation reveal and impose themselves, but furthermore that mediocre persons arrive at those exalted positions, attached in the imagination of our childhood to certain famous elders, when it never occurred to us that, after a certain number of years, their disciples, become masters, would be famous also, and would inspire the respect and awe that once they felt. But if the names of the faithful were unknown to the pecus, their aspect still singled them out in its eyes. Indeed in the train (when the coincidence of what one or another of them might have been doing during the day, assembled them all together), having to collect at a subsequent station only an isolated member, the carriage in which they were gathered, ticketed with the elbow of the sculptor Ski, flagged with Cottard\u2019s Temps, stood out in the distance like a special saloon, and rallied at the appointed station the tardy comrade. The only one who might, because of his semi-blindness, have missed these welcoming signals, was Brichot. But one of the party would always volunteer to keep a look-out for the blind man, and, as soon as his straw hat, his green umbrella and blue spectacles caught the eye, he would be gently but hastily guided towards the chosen compartment. So that it was inconceivable that one of the faithful, without exciting the gravest suspicions of his being \u2018on the loose,\u2019 or even of his not having come \u2018by the train,\u2019 should not pick up the others in the course of the journey. Sometimes the opposite process occurred: one of the faithful had been obliged to go some distance down the line during the afternoon and was obliged in consequence to make part of the journey alone before being joined by the group; but even when thus isolated, alone of his kind, he did not fail as a rule to produce a certain effect. The Future towards which he was travelling marked him out to the person on the seat opposite, who would say to himself: \u201cThat must be somebody,\u201d would discern, round the soft hat of Cottard or of the sculptor Ski, a vague aureole and would be only half-astonished when at the next station an elegant crowd, if it were their terminal point, greeted the faithful one at the carriage door and escorted him to one of the waiting carriages, all of them reverently saluted by the factotum of Douville station, or, if it were an intermediate station, invaded the compartment. This was what was done, and with precipitation, for some of them had arrived late, just as the train which was already in the station was about to start, by the troop which Cottard led at a run towards the carriage in the window of which he had seen me signalling. Brichot, who was among these faithful, had become more faithful than ever in the course of these years which had diminished the assiduity of others. As his sight became steadily weaker, he had been obliged, even in Paris, to reduce more and more his working hours after dark. Besides he was out of sympathy with the modern Sorbonne, where ideas of scientific exactitude, after the German model, were beginning to prevail over humanism. He now confined himself exclusively to his lectures and to his duties as an examiner; and so had a great deal more time to devote to social pursuits. That is to say, to evenings at the Verdurins\u2019, or to those parties that now and again were offered to the Verdurins by one of the faithful, tremulous with emotion. It is true that on two occasions love had almost succeeded in achieving what his work could no longer do, in detaching Brichot from the little clan. But Mme. Verdurin, who kept her eyes open, and moreover, having acquired the habit in the interests of her salon, had come to take a disinterested pleasure in this sort of drama and execution, had immediately brought about a coolness between him and the dangerous person, being skilled in (as she expressed it) \u2018putting things in order\u2019 and \u2018applying the red hot iron to the wound.\u2019 This she had found all the more easy in the case of one of the dangerous persons, who was simply Brichot\u2019s laundress, and Mme. Verdurin, having the right of entry into the Professor\u2019s fifth floor rooms, crimson with rage, when she deigned to climb his stairs, had only had to shut the door in the wretched woman\u2019s face. \u201cWhat!\u201d the Mistress had said to Brichot, \u201ca woman like myself does you the honour of calling upon you, and you receive a creature like that?\u201d Brichot had never forgotten the service that Mme. Verdurin had rendered him by preventing his old age from foundering in the mire, and became more and more strongly attached to her, whereas, in contrast to this revival of affection and possibly because of it, the Mistress was beginning to be tired of a too docile follower, and of an obedience of which she could be certain beforehand. But Brichot derived from his intimacy with the Verdurins a distinction which set him apart from all his colleagues at the Sorbonne. They were dazzled by the accounts that he gave them of dinner-parties to which they would never be invited, by the mention made of him in the reviews, the exhibition of his portrait in the Salon, by some writer or painter of repute whose talent the occupants of the other chairs in the Faculty of Arts esteemed, but without any prospect of attracting his attention, not to mention the elegance of the mundane philosopher\u2019s attire, an elegance which they had mistaken at first for slackness until their colleague kindly explained to them that a tall hat is naturally laid on the floor, when one is paying a call, and is not the right thing for dinners in the country, however smart, where it should be replaced by a soft hat, which goes quite well with a dinner-jacket. For the first few moments after the little group had plunged into the carriage, I could not even speak to Cottard, for he was suffocated, not so much by having run in order not to miss the train as by his astonishment at having caught it so exactly. He felt more than the joy inherent in success, almost the hilarity of an excellent joke. \u201cAh! That was a good one!\u201d he said when he had recovered himself. \u201cA minute later! \u2018Pon my soul, that\u2019s what they call arriving in the nick of time!\u201d he added, with a wink intended not so much to inquire whether the expression were apt, for he was now overflowing with assurance, but to express his satisfaction. At length he was able to introduce me to the other members of the little clan. I was annoyed to see that they were almost all in the dress which in Paris is called smoking. I had forgotten that the Verdurins were beginning a timid evolution towards fashionable ways, retarded by the Dreyfus case, accelerated by the \u2018new\u2019 music, an evolution which for that matter they denied, and continued to deny until it was complete, like those military objectives which a general does not announce until he has reached them, so as not to appear defeated if he fails. In addition to which, Society was quite prepared to go half way to meet them. It went so far as to regard them as people to whose house nobody in Society went but who were not in the least perturbed by the fact. The Verdurin salon was understood to be a Temple of Music. It was there, people assured you, that Vinteuil had found inspiration, encouragement. Now, even if Vinteuil\u2019s sonata remained wholly unappreciated, and almost unknown, his name, quoted as that of the greatest of modern composers, had an extraordinary effect. Moreover, certain young men of the Faubourg having decided that they ought to be more intellectual than the middle classes, there were three of them who had studied music, and among these Vinteuil\u2019s sonata enjoyed an enormous vogue. They would speak of it, on returning to their homes, to the intelligent mothers who had incited them to acquire culture. And, taking an interest in what interested their sons, at a concert these mothers would gaze with a certain respect at Mme. Verdurin in her front box, following the music in the printed score. So far, this social success latent in the Verdurins was revealed by two facts only. In the first place, Mme. Verdurin would say of the Principessa di Caprarola: \u201cAh! She is intelligent, she is a charming woman. What I cannot endure, are the imbeciles, the people who bore me, they drive me mad.\u201d Which would have made anybody at all perspicacious realise that the Principessa di Caprarola, a woman who moved in the highest society, had called upon Mme. Verdurin. She had even mentioned her name in the course of a visit of condolence which she had paid to Mme. Swann after the death of her husband, and had asked whether she knew them. \u201cWhat name did you say?\u201d Odette had asked, with a sudden wistfulness. \u201cVerdurin? Oh, yes, of course,\u201d she had continued in a plaintive tone, \u201cI don\u2019t know them, or rather, I know them without really knowing them, they are people I used to meet at people\u2019s houses, years ago, they are quite nice.\u201d When the Principessa di Caprarola had gone, Odette would fain have spoken the bare truth. But the immediate falsehood was not the fruit of her calculations, but the revelation of her fears, of her desires. She denied not what it would have been adroit to deny, but what she would have liked not to have happened, even if the other person was bound to hear an hour later that it was a fact. A little later she had recovered her assurance, and would indeed anticipate questions by saying, so as not to appear to be afraid of them: \u201cMme. Verdurin, why, I used to know her terribly well!\u201d with an affectation of humility, like a great lady who tells you that she has taken the tram. \u201cThere has been a great deal of talk about the Verdurins lately,\u201d said Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. Odette, with the smiling disdain of a Duchess, replied: \u201cYes, I do seem to have heard a lot about them lately. Every now and then there are new people who arrive like that in society,\u201d without reflecting that she herself was among the newest. \u201cThe Principessa di Caprarola has dined there,\u201d Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 went on. \u201cAh!\u201d replied Odette, accentuating her smile, \u201cthat does not surprise me. That sort of thing always begins with the Principessa di Caprarola, and then some one else follows suit, like Comtesse Mole.\u201d Odette, in saying this, appeared to be filled with a profound contempt for the two great ladies who made a habit of \u2018house-warming\u2019 in recently established drawing-rooms. One felt from her tone that the implication was that she, Odette, was, like Mme. de Souvr\u00e9, not the sort of person to let herself in for that sort of thing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the admission that Mme. Verdurin had made of the Principessa di Caprarola\u2019s intelligence, the second indication that the Verdurins were conscious of their future destiny was that (without, of course, their having formally requested it) they became most anxious that people should now come to dine with them in evening dress. M. Verdurin could now have been greeted without shame by his nephew, the one who was \u2018in the cart.\u2019 Among those who entered my carriage at Graincourt was Saniette, who long ago had been expelled from the Verdurins\u2019 by his cousin Forcheville, but had since returned. His faults, from the social point of view, had originally been \u2014 notwithstanding his superior qualities \u2014 something like Cottard\u2019s, shyness, anxiety to please, fruitless attempts to succeed in doing so. But if the course of life, by making Cottard assume, if not at the Verdurins\u2019, where he had, because of the influence that past associations exert over us when we find ourselves in familiar surroundings, remained more or less the same, at least in his practice, in his hospital ward, at the Academy of Medicine, a shell of coldness, disdain, gravity, that became more accentuated while he rewarded his appreciative students with puns, had made a clean cut between the old Cottard and the new, the same defects had on the contrary become exaggerated in Saniette, the more he sought to correct them. Conscious that he was frequently boring, that people did not listen to him, instead of then slackening his pace as Cottard would have done, of forcing their attention by an air of authority, not only did he try by adopting a humorous tone to make them forgive the unduly serious turn of his conversation, he increased his pace, cleared the ground, used abbreviations in order to appear less long-winded, more familiar with the matters of which he spoke, and succeeded only, by making them unintelligible, in seeming interminable. His self-assurance was not like that of Cottard, freezing his patients, who, when other people praised his social graces, would reply: \u201cHe is a different man when he receives you in his consulting room, you with your face to the light, and he with his back to it, and those piercing eyes.\u201d It failed to create an effect, one felt that it was cloaking an excessive shyness, that the merest trifle would be enough to dispel it. Saniette, whose friends had always told him that he was wanting in self-confidence, and who had indeed seen men whom he rightly considered greatly inferior to himself, attain with ease to the success that was denied to him, never began telling a story without smiling at its drollery, fearing lest a serious air might make his hearers underestimate the value of his wares. Sometimes, giving him credit for the comic element which he himself appeared to find in what he was about to say, people would do him the honour of a general silence. But the story would fall flat. A fellow-guest who was endowed with a kind heart would sometimes convey to Saniette the private, almost secret encouragement of a smile of approbation, making it reach him furtively, without attracting attention, as one passes a note from hand to hand. But nobody went so far as to assume the responsibility, to risk the glaring publicity of an honest laugh. Long after the story was ended and had fallen flat, Saniette, crestfallen, would remain smiling to himself, as though relishing in it and for himself the delectation which he pretended to find adequate and which the others had not felt. As for the sculptor Ski, so styled on account of the difficulty they found in pronouncing his Polish surname, and because he himself made an affectation, since he had begun to move in a certain social sphere, of not wishing to be confused with certain relatives, perfectly respectable but slightly boring and very numerous, he had, at forty-four and with no pretension to good looks, a sort of boyishness, a dreamy wistfulness which was the result of his having been, until the age of ten, the most charming prodigal imaginable, the darling of all the ladies. Mme. Verdurin maintained that he was more of an artist than Elstir. Any resemblance that there may have been between them was, however, purely external. It was enough to make Elstir, who had met Ski once, feel for him the profound repulsion that is inspired in us less by the people who are our exact opposite than by those who r\u00e9semble us in what is least good, in whom are displayed our worst qualities, the faults of which we have cured ourselves, who irritate by reminding us of how we may have appeared to certain other people before we became what we now are. But Mme. Verdurin thought that Ski had more temperament than Elstir because there was no art in which he had not a facility of expression, and she was convinced that he would have developed that facility into talent if he had not been so lazy. This seemed to the Mistress to be actually an additional gift, being the opposite of hard work which she regarded as the lot of people devoid of genius. Ski would paint anything you asked, on cuff-links or on the panels over doors. He sang with the voice of a composer, played from memory, giving the piano the effect of an orchestra, less by his virtuosity than by his vamped basses, which suggested the inability of the fingers to indicate that at a certain point the cornet entered, which, for that matter, he would imitate with his lips. Choosing his words when he spoke so as to convey an odd impression, just as he would pause before banging out a chord to say \u2018Ping!\u2019 so as to let the brasses be heard, he was regarded as marvellously intelligent, but as a matter of fact his ideas could be boiled down to two or three, extremely limited. Bored with his reputation for whimsicality, he had set himself to shew that he was a practical, matter-of-fact person, whence a triumphant affectation of false precision, of false common sense, aggravated by his having no memory and a fund of information that was always inaccurate. The movements of his head, neck, limbs, would have been graceful if he had been still nine years old, with golden curls, a wide lace collar and little boots of red leather. Having reached Graincourt station with Cottard and Brichot, with time to spare, he and Cottard had left Brichot in the waiting-room and had gone for a stroll. When Cottard proposed to turn back, Ski had replied: \u201cBut there is no hurry. It isn\u2019t the local train to-day, it\u2019s the departmental train.\u201d Delighted by the effect that this refinement of accuracy produced upon Cottard, he added, with reference to himself: \u201cYes, because Ski loves the arts, because he models in clay, people think he\u2019s not practical. Nobody knows this line better than I do.\u201d Nevertheless they had turned back towards the station when, all of a sudden, catching sight of the smoke of the approaching train, Cottard, with a wild shout, had exclaimed: \u201cWe shall have to put our best foot foremost.\u201d They did as a matter of fact arrive with not a moment to spare, the distinction between local and departmental trains having never existed save in the mind of Ski. \u201cBut isn\u2019t the Princess on the train?\u201d came in ringing tones from Brichot, whose huge spectacles, resplendent as the reflectors that laryngologists attach to their foreheads to throw a light into the throats of their patients, seemed to have taken their life from the Professor\u2019s eyes, and possibly because of the effort that he was making to adjust his sight to them, seemed themselves, even at the most trivial moments, to be gazing at themselves with a sustained attention and an extraordinary fixity. Brichot\u2019s malady, as it gradually deprived him of his sight, had revealed to him the beauties of that sense, just as, frequently, we have to have made up our minds to part with some object, to make a present of it for instance, before we can study it, regret it, admire it. \u201cNo, no, the Princess went over to Maineville with some of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s guests who were taking the Paris train. It is within the bounds of possibility that Mme. Verdurin, who had some business at Saint-Mars, may be with her! In that case, she will be coming with us, and we shall all travel together, which will be delightful. We shall have to keep our eyes skinned at Maineville and see what we shall see! Oh, but that\u2019s nothing, you may say that we came very near to missing the bus. When I saw the train I was dumbfoundered. That\u2019s what is called arriving at the psychological moment. Can\u2019t you picture us missing the train, Mme. Verdurin seeing the carriages come back without us: Tableau!\u201d added the doctor, who had not yet recovered from his emotion. \u201cThat would be a pretty good joke, wouldn\u2019t it? Now then, Brichot, what have you to say about our little escapade?\u201d inquired the doctor with a note of pride. \u201cUpon my soul,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cwhy, yes, if you had found the train gone, that would have been what the late Villemain used to call a wipe in the eye!\u201d But I, distracted at first by these people who were strangers to me, was suddenly reminded of what Cottard had said to me in the ball-room of the little casino, and, just as though there were an invisible link uniting an organ to our visual memory, the vision of Albertine leaning her breasts against Andr\u00e9e\u2019s caused my heart a terrible pain. This pain did not last: the idea of Albertine\u2019s having relations with women seemed no longer possible since the occasion, forty-eight hours earlier, when the advances that my mistress had made to Saint-Loup had excited in me a fresh jealousy which had made me forget the old. I was simple enough to suppose that one taste of necessity excludes another. At Harambouville, as the tram was full, a farmer in a blue blouse who had only a third class ticket got into our compartment. The doctor, feeling that the Princess must not be allowed to travel with such a person, called a porter, shewed his card, describing him as medical officer to one of the big railway companies, and obliged the station-master to make the farmer get out. This incident so pained and alarmed Saniette\u2019s timid spirit that, as soon as he saw it beginning, fearing already lest, in view of the crowd of peasants on the platform, it should assume the proportions of a rising, he pretended to be suffering from a stomach-ache, and, so that he might not be accused of any share in the responsibility for the doctor\u2019s violence, wandered down the corridor, pretending to be looking for what Cottard called the \u2018water.\u2019 Failing to find one, he stood and gazed at the scenery from the other end of the \u2018twister.\u2019 \u201cIf this is your first appearance at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Sir,\u201d I was addressed by Brichot, anxious to shew off his talents before a newcomer, \u201cyou will find that there is no place where one feels more the \u2018amenities of life,\u2019 to quote one of the inventors of dilettantism, of pococurantism, of all sorts of words in \u2014 ism that are in fashion among our little snobbesses, I refer to M. le Prince de Talleyrand.\u201d For, when he spoke of these great noblemen of the past, he thought it clever and \u2018in the period\u2019 to prefix a \u2018M.\u2019 to their titles, and said \u2018M. le Duc de La Rochefoucauld,\u2019 \u2018M. le Cardinal de Retz,\u2019 referring to these also as \u2018That struggle-for-lifer de Gondi,\u2019 \u2018that Boulangist de Marcillac.\u2019 And he never failed to call Montesquieu, with a smile, when he referred to him: \u201cMonsieur le Pr\u00e9sident Second\u00e2t de Montesquieu.\u201d An intelligent man of the world would have been irritated by a pedantry which reeked so of the lecture-room. But in the perfect manners of the man of the world when speaking of a Prince, there is a pedantry also, which betrays a different caste, that in which one prefixes \u2018the Emperor\u2019 to the name \u2018William\u2019 and addresses a Royal Highness in the third person. \u201cAh, now that is a man,\u201d Brichot continued, still referring to \u2018Monsieur le Prince de Talleyrand\u2019\u2014\u201cto whom we take off our hats. He is an ancestor.\u201d \u201cIt is a charming house,\u201d Cottard told me, \u201cyou will find a little of everything, for Mme. Verdurin is not exclusive, great scholars like Brichot, the high nobility, such as the Princess Sherbatoff, a great Russian lady, a friend of the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, who even sees her alone at hours when no one else is admitted.\u201d As a matter of fact the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, not wishing Princess Sherbatoff, who for years past had been cut by everyone, to come to her house when there might be other people, allowed her to come only in the early morning, when Her Imperial Highness was not at home to any of those friends to whom it would have been as unpleasant to meet the Princess as it would have been awkward for the Princess to meet them. As, for the last three years, as soon as she came away, like a manicurist, from the Grand Duchess, Mme. Sherbatoff would go on to Mme. Verdurin, who had just awoken, and stuck to her for the rest of the day, one might say that the Princess\u2019s loyalty surpassed even that of Brichot, constant as he was at those Wednesdays, both in Paris, where he had the pleasure of fancying himself a sort of Chateaubriand at l\u2019Abbaye-aux-Bois, and in the country, where he saw himself becoming the equivalent of what might have been in the salon of Mme. de Ch\u00e2telet the man whom he always named (with an erudite sarcasm and satisfaction): \u201cM. de Voltaire.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her want of friends had enabled Princess Sherbatoff to shew for some years past to the Verdurins a fidelity which made her more than an ordinary member of the \u2018faithful,\u2019 the type of faithfulness, the ideal which Mme. Verdurin had long thought unattainable and which now, in her later years, she at length found incarnate in this new feminine recruit. However keenly the Mistress might feel the pangs of jealousy, it was without precedent that the most assiduous of her faithful should not have \u2018failed\u2019 her at least once. The most stay-at-home yielded to the temptation to travel; the most continent fell from virtue; the most robust might catch influenza, the idlest be caught for his month\u2019s soldiering, the most indifferent go to close the eyes of a dying mother. And it was in vain that Mme. Verdurin told them then, like the Roman Empress, that she was the sole general whom her legion must obey, like the Christ or the Kaiser that he who loved his father or mother more than her and was not prepared to leave them and follow her was not worthy of her, that instead of slacking in bed or letting themselves be made fools of by bad women they would do better to remain in her company, by her, their sole remedy and sole delight. But destiny which is sometimes pleased to brighten the closing years of a life that has passed the mortal span had made Mme. Verdurin meet the Princess Sherbatoff. Out of touch with her family, an exile from her native land, knowing nobody but the Baroness Putbus and the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, to whose houses, because she herself had no desire to meet the friends of the former, and the latter no desire that her friends should meet the Princess, she went only in the early morning hours when Mme. Verdurin was still asleep, never once, so far as she could remember, having been confined to her room since she was twelve years old, when she had had the measles, having on the 3lst of December replied to Mme. Verdurin who, afraid of being left alone, had asked her whether she would not \u2018shake down\u2019 there for the night, in spite of its being New Year\u2019s Eve: \u201cWhy, what is there to prevent me, any day of the year? Besides, to-morrow is a day when one stays at home, and this is my home,\u201d living in a boarding-house, and moving from it whenever the Verdurins moved, accompanying them upon their holidays, the Princess had so completely exemplified to Mme. Verdurin the line of Vigny:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thou only didst appear that which one seeks always\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the Lady President of the little circle, anxious to make sure of one of her \u2018faithful\u2019 even after death, had made her promise that whichever of them survived the other should be buried by her side. Before strangers \u2014 among whom we must always reckon him to whom we lie most barefacedly because he is the person whose scorn we should most dread: ourself \u2014 Princess Sherbatoff took care to represent her only three friendships \u2014 with the Grand Duchess, the Verdurins, and the Baroness Putbus \u2014 as the only ones, not which cataclysms beyond her control had allowed to emerge from the destruction of all the rest, but which a free choice had made her elect in preference to any other, and to which a certain love of solitude and simplicity had made her confine herself. \u201cI see nobody else,\u201d she would say, insisting upon the inflexible character of what appeared to be rather a rule that one imposes upon oneself than a necessity to which one submits. She would add: \u201cI visit only three houses,\u201d as a dramatist who fears that it may not run to a fourth announces that there will be only three performances of his play. Whether or not M. and Mme. Verdurin believed in the truth of this fiction, they had helped the Princess to instil it into the minds of the faithful. And they in turn were persuaded both that the Princess, among the thousands of invitations that were offered her, had chosen the Verdurins alone, and that the Verdurins, courted in vain by all the higher aristocracy, had consented to make but a single exception, in favour of the Princess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In their eyes, the Princess, too far superior to her native element not to find it boring, among all the people whose society she might have enjoyed, found the Verdurins alone entertaining, while they, in return, deaf to the overtures with which they were bombarded by the entire aristocracy, had consented to make but a single exception, in favour of a great lady of more intelligence than the rest of her kind, the Princess Sherbatoff\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Princess was very rich; she engaged for every first night a large box, to which, with the assent of Mme. Verdurin, she invited the faithful and nobody else. People would point to this pale and enigmatic person who had grown old without turning white, turning red rather like certain sere and shrivelled hedgerow fruits. They admired both her influence and her humility, for, having always with her an Academician, Brichot, a famous scientist, Cottard, the leading pianist of the day, at a later date M. de Charlus, she nevertheless made a point of securing the least prominent box in the theatre, remained in the background, paid no attention to the rest of the house, lived exclusively for the little group, who, shortly before the end of the performance, would withdraw in the wake of this strange sovereign, who was not without a certain timid, fascinating, faded beauty. But if Mme. Sherbatoff did not look at the audience, remained in shadow, it was to try to forget that there existed a living world which she passionately desired and was unable to know: the coterie in a box was to her what is to certain animals their almost corpselike immobility in the presence of danger. Nevertheless the thirst for novelty and for the curious which possesses people in society made them pay even more attention perhaps to this mysterious stranger than to the celebrities in the front boxes to whom everybody paid a visit. They imagined that she must be different from the people whom they knew, that a marvellous intellect combined with a discerning bounty retained round about her that little circle of eminent men. The Princess was compelled, if you spoke to her about anyone, or introduced anyone to her, to feign an intense coldness, in order to keep up the fiction of her horror of society. Nevertheless, with the support of Cottard or Mme. Verdurin, several newcomers succeeded in making her acquaintance and such was her excitement at making a fresh acquaintance that she forgot the fable of her deliberate isolation, and went to the wildest extremes to please the newcomer. If he was entirely unimportant, the rest would be astonished. \u201cHow strange that the Princess, who refuses to know anyone, should make an exception of such an uninteresting person.\u201d But these fertilising acquaintances were rare, and the Princess lived narrowly confined in the midst of the faithful\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cottard said far more often: \u201cI shall see him on Wednesday at the Verdurins\u2019,\u201d than: \u201cI shall see him on Tuesday at the Academy.\u201d He spoke, too, of the Wednesdays as of an engagement equally important and inevitable. But Cottard was one of those people, little sought after, who make it as imperious a duty to respond to an invitation as if such invitations were orders, like a military or judicial summons. It required a call from a very important patient to make him \u201cfail\u201d the Verdurins on a Wednesday, the importance depending moreover rather upon the rank of the patient than upon the gravity of his complaint. For Cottard, excellent fellow as he was, would forego the delights of a Wednesday not for a workman who had had a stroke, but for a Minister\u2019s cold. Even then he would say to his wife: \u201cMake my apologies to Mme. Verdurin. Tell her that I shall be coming later on. His Excellency might really have chosen some other day to catch cold.\u201d One Wednesday their old cook having opened a vein in her arm, Cottard, already in his dinner-jacket to go to the Verdurins\u2019, had shrugged his shoulders when his wife had timidly inquired whether he could not bandage the cut: \u201cOf course I can\u2019t, L\u00e9ontine,\u201d he had groaned; \u201ccan\u2019t you see I\u2019ve got my white waistcoat on?\u201d So as not to annoy her husband, Mme. Cottard had sent post haste for his chief dresser. He, to save time, had taken a cab, with the result that, his carriage entering the courtyard just as Cottard\u2019s was emerging to take him to the Verdurins\u2019, five minutes had been wasted in backing to let one another pass. Mme. Cottard was worried that the dresser should see his master in evening dress. Cottard sat cursing the delay, from remorse perhaps, and started off in a villainous temper which it took all the Wednesday\u2019s pleasures to dispel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If one of Cottard\u2019s patients were to ask him: \u201cDo you ever see the Guermantes?\u201d it was with the utmost sincerity that the Professor would reply: \u201cPerhaps not actually the Guermantes, I can\u2019t be certain. But I meet all those people at the house of some friends of mine. You must, of course, have heard of the Verdurins. They know everybody. Besides, they certainly are not people who\u2019ve come down in the world. They\u2019ve got the goods, all right. It is generally estimated that Mme. Verdurin is worth thirty-five million. Gad, thirty-five million, that\u2019s a pretty figure. And so she doesn\u2019t make two bites at a cherry. You mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes. Let me explain the difference. Mme. Verdurin is a great lady, the Duchesse de Guermantes is probably a nobody. You see the distinction, of course. In any case, whether the Guermantes go to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s or not, she entertains all the very best people, the d\u2019Sherbat\u00f4ffs, the d\u2019Forchevilles, e tutti quanti, people of the highest flight, all the nobility of France and Navarre, with whom you would see me conversing as man to man. Of course, those sort of people are only too glad to meet the princes of science,\u201d he added, with a smile of fatuous conceit, brought to his lips by his proud satisfaction not so much that the expression formerly reserved for men like Potain and Charcot should now be applicable to himself, as that he knew at last how to employ all these expressions that were authorised by custom, and, after a long course of study, had learned them by heart. And so, after mentioning to me Princess Sherbatoff as one of the people who went to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Cottard added with a wink: \u201cThat gives you an idea of the style of the house, if you see what I mean?\u201d He meant that it was the very height of fashion. Now, to entertain a Russian lady who knew nobody but the Grand Duchess Eudoxie was not fashionable at all. But Princess Sherbatoff might not have known even her, it would in no way have diminished Cottard\u2019s estimate of the supreme elegance of the Verdurin salon or his joy at being invited there. The splendour that seems to us to invest the people whose houses we visit is no more intrinsic than that of kings and queens on the stage, in dressing whom it is useless for a producer to spend hundreds and thousands of francs in purchasing authentic costumes and real jewels, when a great designer will procure a far more sumptuous impression by focussing a ray of light on a doublet of coarse cloth studded with lumps of glass and on a cloak of paper. A man may have spent his life among the great ones of the earth, who to him have been merely boring relatives or tiresome acquaintances, because a familiarity engendered in the cradle had stripped them of all distinction in his eyes. The same man, on the other hand, need only have been led by some chance to mix with the most obscure people, for innumerable Cottards to be permanently dazzled by the ladies of title whose drawing-rooms they imagined as the centres of aristocratic elegance, ladies who were not even what Mme. de Villeparisis and her friends were (great ladies fallen from their greatness, whom the aristocracy that had been brought up with them no longer visited); no, those whose friendship has been the pride of so many men, if these men were to publish their memoirs and to give the names of those women and of the other women who came to their parties, Mme. de Cambremer would be no more able than Mme. de Guermantes to identify them. But what of that! A Cottard has thus his Marquise, who is to him \u201cthe Baronne,\u201d as in Marivaux, the Baronne whose name is never mentioned, so much so that nobody supposes that she ever had a name. Cottard is all the more convinced that she embodies the aristocracy \u2014 which has never heard of the lady \u2014 in that, the more dubious titles are, the more prominently coronets are displayed upon wineglasses, silver, notepaper, luggage. Many Cottards who have supposed that they were living in the heart of the Faubourg Saint-Germain have had their imagination perhaps more enchanted by feudal dreams than the men who did really live among Princes, just as with the small shopkeeper who, on Sundays, goes sometimes to look at \u201cold time\u201d buildings, it is sometimes from those buildings every stone of which is of our own time, the vaults of which have been, by the pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, painted blue and sprinkled with golden stars, that they derive the strongest sensation of the middle ages. \u201cThe Princess will be at Maineville. She will be coming with us. But I shall not introduce you to her at once. It will be better to leave that to Mme. Verdurin. Unless I find a loophole. Then you can rely on me to take the bull by the horns.\u201d \u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d asked Saniette, as he rejoined us, pretending to have gone out to take the air. \u201cI was quoting to this gentleman,\u201d said Brichot, \u201ca saying, which you will remember, of the man who, to my mind, is the first of the fins-de-si\u00e8cle (of the eighteenth century, that is), by name Charles Maurice, Abb\u00e9 de Perigord. He began by promising to be an excellent journalist. But he made a bad end, by which I mean that he became a Minister! Life has these tragedies. A far from serapulous politician to boot who, with the lofty contempt of a thoroughbred nobleman, did not hesitate to work in his time for the King of Prussia, there are no two ways about it, and died in the skin of a \u2018Left Centre.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Saint-Pierre-des-Ifs we were joined by a glorious girl who, unfortunately, was not one of the little group. I could not tear my eyes from her magnolia skin, her dark eyes, her bold and admirable outlines. A moment later she wanted to open a window, for it was hot in the compartment, and not wishing to ask leave of everybody, as I alone was without a greatcoat, she said to me in a quick, cool, jocular voice: \u201cDo you mind a little fresh air, Sir?\u201d I would have liked to say to her: \u201cCome with us to the Verdurins\u2019?\u201d or \u201cGive me your name and address.\u201d I answered: \u201cNo, fresh air doesn\u2019t bother me, Mademoiselle.\u201d Whereupon, without stirring from her seat: \u201cDo your friends object to smoke?\u201d and she lit a cigarette. At the third station she sprang from the carriage. Next day, I inquired of Albertine, who could she be. For, stupidly thinking that people could have but one sort of love, in my jealousy of Albertine\u2019s attitude towards Robert, I was reassured so far as other women were concerned. Albertine told me, I believe quite sincerely, that she did not know. \u201cI should so much like to see her again,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, one always sees people again,\u201d replied Albertine. In this particular instance, she was wrong; I never saw again, nor did I ever identify, the pretty girl with the cigarette. We shall see, moreover, why, for a long time, I ceased to look for her. But I have not forgotten her. I find myself at times, when I think of her, seized by a wild longing. But these recurrences of desire oblige us to reflect that if we wish to rediscover these girls with the same pleasure we must also return to the year which has since been followed by ten others in the course of which her bloom has faded. We can sometimes find a person again, but we cannot abolish time. And so on until the unforeseen day, gloomy as a winter night, when we no longer seek for that girl, or for any other, when to find her would actually frighten us. For we no longer feel that we have sufficient attraction to appeal to her, or strength to love her. Not, of course, that we are, in the strict sense of the word, impotent. And as for loving, we should love her more than ever. But we feel that it is too big an undertaking for the little strength that we have left. Eternal rest has already fixed intervals which we can neither cross nor make our voice be heard across them. To set our foot on the right step is an achievement like not missing the perilous leap. To be seen in such a state by a girl we love, even if we have kept the features and all the golden locks of our youth! We can no longer undertake the strain of keeping pace with youth. All the worse if our carnal desire increases instead of failing! We procure for it a woman whom we need make no effort to attract, who will share our couch for one night only and whom we shall never see again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStill no news, I suppose, of the violinist,\u201d said Cottard. The event of the day in the little clan was, in fact, the failure of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s favourite violinist. Employed on military service near Donci\u00e8res, he came three times a week to dine at la Raspeli\u00e8re, having a midnight pass. But two days ago, for the first time, the faithful had been unable to discover him on the tram. It was supposed that he had missed it. But albeit Mme. Verdurin had sent to meet the next tram, and so on until the last had arrived, the carriage had returned empty. \u201cHe\u2019s certain to have been shoved into the guard-room, there\u2019s no other explanation of his desertion. Gad! In soldiering, you know, with those fellows, it only needs a bad-tempered serjeant.\u201d \u201cIt will be all the more mortifying for Mme. Verdurin,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cif he fails again this evening, because our kind hostess has invited to dinner for the first time the neighbours from whom she has taken la Raspeli\u00e8re, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer.\u201d \u201cThis evening, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer!\u201d exclaimed Cottard. \u201cBut I knew absolutely nothing about it. Naturally, I knew like everybody else that they would be coming one day, but I had no idea that it was to be so soon. Sapristi!\u201d he went on, turning to myself, \u201cwhat did I tell you? The Princess Sherbatoff, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer.\u201d And, after repeating these names, lulling himself with their melody: \u201cYou see that we move in good company,\u201d he said to me. \u201cHowever, as it\u2019s your first appearance, you\u2019ll be one of the crowd. It is going to be an exceptionally brilliant gathering.\u201d And, turning to Brichot, he went on: \u201cThe Mistress will be furious. It is time we appeared to lend her a hand.\u201d Ever since Mme. Verdurin had been at la Raspeli\u00e8re she had pretended for the benefit of the faithful to be at once feeling and regretting the necessity of inviting her landlords for one evening. By so doing she would obtain better terms next year, she explained, and was inviting them for business reasons only. But she pretended to regard with such terror, to make such a bugbear of the idea of dining with people who did not belong to the little group that she kept putting off the evil day. The prospect did for that matter alarm her slightly for the reasons which she professed, albeit exaggerating them, if at the same time it enchanted her for reasons of snobbishness which she preferred to keep to herself. She was therefore partly sincere, she believed the little clan to be something so matchless throughout the world, one of those perfect wholes which it takes centuries of time to produce, that she trembled at the thought of seeing introduced into its midst these provincials, people ignorant of the Ring and the Meistersinger, who would be unable to play their part in the concert of conversation and were capable, by coming to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, of ruining one of those famous Wednesdays, masterpieces of art incomparable and frail, like those Venetian glasses which one false note is enough to shatter. \u201cBesides, they are bound to be absolutely anti, and militarists,\u201d M. Verdurin had said. \u201cOh, as for that, I don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ve heard quite enough about all that business,\u201d had replied Mme. Verdurin, who, a sincere Dreyfusard, would nevertheless have been glad to discover a social counterpoise to the preponderant Dreyfusism of her salon. For Dreyfusism was triumphant politically, but not socially. Labori, Reinach, Picquart, Zola were still, to people in society, more or less traitors, who could only keep them aloof from the little nucleus. And so, after this incursion into politics, Mme. Verdurin was determined to return to the world of art. Besides were not Indy, Debussy, on the \u2018wrong\u2019 side in the Case? \u201cSo far as the Case goes, we need only remember Brichot,\u201d she said (the Don being the only one of the faithful who had sided with the General Staff, which had greatly lowered him in the esteem of Madame Verdurin). \u201cThere is no need to be eternally discussing the Dreyfus case. No, the fact of the matter is that the Cambremers bore me.\u201d As for the faithful, no less excited by their unconfessed desire to make the Cambremers\u2019 acquaintance than dupes of the affected reluctance which Mme. Verdurin said she felt to invite them, they returned, day after day, in conversation with her, to the base arguments with which she herself supported the invitation, tried to make them irresistible. \u201cMake up your mind to it once and for all,\u201d Cottard repeated, \u201cand you will have better terms for next year, they will pay the gardener, you will have the use of the meadow. That will be well worth a boring evening. I am thinking only of yourselves,\u201d he added, albeit his heart had leaped on one occasion, when, in Mme. Verdurin\u2019s carriage, he had met the carriage of the old Mme. de Cambremer and, what was more, he had been abased in the sight of the railwaymen when, at the station, he had found himself standing beside the Marquis. For their part, the Cambremers, living far too remote from the social movement ever to suspect that certain ladies of fashion were speaking with a certain consideration of Mme. Verdurin, imagined that she was a person who could know none but Bohemians, was perhaps not even legally married, and so far as people of birth were concerned would never meet any but themselves. They had resigned themselves to the thought of dining with her only to be on good terms with a tenant who, they hoped, would return again for many seasons, especially after they had, in the previous month, learned that she had recently inherited all those millions. It was in silence and without any vulgar pleasantries that they prepared themselves for the fatal day. The faithful had given up hope of its ever coming, so often had Mme. Verdurin already fixed in their hearing a date that was invariably postponed. These false decisions were intended not merely to make a display of the boredom that she felt at the thought of this dinner-party, but to keep in suspense those members of the little group who were staying in the neighbourhood and were sometimes inclined to fail. Not that the Mistress guessed that the \u201cgreat day\u201d was as delightful a prospect to them as to herself, but in order that, having persuaded them that this dinner-party was to her the most terrible of social duties, she might make an appeal to their devotion. \u201cYou are not going to leave me all alone with those Chinese mandarins! We must assemble in full force to support the boredom. Naturally, we shan\u2019t be able to talk about any of the things in which we are interested. It will be a Wednesday spoiled, but what is one to do!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed,\u201d Brichot explained to me, \u201cI fancy that Mme. Verdurin, who is highly intelligent and takes infinite pains in the elaboration of her Wednesdays, was by no means anxious to see these bumpkins of ancient lineage but scanty brains. She could not bring herself to invite the dowager Marquise, but has resigned herself to having the son and daughter-in-law.\u201d \u201cAh! We are to see the Marquise de Cambremer?\u201d said Cottard with a smile into which he saw fit to introduce a leer of sentimentality, albeit he had no idea whether Mme. de Cambremer were good-looking or not. But the title Marquise suggested to him fantastic thoughts of gallantry. \u201cAh! I know her,\u201d said Ski, who had met her once when he was out with Mme. Verdurin. \u201cNot in the biblical sense of the word, I trust,\u201d said the doctor, darting a sly glance through his eyeglass; this was one of his favourite pleasantries. \u201cShe is intelligent,\u201d Ski informed me. \u201cNaturally,\u201d he went on, seeing that I said nothing, and dwelling with a smile upon each word, \u201cshe is intelligent and at the same time she is not, she lacks education, she is frivolous, but she has an instinct for beautiful things. She may say nothing, but she will never say anything silly. And besides, her colouring is charming. She would be an amusing person to paint,\u201d he added, half shutting his eyes, as though he saw her posing in front of him. As my opinion of her was quite the opposite of what Ski was expressing with so many fine shades, I observed merely that she was the sister of an extremely distinguished engineer, M. Legrandin. \u201cThere, you see, you are going to be introduced to a pretty woman,\u201d Brichot said to me, \u201cand one never knows what may come of that. Cleopatra was not even a great lady, she was a little woman, the unconscious, terrible little woman of our Meilhac, and just think of the consequences, not only to that idiot Antony, but to the whole of the ancient world.\u201d \u201cI have already been introduced to Mme. de Cambremer,\u201d I replied. \u201cAh! In that case, you will find yourself on familiar ground.\u201d \u201cI shall be all the more delighted to meet her,\u201d I answered him, \u201cbecause she has promised me a book by the former cur\u00e9 of Com-bray about the place-names of this district, and I shall be able to remind her of her promise. I am interested in that priest, and also in etymologies.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t put any faith in the ones he gives,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cthere is a copy of the book at la Raspeli\u00e8re, which I have glanced through, but without finding anything of any value; it is a mass of error. Let me give you an example. The word Bricq is found in a number of place-names in this neighbourhood. The worthy cleric had the distinctly odd idea that it comes from Briga, a height, a fortified place. He finds it already in the Celtic tribes, Latobriges, Nemetobriges, and so forth, and traces it down to such names as Briand, Brion, and so forth. To confine ourselves to the region in which we have the pleasure of your company at this moment, Bricquebose means the wood on the height, Bricqueville the habitation on the height, Bricquebec, where we shall be stopping presently before coming to Maineville, the height by the stream. Now there is not a word of truth in all this, for the simple reason that bricq is the old Norse word which means simply a bridge. Just as fleur, which Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 takes infinite pains to connect, in one place with the Scandinavian words floi, flo, in another with the Irish word ae or aer, is, beyond any doubt, the fjord of the Danes, and means harbour. So too, the excellent priest thinks that the station of Saint-Mars-le-Vetu, which adjoins la Raspeli\u00e8re, means Saint-Martin-le-Vieux (vetus). It is unquestionable that the word vieux has played a great part in the toponymy of this region. Vieux comes as a rule from vadum, and means a passage, as at the place called les Vieux. It is what the English call ford (Oxford, Hereford). But, in this particular instance, V\u00eatu is derived not from vetus, but from vas-tatus, a place that is devastated and bare. You have, round about here, Sottevast, the vast of Setold, Brillevast, the vast of Berold. I am all the more certain of the cure\u2019s mistake, in that Saint-Mars-le-Vetu was formerly called Saint-Mars du Cast and even Saint-Mars-de-Terregate. Now the v and the g in these words are the same letter. We say d\u00e9vaster, but also g\u00e2cher. J\u00e2ch\u00e8res andgatines (from the High German wastinna) have the same meaning: Terregate is therefore terra vasta. As for Saint-Mars, formerly (save the mark) Saint-Merd, it is Saint-Medardus, which appears variously as Saint-M\u00e9dard, Saint-Mard, Saint-Marc, Cinq-Mars, and even Dammas. Nor must we forget that quite close to here, places bearing the name of Mars are proof simply of a pagan origin (the god Mars) which has remained alive in this country but which the holy man refuses to see. The high places dedicated to the gods are especially frequent, such as the mount of Jupiter (Jeumont). Your cur\u00e9 declines to admit this, but, on the other hand, wherever Christianity has left traces, they escape his notice. He has gone so far afield as to Loctudy, a barbarian name, according to him, whereas it is simply Locus Sancti Tudeni, nor has he in Sammarcoles divined Sanctus Martialis. Your cur\u00e9,\u201d Brichot continued, seeing that I was interested, \u201cderives the terminations hon, home, holm, from the word holl (hullus), a hill, whereas it cornes from the Norse holm, an island, with which you are familiar in Stockholm, and which is so widespread throughout this district, la Houlme, Engohomme, Tahoume, Robehomme, N\u00e9homme, Quettehon, and so forth.\u201d These names made me think of the day when Albertine had wished to go to Amfreville-la-Bigot (from the name of two successive lords of the manor, Brichot told me), and had then suggested that we should dine together at Robehomme. As for Maineville, we were just coming to it. \u201cIsn\u2019t N\u00e9homme,\u201d I asked, \u201csomewhere near Carquethuit and Clitourps?\u201d \u201cPrecisely; N\u00e9homme is the holm, the island or peninsula of the famous Viscount Nigel, whose name has survived also in Neville. The Carquethuit and Clitourps that you mention furnish Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 with an occasion for further blunders. No doubt he has seen that carque is a church, the Kirche of the Germans. You will remember Querqueville, not to mention Dun-kerque. For there we should do better to stop and consider the famous word Dun, which to the Celts meant high ground. And that you will find over the whole of France. Your abb\u00e9 was hypnotised by Duneville, which recurs in the Eure-et-Loir; he would have found Ch\u00e2teaudun, Dun-le-Roi in the Cher, Duneau in the Sarthe, Dun in the Ari\u00e8ge, Dune-les-Places in the Ni\u00e8vre, and many others. This word Dun leads him into a curious error with regard to Douville where we shall be alighting, and shall find Mme. Verdurin\u2019s comfortable carriages awaiting us. Douville, in Latin donvilla, says he. As a matter of fact, Douville does lie at the foot of high hills. Your cur\u00e9, who knows everything, feels all the same that he has made a blunder. He has, indeed, found in an old cartulary, the name Domvilla. Whereupon he retracts; Douville, according to him, is a fief belonging to the Abbot, Domino Abbati, of Mont Saint-Michel. He is delighted with the discovery, which is distinctly odd when one thinks of the scandalous life that, according to the Capitulary of Sainte-Claire sur Epte, was led at Mont Saint-Michel, though no more extraordinary than to picture the King of Denmark as suzerain of all this coast, where he encouraged the worship of Odin far more than that of Christ. On the other hand, the supposition that the n has been changed to m does not shock me, and requires less alteration than the perfectly correct Lyon, which also is derived from Dun (Lugdunum). But the fact is, the abb\u00e9 is mistaken. Douville was never Donville, but Doville, Eudonis villa, the village of Eudes. Douville was formerly called Escalecliff, the steps up the cliff. About the year 1233, Eudes le Bouteiller, Lord of Escalecliff, set out for the Holy Land; on the eve of his departure he made over the church to the Abbey of Blanche-lande. By an exchange of courtesies, the village took his name, whence we have Douville to-day. But I must add that toponymy, of which moreover I know little or nothing, is not an exact science; had we not this historical evidence, Douville might quite well come from Ouville, that is to say the Waters. The forms in ai (Aigu\u00ebs-Mortes), from aqua, are constantly changed to eu or ou. Now there were, quite close to Douville, certain famous springs, Carquethuit. You might suppose that the cur\u00e9 was only too ready to detect there a Christian origin, especially as this district seems to have been pretty hard to convert, since successive attempts were made by Saint Ursal, Saint Gofroi, Saint Barsanore, Saint Laurent of Br\u00e8vedent, who finally handed over the task to the monks of Beaubec. But as regards thuit the writer is mistaken, he sees in it a form of toft, a building, as in Cricquetot, Ectot, Yvetot, whereas it is the thveit, the clearing, the reclaimed land, as in Braquetuit, le Thuit, Regnetuit, and so forth. Similarly, if he recognises in Clitourps the Norman thorp which means village, he insists that the first syllable of the word must come fromclivus, a slope, whereas it comes from cliff, a precipice. But his biggest blunders are due not so much to his ignorance as to his prejudices. However loyal a Frenchman one is, there is no need to fly in the face of the evidence and take Saint-Laurent en Bray to be the Roman priest, so famous at one time, when he is actually Saint Lawrence \u2018Toot, Archbishop of Dublin. But even more than his patriotic sentiments, your friend\u2019s religious bigotry leads him into strange errors. Thus you have not far from our hosts at la Raspeli\u00e8re two places called Montmartin, Montmartin-sur-Mer and Mont-martin-en-Graignes. In the case of Craignes, the good cur\u00e9 has been quite right, he has seen that Craignes, in Latin Crania, in GreekKrene, means ponds, marshes; how many instances of Cresmays, Croen, Gremeville, Lengronne, might we not adduce? But, when he comes to Montmartin, your self-styled linguist positively insists that these must be parishes dedicated to Saint Martin. He bases his opinion upon the fact that the Saint is their patron, but does not realise that he was only adopted subsequently; or rather he is blinded by his hatred of paganism; he refuses to see that we should say Mont-Saint-Martin as we say Mont-Saint-Michel, if it were a question of Saint Martin, whereas the name Montmartin refers in a far more pagan fashion to temples consecrated to the god Mars, temples of which, it is true, no other vestige remains, but which the undisputed existence in the neighbourhood of vast Roman camps would render highly probable even without the name Montmartin, which removes all doubt. You see that the little pamphlet which you will find at la Raspeli\u00e8re is far from perfect.\u201d I protested that at Combray the cur\u00e9 had often told us interesting etymologies. \u201cHe was probably better on his own ground, the move to Normandy must have made him lose his bearings.\u201d \u201cNor did it do him any good,\u201d I added, \u201cfor he came here with neurasthenia and went away again with rheumatism.\u201d \u201cAh, his neurasthenia is to blame. He has lapsed from neurasthenia to philology, as my worthy master Pocquelin would have said. Tell us, Cottard, do you suppose that neurasthenia can have a disturbing effect on philology, philology a soothing effect on neurasthenia and the relief from neurasthenia lead to rheumatism?\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly, rheumatism and neurasthenia are subordinate forms of neuro-arthritism. You may pass from one to the other by metastasis.\u201d \u201cThe eminent Professor,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cexpresses himself in a French as highly infused with Latin and Greek as M. Purgon himself, of Moli\u00e8resque memory! My uncle, I refer to our national Sarcey. . . . \u201d But he was prevented from finishing his sentence. The Professor had leaped from his seat with a wild shout: \u201cThe devil!\u201d he exclaimed on regaining his power of articulate speech, \u201cwe have passed Maineville (d\u2019you hear?) and Renneville too.\u201d He had just noticed that the train was stopping at Saint-Mars-le-Vetu, where most of the passengers alighted. \u201cThey can\u2019t have run through without stopping. We must have failed to notice it while we were talking about the Cambremers. Listen to me, Ski, pay attention, I am going to tell you \u2018a good one,\u2019\u201d said Cottard, who had taken a fancy to this expression, in common use in certain medical circles. \u201cThe Princess must be on the train, she can\u2019t have seen us, and will have got into another compartment. Come along and find her. Let\u2019s hope this won\u2019t land us in trouble!\u201d And he led us all off in search of Princess Sherbatoff. He found her in the corner of an empty compartment, reading the Revue des Deux Mondes. She had long ago, from fear of rebuffs, acquired the habit of keeping in her place, or remaining in her corner, in life as on the train, and of not offering her hand until the other person had greeted her. She went on reading as the faithful trooped into her carriage. I recognised her immediately; this woman who might have forfeited her position but was nevertheless of exalted birth, who in any event was the pearl of a salon such as the Verdurins\u2019, was the lady whom, on the same train, I had put down, two days earlier, as possibly the keeper of a brothel. Her social personality, which had been so vague, became clear to me as soon as I learned her name, just as when, after racking our brains over a puzzle, we at length hit upon the word which clears up all the obscurity, and which, in the case of a person, is his name. To discover two days later who the person is with whom one has travelled in the train is a far more amusing surprise than to read in the next number of a magazine the clue to the problem set in the previous number. Big restaurants, casinos, local trains, are the family portrait galleries of these social enigmas. \u201cPrincess, we must have missed you at Maineville! May we come and sit in your compartment?\u201d \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d said the Princess who, upon hearing Cottard address her, but only then, raised from her magazine a pair of eyes which, like the eyes of M. de Charlus, although gentler, saw perfectly well the people of whose presence she pretended to be unaware. Cottard, coming to the conclusion that the fact of my having been invited to meet the Cambremers was a sufficient recommendation, decided, after a momentary hesitation, to intro-duce me to the Princess, who bowed with great courtesy but appeared to be hearing my name for the first time. \u201cCr\u00e9 nom!\u201d cried the doctor, \u201cmy wife has forgotten to make them change the buttons on my white waist-coat. Ah! Those women, they never remember anything. Don\u2019t you ever marry, my boy,\u201d he said to me. And as this was one of the pleasantries which he considered appropriate when he had nothing else to say, he peeped out of the corner of his eye at the Princess and the rest of the faithful, who, because he was a Professor and an Academician, smiled back, admiring his good temper and freedom from pride. The Princess informed us that the young violinist had been found. He had been confined to bed the evening before by a sick headache, but was coming that evening and bringing with him a friend of his father whom he had met at Donci\u00e8res. She had learned this from Mme. Verdurin with whom she had taken luncheon that morning, she told us in a rapid voice, rolling her r_s, with her Russian accent, softly at the back of her throat, as though they were not r_s but l_s. \u201cAh! You had luncheon with her this morning,\u201d Cottard said to the Princess; but turned his eyes to myself, the purport of this remark being to shew me on what intimate terms the Princess was with the Mistress. \u201cYou are indeed a faithful adherent!\u201d \u201cYes, I love the little cirlcle, so intelligent, so agleeable, neverl spiteful, quite simple, not at all snobbish, and clevel to theirl fingle-tips.\u201d \u201cNom d\u2019une pipe! I must have lost my ticket, I can\u2019t find it anywhere,\u201d cried Cottard, with an agitation that was, in the circumstances, quite unjustified. He knew that at Douville, where a couple of landaus would be awaiting us, the collector would let him pass without a ticket, and would only bare his head all the more humbly, so that the salute might furnish an explanation of his indulgence, to wit that he had of course recognised Cottard as one of the Verdurins\u2019 regular guests. \u201cThey won\u2019t shove me in the lock-up for that,\u201d the doctor concluded. \u201cYou were saying, Sir,\u201d I inquired of Brichot, \u201cthat there used to be some famous waters near here; how do we know that?\u201d \u201cThe name of the next station is one of a multitude of proofs. It is called Fervaches.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t undlestand what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d mumbled the Princess, as though she were saying to me out of politeness: \u201cHe\u2019s rather a bore, ain\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cWhy, Princess, Fervaches means hot springs. Fervidae aquae. But to return to the young violinist,\u201d Brichot went on, \u201cI was quite forgetting, Cottard, to tell you the great news. Had you heard that our poor friend Dechambre, who used to be Mme. Verdurin\u2019s favourite pianist, has just died? It is terribly sad.\u201d \u201cHe was quite young,\u201d replied Cottard, \u201cbut he must have had some trouble with his liver, there must have been something sadly wrong in that quarter, he had been looking very queer indeed for a long time past.\u201d \u201cBut he was not so young as all that,\u201d said Brichot; \u201cin the days when Elstir and Swann used to come to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Dechambre had already made himself a reputation in Paris, and, what is remarkable, without having first received the baptism of success abroad. Ah! He was no follower of the Gospel according to Saint Barnum, that fellow.\u201d \u201cYou are mistaken, he could not have been going to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, at that time, he was still in the nursery.\u201d \u201cBut, unless my old memory plays me false, I was under the impression that Dechambre used to play Vinteuil\u2019s sonata for Swann, when that clubman, who had broken with the aristocracy, had still no idea that he was one day to become the embourgeoised Prince Consort of our national Odette.\u201d \u201cIt is impossible, Vinteuil\u2019s sonata was played at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s long after Swann ceased to come there,\u201d said the doctor, who, like all people who work hard and think that they remember many things which they imagine to be of use to them, forget many others, a condition which enables them to go into ecstasies over the memories of people who have nothing else to do. \u201cYou are hopelessly muddled, though your brain is as sound as ever,\u201d said the doctor with a smile. Brichot admitted that he was mistaken. The train stopped. We were at la Sogne. The name stirred my curiosity. \u201cHow I should like to know what all these names mean,\u201d I said to Cottard. \u201cYou must ask M. Brichot, he may know, perhaps.\u201d \u201cWhy, la Sogne is la Cicogne, Siconia,\u201d replied Brichot, whom I was burning to interrogate about many other names\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forgetting her attachment to her \u2018corner,\u2019 Mme. Sherbatoff kindly offered to change places with me, so that I might talk more easily with Brichot, whom I wanted to ask about other etymologies that interested me, and assured me that she did not mind in the least whether she travelled with her face or her back to the engine, standing, or seated, or anyhow. She remained on the defensive until she had discovered a newcomer\u2019s intentions, but as soon as she had realised that these were friendly, she would do everything in her power to oblige. At length the train stopped at the station of Douville-F\u00e9terne, which being more or less equidistant from the villages of F\u00e9terne and Douville, bore for this reason their hyphenated name. \u201cSaperlipopette!\u201d exclaimed Doctor Cottard, when we came to the barrier where the tickets were collected, and, pretending to have only just discovered his loss, \u201cI can\u2019t find my ticket, I must have lost it.\u201d But the collector, taking off his cap, assured him that it did not matter and smiled respectfully. The Princess (giving instructions to the coachman, as though she were a sort of lady in waiting to Mme. Verdurin, who, because of the Cambremers, had not been able to come to the station, as, for that matter, she rarely did) took me, and also Brichot, with herself in one of the carriages. The doctor, Saniette and Ski got into the other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The driver, although quite young, was the Verdurins\u2019 first coachman, the only one who had any right to the title; he took them, in the daytime, on all their excursions, for he knew all the roads, and in the evening went down to meet the faithful and took them back to the station later on. He was accompanied by extra helpers (whom he selected if necessary). He was an excellent fellow, sober and capable, but with one of those melancholy faces on which a fixed stare indicates that the merest trifle will make the person fly into a passion, not to say nourish dark thoughts. But at the moment he was quite happy, for he had managed to secure a place for his brother, another excellent type of fellow, with the Verdurins. We began by driving through Douville. Grassy knolls ran down from the village to the sea, in wide slopes to which their saturation in moisture and salt gave a richness, a softness, a vivacity of extreme tones. The islands and indentations of Rivebelle, far nearer now than at Balbec, gave this part of the coast the appearance, novel to me, of a relief map. We passed by some little bungalows, almost all of which were let to painters; turned into a track upon which some loose cattle, as frightened as were our horses, barred our way for ten minutes, and emerged upon the cliff road. \u201cBut, by the immortal gods,\u201d Brichot suddenly asked, \u201clet us return to that poor Dechambre; do you suppose Mme. Verdurin knows? Has anyone toldher?\u201d Mme. Verdurin, like most people who move in society, simply because she needed the society of other people, never thought of them again for a single day, as soon as, being dead, they could no longer come to the Wednesdays, nor to the Saturdays, nor dine without dressing. And one could not say of the little clan, a type in this respect of all salons, that it was composed of more dead than living members, seeing that, as soon as one was dead, it was as though one had never existed. But, to escape the nuisance of having to speak of the deceased, in other words to postpone one of the dinners \u2014 a thing impossible to the mistress \u2014 as a token of mourning, M. Verdurin used to pretend that the death of the faithful had such an effect on his wife that, in the interest of her health, it must never be mentioned to her. Moreover, and perhaps just because the death of other people seemed to him so conclusive, so vulgar an accident, the thought of his own death filled him with horror and he shunned any consideration that might lead to it. As for Brichot, since he was the soul of honesty and completely taken in by what M. Verdurin said about his wife, he dreaded for his friend\u2019s sake the emotions that such a bereavement must cause her. \u201cYes, she knew the worst this morning,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cit was impossible to keep it from her.\u201d \u201cAh! Thousand thunders of Zeus!\u201d cried Brichot. \u201cAh! it must have been a terrible blow, a friend of twenty-five years\u2019 standing. There was a man who was one of us.\u201d \u201cOf course, of course, what can you expect? Such incidents are bound to be painful; but Madame Verdurin is a brave woman, she is even more cerebral than emotive.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t altogether agree with the Doctor,\u201d said the Princess, whose rapid speech, her murmured accents, certainly made her appear both sullen and rebellious. \u201cMme. Verdurin, beneath a cold exterior, conceals treasures of sensibility. M. Verdurin told me that he had had great difficulty in preventing her from going to Paris for the funeral; he was obliged to let her think that it was all to be held in the country.\u201d \u201cThe devil! She wanted to go to Paris, did she? Of course, I know that she has a heart, too much heart perhaps. Poor Dechambre! As Madame Verdurin remarked not two months ago: \u2018Compared with him, Plant\u00e9, Paderewski, Risler himself are nowhere!\u2019 Ah, he could say with better reason than that limelighter Nero, who has managed to take in even German scholarship:Qualis artifex pereo! But he at least, Dechambre, must have died in the fulfilment of his priesthood, in the odour of Beethovenian devotion; and gallantly, I have no doubt; he had every right, that interpreter of German music, to pass away while celebrating the Mass in D. But he was, when all is said, the man to greet the unseen with a cheer, for that inspired performer would produce at times from the Parisianised Champagne stock of which he came, the swagger and smartness of a guardsman.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the height we had now reached, the sea suggested no longer, as at Balbec, the undulations of swelling mountains, but on the contrary the view, beheld from a mountain-top or from a road winding round its flank, of a blue-green glacier or a glittering plain, situated at a lower level. The lines of the currents seemed to be fixed upon its surface, and to have traced there for ever their concentric circles; the enamelled face of the sea which changed imperceptibly in colour, assumed towards the head of the bay, where an estuary opened, the blue whiteness of milk, in which little black boats that did not move seemed entangled like flies. I felt that from nowhere could one discover a vaster prospect. But at each turn in the road a fresh expanse was added to it and when we arrived at the Douville toll-house, the spur of the cliff which until then had concealed from us half the bay, withdrew, and all of a sudden I descried upon my left a gulf as profound as that which I had already had before me, but one that changed the proportions of the other and doubled its beauty. The air at this lofty point acquired a keenness and purity that intoxicated me. I adored the Verdurins; that they should have sent a carriage for us seemed to me a touching act of kindness. I should have liked to kiss the Princess. I told her that I had never seen anything so beautiful. She professed that she too loved this spot more than any other. But I could see that to her as to the Verdurins the thing that really mattered was not to gaze at the view like tourists, but to partake of good meals there, to entertain people whom they liked, to write letters, to read books, in short to live in these surroundings, passively allowing the beauty of the scene to soak into them rather than making it the object of their attention\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the toll-house, where the carriage had stopped for a moment at such a height above the sea that, as from a mountain-top, the sight of the blue gulf beneath almost made one dizzy, I opened the window; the sound, distinctly caught, of each wave that broke in turn had something sublime in its softness and precision. Was it not like an index of measurement which, upsetting all our ordinary impressions, shews us that vertical distances may be coordinated with horizontal, in contradiction of the idea that our mind generally forms of them; and that, though they bring the sky nearer to us in this way, they are not great; that they are indeed less great for a sound which traverses them as did the sound of those little waves, the medium through which it has to pass being purer. And in fact if one went back but a couple of yards below the toll-house, one could no longer distinguish that sound of waves, which six hundred feet of cliff had not robbed of its delicate, minute and soft precision. I said to myself that my grandmother would have listened to it with the delight that she felt in all manifestations of nature or art, in the simplicity of which one discerns grandeur. I was now at the highest pitch of exaltation, which raised everything round about me accordingly. It melted my heart that the Verdurins should have sent to meet us at the station. I said as much to the Princess, who seemed to think that I was greatly exaggerating so simple an act of courtesy. I know that she admitted subsequently to Cottard that she found me very enthusiastic; he replied that I was too emotional, required sedatives and ought to take to knitting. I pointed out to the Princess every tree, every little house smothered in its mantle of roses, I made her admire everything, I would have liked to take her in my arms and press her to my heart. She told me that she could see that I had a gift for painting, that of course I must sketch, that she was surprised that nobody had told her about it. And she confessed that the country was indeed pic-I turesque. We drove through, where it perched upon its height, the little I village of Englesqueville (Engleberti villa, Brichot informed us). \u201cBut are you quite sure that there will be a party this evening, in spite of Dechambre\u2019s death, Princess?\u201d he went on, without stopping to think that the presence at the station of the carriage in which we were sitting was in itself an answer to his question. \u201cYes,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cM. Verldulin insisted that it should not be put off, simply to keep his wife from thinking. And besides, after never failing for all these years to entertain on Wednesdays, such a change in her habits would have been bound to upset her. Her nerves are velly bad just now. M. Verdurin was particularly pleased that you were coming to dine this evening, because he knew that it would be a great distraction for Mme. Verdurin,\u201d said the Princess, forgetting her pretence of having never heard my name before. \u201cI think that it will be as well not to sayanything in front of Mme. Verdurin,\u201d the Princess added. \u201cAh! I am glad you warned me,\u201d Brichot artlessly replied. \u201cI shall pass on your suggestion to Cottard.\u201d The carriage stopped for a moment. It moved on again, but the sound that the wheels had been making in the village street had ceased. We had turned into the main avenue of la Raspeli\u00e8re where M. Verdurin stood waiting for us upon the steps. \u201cI did well to put on a dinner-jacket,\u201d he said, observing with pleasure that the faithful had put on theirs, \u201csince I have such smart gentlemen in my party.\u201d And as I apologised for not having changed: \u201cWhy, that\u2019s quite all right. We\u2019re all friends here. I should be delighted to offer you one of my own dinner-jackets, but it wouldn\u2019t fit you.\u201d The handclasp throbbing with emotion which, as he entered the hall of la Raspeli\u00e8re, and by way of condolence at the death of the pianist, Brichot gave our host elicited no response from the latter. I told him how greatly I admired the scenery. \u201cAh! All the better, and you\u2019ve seen nothing, we must take you round. Why not come and spend a week or two here, the air is excellent.\u201d Brichot was afraid that his handclasp had not been understood. \u201cAh! Poor Dechambre!\u201d he said, but in an undertone, in case Mme. Verdurin was within earshot. \u201cIt is terrible,\u201d replied M. Verdurin lightly. \u201cSo young,\u201d Brichot pursued the point. Annoyed at being detained over these futilities, M. Verdurin replied in a hasty tone and with an embittered groan, not of grief but of irritated impatience: \u201cWhy yes, of course, but what\u2019s to be done about it, it\u2019s no use crying over spilt milk, talking about him won\u2019t bring him back to life, will it?\u201d And, his civility returning with his joviality: \u201cCome along, my good Brichot, get your things off quickly. We have a bouillabaisse which mustn\u2019t be kept waiting. But, in heaven\u2019s name, don\u2019t start talking about Dechambre to Madame Verdurin. You know that she always hides her feelings, but she is quite morbidly sensitive. I give you my word, when she heard that Dechambre was dead, she almost cried,\u201d said M. Verdurin in a tone of profound irony. One might have concluded, from hearing him speak, that it implied a form of insanity to regret the death of a friend of thirty years\u2019 standing, and on the other hand one gathered that the perpetual union of M. Verdurin and his wife did not preclude his constantly criticising her and her frequently irritating him. \u201cIf you mention it to her, she will go and make herself ill again. It is deplorable, three weeks after her bronchitis. When that happens, it is I who have to be sick-nurse. You can understand that I have had more than enough of it. Grieve for Dechambre\u2019s fate in your heart as much as you like. Think of him, but do not speak about him. I was very fond of Dechambre, but you cannot blame me for being fonder still of my wife. Here\u2019s Cottard, now, you can ask him.\u201d And indeed, he knew that a family doctor can do many little services, such as prescribing that one must not give way to grief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The docile Cottard had said to the Mistress: \u201cUpset yourself like that, and to-morrow you will give me a temperature of 102,\u201d as he might have said to the cook: \u201cTo-morrow you will give me a riz de veau.\u201d Medicine, when it fails to cure the sick, busies itself with changing the sense of verbs and pronouns\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin was glad to find that Saniette, notwithstanding the snubs that he had had to endure two days earlier, had not deserted the little nucleus. And indeed Mme. Verdurin and her husband had acquired, in their idleness, cruel instincts for which the great occasions, occurring too rarely, no longer sufficed. They had succeeded in effecting a breach between Odette and Swann, between Brichot and his mistress. They would try it again with some one else, that was understood. But the opportunity did not present itself every day. Whereas, thanks to his shuddering sensibility, his timorous and quickly aroused shyness, Saniette provided them with a whipping-block for every day in the year. And so, for fear of his failing them, they took care always to invite him with friendly and persuasive words, such as the bigger boys at school, the old soldiers in a regiment, address to a recruit whom they are anxious to beguile so that they may get him into their clutches, with the sole object of flattering him for the moment and bullying him when he can no longer escape. \u201cWhatever you do,\u201d Brichot reminded Cottard, who had not heard what M. Verdurin was saying, \u201cmum\u2019s the word before Mme. Verdurin. Have no fear, O Cottard, you are dealing with a sage, as Theocritus says. Besides, M. Verdurin is right, what is the use of lamentations,\u201d he went on, for, being capable of assimilating forms of speech and the ideas which they suggested to him, but having no finer perception, he had admired in M. Verdurin\u2019s remarks the most courageous stoicism. \u201cAll the same, it is a great talent that has gone from the world.\u201d \u201cWhat, are you still talking about Dechambre,\u201d said M. Verdurin, who had gone on ahead of us, and, seeing that we were not following him, had turned back. \u201cListen,\u201d he said to Brichot, \u201cnothing is gained by exaggeration. The fact of his being dead is no excuse for making him out a genius, which he was not. He played well, I admit, and what is more, he was in his proper element here; transplanted, he ceased to exist. My wife was infatuated with him and made his reputation. You know what she is. I will go farther, in the interest of his own reputation he has died at the right moment, he is done to a turn, as the demoiselles de Caen, grilled according to the incomparable recipe of Pampilles, are going to be, I hope (unless you keep us standing here all night with your jeremiads in this Kasbah exposed to all the winds of heaven). You don\u2019t seriously expect us all to die of hunger because Dechambre is dead, when for the last year he was obliged to practise scales before giving a concert; to recover for the moment, and for the moment only, the suppleness of his wrists. Besides, you are going to hear this evening, or at any rate to meet, for the rascal is too fond of deserting his art, after dinner, for the card-table, somebody who is a far greater artist than Dechambre, a youngster whom my wife has discovered\u201d (as she had discovered Dechambre, and Paderewski, and everybody else): \u201cMorel. He has not arrived yet, the devil. He is coming with an old friend of his family whom he has picked up, and who bores him to tears, but otherwise, not to get into trouble with his father, he would have been obliged to stay down at Donci\u00e8res and keep him company: the Baron de Charlus.\u201d The faithful entered the drawing-room. M. Verdurin, who had remained behind with me while I took off my things, took my arm by way of a joke, as one\u2019s host does at a dinner-party when there is no lady for one to take in. \u201cDid you have a pleasant journey?\u201d \u201cYes, M. Brichot told me things which interested me greatly,\u201d said I, thinking of the etymologies, and because I had heard that the Verdurins greatly admired Brichot. \u201cI am surprised to hear that he told you anything,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201che is such a retiring man, and talks so little about the things he knows.\u201d This compliment did not strike me as being very apt. \u201cHe seems charming,\u201d I remarked. \u201cExquisite, delicious, not the sort of man you meet every day, such a light, fantastic touch, my wife adores him, and so do I!\u201d replied M. Verdurin in an exaggerated tone, as though repeating a lesson. Only then did I grasp that what he had said to me about Brichot was ironical. And I asked myself whether M. Verdurin, since those far-off days of which I had heard reports, had not shaken off the yoke of his wife\u2019s tutelage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sculptor was greatly astonished to learn that the Verdurins were willing to have M. de Charlus in their house. Whereas in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where M. de Charlus was so well known, nobody ever referred to his morals (of which most people had no suspicion, others remained doubtful, crediting him rather with intense but Platonic friendships, with behaving imprudently, while the enlightened few strenuously denied, shrugging their shoulders, any insinuation upon which some malicious Gallardon might venture), those morals, the nature of which was known perhaps to a few intimate friends, were, on the other hand, being denounced daily far from the circle in which he moved, just as, at times, the sound of artillery fire is audible only beyond a zone of silence. Moreover, in those professional and artistic circles where he was regarded as the typical instance of inversion, his great position in society, his noble origin were completely unknown, by a process analogous to that which, among the people of Rumania, has brought it about that the name of Ron-sard is known as that of a great nobleman, while his poetical work is unknown there. Not only that, the Rumanian estimate of Ronsard\u2019s nobility is founded upon an error. Similarly, if in the world of painters and actors M. de Charlus had such an evil reputation, that was due to their confusing him with a certain Comte Leblois de Charlus who was not even related to him (or, if so, the connexion was extremely remote), and who had been arrested, possibly by mistake, in the course of a police raid which had become historic. In short, all the stories related of our M. de Charlus referred to the other. Many professionals swore that they had had relations with M. de Charlus, and did so in good faith, believing that the false M. de Charlus was the true one, the false one possibly encouraging, partly from an affectation of nobility, partly to conceal his vice, a confusion which to the true one (the Baron whom we already know) was for a long time damaging, and afterwards, when he had begun to go down the hill, became a convenience, for it enabled him likewise to say: \u201cThat is not myself.\u201d And in the present instance it was not he to whom the rumours referred. Finally, what enhanced the falsehood of the reports of an actual fact (the Baron\u2019s tendencies), he had had an intimate and perfectly pure friendship with an author who, in the theatrical world, had for some reason acquired a similar reputation which he in no way deserved. When they were seen together at a first night, people would say: \u201cYou see,\u201d just as it was supposed that the Duchesse de Guermantes had immoral relations with the Princesse de Parme; an indestructible legend, for it would be disproved only in the presence of those two great ladies themselves, to which the people who repeated it would presumably never come any nearer than by staring at them through their glasses in the theatre and slandering them to the occupant of the next stall. Given M. de Charlus\u2019s morals, the sculptor concluded all the more readily that the Baron\u2019s social position must be equally low, since he had no sort of information whatever as to the family to which M. de Charlus belonged, his title or his name. Just as Cottard imagined that everybody knew that the degree of Doctor of Medicine implied nothing, the title of Consultant to a Hospital meant something, so people in society are mistaken when they suppose that everybody has the same idea of the social importance of their name as they themselves and the other people of their set\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Prince d\u2019Agrigente was regarded as a swindler by a club servant to whom he owed twenty-five louis, and regained his importance only in the Faubourg Saint-Germain where he had three sisters who were Duchesses, for it is not among the humble people in whose eyes he is of small account, but among the smart people who know what is what, that the great nobleman creates an effect. M. de Charlus, for that matter, was to learn in the course of the evening that his host had the vaguest ideas about the most illustrious ducal families\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certain that the Verdurins were making a grave mistake in allowing an individual of tarnished reputation to be admitted to so \u2018select\u2019 a household as theirs, the sculptor felt it his duty to take the Mistress aside. \u201cYou are entirely mistaken, besides I never pay any attention to those tales, and even if it were true, I may be allowed to point out that it could hardly compromise me!\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, furious, for Morel being the principal feature of the Wednesdays, the chief thing for her was not to give any offence to him. As for Cottard, he could not express an opinion, for he had asked leave to go upstairs for a moment to \u2018do a little job\u2019 in thebuen retiro, and after that, in M. Verdurin\u2019s bedroom, to write an extremely urgent letter for a patient\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A great publisher from Paris who had come to call, expecting to be invited to stay to dinner, withdrew abruptly, quickly, realising that he was not smart enough for the little clan. He was a tall, stout man, very dark, with a studious and somewhat cutting air. He reminded one of an ebony paper-knife\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin who, to welcome us in her immense drawing-room, in which displays of grasses, poppies, field-flowers, plucked only that morning, alternated with a similar theme painted on the walls, two centuries earlier, by an artist of exquisite taste, had risen for a moment from a game of cards which she was playing with an old friend, begged us to excuse her for just one minute while she finished her game, talking to us the while. What I told her about my impressions did not, however, seem altogether to please her. For one thing I was shocked to observe that she and her husband came indoors every day long before the hour of those sunsets which were considered so fine when seen from that cliff, and finer still from the terrace of la Raspeli\u00e8re, and which I would have travelled miles to see. \u201cYes, it\u2019s incomparable,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin carelessly, with a glance at the huge windows which gave the room a wall of glass. \u201cEven though we have it always in front of us, we never grow tired of it,\u201d and she turned her attention back to her cards. Now my very enthusiasm made me exacting. I expressed my regret that I could not see from the drawing-room the rocks of Darnetal, which, Elstir had told me, were quite lovely at that hour, when they reflected so many colours. \u201cAh! You can\u2019t see them from here, you would have to go to the end of the park, to the \u2018view of the bay.\u2019 From the seat there, you can take in the whole panorama. But you can\u2019t go there by yourself, you will lose your way. I can take you there, if you like,\u201d she added kindly. \u201cNo, no, you are not satisfied with the illness you had the other day, you want to make yourself ill again. He will come back, he can see the view of the bay another time.\u201d I did not insist, and understood that it was enough for the Verdurins to know that this sunset made its way into their drawing-room or dining-room, like a magnificent painting, like a priceless Japanese enamel, justifying the high rent that they were paying for la Raspeli\u00e8re, with plate and linen, but a thing to which they rarely raised their eyes; the important thing, here, for them was to live comfortably, to take drives, to feed well, to talk, to entertain agreeable friends whom they provided with amusing games of billiards, good meals, merry tea-parties. I noticed, however, later on, how intelligently they had learned to know the district, taking their guests for excursions as \u2018novel\u2019 as the music to which they made them listen. The part which the flowers of la Raspeli\u00e8re, the roads by the sea\u2019s edge, the old houses, the undiscovered churches, played in the life of M. Verdurin was so great that those people who saw him only in Paris and who, themselves, substituted for the life by the seaside and in the country the refinements of life in town could barely understand the idea that he himself formed of his own life, or the importance that his pleasures gave him in his own eyes. This importance was further enhanced by the fact that the Verdurins were convinced that la Raspeli\u00e8re, which they hoped to purchase, was a property without its match in the world. This superiority which their self-esteem made them attribute to la Raspeli\u00e8re justified in their eyes my enthusiasm which, but for that, would have annoyed them slightly, because of the disappointments which it involved (like my disappointment when long ago I had first listened to Berma) and which I frankly admitted to them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear the carriage coming back,\u201d the Mistress suddenly murmured. Let us state briefly that Mme. Verdurin, quite apart from the inevitable changes due to increasing years, no longer resembled what she had been at the time when Swann and Odette used to listen to the little phrase in her house. Even when she heard it played, she was no longer obliged to assume the air of attenuated admiration which she used to assume then, for that had become her normal expression. Under the influence of the countless neuralgias which the music of Bach, Wagner, Vinteuil, Debussy had given her, Mme. Verdurin\u2019s brow had assumed enormous proportions, like limbs that are finally crippled by rheumatism. Her temples, suggestive of a pair of beautiful, pain-stricken, milk-white spheres, in which Harmony rolled endlessly, flung back upon either side her silvered tresses, and proclaimed, on the Mistress\u2019s behalf, without any need for her to say a word: \u201cI know what is in store for me to-night.\u201d Her features no longer took the trouble to formulate successively aesthetic impressions of undue violence, for they had themselves become their permanent expression on a countenance ravaged and superb. This attitude of resignation to the ever impending sufferings inflicted by Beauty, and of the courage that was required to make her dress for dinner when she had barely recovered from the effects of the last sonata, had the result that Mme. Verdurin, even when listening to the most heartrending music, preserved a disdainfully impassive countenance, and actually withdrew into retirement to swallow her two spoonfuls of aspirin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes, here they are!\u201d M. Verdurin cried with relief when he saw the door open to admit Morel, followed by M. de Charlus. The latter, to whom dining with the Verdurins meant not so much going into society as going into questionable surroundings, was as frightened as a schoolboy making his way for the first time into a brothel with the utmost deference towards its mistress. Moreover the persistent desire that M. de Charlus felt to appear virile and frigid was overcome (when he appeared in the open doorway) by those traditional ideas of politeness which are awakened as soon as shyness destroys an artificial attitude and makes an appeal to the resources of the subconscious. When it is a Charlus, whether he be noble or plebeian, that is stirred by such a sentiment of instinctive and atavistic politeness to strangers, it is always the spirit of a relative of the female sex, attendant like a goddess, or incarnate as a double, that undertakes to introduce him into a strange drawing-room and to mould his attitude until he comes face to face with his hostess. Thus a young painter, brought up by a godly, Protestant, female cousin, will enter a room, his head aslant and quivering, his eyes raised to the ceiling, his hands gripping an invisible muff, the remembered shape of which and its real and tutelary presence will help the frightened artist to cross without agoraphobia the yawning abyss between the hall and the inner drawing-room. Thus it was that the pious relative, whose memory is helping him to-day, used to enter a room years ago, and with so plaintive an air that one was asking oneself what calamity she had come to announce, when from her first words one realised, as now in the case of the painter, that she had come to pay an after-dinner call. By virtue of the same law, which requires that life, in the interests of the still unfulfilled act, shall bring into play, utilise, adulterate, in a perpetual prostitution, the most respectable, it may be the most sacred, sometimes only the most innocent legacies from the past, and albeit in this instance it engendered a different aspect, the one of Mme. Cottard\u2019s nephews who distressed his family by his effeminate ways and the company he kept would always make a joyous entry as though he had a surprise in store for you or were going to inform you that he had been left a fortune, radiant with a happiness which it would have been futile to ask him to explain, it being due to his unconscious heredity and his misplaced sex. He walked upon tiptoe, was no doubt himself astonished that he was not holding a cardcase, offered you his hand parting his lips as he had seen his aunt part hers, and his uneasy glance was directed at the mirror in which he seemed to wish to make certain, albeit he was bare-headed, whether his hat, as Mme. Cottard had once inquired of Swann, was not askew. As for M. de Charlus, whom the society in which he had lived furnished, at this critical moment, with different examples, with other patterns of affability, and above all with the maxim that one must, in certain cases, when dealing with people of humble rank, bring into play and make use of one\u2019s rarest graces, which one normally holds in reserve, it was with a flutter, archly, and with the same sweep with which a skirt would have enlarged and impeded his waddling motion that he advanced upon Mme. Verdurin with so flattered and honoured an air that one would have said that to be taken to her house was for him a supreme favour. One would have thought that it was Mme. de Marsantes who was entering the room, so prominent at that moment was the woman whom a mistake on the part of Nature had enshrined in the body of M. de Charlus. It was true that the Baron had made every effort to obliterate this mistake and to assume a masculine appearance. But no sooner had he succeeded than, he having in the meantime kept the same tastes, this habit of looking at things through a woman\u2019s eyes gave him a fresh feminine appearance, due this time not to heredity but to his own way of living. And as he had gradually come to regard even social questions from the feminine point of view, and without noticing it, for it is not only by dint of lying to other people, but also by lying to oneself that one ceases to be aware that one is lying, albeit he had called upon his body to manifest (at the moment of his entering the Verdurins\u2019 drawing-room) all the courtesy of a great nobleman, that body which had fully understood what M. de Charlus had ceased to apprehend, displayed, to such an extent that the Baron would have deserved the epithet \u2018ladylike,\u2019 all the attractions of a great lady. Not that there need be any connexion between the appearance of M. de Charlus and the fact that sons, who do not always take after their fathers, even without being inverts, and though they go after women, may consummate upon their faces the profanation of their mothers. But we need not consider here a subject that deserves a chapter to itself: the Profanation of the Mother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albeit other reasons dictated this transformation of M. de Charlus, and purely physical ferments set his material substance \u2018working\u2019 and made his body pass gradually into the category of women\u2019s bodies, nevertheless the change that we record here was of spiritual origin. By dint of supposing yourself to be ill you become ill, grow thin, are too weak to rise from your bed, suffer from nervous enteritis. By dint of thinking tenderly of men you become a woman, and an imaginary spirit hampers your movements. The obsession, just as in the other instance it affects your health, may in this instance alter your sex. Morel, who accompanied him, came to shake hands with me. From that first moment, owing to a twofold change that occurred in him I formed (alas, I was not warned in time to act upon it!) a bad impression of him. I have said that Morel, having risen above his father\u2019s menial status, was generally pleased to indulge in a contemptuous familiarity. He had talked to me on the day when he brought me the photographs without once addressing me as Monsieur, treating me as an inferior. What was my surprise at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s to see him bow very low before me, and before me alone, and to hear, before he had even uttered a syllable to anyone else, words of respect, most respectful \u2014 such words as I thought could not possibly flow from his pen or fall from his lips \u2014 addressed to myself. I at once suspected that he had some favour to ask of me. Taking me aside a minute later: \u201cMonsieur would be doing me a very great service,\u201d he said to me, going so far this time as to address me in the third person, \u201cby keeping from Mme. Verdurin and her guests the nature of the profession that my father practised with his uncle. It would be best to say that he was, in your family, the agent for estates so considerable as to put him almost on a level with your parents,\u201d Morel\u2019s request annoyed me intensely because it obliged me to magnify not his father\u2019s position, in which I took not the slightest interest, but the wealth \u2014 the apparent wealth of my own, which I felt to be absurd. But he appeared so unhappy, so pressing, that I could not refuse him. \u201cNo, before dinner,\u201d he said in an imploring tone, \u201cMonsieur can easily find some excuse for taking Mme. Verdurin aside.\u201d This was what, in the end, I did, trying to enhance to the best of my ability the distinction of Morel\u2019s father, without unduly exaggerating the \u2018style,\u2019 the \u2018worldly goods\u2019 of my own family. It went like a letter through the post, notwithstanding the astonishment of Mme. Verdurin, who had had a nodding acquaintance with my grandfather. And as she had no tact, hated family life (that dissolvent of the little nucleus), after telling me that she remembered, long ago, seeing my great-grandfather, and after speaking of him as of somebody who was almost an idiot, who would have been incapable of understanding the little group, and who, to use her expression, \u201cwas not one of us,\u201d she said to me: \u201cFamilies are such a bore, the only thing is to get right away from them;\u201d and at once proceeded to tell me of a trait in my great-grandfather\u2019s character of which I was unaware, although I might have suspected it at home (I had never seen him, but they frequently spoke of him), his remarkable stinginess (in contrast to the somewhat excessive generosity of my great-uncle, the friend of the lady in pink and Morel\u2019s father\u2019s employer): \u201cWhy, of course, if your grandparents had such a grand agent, that only shews that there are all sorts of people in a family. Your grandfather\u2019s father was so stingy that, at the end of his life, when he was almost half-witted \u2014 between you and me, he was never anything very special, you are worth the whole lot of them \u2014 he could not bring himself to pay a penny for his ride on the omnibus. So that they were obliged to have him followed by somebody who paid his fare for him, and to let the old miser think that his friend M. de Persigny, the Cabinet Minister, had given him a permit to travel free on the omnibuses. But I am delighted to hear that our Morel\u2019s father held such a good position. I was under the impression that he had been a schoolmaster, but that\u2019s nothing, I must have misunderstood. In any case, it makes not the slightest difference, for I must tell you that here we appreciate only true worth, the personal contribution, what I call the participation. Provided that a person is artistic, provided in a word that he is one of the brotherhood, nothing else matters.\u201d The way in which Morel was one of the brotherhood was \u2014 so far as I have been able to discover \u2014 that he was sufficiently fond of both women and men to satisfy either sex with the fruits of his experience of the other. But what it is essential to note here is that as soon as I had given him my word that I would speak on his behalf to Mme. Verdurin, as soon, moreover, as I had actually done so, and without any possibility of subsequent retractation, Morel\u2019s \u2018respect\u2019 for myself vanished as though by magic, the formal language of respect melted away, and indeed for some time he avoided me, contriving to appear contemptuous of me, so that if Mme. Verdurin wanted me to give him a message, to ask him to play something, he would continue to talk to one of the faithful, then move on to another, changing his seat if I approached him. The others were obliged to tell him three or four times that I had spoken to him, after which he would reply, with an air of constraint, briefly, that is to say unless we were by ourselves. When that happened, he was expansive, friendly, for there was a charming side to him. I concluded all the same from this first evening that his must be a vile nature, that he would not, at a pinch, shrink from any act of meanness, was incapable of gratitude. In which he resembled the majority of mankind. But inasmuch as I had inherited a strain of my grandmother\u2019s nature, and enjoyed the diversity of other people without expecting anything of them or resenting anything that they did, I overlooked his baseness, rejoiced in his gaiety when it was in evidence, and indeed in what I believe to have been a genuine affection on his part when, having gone the whole circuit of his false ideas of human nature, he realised (with a jerk, for he shewed strange reversions to a blind and primitive savagery) that my kindness to him was disinterested, that my indulgence arose not from a want of perception but from what he called goodness; and, more important still, I was enraptured by his art which indeed was little more than an admirable virtuosity, but which made me (without his being in the intellectual sense of the word a real musician) hear again or for the first time so much good music. Moreover a manager \u2014 M. de Charlus (whom I had not suspected of such talents, albeit Mme. de Guermantes, who had known him a very different person in their younger days, asserted that he had composed a sonata for her, painted a fan, and so forth), modest in regard to his true merits, but possessing talents of the first order, contrived to place this virtuosity at the service of a versatile artistic sense which increased it tenfold. Imagine a merely skilful performer in the Russian ballet, formed, educated, developed in all directions by M. Diaghileff\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had just given Mme. Verdurin the message with which Morel had charged me and was talking to M. de Charlus about Saint-Loup, when Cottard burst into the room announcing, as though the house were on fire, that the Cambremers had arrived. Mme. Verdurin, not wishing to appear before strangers such as M. de Charlus (whom Cottard had not seen) and myself to attach any great importance to the arrival of the Cambremers, did not move, made no response to the announcement of these tidings, and merely said to the doctor, fanning herself gracefully, and adopting the tone of a Marquise in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais: \u201cThe Baron has just been telling us. . . . \u201d This was too much for Cottard! Less abruptly than he would have done in the old days, for learning and high positions had added weight to his utterance, but with the emotion, nevertheless, which he recaptured at the Verdurins\u2019, he exclaimed: \u201cA Baron! What Baron? Where\u2019s the Baron?\u201d staring around the room with an astonishment that bordered on incredulity. Mme. Verdurin, with the affected indifference of a hostess when a servant has, in front of her guests, broken a valuable glass, and with the artificial, highfalutin tone of a conservatoire prize-winner acting in a play by the younger Dumas, replied, pointing with her fan to Morel\u2019s patron: \u201cWhy, the Baron de Charlus, to whom let me introduce you, M. le Professeur Cottard.\u201d Mme. Verdurin was, for that matter, by no means sorry to have an opportunity of playing the leading lady. M. de Charlus proffered two fingers which the Professor clasped with the kindly smile of a \u2018Prince of Science.\u2019 But he stopped short upon seeing the Cambremers enter the room, while M. de Charlus led me into a corner to tell me something, not without feeling my muscles, which is a German habit. M. de Cambremer bore no resemblance to the old Marquise. To anyone who had only heard of him, or of letters written by him, well and forcibly expressed, his personal appearance was startling. No doubt, one would grow accustomed to it. But his nose had chosen to place itself aslant above his mouth, perhaps the only crooked line, among so many, which one would never have thought of tracing upon his face, and one that indicated a vulgar stupidity, aggravated still further by the proximity of a Norman complexion on cheeks that were like two ripe apples. It is possible that the eyes of M. de Cambremer retained behind their eyelids a trace of the sky of the Cotentin, so soft upon sunny days when the wayfarer amuses himself in watching, drawn up by the roadside, and counting in their hundreds the shadows of the poplars, but those eyelids, heavy, bleared and drooping, would have prevented the least flash of intelligence from escaping. And so, discouraged by the meagreness of that azure glance, one returned to the big crooked nose. By a transposition of the senses, M. de Cambremer looked at you with his nose. This nose of his was not ugly, it was if anything too handsome, too bold, too proud of its own importance. Arched, polished, gleaming, brand new, it was amply prepared to atone for the inadequacy of his eyes. Unfortunately, if the eyes are sometimes the organ through which our intelligence is revealed, the nose (to leave out of account the intimate solidarity and the unsuspected repercussion of one feature upon the rest), the nose is generally the organ in which stupidity is most readily displayed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The propriety of the dark clothes which M. de Cambremer invariably wore, even in the morning, might well reassure those who were dazzled and exasperated by the insolent brightness of the seaside attire of people whom they did not know; still it was impossible to understand why the chief magistrate\u2019s wife should have declared with an air of discernment and authority, as a person who knows far more than you about the high society of Alen\u00e7on, that on seeing M. de Cambremer one immediately felt oneself, even before one knew who he was, in the presence of a man of supreme distinction, of a man of perfect breeding, a change from the sort of person one saw at Balbec, a man in short in whose company one could breathe freely. He was to her, stifled by all those Balbec tourists who did not know her world, like a bottle of smelling salts. It seemed to me on the contrary that he was one of the people whom my grandmother would at once have set down as \u2018all wrong,\u2019 and that, as she had no conception of snobbishness, she would no doubt have been stupefied that he could have succeeded in winning the hand of Mlle. Legrandin, who must surely be difficult to please, having a brother who was \u2018so refined.\u2019 At best one might have said of M. de Cambremer\u2019s plebeian ugliness that it was redolent of the soil and preserved a very ancient local tradition; one was reminded, on examining his faulty features, which one would have liked to correct, of those names of little Norman towns as to the etymology of which my friend the cur\u00e9 was mistaken because the peasants, mispronouncing the names, or having misunderstood the Latin or Norman words that underlay them, have finally fixed in a barbarism to be found already in the cartularies, as Brichot would have said, a wrong meaning and a fault of pronunciation. Life in these old towns may, for all that, be pleasant enough, and M. de Cambremer must have had his good points, for if it was in a mother\u2019s nature that the old Marquise should prefer her son to her daughter-in-law, on the other hand, she, who had other children, of whom two at least were not devoid of merit, was often heard to declare that the Marquis was, in her opinion, the best of the family. During the short time he had spent in the army, his messmates, finding Cambremer too long a name to pronounce, had given him the nickname Cancan, implying a flow of chatter, which he in no way merited. He knew how to brighten a dinner-party to which he was invited by saying when the fish (even if it were stale) or the entr\u00e9e came in: \u201cI say, that looks a fine animal.\u201d And his wife, who had adopted upon entering the family everything that she supposed to form part of their customs, put herself on the level of her husband\u2019s friends and perhaps sought to please him, like a mistress, and as though she had been involved in his bachelor existence, by saying in a careless tone when she was speaking of him to officers: \u201cYou shall see Cancan presently. Cancan has gone to Balbec, but he will be back this evening.\u201d She was furious at having compromised herself by coming to the Verdurins\u2019 and had done so only upon the entreaties of her mother-in-law and husband, in the hope of renewing the lease. But, being less well-bred than they, she made no secret of the ulterior motive and for the last fortnight had been making fun of this dinner-party to her women friends. \u201cYou know we are going to dine with our tenants. That will be well worth an increased rent. As a matter of fact, I am rather curious to see what they have done to our poor old la Raspeli\u00e8re\u201d (as though she had been born in the house, and would find there all her old family associations). \u201cOur old keeper told me only yesterday that you wouldn\u2019t know the place. I can\u2019t bear to think of all that must be going on there. I am sure we shall have to have the whole place disinfected before we move in again.\u201d She arrived haughty and morose, with the air of a great lady whose castle, owing to a state of war, is occupied by the enemy, but who nevertheless feels herself at home and makes a point of shewing the conquerors that they are intruding. Mme. de Cambremer could not see me at first for I was in a bay at the side of the room with M. de Charlus, who was telling me that he had heard from Morel that Morel\u2019s father had been an \u2018agent\u2019 in my family, and that he, Charlus, credited me with sufficient intelligence and magnanimity (a term common to himself and Swann) to forego the mean and ignoble pleasure which vulgar little idiots (I was warned) would not have failed, in my place, to give themselves by revealing to our hosts details which they might regard as derogatory. \u201cThe mere fact that I take an interest in him and extend my protection over him, gives him a pre-eminence and wipes out the past,\u201d the Baron concluded. As I listened to him and promised the silence which I would have kept even without any hope of being considered in return intelligent and magnanimous, I was looking at Mme. de Cambremer. And I had difficulty in recognising the melting, savoury morsel which I had had beside me the other afternoon at teatime, on the terrace at Balbec, in the Norman rock-cake that I now saw, hard as a rock, in which the faithful would in vain have tried to set their teeth. Irritated in anticipation by the knowledge that her husband inherited his mother\u2019s simple kindliness, which would make him assume a flattered expression whenever one of the faithful was presented to him, anxious however to perform her duty as a leader of society, when Brichot had been named to her she decided to make him and her husband acquainted, as she had seen her more fashionable friends do, but, anger or pride prevailing over the desire to shew her knowledge of the world, she said, not, as she ought to have said: \u201cAllow me to introduce my husband,\u201d but: \u201cI introduce you to my husband,\u201d holding aloft thus the banner of the Cambremers, without avail, for her husband bowed as low before Brichot as she had expected. But all Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s ill humour vanished in an instant when her eye fell on M. de Charlus, whom she knew by sight. Never had she succeeded in obtaining an introduction, even at the time of her intimacy with Swann. For as M. de Charlus always sided with the woman, with his sister-in-law against M. de Guermantes\u2019s mistresses, with Odette, at that time still unmarried, but an old flame of Swann\u2019s, against the new, he had, as a stern defender of morals and faithful protector of homes, given Odette \u2014 and kept \u2014 the promise that he would never allow himself to be presented to Mme. de Cambremer. She had certainly never guessed that it was at the Verdurins\u2019 that she was at length to meet this unapproachable person. M. de Cambremer knew that this was a great joy to her, so great that he himself was moved by it and looked at his wife with an air that implied: \u201cYou are glad now you decided to come, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He spoke very little, knowing that he had married a superior woman. \u201cI, all unworthy,\u201d he would say at every moment, and spontaneously quoted a fable of La Fontaine and one of Florian which seemed to him to apply to his ignorance, and at the same time enable him, beneath the outward form of a contemptuous flattery, to shew the men of science who were not members of the Jockey that one might be a sportsman and yet have read fables. The unfortunate thing was that he knew only two of them. And so they kept cropping up. Mme. de Cambremer was no fool, but she had a number of extremely irritating habits. With her the corruption of names bore absolutely no trace of aristocratic disdain. She was not the person to say, like the Duchesse de Guermantes (whom the mere fact of her birth ought to have preserved even more than Mme. de Cambremer from such an absurdity), with a pretence of not remembering the unfashionable name (albeit it is now that of one of the women whom it is most difficult to approach) of Julien de Monch\u00e2teau: \u201ca little Madame . . . Pica della Mirandola.\u201d No, when Mme. de Cambremer said a name wrong it was out of kindness of heart, so as not to appear to know some damaging fact, and when, in her sincerity, she admitted it, she tried to conceal it by altering it. If, for instance, she was defending a woman, she would try to conceal the fact, while determined not to lie to the person who had asked her to tell the truth, that Madame So-and-so was at the moment the mistress of M. Sylvain Levy, and would say: \u201cNo . . . I know absolutely nothing about her, I fancy that people used to charge her with having inspired a passion in a gentleman whose name I don\u2019t know, something like Cahn, Kohn, Kuhn; anyhow, I believe the gentleman has been dead for years and that there was never anything between them.\u201d This is an analogous, but contrary process to that adopted by liars who think that if they alter their statement of what they have been doing when they make it to a mistress or merely to another man, their listener will not immediately see that the expression (like her Cahn, Kohn, Kuhn) is interpolated, is of a different texture from the rest of the conversation, has a double meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin whispered in her husband\u2019s ear: \u201cShall I offer my arm to the Baron de Charlus? As you will have Mme. de Cambremer on your right, we might divide the honours.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201csince the other is higher in rank\u201d (meaning that M. de Cambremer was a Marquis), \u201cM. de Charlus is, strictly speaking, his inferior.\u201d \u201cVery well, I shall put him beside the Princess.\u201d And Mme. Verdurin introduced Mme. Sherbatoff to M. de Charlus; each of them bowed in silence, with an air of knowing all about the other and of promising a mutual secrecy. M. Verdurin introduced me to M. de Cambremer. Before he had even begun to speak in his loud and slightly stammering voice, his tall figure and high complexion displayed in their oscillation the martial hesitation of a commanding officer who tries to put you at your ease and says: \u201cI have heard about you, I shall see what can be done; your punishment shall be remitted; we don\u2019t thirst for blood here; it will be all right.\u201d Then, as he shook my hand: \u201cI think you know my mother,\u201d he said to me. The word \u2018think\u2019 seemed to him appropriate to the discretion of a first meeting, but not to imply any uncertainty, for he went on: \u201cI have a note for you from her.\u201d M. de Cambremer took a childish pleasure in revisiting a place where he had lived for so long. \u201cI am at home again,\u201d he said to Mme. Verdurin, while his eyes marvelled at recognising the flowers painted on panels over the doors, and the marble busts on their high pedestals. He might, all the same, have felt himself at sea, for Mme. Verdurin had brought with her a quantity of fine old things of her own. In this respect, Mme. Verdurin, while regarded by the Cambremers as having turned everything upside down, was not revolutionary but intelligently conservative in a sense which they did not understand. They were thus wrong in accusing her of hating the old house and of degrading it by hanging plain cloth curtains instead of their rich plush, like an ignorant parish priest reproaching a diocesan architect with putting back in its place the old carved wood which the cleric had thrown on the rubbish heap, and had seen fit to replace with ornaments purchased in the Place Saint-Sulpice. Furthermore, a herb garden was beginning to take the place, in front of the mansion, of the borders that were the pride not merely of the Cambremers but of their gardener. The latter, who regarded the Cambremers as his sole masters, and groaned beneath the yoke of the Verdurins, as though the place were under occupation for the moment by an invading army, went in secret to unburden his griefs to its dispossessed mistress, grew irate at the scorn that was heaped upon his araucarias, begonias, house-leeks, double dahlias, and at anyone\u2019s daring in so grand a place to grow such common plants as camomile and maidenhair. Mme. Verdurin felt this silent opposition and had made up her mind, if she took a long lease of la Raspeli\u00e8re or even bought the place, to make one of her conditions the dismissal of the gardener, by whom his old mistress, on the contrary, set great store. He had worked for her without payment, when times were bad, he adored her; but by that odd multiformity of opinion which we find in the lower orders, among whom the most profound moral scorn is embedded in the most passionate admiration, which in turn overlaps old and undying grudges, he used often to say of Mme. de Cambremer who, in \u201870, in a house that she owned in the East of France, surprised by the invasion, had been obliged to endure for a month the contact of the Germans: \u201cWhat many people can\u2019t forgive Mme. la Marquise is that during the war she took the side of the Prussians and even had them to stay in her house. At any other time, I could understand it; but in war time, she ought not to have done it. It is not right.\u201d So that he was faithful to her unto death, venerated her for her goodness, and firmly believed that she had been guilty of treason. Mme. Verdurin was annoyed that M. de Cambremer should pretend to feel so much at home at la Raspeli\u00e8re. \u201cYou must notice a good many changes, all the same,\u201d she replied. \u201cFor one thing there were those big bronze Barbedienne devils and some horrid little plush chairs which I packed off at once to the attic, though even that is too good a place for them.\u201d After this bitter retort to M. de Cambremer, she offered him her arm to go in to dinner. He hesitated for a moment, saying to himself: \u201cI can\u2019t, really, go in before M. de Charlus.\u201d But supposing the other to be an old friend of the house, seeing that he was not set in the post of honour, he decided to take the arm that was offered him and told Mme. Verdurin how proud he felt to be admitted into the symposium (so it was that he styled the little nucleus, not without a smile of satisfaction at his knowledge of the term). Cottard, who was seated next to M. de Charlus, beamed at him through his glass, to make his acquaintance and to break the ice, with a series of winks far more insistent than they would have been in the old days, and not interrupted by fits of shyness. And these engaging glances, enhanced by the smile that accompanied them, were no longer dammed by the glass but overflowed on all sides. The Baron, who readily imagined people of his own kind everywhere, had no doubt that Cottard was one, and was making eyes at him. At once he turned on the Professor the cold shoulder of the invert, as contemptuous of those whom he attracts as he is ardent in pursuit of such as attract him. No doubt, albeit each one of us speaks mendaciously of the pleasure, always refused him by destiny, of being loved, it is a general law, the application of which is by no means confined to the Charlus type, that the person whom we do not love and who does love us seems to us quite intolerable. To such a person, to a woman of whom we say not that she loves us but that she bores us, we prefer the society of any other, who has neither her charm, nor her looks, nor her brains. She will recover these, in our estimation, only when she has ceased to love us. In this light, we might see only the transposition, into odd terms, of this universal rule in the irritation aroused in an invert by a man who displeases him and runs after him. And so, whereas the ordinary man seeks to conceal what he feels, the invert is implacable in making it felt by the man who provokes it, as he would certainly not make it felt by a woman, M. de Charlus for instance by the Princesse de Guermantes, whose passion for him bored him, but flattered him. But when they see another man shew a peculiar liking for them, then, whether because they fail to realise that this liking is the same as their own, or because it annoys them to be reminded that this liking, which they glorify so long as it is they themselves that feel it, is regarded as a vice, or from a desire to rehabilitate themselves by a sensational display in circumstances in which it costs them nothing, or from a fear of being unmasked which they at once recover as soon as desire no longer leads them blindfold from one imprudence to another, or from rage at being subjected, by the equivocal attitude of another person, to the injury which, by their own attitude, if that other person attracted them, they would not be afraid to inflict on him, the men who do not in the least mind following a young man for miles, never taking their eyes off him in the theatre, even if he is with friends, and there is therefore a danger of their compromising him with them, may be heard, if a man who does not attract them merely looks at them, to say: \u201cSir, for what do you take me?\u201d (simply because he takes them for what they are) \u201cI don\u2019t understand, no, don\u2019t attempt to explain, you are quite mistaken,\u201d pass if need be from words to blows, and, to a person who knows the imprudent stranger, wax indignant: \u201cWhat, you know that loathsome creature. He stares at one so! . . . A fine way to behave!\u201d M. de Charlus did not go quite as far as this, but assumed the offended, glacial air adopted, when one appears to be suspecting them, by women who are not of easy virtue, even more by women who are. Furthermore, the invert brought face to face with an invert sees not merely an unpleasing image of himself which, being purely inanimate, could at the worst only injure his self-esteem, but a second self, living, acting in the same sphere, capable therefore of injuring him in his loves. And so it is from an instinct of self-preservation that he will speak evil of the possible rival, whether to people who are able to do him some injury (nor does invert the first mind being thought a liar when he thus denounces invert the second before people who may know all about his own case), or to the young man whom he has \u2018picked up,\u2019 who is perhaps going to be snatched away from him and whom it is important to persuade that the very things which it is to his advantage to do with the speaker would be the bane of his life if he allowed himself to do them with the other person. To M. de Charlus, who was thinking perhaps of the \u2014 wholly imaginary \u2014 dangers in which the presence of this Cottard whose smile he misinterpreted might involve Morel, an invert who did not attract him was not merely a caricature of himself, but was a deliberate rival. A tradesman, practising an uncommon trade, who, on his arrival in the provincial town where he intends to settle for life discovers that, in the same square, directly opposite, the same trade is being carried on by a competitor, is no more discomfited than a Charlus who goes down to a quiet spot to make love unobserved and, on the day of his arrival, catches sight of the local squire or the barber, whose aspect and manner leave no room for doubt. The tradesman often comes to regard his competitor with hatred; this hatred degenerates at times into melancholy, and, if there be but a sufficient strain of heredity, one has seen in small towns the tradesman begin to shew signs of insanity which is cured only by his deciding to sell his stock and goodwill and remove to another place. The invert\u2019s rage is even more agonising. He has realised that from the first moment the squire and the barber have desired his young companion. Even though he repeat to him a hundred times daily that the barber and the squire are scoundrels whose contact would dishonour him, he is obliged, like Harpagon, to watch over his treasure, and rises in the night to make sure that it is not being stolen. And it is this no doubt that, even more than desire, or the convenience of habits shared in common, and almost as much as that experience of oneself which is the only true experience, makes one invert detect another with a rapidity and certainty that are almost infallible. He may be mistaken for a moment, but a rapid divination brings him back to the truth. And so M. de Charlus\u2019s error was brief. His divine discernment shewed him after the first minute that Cottard was not of his kind, and that he need not fear his advances either for himself, which would merely have annoyed him, or for Morel, which would have seemed to him a more serious matter. He recovered his calm, and as he was still beneath the influence of the transit of Venus Androgyne, now and again, he smiled a faint smile at the Verdurins without taking the trouble to open his mouth, merely curving his lips at one corner, and for an instant kindled a coquettish light in his eyes, he so obsessed with virility, exactly as his sister-in-law the Duchesse de Guermantes might have done. \u201cDo you shoot much, Sir?\u201d said M. Verdurin with a note of contempt to M. de Cambremer. \u201cHas Ski told you of the near shave we had to-day?\u201d Cottard inquired of the mistress. \u201cI shoot mostly in the forest of Chantepie,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer. \u201cNo, I have told her nothing,\u201d said Ski. \u201cDoes it deserve its name?\u201d Brichot asked M. de Cambremer, after a glance at me from the corner of his eye, for he had promised me that he would introduce the topic of derivations, begging me at the same time not to let the Cambremers know the scorn that he felt for those furnished by the Combray cur\u00e9. \u201cI am afraid I must be very stupid, but I don\u2019t grasp your question,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cI mean to say: do many pies sing in it?\u201d replied Brichot. Cottard meanwhile could not bear Mme. Verdurin\u2019s not knowing that they had nearly missed the train. \u201cOut with it,\u201d Mme. Cottard said to her husband encouragingly, \u201ctell us your odyssey.\u201d \u201cWell, really, it is quite out of the Ordinary,\u201d said the doctor, and repeated his narrative from the beginning. \u201cWhen I saw that the train was in the station, I stood thunderstruck. It was all Ski\u2019s fault. You are somewhat wide of the mark in your information, my dear fellow! And there was Brichot waiting for us at the station!\u201d \u201cI assumed,\u201d said the scholar, casting around him what he could still muster of a glance and smiling with his thin lips, \u201cthat if you had been detained at Graincourt, it would mean that you had encountered some peripatetic siren.\u201d \u201cWill you hold your tongue, if my wife were to hear you!\u201d said the Professor. \u201cThis wife of mine, it is jealous.\u201d \u201cAh! That Brichot,\u201d cried Ski, moved to traditional merriment by Brichot\u2019s spicy witticism, \u201che is always the same;\u201d albeit he had no reason to suppose that the university don had ever indulged in obscenity. And, to embellish this consecrated utterance with the ritual gesture, he made as though he could not resist the desire to pinch Brichot\u2019s leg. \u201cHe never changes, the rascal,\u201d Ski went on, and without stopping to think of the effect, at once tragic and comic, that the don\u2019s semi-blindness gave to his words: \u201cAlways a sharp look-out for the ladies.\u201d \u201cYou see,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, \u201cwhat it is to meet with a scholar. Here have I been shooting for fifteen years in the forest of Chantepie, and I\u2019ve never even thought of what the name meant.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer cast a stern glance at her husband; she did not like him to humble himself thus before Brichot. She was even more annoyed when, at every \u2018ready-made\u2019 expression that Cancan employed, Cottard, who knew the ins and outs of them all, having himself laboriously acquired them, pointed out to the Marquis, who admitted his stupidity, that they meant nothing. \u201cWhy \u2018stupid as a cabbage?\u2019 Do you suppose cabbages are stupider than anything else? You say:\u2018repeat the same thing thirty-six times.\u2019 Why thirty-six? Why do you say:\u2018sleep like a top?\u2019 Why \u2018Thunder of Brest?\u2019 Why \u2018play four hundred tricks?\u2019\u201d But at this, the defence of M. de Cambremer was taken up by Brichot who explained the origin of each of these expressions. But Mme. de Cambremer was occupied principally in examining the changes that the Verdurins had introduced at la Raspeli\u00e8re, in order that she might be able to criticise some, and import others, or possibly the same ones, to F\u00e9terne. \u201cI keep wondering what that lustre is that\u2019s hanging all crooked. I can hardly recognise my old Raspeli\u00e8re,\u201d she went on, with a familiarly aristocratic air, as she might have spoken of an old servant meaning not so much to indicate his age as to say that she had seen him in his cradle. And, as she was a trifle bookish in her speech: \u201cAll the same,\u201d she added in an undertone, \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that if I were inhabiting another person\u2019s house, I should feel some compunction about altering everything like this.\u201d \u201cIt is a pity you didn\u2019t come with them,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin to M. de Charlus and Morel, hoping that M. de Charlus was now \u2018enrolled\u2019 and would submit to the rule that they must all arrive by the same train. \u201cYou are sure that Chantepie means the singing magpie, Chochotte?\u201d she went on, to shew that, like the great hostess that she was, she could join in every conversation at the same time. \u201cTell me something about this violinist,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer said to me, \u201che interests me; I adore music, and it seems to me that I have heard of him before, complete my education.\u201d She had heard that Morel had come with M. de Charlus and hoped, by getting the former to come to her house, to make friends with the latter. She added, however, so that I might not guess her reason for asking, \u201cM. Brichot, too, interests me.\u201d For, even if she was highly cultivated, just as certain persons inclined to obesity eat hardly anything, and take exercise all day long without ceasing to grow visibly fatter, so Mme. de Cambremer might in vain master, and especially at F\u00e9terne, a philosophy that became ever more esoteric, music that became ever more subtle, she emerged from these studies only to weave plots that would enable her to cut the middle-class friends of her girlhood and to form the connexions which she had originally supposed to be part of the social life of her \u2018in laws,\u2019 and had then discovered to be far more exalted and remote. A philosopher who was not modern enough for her, Leibnitz, has said that the way is long from the intellect to the heart. This way Mme. de Cambremer had been no more capable than her brother of traversing. Abandoning the study of John Stuart Mill only for that of Lachelier, the less she believed in the reality of the external world, the more desperately she sought to establish herself, before she died, in a good position in it. In her passion for realism in art, no object seemed to her humble enough to serve as a model to painter or writer. A fashionable picture or novel would have made her feel sick; Tolstoi\u2019s mujiks, or Millet\u2019s peasants, were the extreme social boundary beyond which she did not allow the artist to pass. But to cross the boundary that limited her own social relations, to raise herself to an intimate acquaintance with Duchesses, this was the goal of all her efforts, so ineffective had the spiritual treatment to which she subjected herself, by the study of great masterpieces, proved in overcoming the congenital and morbid snobbishness that had developed in her. This snobbishness had even succeeded in curing certain tendencies to avarice and adultery to which in her younger days she had been inclined, just as certain peculiar and permanent pathological conditions seem to render those who are subject to them immune to other maladies. I could not, all the same, refrain, as I listened to her, from giving her credit, without deriving any pleasure from them, for the refinement of her expressions. They were those that are used, at a given date, by all the people of the same intellectual breadth, so that the refined expression provides us at once, like the arc of a circle, with the means to describe and limit the entire circumference. And so the effect of these expressions is that the people who employ them bore me immediately, because I feel that I already know them, but are generally regarded as superior persons, and have often been offered me as delightful and unappreciated companions. \u201cYou cannot fail to be aware, Madame, that many forest regions take their name from the animals that inhabit them. Next to the forest of Chantepie, you have the wood Chantereine.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know who the queen may be, but you are not very polite to her,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cOne for you, Chochotte,\u201d said Mme. de Verdurin. \u201cAnd apart from that, did you have a pleasant journey?\u201d \u201cWe encountered only vague human beings who thronged the train. But I must answer M. de Cambremer\u2019s question; reine, in this instance, is not the wife of a king, but a frog. It is the name that the frog has long retained in this district, as is shewn by the station, Renneville, which ought to be spelt Reineville.\u201d \u201cI say, that seems a fine animal,\u201d said M. de Cambremer to Mme. Verdurin, pointing to a fish. (It was one of the compliments by means of which he considered that he paid his scot at a dinner-party, and gave an immediate return of hospitality. \u201cThere is no need to invite them,\u201d he would often say, in speaking of one or other couple of their friends to his wife. \u201cThey were delighted to have us. It was they that thanked me for coming.\u201d) \u201cI must tell you, all the same, that I have been going every day for years to Renneville, and I have never seen any more frogs there than anywhere else. Madame de Cambremer brought the cur\u00e9 here from a parish where she owns a considerable property, who has very much the same turn of mind as yourself, it seems to me. He has written a book.\u201d \u201cI know, I have read it with immense interest,\u201d Brichot replied hypocritically. The satisfaction that his pride received indirectly from this answer made M. de Cambremer laugh long and loud. \u201cAh! well, the author of, what shall I say, this geography, this glossary, dwells at great length upon the name of a little place of which we were formerly, if I may say so, the Lords, and which is called Pont-a-Couleuvre. Of course I am only an ignorant rustic compared with such a fountain of learning, but I have been to Pont-\u00e0-Couleuvre a thousand times if he\u2019s been there once, and devil take me if I ever saw one of his beastly serpents there, I say beastly, in spite of the tribute the worthy La Fontaine pays them.\u201d (The Man and the Serpent was one of his two fables.) \u201cYou have not seen any, and you have been quite right,\u201d replied Brichot. \u201cUndoubtedly, the writer you mention knows his subject through and through, he has written a remarkable book.\u201d \u201cThere!\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cthat book, there\u2019s no other word for it, is a regular Benedictine opus.\u201d \u201cNo doubt he has consulted various polyptychs (by which we mean the lists of benefices and cures of each diocese), which may have furnished him with the names of lay patrons and ecclesiastical collators. But there are other sources. One of the most learned of my friends has delved into them. He found that the place in question was named Pont-a-Quileuvre. This odd name encouraged him to carry his researches farther, to a Latin text in which the bridge that your friend supposes to be infested with serpents is styled Pons cui aperit: A closed bridge that was opened only upon due payment.\u201d \u201cYou were speaking of frogs. I, when I find myself among such learned folk, feel like the frog before the areopagus,\u201d (this being his other fable) said Cancan who often indulged, with a hearty laugh, in this pleasantry thanks to which he imagined himself to be making, at one and the same time, out of humility and with aptness, a profession of ignorance and a display of learning. As for Cottard, blocked upon one side by M. de Charlus\u2019s silence, and driven to seek an outlet elsewhere, he turned to me with one of those questions which so impressed his patients when it hit the mark and shewed them that he could put himself so to speak inside their bodies; if on the other hand it missed the mark, it enabled him to check certain theories, to widen his previous point of view. \u201cWhen you come to a relatively high altitude, such as this where we now are, do you find that the change increases your tendency to choking fits?\u201d he asked me with the certainty of either arousing admiration or enlarging his own knowledge. M. de Cambremer heard the question and smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how amused I am to hear that you have choking fits,\u201d he flung at me across the table. He did not mean that it made him happy, though as a matter of fact it did. For this worthy man could not hear any reference to another person\u2019s sufferings without a feeling of satisfaction and a spasm of hilarity which speedily gave place to the instinctive pity of a kind heart. But his words had another meaning which was indicated more precisely by the clause that followed. \u201cIt amuses me,\u201d he explained, \u201cbecause my sister has them too.\u201d And indeed it did amuse him, as it would have amused him to hear me mention as one of my friends a person who was constantly coming to their house. \u201cHow small the world is,\u201d was the reflexion which he formed mentally and which I saw written upon his smiling face when Cottard spoke to me of my choking fits. And these began to establish themselves, from the evening of this dinner-party, as a sort of interest in common, after which M. de Cambremer never failed to inquire, if only to hand on a report to his sister. As I answered the questions with which his wife kept plying me about Morel, my thoughts returned to a conversation I had had with my mother that afternoon. Having, without any attempt to dissuade me from going to the Verdurins\u2019 if there was a chance of my being amused there, suggested that it was a house of which my grandfather would not have approved, which would have made him exclaim: \u201cOn guard!\u201d my mother had gone on to say: \u201cListen, Judge Toureuil and his wife told me they had been to luncheon with Mme. Bon-temps. They asked me no questions. But I seemed to gather from what was said that your marriage to Albertine would be the joy of her aunt\u2019s life. I think the real reason is that they are all extremely fond of you. At the same time the style in which they suppose that you would be able to keep her, the sort of friends they more or less know that we have, all that is not, I fancy, left out of account, although it may be a minor consideration. I should not have mentioned it to you myself, because I attach no importance to it, but as I imagine that people will mention it to you, I prefer to get a word in first.\u201d \u201cBut you yourself, what do you think of her?\u201d I asked my mother. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not I that am going to marry her. You might certainly do a thousand times better. But I feel that your grandmother would not have liked me to influence you. As a matter of fact, I cannot tell you what I think of Albertine; I don\u2019t think of her. I shall say to you, like Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u2018She has good qualities, at least I suppose so. But at this first stage I can praise her only by negatives. One thing she is not, she has not the Rennes accent. In time, I shall perhaps say, she is something else. And I shall always think well of her if she can make you happy.\u2019\u201d But by these very words which left it to myself to decide my own happiness, my mother had plunged me in that state of doubt in which I had been plunged long ago when, my father having allowed me to go to Ph\u00e8dre and, what was more, to take to writing, I had suddenly felt myself burdened with too great a responsibility, the fear of distressing him, and that melancholy which we feel when we cease to obey orders which, from one day to another, keep the future hidden, and realise that we have at last begun to live in real earnest, as a grown-up person, the life, the only life that any of us has at his disposal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the best thing would be to wait a little longer, to begin by regarding Albertine as in the past, so as to find out whether I really loved her. I might take her, as a distraction, to see the Verdurins, and this thought reminded me that I had come there myself that evening only to learn whether Mme. Putbus was staying there or was expected. In any case, she was not dining with them. \u201cSpeaking of your friend Saint-Loup,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer, using an expression which shewed a closer sequence in her ideas than her remarks might have led one to suppose, for if she spoke to me about music she was thinking about the Guermantes; \u201cyou know that everybody is talking about his marriage to the niece of the Princesse de Guermantes. I may tell you that, so far as I am concerned, all that society gossip leaves me cold.\u201d I was seized by a fear that I might have spoken unfeelingly to Robert about the girl in question, a girl full of sham originality, whose mind was as mediocre as her actions were violent. Hardly ever do we hear anything that does \u2018not make us regret something that we have said. I replied to Mme. de Cambremer, truthfully as it happened, that I knew nothing about it, and that anyhow I thought that the girl was still too young to be engaged. \u201cThat is perhaps why it is not yet official, anyhow there is a lot of talk about it.\u201d \u201cI ought to warn you,\u201d Mme. Verdurin observed dryly to Mme. de Cambremer, having heard her talking to me about Morel and supposing, when Mme. de Cambremer lowered her voice to speak of Saint-Loup\u2019s engagement, that Morel was still under discussion. \u201cYou needn\u2019t expect any light music here. In matters of art, you know, the faithful who come to my Wednesdays, my children as I call them, are all fearfully advanced,\u201d she added with an air of proud terror. \u201cI say to them sometimes: My dear people, you move too fast for your Mistress, not that she has ever been said to be afraid of anything daring. Every year it goes a little farther; I can see the day coming when they will have no more use for Wagner or Indy.\u201d \u201cBut it is splendid to be advanced, one can never be advanced enough,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer, scrutinising as she spoke every corner of the dining-room, trying to identify the things that her mother-in-law had left there, those that Mme. Verdurin had brought with her, and to convict the latter red-handed of want of taste. At the same time, she tried to get me to talk of the subject that interested her most, M. de Charlus. She thought it touching that he should be looking after a violinist. \u201cHe seems intelligent.\u201d \u201cWhy, his mind is extremely active for a man of his age,\u201d said I. \u201cAge? But he doesn\u2019t seem at all old, look, the hair is still young.\u201d (For, during the last three or four years, the word hair had been used with the article by one of those unknown persons who launch the literary fashions, and everybody at the same radius from the centre as Mme. de Cambremer would say \u2018the hair,\u2019 not without an affected smile. At the present day, people still say \u2018the hair\u2019 but, from an excessive use of the article, the pronoun will be born again.) \u201cWhat interests me most about M. de Charlus,\u201d she went on, \u201cis that one can feel that he has the gift. I may tell you that I attach little importance to knowledge. Things that can be learned do not interest me.\u201d This speech was not incompatible with Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s own distinction which was, in the fullest sense, imitated and acquired. But it so happened that one of the things which one had to know at that moment was that knowledge is nothing, and is not worth a straw when compared with originality. Mme. de Cambremer had learned, with everything else, that one ought not to learn anything. \u201cThat is why,\u201d she explained to me, \u201cBrichot, who has an interesting side to him, for I am not one to despise a certain spicy erudition, interests me far less.\u201d But Brichot, at that moment, was occupied with one thing only; hearing people talk about music, he trembled lest the subject should remind Mme. Verdurin of the death of Dechambre. He decided to say something that would avert that harrowing memory. M. de Cambremer provided him with an opportunity with the question: \u201cYou mean to say that wooded places always take their names from animals?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Brichot, proud to display his learning before so many strangers, among whom, I had told him, he would be certain to interest one at least. \u201cWe have only to consider how often, even in the names of people, a tree is preserved, like a fern in a piece of coal. One of our Conscript Fathers is called M. de Saulces de Freycinet, which means, if I be not mistaken, a spot planted with willows and ashes, salix et fraxinetum; his nephew M. de Selves combines more trees still, since he is named de Selves, de sylvis.\u201d Saniette was delighted to see the conversation take so animated a turn. He could, since Brichot was talking all the time, preserve a silence which would save him from being the butt of M. and Mme. Verdurin\u2019s wit. And growing even more sensitive in his joy at being set free, he had been touched when he heard M. Verdurin, notwithstanding the formality of so grand a dinner-party, tell the butler to put a decanter of water in front of M. Saniette who never drank anything else. (The generals responsible for the death of most soldiers insist upon their being well fed.) Moreover, Mme. Verdurin had actually smiled once at Saniette. Decidedly, they were kind people. He was not going to be tortured any more. At this moment the meal was interrupted by one of the party whom I have forgotten to mention, an eminent Norwegian philosopher who spoke French very well but very slowly, for the twofold reason that, in the first place, having learned the language only recently and not wishing to make mistakes (he did, nevertheless, make some), he referred each word to a sort of mental dictionary, and secondly, being a metaphysician, he always thought of what he intended to say while he was saying it, which, even in a Frenchman, causes slowness of utterance. He was, otherwise, a charming person, although similar in appearance to many other people, save in one respect. This man so slow in his diction (there was an interval of silence after every word) acquired a startling rapidity in escaping from the room as soon as he had said good-bye. His haste made one suppose, the first time one saw him, that he was suffering from colic or some even more urgent need\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear \u2014 colleague,\u201d he said to Brichot, after deliberating in his mind whether colleague was the correct term, \u201cI have a sort of \u2014 desire to know whether there are other trees in the \u2014 nomenclature of your beautiful French \u2014 Latin \u2014 Norman tongue. Madame\u201d (lie meant Madame Verdurin, although he dared not look at her) \u201chas told me that you know everything. Is not this precisely the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, it is the moment for eating,\u201d interrupted Mme. Verdurin, who saw the dinner becoming interminable. \u201cVery well,\u201d the Scandinavian replied, bowing his head over his plate with a resigned and sorrowful smile. \u201cBut I must point out to Madame that if I have permitted myself this questionnaire \u2014 pardon me, this questation \u2014 it is because I have to return to-morrow to Paris to dine at the Tour d\u2019Argent or at the H\u00f4tel Meurice, My French \u2014 brother \u2014 M. Boutroux is to address us there about certain seances of spiritualism \u2014 pardon me, certain spirituous evocations which he has controlled.\u201d \u201cThe Tour d\u2019Argent is not nearly as good as they make out,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin sourly. \u201cIn fact, I have had some disgusting dinners there.\u201d \u201cBut am I mistaken, is not the food that one consumes at Madame\u2019s table an example of the finest French cookery?\u201d \u201cWell, it is not positively bad,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, sweetening. \u201cAnd if you come next Wednesday, it will be better.\u201d \u201cBut I am leaving on Monday for Algiers, and from there I am going to the Cape. And when I am at the Cape of Good Hope, I shall no longer be able to meet my illustrious colleague \u2014 pardon me, I shall no longer be able to meet my brother.\u201d And he set to work obediently, after offering these retrospective apologies, to devour his food at a headlong pace. But Brichot was only too delighted to be able to furnish other vegetable etymologies, and replied, so greatly interesting the Norwegian that he again stopped eating, but with a sign to the servants that they might remove his plate and help him to the next course. \u201cOne of the Forty,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cis named Houssaye, or a place planted with hollies; in the name of a brilliant diplomat, d\u2019Ormesson, you will find the elm, theulmus beloved of Virgil, which has given its name to the town of Ulm; in the names of his colleagues, M. de la Boulaye, the birch (bouleau), M. d\u2019Aunay, the alder (aune), M. de Buissi\u00e8re, the box (buis), M. Albaret, the sapwood (aubier)\u201d (I made a mental note that I must tell this to C\u00e9leste), \u201cM. de Cholet, the cabbage (chou), and the apple-tree (pommier) in the name of M. de la Pommeraye, whose lectures we used to attend, do you remember, Saniette, in the days when the worthy Porel had been sent to the farthest ends of the earth, as Proconsul in Odeonia?\u201d \u201cYou said that Cholet was derived from chou,\u201d I remarked to Brichot. \u201cAm I to suppose that the name of a station I passed before reaching Donci\u00e8res, Saint-Frichoux, comes from chou also?\u201d \u201cNo, Saint-Frichoux is Sanctus Fruc-tuosus, asSanctus Ferreolus gave rise to Saint-Fargeau, but that is not Norman in the least.\u201d \u201cHe knows too much, he\u2019s boring us,\u201d the Princess muttered softly. \u201cThere are so many other names that interest me, but I can\u2019t ask you everything at once.\u201d And, turning to Cottard, \u201cIs Madame Putbus here?\u201d I asked him. On hearing Brichot utter the name of Saniette, M. Verdurin cast at his wife and at Cottard an ironical glance which confounded their timid guest. \u201cNo, thank heaven,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, who had overheard my question, \u201cI have managed to turn her thoughts in the direction of Venice, we are rid of her for this year.\u201d \u201cI shall myself be entitled presently to two trees,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cfor I have more or less taken a little house between Saint-Martin-du-Chene and Saint-Pierre-des-Ifs.\u201d \u201cBut that is quite close to here, I hope that you will come over often with Charlie Morel. You have only to come to an arrangement with our little group about the trains, you are only a step from Donci\u00e8res,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, who hated people\u2019s not coming by the same train and not arriving at the hours when she sent carriages to meet them. She knew how stiff the climb was to la Raspeli\u00e8re, even if you took the zigzag path, behind F\u00e9terne, which was half-an-hour longer; she was afraid that those of her guests who kept to themselves might not find carriages to take them, or even, having in reality stayed away, might plead the excuse that they had not found a carriage at Douville-F\u00e9terne, and had not felt strong enough to make so stiff a climb on foot. To this invitation M. de Charlus responded with a silent bow. \u201cHe\u2019s not the sort of person you can talk to any day of the week, he seems a tough customer,\u201d the doctor whispered to Ski, for having remained quite simple, notwithstanding a surface-dressing of pride, he made no attempt to conceal the fact that Charlus had snubbed him. \u201cHe is doubtless unaware that at all the watering-places, and even in Paris in the wards, the physicians, who naturally regard me as their \u2018chief,\u2019 make it a point of honour to introduce me to all the noblemen present, not that they need to be asked twice. It makes my stay at the spas quite enjoyable,\u201d he added carelessly. \u201cIndeed at Donci\u00e8res the medical officer of the regiment, who is the doctor who attends the Colonel, invited me to luncheon to meet him, saying that I was fully entitled to dine with the General. And that General is a Monsieur de something. I don\u2019t know whether his title-deeds are more or less ancient than those of this Baron.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about him, his is a very humble coronet,\u201d replied Ski in an undertone, and added some vague statement including a word of which I caught only the last syllable, -ast, being engaged in listening to what Brichot was saying to M. de Charlus. \u201cNo, as for that, I am sorry to say, you have probably one tree only, for if Saint-Martin-du-Ch\u00eane is obviouslySanctus Martinus juxta quercum, on the other hand, the word if may be simply the root ave, eve, which means moist, as in Aveyron, Lod\u00e8ve, Yvette, and which you see survive in our kitchen-sinks (\u00e9viers). It is the word eau which in Breton is represented by ster, Ster-maria, Sterlaer, Sterbouest, Ster-en-Dreuchen.\u201d I heard no more, for whatever the pleasure I might feel on hearing again the name Stermaria, I could not help listening to Cottard, next to whom I was seated, as he murmured to Ski: \u201cIndeed! I was not aware of it. So he is a gentleman who has learned to look behind! He is one of the happy band, is he? He hasn\u2019t got rings of fat round his eyes, all the same. I shall have to keep my feet well under me, or he may start squeezing them. But I\u2019m not at all surprised. I am used to seeing noblemen in the bath, in their birthday suits, they are all more or less degenerates. I don\u2019t talk to them, because after all I am in an official position and it might do me harm. But they know quite well who I am.\u201d Saniette, whom Brichot\u2019s appeal had frightened, was beginning to breathe again, like a man who is afraid of the storm when he finds that the lightning has not been followed by any sound of thunder, when he heard M. Verdurin interrogate him, fastening upon him a stare which did not spare the wretch until he had finished speaking, so as to put him at once out of countenance and prevent him from recovering his composure. \u201cBut you never told us that you went to those matin\u00e9es at the Od\u00e9on, Saniette?\u201d Trembling like a recruit before a bullying serjeant, Saniette replied, making his speech as diminutive as possible, so that it might have a better chance of escaping the blow: \u201cOnly once, to the Chercheuse.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that he says?\u201d shouted M. Verdurin, with an air of disgust and fury combined, knitting his brows as though it was all he could do to grasp something unintelligible. \u201cIt is impossible to understand what you say, what have you got in your mouth?\u201d inquired M. Verdurin, growing more and more furious, and alluding to Saniette\u2019s defective speech. \u201cPoor Saniette, I won\u2019t have him made unhappy,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin in a tone of false pity, so as to leave no one in doubt as to her husband\u2019s insolent intention. \u201cI was at the Ch . . . Che..\u201d \u201cChe, che, try to speak distinctly,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201cI can\u2019t understand a word you say.\u201d Almost without exception, the faithful burst out laughing and they suggested a band of cannibals in whom the sight of a wound on a white man\u2019s skin has aroused the thirst for blood. For the instinct of imitation and absence of courage govern society and the mob alike. And we all of us laugh at a person whom we see being made fun of, which does not prevent us from venerating him ten years later in a circle where he is admired. It is in like manner that the populace banishes or acclaims its kings. \u201cCome, now, it is not his fault,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cIt is not mine either, people ought not to dine out if they can\u2019t speak properly.\u201d \u201cI was at the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit by Favart.\u201d \u201cWhat! It\u2019s theChercheuse d\u2019Esprit that you call the Chercheuse? Why, that\u2019s marvellous! I might have tried for a hundred years without guessing it,\u201d cried M. Verdurin, who all the same would have decided immediately that you were not literary, were not artistic, were not \u2018one of us,\u2019 if he had heard you quote the full title of certain works. For instance, one was expected to say the Malade, the Bourgeois; and whoso would have added imaginaire orgentilhomme would have shewn that he did not understand \u2018shop,\u2019 just as in a drawing-room a person proves that he is not in society by saying \u2018M. de Montesquiou-F\u00e9zensac\u2019 instead of \u2018M. de Montesquieu.\u2019 \u201cBut it is not so extraordinary,\u201d said Saniette, breathless with emotion but smiling, albeit he was in no smiling mood. Mme. Verdurin could not contain herself. \u201cYes, indeed!\u201d she cried with a titter. \u201cYou may be quite sure that nobody would ever have guessed that you meant the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit.\u201d M. Verdurin went on in a gentler tone, addressing both Saniette and Brichot: \u201cIt is quite a pretty piece, all the same, the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit.\u201d Uttered in a serious tone, this simple phrase, in which one could detect no trace of malice, did Saniette as much good and aroused in him as much gratitude as a deliberate compliment. He was unable to utter a single word and preserved a happy silence. Brichot was more loquacious. \u201cIt is true,\u201d he replied to M. Verdurin, \u201cand if it could be passed off as the work of some Sarmatian or Scandinavian author, we might put forward the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit as a candidate for the vacant post of masterpiece. But, be it said without any disrespect to the shade of the gentle Favart, he had not the Ibsenian temperament.\u201d (Immediately he blushed to the roots of his hair, remembering the Norwegian philosopher who appeared troubled because he was seeking in vain to discover what vegetable the buis might be that Brichot had cited a little earlier in connexion with the name Bussi\u00e8re.) \u201cHowever, now that Porel\u2019s satrapy is filled by a functionary who is a Tolstoist of rigorous observance, it may come to pass that we shall witnessAnna Karenina or Resurrection beneath the Od\u00e9onian architrave.\u201d \u201cI know the portrait of Favart to which you allude,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cI have seen a very fine print of it at Comtesse Mol\u00e9\u2018s.\u201d The name of Comtesse Mol\u00e9 made a great impression upon Mme. Verdurin. \u201cOh! So you go to Mme. de Mol\u00e9\u2018s!\u201d she exclaimed. She supposed that people said Comtesse Mol\u00e9, Madame Mol\u00e9, simply as an abbreviation, as she heard people say \u2018the Rohans\u2019 or in contempt, as she herself said: \u2018Madame la Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle.\u2019 She had no doubt that Comtesse Mol\u00e9, who knew the Queen of Greece and the Principessa di Caprarola, had as much right as anybody to the particle, and for once in a way had decided to bestow it upon so brilliant a personage, and one who had been extremely civil to herself. And so, to make it clear that she had spoken thus on purpose and did not grudge the Comtesse her \u2018de,\u2019 she went on: \u201cBut I had no idea that you knew Madame de Mol\u00e9!\u201d as though it had been doubly extraordinary, both that M. de Charlus should know the lady, and that Mme. Verdurin should not know that he knew her. Now society, or at least the people to whom M. de Charlus gave that name, forms a relatively homogeneous and compact whole. And so it is comprehensible that, in the incongruous vastness of the middle classes, a barrister may say to somebody who knows one of his school friends: \u201cBut how in the world do you come to know him?\u201d whereas to be surprised at a Frenchman\u2019s knowing the meaning of the word templeor forest would be hardly more extraordinary than to wonder at the hazards that might have brought together M. de Charlus and the Comtesse Mol\u00e9. What is more, even if such an acquaintance had not been derived quite naturally from the laws that govern society, how could there be anything strange in the fact of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s not knowing of it, since she was meeting M. de Charlus for the first time, and his relations with Mme. Mol\u00e9 were far from being the only thing that she did not know with regard to him, about whom, to tell the truth, she knew nothing. \u201cWho was it that played this Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit, my good Saniette?\u201d asked M. Verdurin. Albeit he felt that the storm had passed, the old antiquarian hesitated before answering. \u201cThere you go,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cyou frighten him, you make fun of everything that he says, and then you expect him to answer. Come along, tell us who played the part, and you shall have some galantine to take home,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, making a cruel allusion to the penury into which Saniette had plunged himself by trying to rescue the family of a friend. \u201cI can remember only that it was Mme. Samary who played the Zerbine,\u201d said Saniette. \u201cThe Zerbine? What in the world is that,\u201d M. Verdurin shouted, as though the house were on fire. \u201cIt is one of the parts in the old repertory, like Captain Fracasse, as who should say the Fire-eater, the Pedant.\u201d \u201cAh, the pedant, that\u2019s yourself. The Zerbine! No, really the man\u2019s mad,\u201d exclaimed M. Verdurin. Mme. Verdurin looked at her guests and laughed as though to apologise for Saniette. \u201cThe Zerbine, he imagines that everybody will know at once what it means. You are like M. de Longepierre, the stupidest man I know, who said to us quite calmly the other day \u2018the Banat.\u2019 Nobody had any idea what he meant. Finally we were informed that it was a province in Serbia.\u201d To put an end to Saniette\u2019s torture, which hurt me \u2018more than it hurt him, I asked Brichot if he knew what the word Balbec meant. \u201cBalbec is probably a corruption of Dalbec,\u201d he told me. \u201cOne would have to consult the charters of the Kings of England, Overlords of Normandy, for Balbec was held of the Barony of Dover, for which reason it was often styled Balbec d\u2019Outre-Mer, Balbec-en-Terre. But the Barony of Dover was itself held of the Bishopric of Bayeux, and, notwithstanding the rights that were temporarily enjoyed in the abbey by the Templars, from the time of Louis d\u2019Harcourt, Patriarch of Jerusalem and Bishop of Bayeux; it was the Bishops of that diocese who collated to the benefice of Balbec. So it was explained to me by the incumbent of Douville, a bald person, eloquent, fantastic, and a devotee of the table, who lives by the Rule of Brillat-Savarin, and who expounded to me in slightly sibylline language a loose pedagogy, while he fed me upon some admirable fried potatoes.\u201d While Brichot smiled to shew how witty it was to combine matters so dissimilar and to employ an ironically lofty diction in treating of commonplace things, Saniette was trying to find a loophole for some clever remark which would raise him from the abyss into which he had fallen. The witty remark was what was known as a \u2018comparison,\u2019 but had changed its form, for there is an evolution in wit as in literary styles, an epidemic that disappears has its place taken by another, and so forth. . . . At one time the typical \u2018comparison\u2019 was the \u2018height of. . . . \u2019 But this was out of date, no one used it any more, there was only Cottard left to say still, on occasion, in the middle of a game of piquet: \u201cDo you know what is the height of absent-mindedness, it is to think that the Edict (l\u2019edit) of Nantes was an Englishwoman.\u201d These \u2018heights\u2019 had been replaced by nicknames. In reality it was still the old \u2018comparison,\u2019 but, as the nickname was in fashion, people did not observe the survival. Unfortunately for Saniette, when these \u2018comparisons\u2019 were not his own, and as a rule were unknown to the little nucleus, he produced them so timidly that, notwithstanding the laugh with which he followed them up to indicate their humorous nature, nobody saw the point. And if on the other hand the joke was his own, as he had generally hit upon it in conversation with one of the faithful, and the latter had repeated it, appropriating the authorship, the joke was in that case known, but not as being Saniette\u2019s. And so when he slipped in one of these it was recognised, but, because he was its author, he was accused of plagiarism. \u201cVery well, then,\u201d Brichot continued, \u201cBee, in Norman, is a stream; there is the Abbey of Bee, Mobec, the stream from the marsh (Mor or Mer meant a marsh, as in Morville, or in Bricquemar, Alvimare, Cambremer), Bricquebac the stream from the high ground coming from Briga, a fortified place, as in Bricqueville, Bricquebose, le Bric, Briand, or indeed Brice, bridge, which is the same asbruck in German (Innsbruck), and as the English  which ends so many place-names (Cambridge, for instance). You have moreover in Normandy many other instances of bec: Caudebec, Bolbec, le Robec, le Bec-Hellouin, Becquerel. It is the Norman form of the German bach Offenbach, Anspach. Varaguebec, from the old word varaigne, equivalent to warren, preserved woods or ponds. As for Dal,\u201d Brichot went on, \u201cit is a form of thal, a valley: Darnetal, Rosendal, and indeed, close to Louviers, Becdal. The river that has given its name to Balbec, is, by the way, charming. Seen from a falaise (fels in German, you have indeed, not far from here, standing on a height, the picturesque town of Falaise), it runs close under the spires of the church, which is actually a long way from it, and seems to be reflecting them.\u201d \u201cI should think,\u201d said I, \u201cthat is an effect that Elstir admires greatly. I have seen several sketches of it in his studio.\u201d \u201cElstir! You know Tiche,\u201d cried Mme. Verdurin. \u201cBut do you know that we used to be the dearest friends? Thank heaven, I never see him now. No, but ask Cottard, Brichot, he used to have his place laid at my table, he came every day. Now, there\u2019s a man of whom you can say that it has done him no good to leave our little nucleus. I shall shew you presently some flowers he painted for me; you shall see the difference from the things he is doing now, which I don\u2019t care for at all, not at all! Why! I made him do me a portrait of Cottard, not to mention all the sketches he has made of me.\u201d \u201cAnd he gave the Professor purple hair,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, forgetting that at the time her husband had not been even a Fellow of the College. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Sir, whether you find that my husband has purple hair.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, raising her chin with an air of contempt for Mme. Cottard and of admiration for the man of whom she was speaking, \u201che was a brave colourist, a fine painter. Whereas,\u201d she added, turning again to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you call it painting, all those huge she-devils of composition, those vast structures he exhibits now that he has given up coming to me. For my part, I call it daubing, it\u2019s all so hackneyed, and besides, it lacks relief, personality. It\u2019s anybody\u2019s work.\u201d \u201cHe revives the grace of the eighteenth century, but in a modern form,\u201d Saniette broke out, fortified and reassured by my affability. \u201cBut I prefer Helleu.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not in the least like Helleu,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cYes, he has the fever of the eighteenth century. He\u2019s a steam Watteau,\u201d and he began to laugh. \u201cOld, old as the hills, I\u2019ve had that served up to me for years,\u201d said M. Verdurin, to whom indeed Ski had once repeated the remark, but as his own invention. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that when once in a way you say something quite amusing and make it intelligible, it is not your own.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry about it,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on, \u201cbecause he was really gifted, he has wasted a charming temperament for painting. Ah! if he had stayed with us! Why, he would have become the greatest landscape painter of our day. And it is a woman that has dragged him down so low! Not that that surprises me, for he was a pleasant enough man, but common. At bottom, he was a mediocrity. I may tell you that I felt it at once. Really, he never interested me. I was very fond of him, that was all. For one thing, he was so dirty. Tell me, do you, now, really like people who never wash?\u201d \u201cWhat is this charmingly coloured thing that we are eating?\u201d asked Ski. \u201cIt is called strawberry mousse,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cBut it is ex-qui-site. You ought to open bottles of Ch\u00e2teau-Margaux, Ch\u00e2teau-Lafite, port wine.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how he amuses me, he never drinks anything but water,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, seeking to cloak with her delight at such a flight of fancy her alarm at the thought of so prodigal an outlay. \u201cBut not to drink,\u201d Ski went on, \u201cyou shall fill all our glasses, they will bring in marvelous peaches, huge nectarines, there against the sunset; it will be as gorgeous as a fine Veronese.\u201d \u201cIt would cost almost as much,\u201d M. Verdurin murmured. \u201cBut take away those cheeses with their hideous colour,\u201d said Ski, trying to snatch the plate from before his host, who defended his gruy\u00e8re with his might and main. \u201cYou can realise that I don\u2019t regret Elstir,\u201d Mme. Verdurin said to me, \u201cthat one is far more gifted. Elstir is simply hard work, the man who can\u2019t make himself give up painting when he would like to. He is the good student, the slavish competitor. Ski, now, only follows his own fancy. You will see him light a cigarette in the middle of dinner.\u201d \u201cAfter all, I can\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t invite his wife,\u201d said Cottard, \u201che would be with us still.\u201d \u201cWill you mind what you\u2019re saying, please, I don\u2019t open my doors to street-walkers, Monsieur le Professeur,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, who had, on the contrary, done everything in her power to make Elstir return, even with his wife. But before they were married she had tried to make them quarrel, had told Elstir that the woman he loved was stupid, dirty, immoral, a thief. For once in a way she had failed to effect a breach. It was with the Verdurin salon that Elstir had broken; and he was glad of it, as converts bless the illness or misfortune that has withdrawn them from the world and has made them learn the way of salvation. \u201cHe really is magnificent, the Professor,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy not declare outright that I keep a disorderly house? Anyone would think you didn\u2019t know what Madame Elstir was like. I would sooner have the lowest street-walker at my table! Oh no, I don\u2019t stand for that sort of thing. Besides I may tell you that it would have been stupid of me to overlook the wife, when the husband no longer interests me, he is out of date, he can\u2019t even draw.\u201d \u201cThat is extraordinary in a man of his intelligence,\u201d said Cottard. \u201cOh, no!\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, \u201ceven at the time when he had talent, for he had it, the wretch, and to spare, what was tiresome about him was that he had not a spark of intelligence.\u201d Mme. Verdurin, in passing this judgment upon Elstir, had not waited for their quarrel, or until she had ceased to care for his painting. The fact was that, even at the time when he formed part of the little group, it would happen that Elstir spent the whole day in the company of some woman whom, rightly or wrongly, Mme. Verdurin considered a goose, which, in her opinion, was not the conduct of an intelligent man. \u201cNo,\u201d she observed with an air of finality, \u201cI consider that his wife and he are made for one another. Heaven knows, there isn\u2019t a more boring creature on the face of the earth, and I should go mad if I had to spend a couple of hours with her. But people say that he finds her very intelligent. There\u2019s no use denying it, our Tiche was extremely stupid. I have seen him bowled over by people you can\u2019t conceive, worthy idiots we should never have allowed into our little clan. Well! He wrote to them, he argued with them, he, Elstir! That doesn\u2019t prevent his having charming qualities, oh, charming and deliciously absurd, naturally.\u201d For Mme. Verdurin was convinced that men who are truly remarkable are capable of all sorts of follies. A false idea in which there is nevertheless a grain of truth. Certainly, people\u2019s follies are insupportable. But a want of balance which we discover only in course of time is the consequence of the entering into a human brain of delicacies for which it is not regularly adapted. So that the oddities of charming people exasperate us, but there are few if any charming people who are not, at the same time, odd. \u201cLook, I shall be able to shew you his flowers now,\u201d she said to me, seeing that her husband was making signals to her to rise. And she took M. de Cambremer\u2019s arm again. M. Verdurin tried to apologise for this to M. de Charlus, as soon as he had got rid of Mme. de Cambremer, and to give him his reasons, chiefly for the pleasure of discussing these social refinements with a gentleman of title, momentarily the inferior of those who assigned to him the place to which they considered him entitled. But first of all he was anxious to make it clear to M. de Charlus that intellectually he esteemed him too highly to suppose that he could pay any attention to these trivialities. \u201cExcuse my mentioning so small a point,\u201d he began, \u201cfor I can understand how little such things mean to you. Middle-class minds pay attention to them, but the others, the artists, the people who are really of our sort, don\u2019t give a rap for them. Now, from the first words we exchanged, I realised that you were one of us!\u201d M. de Charlus, who gave a widely different meaning to this expression, drew himself erect. After the doctor\u2019s oglings, he found his host\u2019s insulting frankness suffocating. \u201cDon\u2019t protest, my dear Sir, you are one of us, it is plain as daylight,\u201d replied M. Verdurin. \u201cObserve that I have no idea whether you practise any of the arts, but that is not necessary. It is not always sufficient. Dechambre, who has just died, played exquisitely, with the most vigorous execution, but he was not one of us, you felt at once that he was not one of us. Brichot is not one of us. Morel is, my wife is, I can feel that you are. . . . \u201d \u201cWhat were you going to tell me?\u201d interrupted M. de Charlus, who was beginning to feel reassured as to M. Verdurin\u2019s meaning, but preferred that he should not utter these misleading remarks quite so loud. \u201cOnly that we put you on the left,\u201d replied M. Verdurin. M. de Charlus, with a comprehending, genial, insolent smile, replied: \u201cWhy! That is not of the slightest importance,here!\u201d And he gave a little laugh that was all his own \u2014 a laugh that came to him probably from some Bavarian or Lorraine grandmother, who herself had inherited it, in identical form, from an ancestress, so that it had been sounding now, without change, for not a few centuries in little old-fashioned European courts, and one could relish its precious quality like that of certain old musical instruments that have now grown rare. There are times when, to paint a complete portrait of some one, we should have to add a phonetic imitation to our verbal description, and our portrait of the figure that M. de Charlus presented is liable to remain incomplete in the absence of that little laugh, so delicate, so light, just as certain compositions are never accurately rendered because our orchestras lack those \u2018small trumpets,\u2019 with a sound so entirely their own, for which the composer wrote this or that part. \u201cBut,\u201d M. Verdurin explained, stung by his laugh, \u201cwe did it on purpose. I attach no importance whatever to title of nobility,\u201d he went on, with that contemptuous smile which I have seen so many people whom I have known, unlike my grandmother and my mother, assume when they spoke of anything that they did not possess, before others who thus, they supposed, would be prevented from using that particular advantage to crow over them. \u201cBut, don\u2019t you see, since we happened to have M. de Cambremer here, and he is a Marquis, while you are only a Baron. . . . \u201d \u201cPardon me,\u201d M. de Charlus replied with an arrogant air to the astonished Verdurin, \u201cI am also Duc de Brabant, Damoiseau de Montargis, Prince d\u2019Oloron, de Carency, de Viareggio and des Dunes. However, it is not of the slightest importance. Please do not distress yourself,\u201d he concluded, resuming his subtle smile which spread itself over these final words: \u201cI could see at a glance that you were not accustomed to society.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin came across to me to shew me Elstir\u2019s flowers. If this action, to which I had grown so indifferent, of going out to dinner, had on the contrary, taking the form that made it entirely novel, of a journey along the coast, followed by an ascent in a carriage to a point six hundred feet above the sea, produced in me a sort of intoxication, this feeling had not been dispelled at la Raspeli\u00e8re. \u201cJust look at this, now,\u201d said the Mistress, shewing me some huge and splendid roses by Elstir, whose unctuous scarlet and rich white stood out, however, with almost too creamy a relief from the flower-stand upon which they were arranged. \u201cDo you suppose he would still have to touch to get that? Don\u2019t you call that striking? And besides, it\u2019s fine as matter, it would be amusing to handle. I can\u2019t tell you how amusing it was to watch him painting them. One could feel that he was interested in trying to get just that effect.\u201d And the Mistress\u2019s gaze rested musingly on this present from the artist in which were combined not merely his great talent but their long friendship which survived only in these mementoes of it which he had bequeathed to her; behind the flowers which long agcr he had picked for her, she seemed to see the shapely hand that had painted them, in the course of a morning, in their freshness, so that, they on the table, it leaning against the back of a chair, had been able to meet face to face at the Mistress\u2019s luncheon party, the roses still alive and their almost lifelike portrait. Almost only, for Elstir was unable to look at a flower without first transplanting it to that inner garden in which we are obliged always to remain. He had shewn in this water-colour the appearance of the roses which he had seen, and which, but for him, no one would ever have known; so that one might say that they were a new variety with which this painter, like a skilful gardener, had enriched the family of the Roses. \u201cFrom the day he left the little nucleus, he was finished. It seems, my dinners made him waste his time, that I hindered the development of his genius,\u201d she said in a tone of irony. \u201cAs if the society of a woman like myself could fail to be beneficial to an artist,\u201d she exclaimed with a burst of pride. Close beside us, M. de Cambremer, who was already seated, seeing that M. de Charlus was standing, made as though to rise and offer him his chair. This offer may have arisen, in the Marquis\u2019s mind, from nothing more than a vague wish to be polite. M. de Charlus preferred to attach to it the sense of a duty which the plain gentleman knew that he owed to a Prince, and felt that he could not establish his right to this precedence better than by declining it. And so he exclaimed: \u201cWhat are you doing? I beg of you! The idea!\u201d The astutely vehement tone of this protest had in itself something typically \u2018Guermantes\u2019 which became even more evident in the imperative, superfluous and familiar gesture with which he brought both his hands down, as though to force him to remain seated, upon the shoulders of M. de Cambremer who had not risen. \u201cCome, come, my dear fellow,\u201d the Baron insisted, \u201cthis is too much. There is no reason for it! In these days we keep that for Princes of the Blood.\u201d I made no more effect on the Cambremers than on Mme. Verdurin by my enthusiasm for their house. For I remained cold to the beauties which they pointed out to me and grew excited over confused reminiscences; at times I even confessed my disappointment at not finding something correspond to what its name had made me imagine. I enraged Mme. de Cambremer by telling her that I had supposed the place to be more in the country. On the other hand I broke off in an ecstasy to sniff the fragrance of a breeze that crept in through the chink of the door. \u201cI see you like draughts,\u201d they said to me. My praise of the patch of green lining-cloth that had been pasted over a broken pane met with no greater success: \u201cHow frightful!\u201d cried the Marquise. The climax came when I said: \u201cMy greatest joy was when I arrived. When I heard my step echoing along the gallery, I felt that I had come into some village council-office, with a map of the district on the wall.\u201d This time, Mme. de Cambremer resolutely turned her back on me. \u201cYou don\u2019t think the arrangement too bad?\u201d her husband asked her with the same compassionate anxiety with which he would have inquired how his wife had stood some painful ceremony. \u201cThey have some fine things.\u201d But, inasmuch as malice, when the hard and fast rules of sure taste do not confine it within fixed limits, finds fault with everything, in the persons or in the houses, of the people who have supplanted the critic: \u201cYes, but they are not in the right places. Besides, are they really as fine as all that?\u201d \u201cYou noticed,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, with a melancholy that was controlled by a note of firmness, \u201cthere are some Jouy hangings that are worn away, some quite threadbare things in this drawing-room!\u201d \u201cAnd that piece of stuff with its huge roses, like a peasant woman\u2019s quilt,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer whose purely artificial culture was confined exclusively to idealist philosophy, impressionist painting and Debussy\u2019s music. And, so as not to criticise merely in the name of smartness but in that of good taste: \u201cAnd they have put up windscreens! Such bad style! What can you expect of such people, they don\u2019t know, where could they have learned? They must be retired tradespeople. It\u2019s really not bad for them.\u201d \u201cI thought the chandeliers good,\u201d said the Marquis, though it was not evident why he should make an exception of the chandeliers, just as inevitably, whenever anyone spoke of a church, whether it was the Cathedral of Chartres, or of Rheims, or of Amiens, or the church at Balbec, what he would always make a point of mentioning as admirable would be: \u201cthe organ-loft, the pulpit and the misericords.\u201d \u201cAs for the garden, don\u2019t speak about it,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer. \u201cIt\u2019s a massacre. Those paths running all crooked.\u201d I seized the opportunity while Mme. Verdurin was pouring out coffee to go and glance over the letter which M. de Cambremer had brought me, and in which his mother invited me to dinner. With that faint trace of ink, the handwriting revealed an individuality which in the future I should be able to recognise among a thousand, without any more need to have recourse to the hypothesis of special pens, than to suppose that rare and mysteriously blended colours are necessary to enable a painter to express his original vision. Indeed a paralytic, stricken with agraphia after a seizure, and compelled to look at the script as at a drawing without being able to read it, would have gathered that Mme. de Cambremer belonged to an old family in which the zealous cultivation of literature and the arts had supplied a margin to its artistocratic traditions. He would have guessed also the period in which the Marquise had learned simultaneously to write and to play Chopin\u2019s music. It was the time when well-bred people observed the rule of affability and what was called the rule of the three adjectives. Mme. de Cambremer combined the two rules in one. A laudatory adjective was not enough for her, she followed it (after a little stroke of the pen) with a second, then (after another stroke), with a third. But, what was peculiar to herself was that, in defiance of the literary and social object at which she aimed, the sequence of the three epithets assumed in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s notes the aspect not of a progression but of a diminuendo. Mme. de Cambremer told me in this first letter that she had seen Saint-Loup and had appreciated more than ever his \u2018unique \u2014 rare \u2014 real\u2019 qualities, that he was coming to them again with one of his friends (the one who was in love with her daughter-in-law), and that if I cared to come, with or without them, to dine at F\u00e9terne she would be \u2018delighted \u2014 happy \u2014 pleased.\u2019 Perhaps it was because her desire to be friendly outran the fertility of her imagination and the riches of her vocabulary that the lady, while determined to utter three exclamations, was incapable of making the second and third anything more than feeble echoes of the first. Add but a fourth adjective, and, of her initial friendliness, there would be nothing left. Moreover, with a certain refined simplicity which cannot have failed to produce a considerable impression upon her family and indeed in her circle of acquaintance, Mme. de Cambremer had acquired the habit of substituting for the word (which might in time begin to ring false) \u2018sincere,\u2019 the word \u2018true.\u2019 And to shew that it was indeed by sincerity that she was impelled, she broke the conventional rule that would have placed the adjective \u2018true\u2019 before its noun, and planted it boldly after. Her letters ended with: \u201cCroyez \u00e0 mon amiti\u00e9 vraie.\u201d \u201cCroyez \u00e0 ma sympathie vraie.\u201d Unfortunately, this had become so stereotyped a formula that the affectation of frankness was more suggestive of a polite fiction than the time-honoured formulas, of the meaning of which people have ceased to think. I was, however, hindered from reading her letter by the confused sound of conversation over which rang out the louder accents of M. de Charlus, who, still on the same topic, was saying to M. de Cambremer: \u201cYou reminded me, when you offered me your chair, of a gentleman from whom I received a letter this morning, addressed: \u2018To His Highness, the Baron de Charlus,\u2019 and beginning \u2018Monseigneur.\u2019\u201d \u201cTo be sure, your correspondent was slightly exaggerating,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer, giving way to a discreet show of mirth. M. de Charlus had provoked this; he did not partake in it. \u201cWell, if it comes to that, my dear fellow,\u201d he said, \u201cI may observe that, heraldically speaking, he was entirely in the right. I am not regarding it as a personal matter, you understand. I should say the same of anyone else. But one has to face the facts, history is history, we can\u2019t alter it and it is not in our power to rewrite it. I need not cite the case of the Emperor William, who at Kiel never ceased to address me as \u2018Monseigneur.\u2019 I have heard it said that he gave the same title to all the Dukes of France, which was an abuse of the privilege, but was perhaps simply a delicate attention aimed over our heads at France herself.\u201d \u201cMore delicate, perhaps, than sincere,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cAh! There I must differ from you. Observe that, personally, a gentleman of the lowest rank such as that Hohenzollern, a Protestant to boot, and one who has usurped the throne of my cousin the King of Hanover, can be no favourite of mine,\u201d added M. de Charlus, with whom the annexation of Hanover seemed to rankle more than that of Alsace-Lorraine. \u201cBut I believe the feeling that turns the Emperor in our direction to be profoundly sincere. Fools will tell you that he is a stage emperor. He is on the contrary marvellously intelligent; it is true that he knows nothing about painting, and has forced Herr Tschudi to withdraw the Elstirs from the public galleries. But Louis XIV did not appreciate the Dutch Masters, he had the same fondness for display, and yet he was, when all is said, a great Monarch. Besides, William II has armed his country from the military and naval point of view in a way that Louis XIV failed to do, and I hope that his reign will never know the reverses that darkened the closing days of him who is fatuously styled the Roi Soleil. The Republic made a great mistake, to my mind, in rejecting the overtures of the Hohenzollern, or responding to them only in driblets. He is very well aware of it himself and says, with that gift that he has for the right expression: \u2018What I want is a clasped hand, not a raised hat.\u2019 As a man, he is vile; he has abandoned, surrendered, denied his best friends, in circumstances in which his silence was as deplorable as theirs was grand,\u201d continued M. de Charlus, who was irresistibly drawn by his own tendencies to the Eulenburg affair, and remembered what one of the most highly placed of the culprits had said to him: \u201cThe Emperor must have relied upon our delicacy to have dared to allow such a trial. But he was not mistaken in trusting to our discretion. We would have gone to the scaffold with our lips sealed.\u201d \u201cAll that, however, has nothing to do with what I was trying to explain, which is that, in Germany, mediatised Princes like ourselves are Durchlaucht, and in France our rank of Highness was publicly recognised. Saint-Simon tries to make out that this was an abuse on our part, in which he is entirely mistaken. The reason that he gives, namely that Louis XIV forbade us to style him the Most Christian King and ordered us to call him simply the King, proves merely that we held our title from him, and not that we had not the rank of Prince. Otherwise, it would have to be withheld from the Duc de Lorraine and ever so many others. Besides, several of our titles come from the House of Lorraine through Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d\u2019Espinay, my great-grandmother, who was the daughter of the Damoiseau de Commercy.\u201d Observing that Morel was listening, M. de Charlus proceeded to develop the reasons for his claim. \u201cI have pointed out to my brother that it is not in the third part of Gotha, but in the second, not to say the first, that the account of our family ought to be included,\u201d he said, without stopping to think that Morel did not know what \u2018Gotha\u2019 was. \u201cBut that is his affair, he is the Head of my House, and so long as he raises no objection and allows the matter to pass, I have only to shut my eyes.\u201d \u201cM. Brichot interests me greatly,\u201d I said to Mme. Verdurin as she joined me, and I slipped Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s letter into my pocket. \u201cHe has a cultured mind and is an excellent man,\u201d she replied coldly. \u201cOf course what he lacks is originality and taste, he has a terrible memory. They used to say of the \u2018forebears\u2019 of the people we have here this evening, the \u00e9migr\u00e9s, that they had forgotten nothing. But they had at least the excuse,\u201d she said, borrowing one of Swann\u2019s epigrams, \u201cthat they had learned nothing. Whereas Brichot knows everything, and hurls chunks of dictionary at our heads during dinner. I\u2019m sure you know everything now about the names of all the towns and villages.\u201d While Mme. Verdurin was speaking, it occurred to me that I had determined to ask her something, but I could not remember what it was. I could not at this moment say what Mme. Verdurin was wearing that evening. Perhaps even then I was no more able to say, for I have not an observant mind. But feeling that her dress was not unambitious I said to her something polite and even admiring. She was like almost all women, who imagine that a compliment that is paid to them is a literal statement of the truth, and is a judgment impartially, irresistibly pronounced, as though it referred to a work of art that has no connexion with a person. And so it was with an earnestness which made me blush for my own hypocrisy that she replied with the proud and artless question, habitual in the circumstances: \u201cYou like it?\u201d \u201cI know you\u2019re talking about Brichot. Eh, Chantepie, Freycinet, he spared you nothing. I had my eye on you, my little Mistress!\u201d \u201cI saw you, it was all I could do not to laugh.\u201d \u201cYou are talking about Chantepie, I am certain,\u201d said M. Verdurin, as he came towards us. I had been alone, as I thought of my strip of green cloth and of a scent of wood, in failing to notice that, while he discussed etymologies, Brichot had been provoking derision. And inasmuch as the expressions which, for me, gave their value to things were of the sort which other people either do not feel or reject without thinking of them, as unimportant, they were entirely useless to me and had the additional drawback of making me appear stupid in the eyes of Mme. Verdurin who saw that I had \u2018swallowed\u2019 Brichot, as before I had appeared stupid to Mme. de Guermantes, because I enjoyed going to see Mme. d\u2019Arpajon. With Brichot, however, there was another reason. I was not one of the little clan. And in every clan, whether it be social, political, literary, one contracts a perverse facility in discovering in a conversation, in an official speech, in a story, in a sonnet, everything that the honest reader would never have dreamed of finding there. How many times have I found myself, after reading with a certain emotion a tale skilfully told by a learned and slightly old-fashioned Academician, on the point of saying to Bloch or to Mme. de Guermantes: \u201cHow charming this is!\u201d when before I had opened my mouth they exclaimed, each in a different language: \u201cIf you want to be really amused, read a tale by So-and-so. Human stupidity has never sunk to greater depths.\u201d Bloch\u2019s scorn was aroused principally by the discovery that certain effects of style, pleasant enough in themselves, were slightly faded; that of Mme. de Guermantes because the tale seemed to prove the direct opposite of what the author meant, for reasons of fact which she had the ingenuity to deduce but which would never have occurred to me. I was no less surprised to discover the irony that underlay the Verdurins\u2019 apparent friendliness for Brichot than to hear, some days later, at F\u00e9terne, the Cambremers say to me, on hearing my enthusiastic praise of la Raspeli\u00e8re: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that you can be sincere, after all they\u2019ve done to it.\u201d It is true that they admitted that the china was good. Like the shocking windscreens, it had escaped my notice. \u201cAnyhow, when you go back to Balbec, you will know what Balbec means,\u201d said M. Verdurin ironically. It was precisely the things Brichot had told me that interested me. As for what they called his mind, it was exactly the same mind that had at one time been so highly appreciated by the little clan. He talked with the same irritating fluency, but his words no longer carried, having to overcome a hostile silence or disagreeable echoes; what had altered was not the things that he said but the acoustics of the room and the attitude of his audience. \u201cTake care,\u201d Mme. Verdurin murmured, pointing to Brichot. The latter, whose hearing remained keener than his vision, darted at the mistress the hastily withdrawn gaze of a short-sighted philosopher. If his bodily eyes were less good, his mind\u2019s eye on the contrary had begun to take a larger view of things. He saw how little was to be expected of human affection, and resigned himself to it. Undoubtedly the discovery pained him. It may happen that even the man who on one evening only, in a circle where he is usually greeted with joy, realises that the others have found him too frivolous or too pedantic or too loud, or too forward, or whatever it may be, returns home miserable. Often it is a difference of opinion, or of system, that has made him appear to other people absurd or old-fashioned. Often he is perfectly well aware that those others are inferior to himself. He could easily dissect the sophistries with which he has been tacitly condemned, he is tempted to pay a call, to write a letter: on second thoughts, he does nothing, awaits the invitation for the following week. Sometimes, too, these discomfitures, instead of ending with the evening, last for months. Arising from the instability of social judgments, they increase that instability further. For the man who knows that Mme. X despises him, feeling that he is respected at Mme. Y\u2019s, pronounces her far superior to the other and emigrates to her house. This however is not the proper place to describe those men, superior to the life of society but lacking the capacity to realise their own worth outside it, glad to be invited, embittered by being disparaged, discovering annually the faults of the hostess to whom they have been offering incense and the genius of her whom they have never properly appreciated, ready to return to the old love when they shall have felt the drawbacks to be found equally in the new, and when they have begun to forget those of the old. We may judge by these temporary discomfitures the grief that Brichot felt at one which he knew to be final. He was not unaware that Mme. Verdurin sometimes laughed at him publicly, even at his infirmities, and knowing how little was to be expected of human affection, submitting himself to the facts, he continued nevertheless to regard the Mistress as his best friend. But, from the blush that swept over the scholar\u2019s face, Mme. Verdurin saw that he had heard her, and made up her mind to be kind to him for the rest of the evening. I could not help remarking to her that she had not been very kind to Saniette. \u201cWhat! Not kind to him! Why, he adores us, you can\u2019t imagine what we are to him. My husband is sometimes a little irritated by his stupidity, and you must admit that he has every reason, but when that happens why doesn\u2019t he rise in revolt, instead of cringing like a whipped dog? It is not honest. I don\u2019t like it. That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t always try to calm my husband, because if he went too far, all that would happen would be that Saniette would stay away; and I don\u2019t want that because I may tell you that he hasn\u2019t a penny in the world, he needs his dinners. But after all, if he does mind, he can stay away, it has nothing to do with me, when a person depends on other people he should try not to be such an idiot.\u201d \u201cThe Duchy of Aumale was in our family for years before passing to the House of France,\u201d M. de Charlus was explaining to M. de Cambremer, before a speechless Morel, for whom, as a matter of fact, the whole of this dissertation was, if not actually addressed to him, intended. \u201cWe took precedence over all foreign Princes; I could give you a hundred examples. The Princesse de Croy having attempted, at the burial of Monsieur, to fall on her knees after my great-great-grandmother, that lady reminded her sharply that she had not the privilege of the hassock, made the officer on duty remove it, and reported the matter to the King, who ordered Mme. de Croy to call upon Mme. de Guermantes and offer her apologies. The Duc de Bourgogne having come to us with ushers with raised wands, we obtained the King\u2019s authority to have them lowered. I know it is not good form to speak of the merits of one\u2019s own family. But it is well known that our people were always to the fore in the hour of danger. Our battle-cry, after we abandoned that of the Dukes of Brabant, was Passavant! So that it is fair enough after all that this right to be everywhere the first, which we had established for so many centuries in war, should afterwards have been confirmed to us at Court. And, egad, it has always been admitted there. I may give you a further instance, that of the Princess of Baden. As she had so far forgotten herself as to attempt to challenge the precedence of that same Duchesse de Guermantes of whom I was speaking just now, and had attempted to go in first to the King\u2019s presence, taking advantage of a momentary hesitation which my relative may perhaps have shewn (although there could be no reason for it), the King called out: \u2018Come in, cousin, come in; Mme. de Baden knows very well what her duty is to you.\u2019 And it was as Duchesse de Guermantes that she held this rank, albeit she was of no mean family herself, since she was through her mother niece to the Queen of Poland, the Queen of Hungary, the Elector Palatine, the Prince of Savoy-Carignano and the Elector of Hanover, afterwards King of England.\u201d \u201cMaecenas atavis \u00e9dite regibus!\u201d said Brichot, addressing M. de Charlus, who acknowledged the compliment with a slight inclination of his head. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mme. Verdurin asked Brichot, anxious to make amends to him for her previous speech. \u201cI was referring, Heaven forgive me, to a dandy who was the pick of the basket\u201d (Mme. Verdurin winced) \u201cabout the time of Augustus\u201d (Mme. Verdurin, reassured by the remoteness in time of this basket, assumed a more serene expression), \u201cof a friend of Virgil and Horace who carried their sycophancy to the extent of proclaiming to his face his more than aristocratic, his royal descent, in a word I was referring to Maecenas, a bookworm who was the friend of Horace, Virgil, Augustus. I am sure that M. de Charlus knows all about Maecenas.\u201d With a gracious, sidelong glance at Mme. Verdurin, because he had heard her make an appointment with Morel for the day after next and was afraid that she might not invite him also, \u201cI should say,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cthat Maecenas was more or less the Verdurin of antiquity.\u201d Mme. Verdurin could not altogether suppress a smile of satisfaction. She went over to Morel. \u201cHe\u2019s nice, your father\u2019s friend,\u201d she said to him. \u201cOne can see that he\u2019s an educated man, and well bred. He will get on well in our little nucleus. What is his address in Paris?\u201d Morel preserved a haughty silence and merely proposed a game of cards. Mme. Verdurin insisted upon a little violin music first. To the general astonishment, M. de Charlus, who never referred to his own considerable gifts, accompanied, in the purest style, the closing passage (uneasy, tormented, Schumannesque, but, for all that, earlier than Franck\u2019s Sonata) of the Sonata for piano and violin by Faur\u00e9. I felt that he would furnish Morel, marvellously endowed as to tone and virtuosity, with just those qualities that he lacked, culture and style. But I thought with curiosity of this combination in a single person of a physical blemish and a spiritual gift. M. de Charlus was not very different from his brother, the Duc de Guermantes. Indeed, a moment ago (though this was rare), he had spoken as bad French as his brother. He having reproached me (doubtless in order that I might speak in glowing terms of Morel to Mme. Verdurin) with never coming to see him, and I having pleaded discretion, he had replied: \u201cBut, since it is I that asks you, there is no one but I who am in a position to take offence.\u201d This might have been said by the Duc de Guermantes. M. de Charlus was only a Guermantes when all was said. But it had been enough that nature should upset the balance of his nervous system sufficiently to make him prefer to the woman that his brother the Duke would have chosen one of Virgil\u2019s shepherds or Plato\u2019s disciples, and at once qualities unknown to the Duc de Guermantes and often combined with this want of balance had made M. de Charlus an exquisite pianist, an amateur painter who was not devoid of taste, an eloquent talker. Who would ever have detected that the rapid, eager, charming style with which M. de Charlus played the Schumannesque passage of Faur\u00e9\u2018s Sonata had its equivalent \u2014 one dares not say its cause \u2014 in elements entirely physical, in the nervous defects of M. de Charlus? We shall explain later on what we mean by nervous defects, and why it is that a Greek of the time of Socrates, a Roman of the time of Augustus might be what we know them to have been and yet remain absolutely normal men, and not men-women such as we see around us to-day. Just as he had genuine artistic tendencies, which had never come to fruition, so M. de Charlus had, far more than the Duke, loved their mother, loved his own wife, and indeed, years after her death, if anyone spoke of her to him would shed tears, but superficial tears, like the perspiration of an over-stout man, whose brow will glisten with sweat at the slightest exertion. With this difference, that to the latter we say: \u201cHow hot you are,\u201d whereas we pretend not to notice other people\u2019s tears. We, that is to say, people in society; for the humbler sort are as distressed by the sight of tears as if a sob were more serious than a hemorrhage. His sorrow after the death of his wife, thanks to the habit of falsehood, did not debar M. de Charlus from a life which was not in harmony \u2022with it. Indeed later on, he sank so low as to let it be known that, during the funeral rites, he had found an opportunity of asking the acolyte for his name and address. And it may have been true\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the piece eame to an end, I ventured to ask for some Franck, which appeared to cause Mme. de Cambremer such acute pain that I did not insist. \u201cYou can\u2019t admire that sort of thing,\u201d she said to me. Instead she asked for Debussy\u2019s F\u00eates, which made her exclaim: \u201cAh! How sublime!\u201d from the first note. But Morel discovered that he remembered the opening bars only, and in a spirit of mischief, without any intention to deceive, began a March by Meyerbeer. Unfortunately, as he left little interval and made no announcement, everybody supposed that he was still playing Debussy, and continued to exclaim \u2018Sublime!\u2019 Morel, by revealing that the composer was that not of Pell\u00e9as but of Robert le Diable created a certain chill. Mme. de Cambremer had scarcely time to feel it, for she had just discovered a volume of Scarlatti, and had flung herself upon it with an hysterical impulse. \u201cOh! Play this, look, this piece, it\u2019s divine,\u201d she cried. And yet, of this composer long despised, recently ^promoted to the highest honours, what she had selected in her feverish impatience was one of those infernal pieces which have so often kept us from sleeping, while a merciless pupil repeats them indefinitely on the next floor. But Morel had had enough music, and as he insisted upon cards, M. de Charlus, to be able to join in, proposed a game of whist. \u201cHe was telling the Master just now that he is a Prince,\u201d said Ski to Mme. Verdurin, \u201cbut it\u2019s not true, they\u2019re quite a humble family of architects.\u201d \u201cI want to know what it was you were saying about Maecenas. It interests me, don\u2019t you know!\u201d Mme. Verdurin repeated to Brichot, with an affability that carried him off his feet. And so, in order to shine in the Mistress\u2019s eyes, and possibly in mine: \u201cWhy, to tell you the truth, Madame, Maecenas interests me chiefly because he is the earliest apostle of note of that Chinese god who numbers more followers in France to-day than Brahma, than Christ himself, the all-powerful God Ubedamd.\u201d Mme. Verdurin was no longer content, upon these occasions, with burying her head in her hands. She would descend with the suddenness of the insects called ephemeral upon Princess Sherbatoff; were the latter within reach the Mistress would cling to her shoulder, dig her nails into it, and hide her face against it for a few moments like a child playing at hide and seek. Concealed by this protecting screen, she was understood to be laughing until she cried and was as well able to think of nothing at all as people are who while saying a prayer that is rather long take the wise precaution of burying their faces in their hands. Mme. Verdurin used to imitate them when she listened to Beethoven quartets, so as at the same time to let it be seen that she regarded them as a prayer and not to let it be seen that she was asleep. \u201cI am quite serious, Madame,\u201d said Brichot. \u201cToo numerous, I consider, to-day is become the person who spends his time gazing at his navel as though it were the hub of the universe. As a matter of doctrine, I have no objection to offer to some Nirvana which will dissolve us in the great Whole (which, like Munich and Oxford, is considerably nearer to Paris than Asni\u00e8res or Bois-Colombes), but it is unworthy either of a true Frenchman, or of a true European even, when the Japanese are possibly at the gates of our Byzantium, that socialised anti-militarists should be gravely discussing the cardinal virtues of free verse.\u201d Mme. Verdurin felt that she might dispense with the Princess\u2019s mangled shoulder, and allowed her face to become once more visible, not without pretending to wipe her eyes and gasping two or three times for breath. But Brichot was determined that I should have my share in the entertainment, and having learned, from those oral examinations which he conducted so admirably, that the best way to flatter the young is to lecture them, to make them feel themselves important, to make them regard you as a reactionary: \u201cI have no wish to blaspheme against the Gods of Youth,\u201d he said, with that furtive glance at myself which a speaker turns upon a member of his audience whom he has mentioned by name. \u201cI have no wish to be damned as a heretic and renegade in the Mallarm\u00e9an chapel in which our new friend, like all the young men of his age, must have served the esoteric mass, at least as an acolyte, and have shewn himself deliquescent or Rosicrucian. But, really, we have seen more than enough of these intellectuals worshipping art with a big A, who, when they can no longer intoxicate themselves upon Zola, inject themselves with Verlaine. Become etheromaniacs out of Baude-lairean devotion, they would no longer be capable of the virile effort which the country may, one day or another, demand of them, anaesthetised as they are by the great literary neurosis in the heated, enervating atmosphere, heavy with unwholesome vapours, of a symbolism of the opium-pipe.\u201d Feeling incapable of feigning any trace of admiration for Brichot\u2019s inept and motley tirade, I turned to Ski and assured him that he was entirely mistaken as to the family to which M. de Charlus belonged; he replied that he was certain of his facts, and added that I myself had said that his real name was Gandin, Le Gandin. \u201cI told you,\u201d was my answer, \u201cthat Mme. de Cambremer was the sister of an engineer, M. Legrandin. I never said a word to you about M. de Charlus. There is about as much connexion between him and Mme. de Cambremer as between the Great Cond\u00e9 and Racine.\u201d \u201cIndeed! I thought there was,\u201d said Ski lightly, with no more apology for his mistake than he had made a few hours earlier for the mistake that had nearly made his party miss the train. \u201cDo you intend to remain long on this coast?\u201d Mme. Verdurin asked M. de Charlus, in whom she foresaw an addition to the faithful and trembled lest he should be returning too soon to Paris. \u201cGood Lord, one never knows,\u201d replied M. de Charlus in a nasal drawl. \u201cI should like to stay here until the end of September.\u201d \u201cYou are quite right,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin; \u201cthat is the time for fine storms at sea.\u201d \u201cTo tell you the truth, that is not what would influence me. I have for some time past unduly neglected the Archangel Saint Michael, my patron, and I should like to make amends to him by staying for his feast, on the 29th of September, at the Abbey on the Mount.\u201d \u201cYou take an interest in all that sort of thing?\u201d asked Mme. Verdurin, who might perhaps have succeeded in hushing the voice of her outraged anti-clericalism, had she not been afraid that so long an expedition might make the violinist and the Baron \u2018fail\u2019 her for forty-eight hours. \u201cYou are perhaps afflicted with intermittent deafness,\u201d M. de Charlus replied insolently. \u201cI have told you that Saint Michael is one of my glorious patrons.\u201d Then, smiling with a benevolent ecstasy, his eyes gazing into the distance, his voice strengthened by an excitement which seemed now to be not merely aesthetic but religious: \u201cIt is so beautiful at the offertory when Michael stands erect by the altar, in a white robe, swinging a golden censer heaped so high with perfumes that the fragrance of them mounts up to God.\u201d \u201cWe might go there in a party,\u201d suggested Mme. Verdurin, notwithstanding her horror of the clergy. \u201cAt that moment, when the offertory begins,\u201d went on M. de Charlus who, for other reasons but in the same manner as good speakers in Parliament, never replied to an interruption and would pretend not to have heard it, \u201cit would be wonderful to see our young friend Palestrinising, indeed performing an aria by Bach. The worthy Abbot, too, would be wild with joy, and that is the greatest homage, at least the greatest public homage that I can pay to my Holy Patron. What an edification for the faithful! We must mention it presently to the young Angelico of music, a warrior like Saint Michael.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saniette, summoned to make a fourth, declared that he did not know how to play whist. And Cottard, seeing that there was not much time left before our train, embarked at once on a game of \u00e9cart\u00e9 with Morel. M. Verdurin was furious, and bore down with a terrible expression upon Saniette. \u201cIs there anything in the world that you can play?\u201d he cried, furious at being deprived of the opportunity for a game of whist, and delighted to have found one to insult the old registrar. He, in his terror, did his best to look clever. \u201cYes, I can play the piano,\u201d he said. Cottard and Morel were seated face to face. \u201cYour deal,\u201d said Cottard. \u201cSuppose we go nearer to the card-table,\u201d M. de Charlus, worried by the sight of Morel in Cottard\u2019s company, suggested to M. de Cambremer. \u201cIt is quite as interesting as those questions of etiquette which in these days have ceased to count for very much. The only kings that we have left, in France at least, are the kings in the pack of cards, who seem to me to be positively swarming in the hand of our young virtuoso,\u201d he added a moment later, from an admiration for Morel which extended to his way of playing cards, to flatter him also, and finally to account for his suddenly turning to lean over the young violinist\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI-ee cut,\u201d said (imitating the accent of a cardsharper) Cottard, whose children burst out laughing, like his students and the chief dresser, whenever the master, even by the bedside of a serious case, uttered with the emotionless face of an epileptic one of his hackneyed witticisms. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to play,\u201d said Morel, seeking advice from M. de Charlus. \u201cJust as you please, you\u2019re bound to lose, whatever you play, it\u2019s all the same (c\u2019est \u00e9gal).\u201d \u201cEgal . . . Ingalli?\u201d said the doctor, with an insinuating, kindly glance at M. de Cambremer. \u201cShe was what we call a true diva, she was a dream, a Carmen such as we shall never see again. She was wedded to the part. I used to enjoy too listening to Ingalli \u2014 married.\u201d The Marquis drew himself up with that contemptuous vulgarity of well-bred people who do not realise that they are insulting their host by appearing uncertain whether they ought to associate with his guests, and adopt English manners by way of apology for a scornful expression: \u201cWho is that gentleman playing cards, what does he do for a living, what does he sell? I rather like to know whom I am meeting, so as not to make friends with any Tom, Dick or Harry. But I didn\u2019t catch his name when you did me the honour of introducing me to him.\u201d If M. Verdurin, availing himself of this phrase, had indeed introduced M. de Cambremer to his fellow-guests, the other would have been greatly annoyed. But, knowing that it was the opposite procedure that was observed, he thought it gracious to assume a genial and modest air, without risk to himself. The pride that M. Verdurin took in his intimacy with Cottard had increased if anything now that the doctor had become an eminent professor. But it no longer found expression in the artless language of earlier days. Then, when Cottard was scarcely known to the public, if you spoke to M. Verdurin of his wife\u2019s facial neuralgia: \u201cThere is nothing to be done,\u201d he would say, with the artless self-satisfaction of people who assume that anyone whom they know must be famous, and that everybody knows the name of their family singing-master. \u201cIf she had an ordinary doctor, one might look for a second opinion, but when that doctor is called Cottard\u201d (a name which he pronounced as though it were Bouchard or Charcot) \u201cone has simply to bow to the inevitable.\u201d Adopting a reverse procedure, knowing that M. de Cambremer must certainly have heard of the famous Professor Cottard, M. Verdurin adopted a tone of simplicity. \u201cHe\u2019s our family doctor, a worthy soul whom we adore and who would let himself be torn in pieces for our sakes; he is not a doctor, he is a friend, I don\u2019t suppose you have ever heard of him or that his name would convey anything to you, in any case to us it is the name of a very good man, of a very dear friend, Cottard.\u201d This name, murmured in a modest tone, took in M. de Cambremer who supposed that his host was referring to some one else. \u201cCottard? You don\u2019t mean Professor Cottard?\u201d At that moment one heard the voice of the said Professor who, at an awkward point in the game, was saying as he looked at his cards: \u201cThis is where Greek meets Greek.\u201d \u201cWhy, yes, to be sure, he is a professor,\u201d said M. Verdurin. \u201cWhat! Professor Cottard! You are not making a mistake?-You are quite sure it\u2019s the same man? The one who lives in the Rue du Bac?\u201d \u201cYes, his address is 43, Rue du Bac. You know him?\u201d \u201cBut everybody knows Professor Cottard. He\u2019s at the top of the tree! You might as well ask me if I knew Bouffe de Saint-Biaise or Courtois-Suffit. I could see when I heard him speak that he was not an ordinary person, that is why I took the liberty of asking you.\u201d \u201cCome now, what shall I play, trumps?\u201d asked Cottard. Then abruptly, with a vulgarity which would have been offensive even in heroic circumstances, as when a soldier uses a coarse expression to convey his contempt for death, but became doubly stupid in the safe pastime of a game of cards, Cottard, deciding to play a trump, assumed a sombre, suicidal air, and, borrowing the language of people who are risking their skins, played his card as though it were his life, with the exclamation: \u201cThere it is, and be damned to it!\u201d It was not the right card to play, but he had a consolation. In the middle of the room, in a deep armchair, Mme. Cottard, yielding to the effect, which she always found irresistible, of a good dinner, had succumbed after vain efforts to the vast and gentle slumbers that were overpowering her. In vain might she sit up now and again, and smile, whether at her own absurdity or from fear of leaving unanswered some polite speech that might have been addressed to her, she sank back, in spite of herself, into the clutches of the implacable and delicious malady. More than the noise, what awakened her thus for an instant only, was the giance (which, in her wifely affection she could see even when her eyes were shut, and foresaw, for the same scene occurred every evening and haunted her dreams like the thought of the hour at which one will have to rise), the glance with which the Professor drew the attention of those present to his wife\u2019s slumbers. To begin with, he merely looked at her and smiled, for if as a doctor he disapproved of this habit of falling asleep after dinner (or at least gave this scientific reason for growing annoyed later on, but it is not certain whether it was a determining reason, so many and diverse were the views that he held about it), as an all-powerful and teasing husband, he was delighted to be able to make a fool of his wife, to rouse her only partly at first, so that she might fall asleep again and he have the pleasure of waking her afresh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this time, Mme. Cottard was sound asleep. \u201cNow then, L\u00e9ontine you\u2019re snoring,\u201d the professor called to her. \u201cI am listening to Mme. Swann, my dear,\u201d Mme. Cottard replied faintly, and dropped back into her lethargy. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect nonsense,\u201d exclaimed Cottard, \u201cshe\u2019ll be telling us presently that she wasn\u2019t asleep. She\u2019s like the patients who come to consult us and insist that they never sleep at all.\u201d \u201cThey imagine it, perhaps,\u201d said M. de Cambremer with a laugh. But the doctor enjoyed contradicting no less than teasing, and would on no account allow a layman to talk medicine to him. \u201cPeople do not imagine that they never sleep,\u201d he promulgated in a dogmatic tone. \u201cAh!\u201d replied the Marquis with a respectful bow, such as Cottard at one time would have made. \u201cIt is easy to see,\u201d Cottard went on, \u201cthat you have never administered, as I have, as much as two grains of trional without succeeding in provoking som-nolescence.\u201d \u201cQuite so, quite so,\u201d replied the Marquis, laughing with a superior air, \u201cI have never taken trional, or any of those drugs which soon cease to have any effect but ruin your stomach. When a man has been out shooting all night, like me, in the forest of Chantepie, I can assure you he doesn\u2019t need any trional to make him sleep.\u201d \u201cIt is only fools who say that,\u201d replied the Professor. \u201cTrional frequently has a remarkable effect on the nervous tone. You mention trional, have you any idea what it is?\u201d \u201cWell . . . I\u2019ve heard people say that it is a drug to make one sleep.\u201d \u201cYou are not answering my question,\u201d replied the Professor, who, thrice weekly, at the Faculty, sat on the board of examiners. \u201cI don\u2019t ask you whether it makes you sleep or not, but what it is. Can you tell me what percentage it contains of amyl and ethyl?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer with embarrassment. \u201cI prefer a good glass of old brandy or even 345 Port.\u201d \u201cWhich are ten times as toxic,\u201d the Professor interrupted. \u201cAs for trional,\u201d M. de Cambremer ventured, \u201cmy wife goes in for all that sort of thing, you\u2019d better talk to her about it.\u201d \u201cShe probably knows just as much about it as yourself. In any case, if your wife takes trional to make her sleep, you can see that mine has no need of it. Come along, L\u00e9ontine, wake up, you\u2019re getting ankylosed, did you ever see me fall asleep after dinner? What will you be like when you\u2019re sixty, if you fall asleep now like an old woman? You\u2019ll go and get fat, you\u2019re arresting the circulation. She doesn\u2019t even hear what I\u2019m saying.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re bad for one\u2019s health, these little naps after dinner, ain\u2019t they, Doctor?\u201d said M. de Cambremer, seeking to rehabilitate himself with Cottard. \u201cAfter a heavy meal one ought to take exercise.\u201d \u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d replied the Doctor. \u201cWe have taken identical quantities of food from the stomach of a dog that has lain quiet and from the stomach of a dog that has been running about and it is in the former that digestion is more advanced.\u201d \u201cThen it is sleep that stops digestion.\u201d \u201cThat depends upon whether you mean oesophagic digestion, stomachic digestion, intestinal digestion; it is useless to give you explanations which you would not understand since you have never studied medicine. Now then, L\u00e9ontine, quick march, it is time we were going.\u201d This was not true, for the doctor was going merely to continue his game, but he hoped thus to cut short in a more drastic fashion the slumbers of the deaf mute to whom he had been addressing without a word of response the most learned exhortations. Whether a determination to remain awake survived in Mme. Cottard, even in the state of sleep, or because the armchair offered no support to her head, it was jerked mechanically from left to right, and up and down, in the empty air, like a lifeless object, and Mme. Cottard, with her nodding poll, appeared now to be listening to music, now to be in the last throes of death. Where her husband\u2019s increasingly vehement admonitions failed of their effect, her sense of her own stupidity proved successful. \u201cMy bath is nice and hot,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut the feathers in the dictionary . . . \u201d she exclaimed as she sat bolt upright. \u201cOh! Good lord, what a fool I am. Whatever have I been saying, I was thinking about my hat, I\u2019m sure I said something silly, in another minute I should have been asleep, it\u2019s that wretched fire.\u201d Everybody began to laugh, for there was no fire in the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Note: In the French text of Sodome et Gomorrhe, Volume II ends at this point.]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are making fun of me,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, herself laughing, and raising her hand to her brow to wipe away, with the light touch of a hypnotist and the sureness of a woman putting her hair straight, the last traces of sleep, \u201cI must offer my humble apologies to dear Mme. Verdurin and ask her to tell me the truth.\u201d But her smile at once grew sorrowful, for the Professor who knew that his wife sought to please him and trembled lest she should fail, had shouted at her: \u201cLook at yourself in the glass, you are as red as if you had an eruption of acne, you look just like an old peasant.\u201d \u201cYou know, he is charming,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201che has such a delightfully sarcastic side to his character. And then, he snatched my husband from the jaws of death when the whole Faculty had given him up. He spent three nights by his bedside, without ever lying down. And so Cottard to me, you know,\u201d she went on, in a grave and almost menacing tone, raising her hand to the twin spheres, shrouded in white tresses, of her musical temples, and as though we had wished to assault the doctor, \u201cis sacred! He could ask me for anything in the world! As it is, I don\u2019t call him Doctor Cottard, I call him Doctor God! And even in saying that I am slandering him, for this God does everything in his power to remedy some of the disasters for which the other is responsible.\u201d \u201cPlay a trump,\u201d M. de Charlus said to Morel with a delighted air. \u201cA trump, here goes,\u201d said the violinist. \u201cYou ought to have declared your king first,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cyou\u2019re not paying attention to the game, but how well you play!\u201d \u201cI have the king,\u201d said Morel. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine man,\u201d replied the Professor. \u201cWhat\u2019s all that business up there with the sticks?\u201d asked Mme. Verdurin, drawing M. de Cambremer\u2019s attention to a superb escutcheon carved over the mantelpiece. \u201cAre they your arms?\u201d she added with an ironical disdain. \u201cNo, they are not ours,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer. \u201cWe bear, barry of five, embattled counter-embattled or and gules, as many trefoils countercharged. No, those are the arms of the Arrachepels, who were not of our stock, but from whom we inherited the house, and nobody of our line has ever made any changes here. The Arrachepels (formerly Pelvilains, we are told) bore or five piles couped in base gules. When they allied themselves with the F\u00e9terne family, their blazon changed, but remainedcantoned within twenty cross crosslets fitchee in base or, a dexter canton ermine.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one for her!\u201d muttered Mme. de Cambremer. \u201cMy great-grandmother was a d\u2019Arrachepel or de Rachepel, as you please, for both forms are found in the old charters,\u201d continued M. de Cambremer, blushing vividly, for only then did the idea for which his wife had given him credit occur to him, and he was afraid that Mme. Verdurin might have applied to herself a speech which had been made without any reference to her. \u201cThe history books say that, in the eleventh century, the first Arrachepel, Mace, named Pelvilain, shewed a special aptitude, in siege warfare, in tearing up piles. Whence the name Arrachepel by which he was ennobled, and the piles which you see persisting through the centuries in their arms. These are the piles which, to render fortifications more impregnable, used to be driven, plugged, if you will pardon the expression, into the ground in front of them, and fastened together laterally. They are what you quite rightly called sticks, though they had nothing to do with the floating sticks of our good Lafontaine. For they were supposed to render a stronghold unassailable. Of course, with our modern artillery, they make one smile. But you must bear in mind that I am speaking of the eleventh century.\u201d \u201cIt is all rather out of date,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cbut the little campanile has a character.\u201d \u201cYou have,\u201d said Cottard, \u201cthe luck of . . . turlututu,\u201d a word which he gladly repeated to avoid using Moli\u00e8re\u2019s. \u201cDo you know why the king of diamonds was turned out of the army?\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t mind being in his shoes,\u201d said Morel, who was tired of military service. \u201cOh! What a bad patriot,\u201d exclaimed M. de Charlus, who could not refrain from pinching the violinist\u2019s ear. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t know why the king of diamonds was turned out of the army,\u201d Cottard pursued, determined to make his joke, \u201cit\u2019s because he has only one eye.\u201d \u201cYou are up against it, Doctor,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, to shew Cottard that he knew who he was. \u201cThis young man is astonishing,\u201d M. de Charlus interrupted innocently. \u201cHe plays like a god.\u201d This observation did not find favour with the doctor, who replied: \u201cNever too late to mend. Who laughs last, laughs longest.\u201d \u201cQueen, ace,\u201d Morel, whom fortune was favouring, announced triumphantly. The doctor bowed his head as though powerless to deny this good fortune, and admitted, spellbound: \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cWe are so pleased to have met M. de Charlus,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer to Mme. Verdurin. \u201cHad you never met him before? He is quite nice, he is unusual, he is of a period\u201c (she would have found it difficult to say which), replied Mme. Verdurin with the satisfied smile of a connoisseur, a judge and a hostess. Mme. de Cambremer asked me if I was coming to F\u00e9terne with Saint-Loup. I could not suppress a cry of admiration when I saw the moon hanging like an orange lantern beneath the vault of oaks that led away from the house. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, presently, when the moon has risen higher and the valley is lighted up, it will be a thousand times better.\u201d \u201cAre you staying any time in this neighbourhood, Madame?\u201d M. de Cambremer asked Mme. Cottard, a speech that might be interpreted as a vague intention to invite and dispensed him for the moment from making any more precise engagement. \u201cOh, certainly, Sir, I regard this annual exodus as most important for the children. Whatever you may say, they must have fresh air. The Faculty wanted to send me to Vichy; but it is too stuffy there, and I can look after my stomach when those big boys of mine have grown a little bigger. Besides, the Professor, with all the examinations he has to hold, has always got his shoulder to the wheel, and the hot weather tires him dreadfully. I feel that a man needs a thorough rest after he has been on the go all the year like that. Whatever happens we shall stay another month at least.\u201d \u201cAh! In that case we shall meet again.\u201d \u201cBesides, I shall be all the more obliged to stay here as my husband has to go on a visit to Savoy, and won\u2019t be finally settled here for another fortnight.\u201d \u201cI like the view of the valley even more than the sea view,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on. \u201cYou are going to have a splendid night for your journey.\u201d \u201cWe ought really to find out whether the carriages are ready, if you are absolutely determined to go back to Balbec to-night,\u201d M. Verdurin said to me, \u201cfor I see no necessity for it myself. We could drive you over to-morrow morning. It is certain to be fine. The roads are excellent.\u201d I said that it was impossible. \u201cBut in any case it is not time yet,\u201d the Mistress protested. \u201cLeave them alone, they have heaps of time. A lot of good it will do them to arrive at the station with an hour to wait. They are far happier here. And you, my young Mozart,\u201d she said to Morel, not venturing to address M. de Charlus directly, \u201cwon\u2019t you stay the night? We have some nice rooms facing the sea.\u201d \u201cNo, he can\u2019t,\u201d M. de Gharlus replied on behalf of the absorbed card-player who had not heard. \u201cHe has a pass until midnight only. He must go back to bed like a good little boy, obedient, and well-behaved,\u201d he added in a complaisant, mannered, insistent voice, as though he derived some sadic pleasure from the use of this chaste comparison and also from letting his voice dwell, in passing, upon any reference to Morel, from touching him with (failing his fingers) words that seemed to explore his person\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the sermon that Brichot had addressed to me, M. de Cambremer had concluded that I was a Dreyfusard. As he himself was as anti-Dreyfusard as possible, out of courtesy to a foe, he began to sing me the praises of a Jewish colonel who had always been very decent to a cousin of the Chevregny and had secured for him the promotion he deserved. \u201cAnd my cousin\u2019s opinions were the exact opposite,\u201d said M. de Cambremer; he omitted to mention what those opinions were, but I felt that they were as antiquated and misshapen as his own face, opinions which a few families in certain small towns must long have entertained. \u201cWell, you know, I call that really fine!\u201d was M. de Cambremer\u2019s conclusion. It is true that he was hardly employing the word \u2018fine\u2019 in the aesthetic sense in which it would have suggested to his wife and mother different works, but works, anyhow, of art. M. de Cambremer often made use of this term, when for instance he was congratulating a delicate person who had put on a little flesh. \u201cWhat, you have gained half-a-stone in two months. I say, that\u2019s fine!\u201d Refreshments were set out on a table. Mme. Verdurin invited the gentlemen to go and choose whatever drinks they preferred. M. de Charlus went and drank his glass and at once returned to a seat by the card-table from which he did not stir. Mme. Verdurin asked him: \u201cHave you tasted my orangeade?\u201d Upon which M. de Charlus, with a gracious smile, in a crystalline tone which he rarely sounded and with endless motions of his lips and body, replied: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, it was strawberry-juice, I think, it was delicious.\u201d It is curious that a certain order of secret actions has the external effect of a manner of speaking or gesticulating which reveals them. If a gentleman believes or disbelieves in the Immaculate Conception, or in the innocence of Dreyfus, or in a plurality of worlds, and wishes to keep his opinion to himself, you will find nothing in his voice or in his movements that will let you read his thoughts. But on hearing M. de Charlus say in that shrill voice and with that smile and waving his arms: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, the strawberry-juice,\u201d one could say: \u201cThere, he likes the stronger sex,\u201d with the same certainty as enables a judge to sentence a criminal who has not confessed, a doctor a patient suffering from general paralysis who himself is perhaps unaware of his malady but has made some mistake in pronunciation from which one can deduce that he will be dead in three years. Perhaps the people who conclude from a man\u2019s way of saying: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, the strawberry-juice,\u201d a love of the kind called unnatural, have no need of any such scientific knowledge. But that is because there is a more direct relation between the revealing sign and the secret. Without saying it in so many words to oneself, one feels that it is a gentle, smiling lady who is answering and who appears mannered because she is pretending to be a man and one is not accustomed to seeing men adopt such mannerisms. And it is perhaps more pleasant to think that for long years a certain number of angelic women have been included by mistake in the masculine sex where, in exile, ineffectually beating their wings towards men in whom they inspire a physical repulsion, they know how to arrange a drawing-room, compose \u2018interiors.\u2019 M. de Charlus was not in the least perturbed that Mme. Verdurin should be standing, and remained installed in his armchair so as to be nearer to Morel. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it criminal,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin to the Baron, \u201cthat that creature who might be enchanting us with his violin should be sitting there at a card-table. When anyone can play the violin like that!\u201d \u201cHe plays cards well, he does everything well, he is so intelligent,\u201d said M. de Charlus, keeping his eye on the game, so as to be able to advise Morel. This was not his only reason, however, for not rising from his chair for Mme. Verdurin. With the singular amalgam that he had made of the social conceptions at once of a great nobleman and an amateur of art, instead of being polite in the same way that a man of his world would be, he would create a sort of tableau-vivant for himself after Saint-Simon; and at that moment was amusing himself by impersonating the Mar\u00e9chal d\u2019Uxelles, who interested him from other aspects also, and of whom it is said that he was so proud as to remain seated, with a pretence of laziness, before all the most distinguished persons at court. \u201cBy the way, Charlus,\u201d said Mme. Verdurip, who was beginning to grow familiar, \u201cyou don\u2019t know of any ruined old nobleman in your Faubourg who would come to me as porter?\u201d \u201cWhy, yes . . . why, yes,\u201d replied M. de Charlus with a genial smile, \u201cbut I don\u2019t advise it.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI should be afraid for your sake, that your smart visitors would call at the lodge and go no farther.\u201d This was the first skirmish between them. Mme. Verdurin barely noticed it. There were to be others, alas, in Paris. M. de Charlus remained glued to his chair. He could not, moreover, restrain a faint smile, seeing how his favourite maxims as to aristocratic prestige and middle-class cowardice were confirmed by the so easily won submission of Mme. Verdurin. The Mistress appeared not at all surprised by the Baron\u2019s posture, and if she left him it was only because she had been perturbed by seeing me taken up by M. de Cambremer. But first of all, she wished to clear up the mystery of M. de Charlus\u2019s relations with Comtesse Mole. \u201cYou told me that you knew Mme. de Mol\u00ea. Does that mean, you go there?\u201d she asked, giving to the words \u2018go there\u2019 the sense of being received there, of having received authority from the lady to go and call upon her. M. de Charlus replied with an inflexion of disdain, an affectation of precision and in a sing-song tone: \u201cYes, sometimes.\u201d This \u2018sometimes\u2019 inspired doubts in Mme. Verdurin, who asked: \u201cHave you ever met the Duc de Guermantes there?\u201d \u201cAh! That I don\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cyou don\u2019t know the Duc de Guermantes?\u201d \u201cAnd how should I not know him?\u201d replied M. de Charlus, his lips curving in a smile. This smile was ironical; but as the Baron was afraid of letting a gold tooth be seen, he stopped it with a reverse movement of his lips, so that the resulting sinuosity was that of a good-natured smile. \u201cWhy do you say: \u2018How should I not know him?\u2019 \u201c \u201cBecause he is my brother,\u201d said M. de Charlus carelessly, leaving Mme. Verdurin plunged in stupefaction and in the uncertainty whether her guest was making fun of her, was a natural son, or a son by another marriage. The idea that the brother of the Duc de Guermantes might be called Baron de Charlus never entered her head. She bore down upon me. \u201cI heard M. de Cambremer invite you to dinner just now. It has nothing to do with me, you understand. But for your own sake, I do hope you won\u2019t go. For one thing, the place is infested with bores. Oh! If you like dining with provincial Counts and Marquises whom nobody knows, you will be supplied to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d \u201cI think I shall be obliged to go there once or twice. I am not altogether free, however, for I have a young cousin whom I cannot leave by herself\u201d (I felt that this fictitious kinship made it easier for me to take Albertine about). \u201cBut as for the Cambremers, as I have been introduced to them. . . . \u201d \u201cYou shall do just as you please. One thing I can tell you: it\u2019s extremely unhealthy; when you have caught pneumonia, or a nice little chronic rheumatism, you\u2019ll be a lot better off!\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t the place itself very pretty?\u201d \u201cMmmmyess. . . . If you like. For my part, I confess frankly that I would a hundred times rather have the view from here over this valley. To begin with, if they\u2019d paid us I wouldn\u2019t have taken the other house because the sea air is fatal to M. Verdurin. If your cousin suffers at all from nerves. . . . But you yourself have bad nerves, I think you have choking fits. Very well! You shall see. Go there once, you won\u2019t sleep for a week after it; but it\u2019s not my business.\u201d And without thinking of the inconsistency with what she had just been saying: \u201cIf it would amuse you to see the house, which is not bad, pretty is too strong a word, still it is amusing with its old moat, and the old drawbridge, as I shall have to sacrifice myself and dine there once, very well, come that day, I shall try to bring all my little circle, then it will be quite nice. The day after to-morrow we are going to Harambouville in the carriage. It\u2019s a magnificent drive, the cider is delicious. Come with us. You, Brichot, you shall come too. And you too, Ski. That will make a party which, as a matter of fact, my husband must have arranged already. I don\u2019t know whom all he has invited, Monsieur de Charlus, are you one of them?\u201d The Baron, who had not heard the whole speech, and did not know that she was talking of an excursion to Harambouville, gave a start. \u201cA strange question,\u201d he murmured in a mocking tone by which Mme. Verdurin felt hurt. \u201cAnyhow,\u201d she said to me, \u201cbefore you dine with the Cambremers, why not bring her here, your cousin? Does she like conversation, and clever people? Is she pleasant? Yes, very well then. Bring her with you. The Cambremers aren\u2019t the only people in the world. I can understand their being glad to invite her, they must find it difficult to get anyone. Here she will have plenty of fresh air, and lots of clever men. In any case, I am counting on you not to fail me next Wednesday. I heard you were having a tea-party at Rivebelle with your cousin, and M. de Charlus, and I forget who\u2019 else. You must arrange to bring the whole lot on here, it would be nice if you all came in a body. It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to get here, the roads are charming; if you like I can send down for you. I can\u2019t imagine what you find attractive in Rivebelle, it\u2019s infested with mosquitoes. You are thinking perhaps of the reputation of the rock-cakes. My cook makes them far better. I can let you have them, here, Norman rock-cakes, the real article, and shortbread; I need say no more. Ah! If you like the filth they give you at Rivebelle, that I won\u2019t give you, I don\u2019t poison my guests, Sir, and even if I wished to, my cook would refuse to make such abominations and would leave my service. Those rock-cakes you get down there, you can\u2019t tell what they are made of. I knew a poor girl who got peritonitis from them, which carried her off in three days. She was only seventeen. It was sad for her poor mother,\u201d added Mme. Verdurin with a melancholy air beneath the spheres of her temples charged with experience and suffering. \u201cHowever, go and have tea at Rivebelle, if you enjoy being fleeced and flinging money out of the window. But one thing I beg of you, it is a confidential mission I am charging you with, on the stroke of six, bring all your party here, don\u2019t allow them to go straggling away by themselves. You can bring whom you please. I wouldn\u2019t say that to everybody. But I am sure that your friends are nice, I can see at once that we understand one another. Apart from the little nucleus, there are some very pleasant people coming on Wednesday. You don\u2019t know little Madame de Longpont. She is charming, and so witty, not in the least a snob, you will find, you\u2019ll like her immensely. And she\u2019s going to bring a whole troop of friends too,\u201d Mme. Verdurin added to shew me that this was the right thing to do and encourage me by the other\u2019s example. \u201cWe shall see which has most influence and brings most people, Barbe de Longpont or you. And then I believe somebody\u2019s going to bring Bergotte,\u201d she added with a vague air, this meeting with a celebrity being rendered far from likely by a paragraph which had appeared in the papers that morning, to the effect that the great writer\u2019s health was causing grave anxiety. \u201cAnyhow, you will see that it will be one of my most successful Wednesdays, I don\u2019t want to have any boring women. You mustn\u2019t judge by this evening, it has been a complete failure. Don\u2019t try to be polite, you can\u2019t have been more bored than I was, I thought myself it was deadly. It won\u2019t always be like to-night, you know! I\u2019m not thinking of the Cambremers, who are impossible, but I have known society people who were supposed to be pleasant, well, compared with my little nucleus, they didn\u2019t exist. I heard you say that you thought Swann clever. I must say, to my mind, his cleverness was greatly exaggerated, but without speaking of the character of the man, which I have always found fundamentally antipathetic, sly, underhand, I have often had him to dinner on Wednesdays. Well, you can ask the others, even compared with Brichot, who is far from being anything wonderful, a good assistant master, whom I got into the Institute, Swann was simply nowhere. He was so dull!\u201d And, as I expressed a contrary opinion: \u201cIt\u2019s the truth. I don\u2019t want to say a word against him to you, since he was your friend, indeed he was very fond of you, he has spoken to me about you in the most charming way, but ask the others here if he ever said anything interesting, at our dinners. That, after all, is the supreme test. Well, I don\u2019t know why it was, but Swann, in my house, never seemed to come off, one got nothing out of him. And yet anything there ever was in him he picked up here.\u201d I assured her that he was highly intelligent. \u201cNo, you only think that, because you haven\u2019t known him as long as I have. One got to the end of him very soon. I was always bored to death by him.\u201d (Which may be interpreted: \u201cHe went to the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles and the Guermantes and knew that I didn\u2019t.\u201d) \u201cAnd I can put up with anything, except being bored. That, I cannot and will not stand!\u201d Her horror of boredom was now the reason upon which Mme. Verdurin relied to explain the composition of the little group. She did not yet entertain duchesses because she was incapable of enduring boredom, just as she was unable to go for a cruise, because of sea-sickness. I thought to myself that what Mme. Verdurin said was not entirely false, and, whereas the Guermantes would have declared Brichot to be the stupidest man they had ever met, I remained uncertain whether he were not in reality superior, if not to Swann himself, at least to the other people endowed with the wit of the Guermantes who would have had the good taste to avoid and the modesty to blush at his pedantic pleasantries; I asked myself the question as though a fresh light might be thrown on the nature of the intellect by the answer that I should make, and with the earnestness of a Christian influenced by Port-Royal when he considers the problem of Grace. \u201cYou will see,\u201d Mme. Verdurin continued, \u201cwhen one has society people together with people of real intelligence, people of our set, that\u2019s where one has to see them, the society man who is brilliant in the kingdom of the blind, is only one-eyed here. Besides, the others don\u2019t feel at home any longer. So much so that I\u2019m inclined to ask myself whether, instead of attempting mixtures that spoil everything, I shan\u2019t start special evenings confined to the bores so as to have the full benefit of my little nucleus. However: you are coming again with your cousin. That\u2019s settled. Good. At any rate you will both find something to eat here. F\u00e9terne is starvation corner. Oh, by the way, if you like rats, go there at once, you will get as many as you want. And they will keep you there as long as you are prepared to stay. Why, you\u2019ll die of hunger. I\u2019m sure, when I go there, I shall have my dinner before I start. The more the merrier, you must come here first and escort me. We shall have high tea, and supper when we get back. Do you like apple-tarts? Yes, very well then, our chef makes the best in the world. You see, I was quite right when I told you that you were meant to live here. So come and stay. You know, there is far more room in the house than people think. I don\u2019t speak of it, so as not to let myself in for bores. You might bring your cousin to stay. She would get a change of air from Balbec. With this air here, I maintain I can cure incurables. I have cured them, I may tell you, and not only this time. For I have stayed quite close to here before, a place I discovered and got for a mere song, a very different style of house from their Raspelicre. I can shew you it if we go for a drive together. But I admit that even here the air is invigorating. Still, I don\u2019t want to say too much about it, the whole of Paris would begin to take a fancy to my little corner. That has always been my luck. Anyhow, give your cousin my message. We shall put you in two nice rooms looking over the valley, you ought to see it in the morning, with the sun shining on the mist! By the way, who is this Robert de Saint-Loup of whom you were speaking?\u201d she said with a troubled air, for she had heard that I was to pay him a visit at Donci\u00e8res, and was afraid that he might make me fail her. \u201cWhy not bring him here instead, if he\u2019s not a bore. I have heard of him from Morel; I fancy he\u2019s one of his greatest friends,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin with entire want of truth, for Saint-Loup and Morel were not even aware of one another\u2019s existence. But having heard that Saint-Loup knew M. de Charlus, she supposed that it was through the violinist, and wished to appear to know all about them. \u201cHe\u2019s not taking up medicine, by any chance, or literature? You know, if you want any help about examinations, Cottard can do anything, and I make what use of him I please. As for the Academy later on, for I suppose he\u2019s not old enough yet, I have several notes in my pocket. Your friend would find himself on friendly soil here, and it might amuse him perhaps to see over the house. Life\u2019s not very exciting at Donci\u00e8res. But you shall do just what you please, then you can arrange what you think best,\u201d she concluded, without insisting, so as not to appear to be trying to know people of noble birth, and because she always maintained that the system by which she governed the faithful, to wit despotism, was named liberty. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter with you,\u201d she said, at the sight of M. Verdurin who, with gestures of impatience, was making for the wooden terrace that ran along the side of the drawing-room above the valley, like a man who is bursting with rage and must have fresh air. \u201cHas Saniette been annoying you again? But you know what an idiot he is, you have to resign yourself to him, don\u2019t work yourself up into such a state. I dislike this sort of thing,\u201d she said to me, \u201cbecause it is bad for him, it sends the blood to his head. But I must say that one would need the patience of an angel at times to put up with Saniette, and one must always remember that it is a charity to have him in the house. For my part I must admit that he\u2019s so gloriously silly, I can\u2019t help enjoying him. I dare say you heard what he said after dinner: \u2018I can\u2019t play whist, but I can the piano.\u2019 Isn\u2019t it superb? It is positively colossal, and incidentally quite untrue, for he knows nothing at all about either. But my husband, beneath his rough exterior, is very sensitive, very kind-hearted, and Saniette\u2019s self-centred way of always thinking about the effect he is going to make drives himcrazy. Come, dear, calm yourself, you know Cottard told you that it was bad for your liver. And it is I that will have to bear the brunt of it all,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cTo-morrow Saniette will come back all nerves and tears. Poor man, he is very ill indeed. Still, that is no reason why he should kill other people. Besides, even at times when he is in pain, when one would like to be sorry for him, his silliness hardens one\u2019s heart. He is really too stupid. You have only to tell him quite politely that these scenes make you both ill, and he is not to come again, since that\u2019s what he\u2019s most afraid of, it will have a soothing effect on his nerves,\u201d Mme. Verdurin whispered to her husband\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One could barely make out the sea from the windows on the right. But those on the other side shewed the valley, now shrouded in a snowy cloak of moonlight. Now and again one heard the voices of Morel and Cottard. \u201cYou have a trump?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAh! You\u2019re in luck, you are,\u201d said M. de Cambremer to Morel, in answer to his question, for he had seen that the doctor\u2019s hand was full of trumps. \u201cHere comes the lady of diamonds,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cThat\u2019s a trump, you know? My trick. But there isn\u2019t a Sorbonne any longer,\u201d said the doctor to M. de Cambremer; \u201cthere\u2019s only the University of Paris.\u201d M. de Cambremer confessed his inability to understand why the doctor made this remark to him. \u201cI thought you were talking about the Sorbonne,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cI heard you say: tu nous la sors bonne,\u201d he added, with a wink, to shew that this was meant for a pun. \u201cJust wait a moment,\u201d he said, pointing to his adversary, \u201cI have a Trafalgar in store for him.\u201d And the prospect must have been excellent for the doctor, for in his joy his shoulders began to shake rapturously with laughter, which in his family, in the \u2018breed\u2019 of the Cottards, was an almost zoological sign of satisfaction. In the previous generation the gesture of rubbing the hands together as though one were soaping them used to accompany this movement. Cottard himself had originally employed both forms simultaneously, but one fine day, nobody ever knew by whose intervention, wifely, professorial perhaps, the rubbing of the hands had disappeared. The doctor even at dominoes, when he got his adversary on the run, and made him take the double six, which was to him the keenest of pleasures, contented himself with shaking his shoulders. And when \u2014 which was as seldom as possible \u2014 he went down to his native village for a few days, and met his first cousin, who was still at the hand-rubbing stage, he would say to Mme. Cottard on his return: \u201cI thought poor Ren\u00e9 very common.\u201d \u201cHave you the little dee-ar?\u201d he said, turning to Morel. \u201cNo? Then I play this old David.\u201d \u201cThen you have five, you have won!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a great victory, Doctor,\u201d said the Marquis. \u201cA Pyrrhic victory,\u201d said Cottard, turning to face the Marquis and looking at him over his glasses to judge the effect of his remark. \u201cIf there is still time,\u201d he said to Morel, \u201cI give you your revenge. It is my deal. Ah! no, here come the carriages, it will have to be Friday, and I shall shew you a trick you don\u2019t see every day.\u201d M. and Mme. Verdurin accompanied us to the door. The Mistress was especially coaxing with Saniette so as to make certain of his returning next time. \u201cBut you don\u2019t look to me as if you were properly wrapped up, my boy,\u201d said M. Verdurin, whose age allowed him to address me in this paternal tone. \u201cOne would say the weather had changed.\u201d These words filled me with joy, as though the profoundly hidden life, the uprising of different combinations which they implied in nature, hinted at other changes, these occurring in my own life, and created fresh possibilities in it. Merely by opening the door upon the park, before leaving, one felt that a different \u2018weather\u2019 had, at that mo-merit, taken possession of the scene; cooling breezes, one of the joys of summer, were rising in the fir plantation (where long ago Mme. de Cambremer had dreamed of Chopin) and almost imperceptibly, in caressing coils, capricious eddies, were beginning their gentle nocturnes. I declined the rug which, on subsequent evenings, I was to accept when Albertine was with me, more to preserve the secrecy of my pleasure than to avoid the risk of cold. A vain search was made for the Norwegian philosopher. Had he been seized by a colic? Had he been afraid of missing the train? Had an aeroplane come to fetch him? Had he been carried aloft in an Assumption? In any case he had vanished without anyone\u2019s noticing his departure, like a god. \u201cYou are unwise,\u201d M. de Cambremer said to me, \u201cit\u2019s as cold as charity.\u201d \u201cWhy charity?\u201d the doctor inquired. \u201cBeware of choking,\u201d the Marquis went on. \u201cMy sister never goes out at night. However, she is in a pretty bad state at present. In any case you oughtn\u2019t to stand about bare-headed, put your tile on at once.\u201d \u201cThey are not frigorifie chokings,\u201d said Cottard sententiously. \u201cOh, indeed!\u201d M. de Cambremer bowed. \u201cOf course, if that\u2019s your opinion. . . . \u201d \u201cOpinions of the press!\u201d said the doctor, smiling round his glasses. M. de Cambremer laughed, but, feeling certain that he was in the right, insisted: \u201cAll the same,\u201d he said, \u201cwhenever my sister goes out after dark, she has an attack.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no use quibbling,\u201d replied the doctor, regardless of his want of manners. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t practise medicine by the seaside, unless I am called in for a consultation. I am here on holiday.\u201d He was perhaps even more on holiday than he would have liked. M. de Cambremer having said to him as they got into the carriage together: \u201cWe are fortunate in having quite close to us (not on your side of the Day, on the opposite side, but it is quite narrow at that point) another medical celebrity, Doctor du Boulbon,\u201d Cottard, who, as a rule, from \u2018deontology,\u2019 abstained from criticising his colleagues, could not help exclaiming, as he had exclaimed to me on the fatal day when we had visited the little casino: \u201cBut he is not a doctor. He practises \u2018a literary medicine, it is all fantastic therapeutics, charlatanism. All the same, we are on quite good terms. I should take the boat and go over and pay him a visit, if I weren\u2019t leaving.\u201d But, from the air which Cottard assumed in speaking of du Boulbon to M. de Cambremer, I felt that the boat which he would gladly have taken to call upon him would have greatly resembled that vessel which, in order to go and ruin the waters discovered by another literary doctor, Virgil (who took all their patients from them as well), the doctors of Salerno had chartered, but which sank with them on the voyage. \u201cGood-bye, my dear Saniette, don\u2019t forget to come to-morrow, you know how my husband enjoys seeing you. He enjoys your wit, your intellect; yes indeed, you know quite well, he takes sudden moods, but he can\u2019t live without seeing you. It\u2019s always the first thing he asks me: \u2018Is Saniette coming? I do so enjoy seeing him.\u2019\u201d \u201cI never said anything of the sort,\u201d said M. Verdurin to Saniette with a feigned frankness which seemed perfectly to reconcile what the Mistress had just said with the manner in which he treated Saniette. Then looking at his watch, doubtless so as not to prolong the leave-taking in the damp night air, he warned the coachmen not to lose any time, but to be careful when going down the hill, and assured us that we should be in plenty of time for our train. This was to set down the faithful, one at one station, another at another, ending with myself, for no one else was going as far as Balbec, and beginning with the Cambremers. They, so as not to bring their horses all the way up to la Raspeli\u00e8re at night, took the train with us at Douville-F\u00e9terne. The station nearest to them was indeed not this, which, being already at some distance from the village, was farther still from the mansion, but la Sogne. On arriving at the station of Douville-F\u00e9terne, M. de Cambremer made a point of giving a \u2018piece,\u2019 as Fran\u00e7oise used to say, to the Verdurins\u2019 coachman (the nice, sensitive coachman, with melancholy thoughts), for M. de Cambremer was generous, and in that respect took, rather, \u2018after his mamma.\u2019 But, possibly because his \u2018papa\u2019s\u2019 strain intervened at this point, he felt a scruple, or else that there might be a mistake \u2014 either on his part, if, for instance, in the dark, he were to give a you instead of a franc, or on the recipient\u2019s who might not perceive the importance of the present that was being given him. And so he drew attention to it: \u201cIt is a franc I\u2019m giving you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said to the coachman, turning the coin until it gleamed in the lamplight, and so that the faithful might report his action to Mme. Verdurin. \u201cIsn\u2019t it? Twenty sous is right, as it\u2019s only a short drive.\u201d He and Mme. de Cambremer left us at la Sogne. \u201cI shall tell my sister,\u201d he repeated to me, \u201cthat you have choking fits, I am sure she will be interested.\u201d I understood that he meant: \u2018will be pleased.\u2019 As for his wife, she employed, in saying good-bye to me, two abbreviations which, even in writing, used to shock me at that time in a letter, although one has grown accustomed to them since, but which, when spoken, seem to me to-day even to contain in their deliberate carelessness, in their acquired familiarity, something insufferably pedantic: \u201cPleased to have met you,\u201d she said to me; \u201cgreetings to Saint-Loup, if you see him.\u201d In making this speech, Mme. de Cambremer pronounced the name \u2018Saint-Loupe.\u2019 I have never discovered who had pronounced it thus in her hearing, or what had led her to suppose that it ought to be so pronounced. However it may be, for some weeks afterwards, she continued to say \u2018Saint-Loupe\u2019 and a man who had a great admiration for her and echoed her in every way did the same. If other people said \u2018Saint-Lou,\u2019 they would insist, would say emphatically \u2018Saint-Loupe,\u2019 whether to teach the others an indirect lesson or to be different from them. But, no doubt, women of greater brilliance than Mme. de Cambremer told her, or gave her indirectly to understand that this was not the correct pronunciation, and that what she regarded as a sign of originality was a mistake which would make people think her little conversant with the usages of society, for shortly afterwards Mme. de Cambremer was again saying \u2018Saint-Lou,\u2019 and her admirer similarly ceased to hold out, whether because she had lectured him, or because he had noticed that she no longer sounded the final consonant, and had said to himself that if a woman of such distinction, energy and ambition had yielded, it must have been on good grounds. The worst of her admirers was her husband. Mme. de Cambremer loved to tease other people in a way that was often highly impertinent. As soon as she began to attack me, or anyone else, in this fashion, M. de Cambremer would start watching her victim, laughing the while. As the Marquis had a squint \u2014 a blemish which gives an effect of wit to the mirth even of imbeciles \u2014 the effect of this laughter was to bring a segment of pupil into the otherwise complete whiteness of his eye. So a sudden rift brings a patch of blue into an otherwise clouded sky. His monocle moreover protected, like the glass over a valuable picture, this delicate operation. As for the actual intention of his laughter, it was hard to say whether it was friendly: \u201cAh! You rascal! You\u2019re in an enviable position, aren\u2019t you. You have won the favour of a lady who has a pretty wit!\u201d Or coarse: \u201cWell, Sir, I hope you\u2019ll learn your lesson, you\u2019ve got to eat a slice of humble pie.\u201d Or obliging: \u201cI\u2019m here, you know, I take it with a laugh because it\u2019s all pure fun, but I shan\u2019t let you be ill-treated.\u201d Or cruelly accessory: \u201cI don\u2019t need to add my little pinch of salt, but you can see, I\u2019m revelling in all the insults she is showering on you. I\u2019m wriggling like a hunchback, therefore I approve, I, the husband. And so, if you should take it into your head to answer back, you would have me to deal with, my young Sir. I should first of all give you a pair of resounding smacks, well aimed, then we should go and cross swords in the forest of Chantepie.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whatever the correct interpretation of the husband\u2019s merriment, the wife\u2019s whimsies soon came to an end. Whereupon M. de Cambremer ceased to laugh, the temporary pupil vanished and as one had forgotten for a minute or two to expect an entirely white eyeball, it gave this ruddy Norman an air at once anaemic and ecstatic, as though the Marquis had just undergone an operation, or were imploring heaven, through his monocle, for the palms of martyrdomEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0,

long\nPretty baby, since you went away\nHaven't spent a happy day\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wake up crying\nAfter sobbing and sighing\nAnd wondering just what went wrong\nPretty baby, I was good to you\nWhy'd you go and make me blue?\n[Bridge]\nI need your arms to hold me tight\nI need your lips to kiss me goodnight\nI'm so unhappy on my own\nDon't, don't, leave me sad and lonely\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wake up crying\nAfter tossing and turning\nAnd yearning the whole night long\nPretty baby, please come back to me\nSave me from this misery\n\n[Outro]\nOh baby, won't you save me from this misery?\nOh baby, won't you save me from this misery?You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/855085", "artist_names": "Brook Benton", "full_title": "Frankie And Johnny

But this fusion of all the companies into one was looked upon unfavourably; there was an outcry against monopolies, as if immense capital were not needed for carrying out enterprises of this kind!\n\nDeslauriers, who had read for the purpose the work of Gobet and the articles of M. Chappe in the Journal des Mines, understood the question perfectly. He demonstrated that the law of 1810 established for the benefit of the grantee a privilege which could not be transferred. Besides, a democratic colour might be given to the undertaking. To interfere with the formation of coal-mining companies was against the principle even of association.\n\nM. Dambreuse intrusted to him some notes for the purpose of drawing up a memorandum. As for the way in which he meant to pay for the work, he was all the more profuse in his promises from the fact that they were not very definite.\n\nDeslauriers called again at Frederick's house, and gave him an account of the interview. Moreover, he had caught a glimpse of Madame Dambreuse at the bottom of the stairs, just as he was going out.\n\n\"I wish you joy\u2014upon my soul, I do!\"\nThen they had a chat about the election. There was something to be devised in order to carry it.\n\nThree days later Deslauriers reappeared with a sheet of paper covered with handwriting, intended for the newspapers, and which was nothing less than a friendly letter from M. Dambreuse, expressing approval of their friend's candidature. Supported by a Conservative and praised by a Red, he ought to succeed. How was it that the capitalist had put his signature to such a lucubration? The advocate had, of his own motion, and without the least appearance of embarrassment, gone and shown it to Madame Dambreuse, who, thinking it quite appropriate, had taken the rest of the business on her own shoulders.\n\nFrederick was astonished at this proceeding. Nevertheless, he approved of it; then, as Deslauriers was to have an interview with M. Roque, his friend explained to him how he stood with regard to Louise.\n\n\"Tell them anything you like; that my affairs are in an unsettled state, that I am putting them in order. She is young enough to wait!\"\n\nDeslauriers set forth, and Frederick looked upon himself as a very able man. He experienced, moreover, a feeling of gratification, a profound satisfaction. His delight at being the possessor of a rich woman was not spoiled by any contrast. The sentiment harmonised with the surroundings. His life now would be full of joy in every sense.\n\nPerhaps the most delicious sensation of all was to gaze at Madame Dambreuse in the midst of a number of other ladies in her drawing-room. The propriety of her manners made him dream of other attitudes. While she was talking in a tone of coldness, he would recall to mind the loving words which she had murmured in his ear. All the respect which he felt for her virtue gave him a thrill of pleasure, as if it were a homage which was reflected back on himself; and at times he felt a longing to exclaim:\n\n\"But I know her better than you! She is mine!\"\n\nIt was not long ere their relations came to be socially recognised as an established fact. Madame Dambreuse, during the whole winter, brought Frederick with her into fashionable society.\n\nHe nearly always arrived before her; and he watched her as she entered the house they were visiting with her arms uncovered, a fan in her hand, and pearls in her hair. She would pause on the threshold (the lintel of the door formed a framework round her head), and she would open and shut her eyes with a certain air of indecision, in order to see whether he was there.\n\nShe drove him back in her carriage; the rain lashed the carriage-blinds. The passers-by seemed merely shadows wavering in the mire of the street; and, pressed close to each other, they observed all these things vaguely with a calm disdain. Under various pretexts, he would linger in her room for an entire additional hour.\n\nIt was chiefly through a feeling of ennui that Madame Dambreuse had yielded. But this latest experience was not to be wasted. She desired to give herself up to an absorbing passion; and so she began to heap on his head adulations and caresses.\n\nShe sent him flowers; she had an upholstered chair made for him. She made presents to him of a cigar-holder, an inkstand, a thousand little things for daily use, so that every act of his life should recall her to his memory. These kind attentions charmed him at first, and in a little while appeared to him very simple.\n\nShe would step into a cab, get rid of it at the opening into a by-way, and come out at the other end; and then, gliding along by the walls, with a double veil on her face, she would reach the street where Frederick, who had been keeping watch, would take her arm quickly to lead her towards his house. His two men-servants would have gone out for a walk, and the doorkeeper would have been sent on some errand. She would throw a glance around her\u2014nothing to fear!\u2014and she would breathe forth the sigh of an exile who beholds his country once more. Their good fortune emboldened them. Their appointments became more frequent. One evening, she even presented herself, all of a sudden, in full ball-dress. These surprises might have perilous consequences. He reproached her for her lack of prudence. Nevertheless, he was not taken with her appearance. The low body of her dress exposed her thinness too freely.\nIt was then that he discovered what had hitherto been hidden from him\u2014the disillusion of his senses. None the less did he make professions of ardent love; but in order to call up such emotions he found it necessary to evoke the images of Rosanette and Madame Arnoux.\n\nThis sentimental atrophy left his intellect entirely untrammelled; and he was more ambitious than ever of attaining a high position in society. Inasmuch as he had such a stepping-stone, the very least he could do was to make use of it.\n\nOne morning, about the middle of January, S\u00e9n\u00e9cal entered his study, and in response to his exclamation of astonishment, announced that he was Deslauriers' secretary. He even brought Frederick a letter. It contained good news, and yet it took him to task for his negligence; he would have to come down to the scene of action at once. The future deputy said he would set out on his way there in two days' time.\n\nS\u00e9n\u00e9cal gave no opinion on the other's merits as a candidate. He spoke about his own concerns and about the affairs of the country.\n\nMiserable as the state of things happened to be, it gave him pleasure, for they were advancing in the direction of Communism. In the first place, the Administration led towards it of its own accord, since every day a greater number of things were controlled by the Government. As for Property, the Constitution of '48, in spite of its weaknesses, had not spared it. The State might, in the name of public utility, henceforth take whatever it thought would suit it. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal declared himself in favour of authority; and Frederick noticed in his remarks the exaggeration which characterised what he had said himself to Deslauriers. The Republican even inveighed against the masses for their inadequacy.\n\n\"Robespierre, by upholding the right of the minority, had brought Louis XVI. to acknowledge the National Convention, and saved the people. Things were rendered legitimate by the end towards which they were directed. A dictatorship is sometimes indispensable. Long live tyranny, provided that the tyrant promotes the public welfare!\"\n\nTheir discussion lasted a long time; and, as he was taking his departure, S\u00e9n\u00e9cal confessed (perhaps it was the real object of his visit) that Deslauriers was getting very impatient at M. Dambreuse's silence.\n\nBut M. Dambreuse was ill. Frederick saw him every day, his character of an intimate friend enabling him to obtain admission to the invalid's bedside.\n\nGeneral Changarnier's recall had powerfully affected the capitalist's mind. He was, on the evening of the occurrence, seized with a burning sensation in his chest, together with an oppression that prevented him from lying down. The application of leeches gave him immediate relief. The dry cough disappeared; the respiration became more easy; and, eight days later, he said, while swallowing some broth:\n\n\"Ah! I'm better now\u2014but I was near going on the last long journey!\"\n\n\"Not without me!\" exclaimed Madame Dambreuse, intending by this remark to convey that she would not be able to outlive him.\n\nInstead of replying, he cast upon her and upon her lover a singular smile, in which there was at the same time resignation, indulgence, irony, and even, as it were, a touch of humour, a sort of secret satisfaction almost amounting to actual joy.\n\nFrederick wished to start for Nogent. Madame Dambreuse objected to this; and he unpacked and re-packed his luggage by turns according to the changes in the invalid's condition.\nSuddenly M. Dambreuse spat forth considerable blood. The \"princes of medical science,\" on being consulted, could not think of any fresh remedy. His legs swelled, and his weakness increased. He had several times evinced a desire to see C\u00e9cile, who was at the other end of France with her husband, now a collector of taxes, a position to which he had been appointed a month ago. M. Dambreuse gave express orders to send for her. Madame Dambreuse wrote three letters, which she showed him.\n\nWithout trusting him even to the care of the nun, she did not leave him for one second, and no longer went to bed. The ladies who had their names entered at the door-lodge made enquiries about her with feelings of admiration, and the passers-by were filled with respect on seeing the quantity of straw which was placed in the street under the windows.\n\nOn the 12th of February, at five o'clock, a frightful h\u00e6moptysis came on. The doctor who had charge of him pointed out that the case had assumed a dangerous aspect. They sent in hot haste for a priest.\n\nWhile M. Dambreuse was making his confession, Madame kept gazing curiously at him some distance away. After this, the young doctor applied a blister, and awaited the result.\n\nThe flame of the lamps, obscured by some of the furniture, lighted up the apartment in an irregular fashion. Frederick and Madame Dambreuse, at the foot of the bed, watched the dying man. In the recess of a window the priest and the doctor chatted in low tones. The good sister on her knees kept mumbling prayers.\n\nAt last came a rattling in the throat. The hands grew cold; the face began to turn white. Now and  then he drew a deep breath all of a sudden; but gradually this became rarer and rarer. Two or three confused words escaped him. He turned his eyes upward, and at the same moment his respiration became so feeble that it was almost imperceptible. Then his head sank on one side on the pillow.\n\nFor a minute, all present remained motionless.\n\nMadame Dambreuse advanced towards the dead body of her husband, and, without an effort\u2014with the unaffectedness of one discharging a duty\u2014she drew down the eyelids. Then she spread out her two arms, her figure writhing as if in a spasm of repressed despair, and quitted the room, supported by the physician and the nun.\n\nA quarter of an hour afterwards, Frederick made his way up to her apartment.\n\nThere was in it an indefinable odour, emanating from some delicate substances with which it was filled. In the middle of the bed lay a black dress, which formed a glaring contrast with the pink coverlet.\n\nMadame Dambreuse was standing at the corner of the mantelpiece. Without attributing to her any passionate regret, he thought she looked a little sad; and, in a mournful voice, he said:\n\n\"You are enduring pain?\"\n\n\"I? No\u2014not at all.\"\n\nAs she turned around, her eyes fell on the dress, which she inspected. Then she told him not to stand on ceremony.\n\n\"Smoke, if you like! You can make yourself at home with me!\"\n\nAnd, with a great sigh:\n\n\"Ah! Blessed Virgin!\u2014what a riddance!\"\n\nFrederick was astonished at this exclamation. He replied, as he kissed her hand:\n\n\"All the same, you were free!\"\n\nThis allusion to the facility with which the intrigue between them had been carried on hurt Madame Dambreuse.\n\n\"Ah! you don't know the services that I did for him, or the misery in which I lived!\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Why, certainly! Was it a safe thing to have always near him that bastard, a daughter, whom he introduced into the house at the end of five years of married life, and who, were it not for me, might have led him into some act of folly?\"\n\nThen she explained how her affairs stood. The arrangement on the occasion of her marriage was that the property of each party should be separate.[I] The amount of her inheritance was three hundred thousand francs. M. Dambreuse had guaranteed by the marriage contract that in the event of her surviving him, she should have an income of fifteen thousand francs a year, together with the ownership of the mansion. But a short time afterwards he had made a will by which he gave her all he possessed, and this she estimated, so far as it was possible to ascertain just at present, at over three millions.\n\nFrederick opened his eyes widely.\n\n\"It was worth the trouble, wasn't it? However, I contributed to it! It was my own property I was protecting; C\u00e9cile would have unjustly robbed me of it.\"\n\n\"Why did she not come to see her father?\"\n\nAs he asked her this question Madame Dambreuse eyed him attentively; then, in a dry tone:\n\n\"I haven't the least idea! Want of heart, probably! Oh! I know what she is! And for that reason she won't get a farthing from me!\"\n\nShe had not been very troublesome, he pointed out; at any rate, since her marriage.\n\n\"Ha! her marriage!\" said Madame Dambreuse, with a sneer. And she grudged having treated only too well this stupid creature, who was jealous, self-interested, and hypocritical. \"All the faults of her father!\" She disparaged him more and more. There was never a person with such profound duplicity, and with such a merciless disposition into the bargain, as hard as a stone\u2014\"a bad man, a bad man!\"\n\nEven the wisest people fall into errors. Madame Dambreuse had just made a serious one through this overflow of hatred on her part. Frederick, sitting opposite her in an easy chair, was reflecting deeply, scandalised by the language she had used.\n\nShe arose and knelt down beside him.\n\n\"To be with you is the only real pleasure! You are the only one I love!\"\n\nWhile she gazed at him her heart softened, a nervous reaction brought tears into her eyes, and she murmured:\n\n\"Will you marry me?\"\n\nAt first he thought he had not understood what she meant. He was stunned by this wealth.\n\nShe repeated in a louder tone:\n\n\"Will you marry me?\"\n\nAt last he said with a smile:\n\n\"Have you any doubt about it?\"\n\nThen the thought forced itself on his mind that his conduct was infamous, and in order to make a kind of reparation to the dead man, he offered to watch by his side himself. But, feeling ashamed of this pious sentiment, he added, in a flippant tone:\n\n\"It would be perhaps more seemly.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so, indeed,\" she said, \"on account of the servants.\"\n\nThe bed had been drawn completely out of the alcove. The nun was near the foot of it, and at the head of it sat a priest, a different one, a tall, spare man, with the look of a fanatical Spaniard. On the night-table, covered with a white cloth, three wax-tapers were burning.\n\nFrederick took a chair, and gazed at the corpse.\n\nThe face was as yellow as straw. At the corners of the mouth there were traces of blood-stained foam. A silk handkerchief was tied around the skull, and on the breast, covered with a knitted waistcoat, lay a silver crucifix between the two crossed hands.\n\nIt was over, this life full of anxieties! How many journeys had he not made to various places? How many rows of figures had he not piled together? How many speculations had he not hatched? How many reports had he not heard read? What quackeries, what smiles and curvets! For he had acclaimed Napol\u00e9on, the Cossacks, Louis XVIII., 1830, the working-men, every r\u00e9gime, loving power so dearly that he would have paid in order to have the opportunity of selling himself.\n\nBut he had left behind him the estate of La Fortelle, three factories in Picardy, the woods of Cranc\u00e9 in the Yonne, a farm near Orl\u00e9ans, and a great deal of personal property in the form of bills and papers.\n\nFrederick thus made an estimate of her fortune; and it would soon, nevertheless, belong to him! First of all, he thought of \"what people would say\"; then he asked himself what present he ought to make to his mother, and he was concerned about his future equipages, and about employing an old coachman belonging to his own family as the doorkeeper. Of course, the livery would not be the same. He would convert the large reception-room into his own study. There was nothing to prevent him by knocking down three walls from setting up a picture-gallery on the second-floor. Perhaps there might be an opportunity for introducing into the lower portion of the house a hall for Turkish baths. As for M. Dambreuse's office, a disagreeable spot, what use could he make of it?\n\nThese reflections were from time to time rudely interrupted by the sounds made by the priest in blowing his nose, or by the good sister in settling the fire.\n\nBut the actual facts showed that his thoughts rested on a solid foundation. The corpse was there. The eyelids had reopened, and the pupils, although steeped in clammy gloom, had an enigmatic, intolerable expression.\n\nFrederick fancied that he saw there a judgment directed against himself, and he felt almost a sort of remorse, for he had never any complaint to make against this man, who, on the contrary\u2014\u2014\n\n\"Come, now! an old wretch!\" and he looked at the dead man more closely in order to strengthen his mind, mentally addressing him thus:\n\n\"Well, what? Have I killed you?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the priest read his breviary; the nun, who sat motionless, had fallen asleep. The wicks of the three wax-tapers had grown longer.\n\nFor two hours could be heard the heavy rolling of carts making their way to the markets. The window-panes began to admit streaks of white. A cab passed; then a group of donkeys went trotting over the pavement. Then came strokes of hammers, cries of itinerant vendors of wood and blasts of horns. Already every other sound was blended with the great voice of awakening Paris.\n\nFrederick went out to perform the duties assigned to him. He first repaired to the Mayor's office to make the necessary declaration; then, when the medical officer had given him a certificate of death, he called a second time at the municipal buildings in order to name the cemetery which the family had selected, and to make arrangements for the funeral ceremonies.\n\nThe clerk in the office showed him a plan which indicated the mode of interment adopted for the various classes, and a programme giving full particulars with regard to the spectacular portion of the funeral. Would he like to have an open funeral-car or a hearse with plumes, plaits on the horses, and aigrettes on the footmen, initials or a coat-of-arms, funeral-lamps, a man to display the family distinctions? and what number of carriages would he require?\n\nFrederick did not economise in the slightest degree. Madame Dambreuse was determined to spare no expense.\n\nAfter this he made his way to the church.\n\nThe curate who had charge of burials found fault with the waste of money on funeral pomps.  For instance, the officer for the display of armorial distinctions was really useless. It would be far better to have a goodly display of wax-tapers. A low mass accompanied by music would be appropriate.\n\nFrederick gave written directions to have everything that was agreed upon carried out, with a joint undertaking to defray all the expenses.\n\nHe went next to the H\u00f4tel de Ville to purchase a piece of ground. A grant of a piece which was two metres in length and one in breadth[J] cost five hundred francs. Did he want a grant for fifty years or forever?\n\n\"Oh, forever!\" said Frederick.\n\nHe took the whole thing seriously and got into a state of intense anxiety about it. In the courtyard of the mansion a marble-cutter was waiting to show him estimates and plans of Greek, Egyptian, and Moorish tombs; but the family architect had already been in consultation with Madame; and on the table in the vestibule there were all sorts of prospectuses with reference to the cleaning of mattresses, the disinfection of rooms, and the various processes of embalming.\n\nAfter dining, he went back to the tailor's shop to order mourning for the servants; and he had still to discharge another function, for the gloves that he had ordered were of beaver, whereas the right kind for a funeral were floss-silk.\n\nWhen he arrived next morning, at ten o'clock, the large reception-room was filled with people, and nearly everyone said, on encountering the others, in a melancholy tone:\n\n\"It is only a month ago since I saw him! Good heavens! it will be the same way with us all!\"\n\n\"Yes; but let us try to keep it as far away from us as possible!\"\n\nThen there were little smiles of satisfaction; and they even engaged in conversations entirely unsuited to the occasion. At length, the master of the ceremonies, in a black coat in the French fashion and short breeches, with a cloak, cambric mourning-bands, a long sword by his side, and a three-cornered hat under his arm, gave utterance, with a bow, to the customary words:\n\n\"Messieurs, when it shall be your pleasure.\"\n\nThe funeral started. It was the market-day for flowers on the Place de la Madeleine. It was a fine day with brilliant sunshine; and the breeze, which shook the canvas tents, a little swelled at the edges the enormous black cloth which was hung over the church-gate. The escutcheon of M. Dambreuse, which covered a square piece of velvet, was repeated there three times. It was: Sable, with an arm sinister or and a clenched hand with a glove argent; with the coronet of a count, and this device: By every path.\n\nThe bearers lifted the heavy coffin to the top of the staircase, and they entered the building. The six chapels, the hemicycles, and the seats were hung with black. The catafalque at the end of the choir formed, with its large wax-tapers, a single focus of yellow lights. At the two corners, over the candelabra, flames of spirits of wine were burning.\n\nThe persons of highest rank took up their position in the sanctuary, and the rest in the nave; and then the Office for the Dead began.\n\nWith the exception of a few, the religious ignorance of all was so profound that the master of the ceremonies had, from time to time, to make signs to them to rise, to kneel, or to resume their seats. The organ and the two double-basses could be heard alternately with the voices. In the intervals of silence, the only sounds that reached the ear were the mumblings of the priest at the altar; then the music and the chanting went on again.\n\nThe light of day shone dimly through the three cupolas, but the open door let in, as it were, a stream of white radiance, which, entering in a horizontal direction, fell on every uncovered head; and in the air, half-way towards the ceiling of the church, floated a shadow, which was penetrated by the reflection of the gildings that decorated the ribbing of the pendentives and the foliage of the capitals.\n\nFrederick, in order to distract his attention, listened to the Dies ir\u00e6. He gazed at those around him, or tried to catch a glimpse of the pictures hanging too far above his head, wherein the life of the Magdalen was represented. Luckily, Pellerin came to sit down beside him, and immediately plunged into a long dissertation on the subject of frescoes. The bell began to toll. They left the church.\n\nThe hearse, adorned with hanging draperies and tall plumes, set out for P\u00e8re-Lachaise drawn by four black horses, with their manes plaited, their heads decked with tufts of feathers, and with large trappings embroidered with silver flowing down to their shoes. The driver of the vehicle, in Hessian boots, wore a three-cornered hat with a long piece of crape falling down from it. The cords were held by four personages: a questor of the Chamber of Deputies, a member of the General Council of the Aube, a delegate from the coal-mining company, and Fumichon, as a friend. The carriage of the deceased and a dozen mourning-coaches followed. The persons attending at the funeral came in the rear, filling up the middle of the boulevard.\n\nThe passers-by stopped to look at the mournful procession. Women, with their brats in their arms, got up on chairs, and people, who had been drinking glasses of beer in the caf\u00e9s, presented themselves at the windows with billiard-cues in their hands.\n\nThe way was long, and, as at formal meals at which people are at first reserved and then expansive, the general deportment speedily relaxed. They talked of nothing but the refusal of an allowance by the Chamber to the President. M. Piscatory had shown himself harsh; Montalembert had been \"magnificent, as usual,\" and MM. Chamballe, Pidoux, Creton, in short, the entire committee would be compelled perhaps to follow the advice of MM. Quentin-Bauchard and Dufour.\n\nThis conversation was continued as they passed through the Rue de la Roquette, with shops on each side, in which could be seen only chains of coloured glass and black circular tablets covered with drawings and letters of gold\u2014which made them resemble grottoes full of stalactites and crockery-ware shops. But, when they had reached the cemetery-gate, everyone instantaneously ceased speaking.\n\nThe tombs among the trees: broken columns, pyramids, temples, dolmens, obelisks, and Etruscan vaults with doors of bronze. In some of them might be seen funereal boudoirs, so to speak, with rustic armchairs and folding-stools. Spiders' webs hung like rags from the little chains of the urns; and the bouquets of satin ribbons and the crucifixes were covered with dust. Everywhere, between the balusters on the tombstones, may be observed crowns of immortelles and chandeliers, vases, flowers, black discs set off with gold letters, and plaster statuettes\u2014little boys or little girls or little angels sustained in the air by brass wires; several of them have even a roof of zinc overhead. Huge cables made of glass strung together, black, white, or azure, descend from the tops of the monuments to the ends of the flagstones with long folds, like boas. The rays of the sun, striking on them, made them scintillate in the midst of the black wooden crosses. The hearse advanced along the broad paths, which are paved like the streets of a city. From time to time the axletrees cracked. Women, kneeling down, with their dresses trailing in the grass, addressed the dead in tones of tenderness. Little white fumes arose from the green leaves of the yew trees. These came from offerings that had been left behind, waste material that had been burnt.\n\nM. Dambreuse's grave was close to the graves of Manuel and Benjamin Constant. The soil in this place slopes with an abrupt decline. One has under his feet there the tops of green trees, further down the chimneys of steam-pumps, then the entire great city.\n\nFrederick found an opportunity of admiring the scene while the various addresses were being delivered.\n\nThe first was in the name of the Chamber of Deputies, the second in the name of the General Council of the Aube, the third in the name of the coal-mining company of Saone-et-Loire, the fourth in the name of the Agricultural Society of the Yonne,[260] and there was another in the name of a Philanthropic Society. Finally, just as everyone was going away, a stranger began reading a sixth address, in the name of the Amiens Society of Antiquaries.\n\nAnd thereupon they all took advantage of the occasion to denounce Socialism, of which M. Dambreuse had died a victim. It was the effect produced on his mind by the exhibitions of anarchic violence, together with his devotion to order, that had shortened his days. They praised his intellectual powers, his integrity, his generosity, and even his silence as a representative of the people, \"for, if he was not an orator, he possessed instead those solid qualities a thousand times more useful,\" etc., with all the requisite phrases\u2014\"Premature end; eternal regrets; the better land; farewell, or rather no, au revoir!\"\n\nThe clay, mingled with stones, fell on the coffin, and he would never again be a subject for discussion in society.\n\nHowever, there were a few allusions to him as the persons who had followed his remains left the cemetery. Hussonnet, who would have to give an account of the interment in the newspapers, took up all the addresses in a chaffing style, for, in truth, the worthy Dambreuse had been one of the most notable pots-de-vin[K] of the last reign. Then the citizens were driven in the mourning-coaches to their various places of business; the ceremony had not lasted very long; they congratulated themselves on the circumstance.\n\nFrederick returned to his own abode quite worn out.\n\nWhen he presented himself next day at Madame Dambreuse's residence, he was informed that she was busy below stairs in the room where M. Dambreuse had kept his papers.\n\nThe cardboard receptacles and the different drawers had been opened confusedly, and the account-books had been flung about right and left. A roll of papers on which were endorsed the words \"Repayment hopeless\" lay on the ground. He was near falling over it, and picked it up. Madame Dambreuse had sunk back in the armchair, so that he did not see her.\n\n\"Well? where are you? What is the matter!\"\n\nShe sprang to her feet with a bound.\n\n\"What is the matter? I am ruined, ruined! do you understand?\"\n\nM. Adolphe Langlois, the notary, had sent her a message to call at his office, and had informed her about the contents of a will made by her husband before their marriage. He had bequeathed everything to C\u00e9cile; and the other will was lost. Frederick turned very pale. No doubt she had not made sufficient search.\n\n\"Well, then, look yourself!\" said Madame Dambreuse, pointing at the objects contained in the room.\n\nThe two strong-boxes were gaping wide, having been broken open with blows of a cleaver, and she had turned up the desk, rummaged in the cupboards, and shaken the straw-mattings, when, all of a sudden, uttering a piercing cry, she dashed into corner where she had just noticed a little box with a brass lock. She opened it\u2014nothing!\n\n\"Ah! the wretch! I, who took such devoted care of him!\"\n\nThen she burst into sobs.\n\n\"Perhaps it is somewhere else?\" said Frederick.\n\n\"Oh! no! it was there! in that strong-box, I saw it there lately. 'Tis burned! I'm certain of it!\"\n\nOne day, in the early stage of his illness, M. Dambreuse had gone down to this room to sign some documents.\n\n\"'Tis then he must have done the trick!\"\n\nAnd she fell back on a chair, crushed. A mother grieving beside an empty cradle was not more woeful than Madame Dambreuse was at the sight of the open strong-boxes. Indeed, her sorrow, in spite of the baseness of the motive which inspired it, appeared so deep that he tried to console her by reminding her that, after all, she was not reduced to sheer want.\n\n\"It is want, when I am not in a position to offer you a large fortune!\"\n\nShe had not more than thirty thousand livres a year, without taking into account the mansion, which was worth from eighteen to twenty thousand, perhaps.\n\nAlthough to Frederick this would have been opulence, he felt, none the less, a certain amount of disappointment. Farewell to his dreams and to all the splendid existence on which he had intended to enter! Honour compelled him to marry Madame Dambreuse. For a minute he reflected; then, in a tone of tenderness:\n\n\"I'll always have yourself!\"\n\nShe threw herself into his arms, and he clasped her to his breast with an emotion in which there was a slight element of admiration for himself.\n\nMadame Dambreuse, whose tears had ceased to flow, raised her face, beaming all over with happiness, and seizing his hand:\n\n\"Ah! I never doubted you! I knew I could count on you!\"\n\nThe young man did not like this tone of anticipated certainty with regard to what he was pluming himself on as a noble action.\n\nThen she brought him into her own apartment, and they began to arrange their plans for the future. Frederick should now consider the best way of advancing himself in life. She even gave him excellent advice with reference to his candidature.\n\nThe first point was to be acquainted with two or three phrases borrowed from political economy. It was necessary to take up a specialty, such as the stud system, for example; to write a number of notes on questions of local interest, to have always at his disposal post-offices or tobacconists' shops, and to do a heap of little services. In this respect M. Dambreuse had shown himself a true model. Thus, on one occasion, in the country, he had drawn up his wagonette, full of friends of his, in front of a cobbler's stall, and had bought a dozen pairs of shoes for his guests, and for himself a dreadful pair of boots, which he had not even the courage to wear for an entire fortnight. This anecdote put them into a good humour. She related others, and that with a renewal of grace, youthfulness, and wit.\n\nShe approved of his notion of taking a trip immediately to Nogent. Their parting was an affectionate one; then, on the threshold, she murmured once more:\n\n\"You love me\u2014do you not?\"\n\n\"Eternally,\" was his reply.\n\nA messenger was waiting for him at his own house with a line written in lead-pencil informing him that Rosanette was about to be confined. He had been so much preoccupied for the past few days that he had not bestowed a thought upon the matter.\n\nShe had been placed in a special establishment at Chaillot.\n\nFrederick took a cab and set out for this institution.\n\nAt the corner of the Rue de Marbeuf he read on a board in big letters: \"Private Lying-in-Hospital, kept by Madame Alessandri, first-class midwife, ex-pupil of the Maternity, author of various works, etc.\" Then, in the centre of the street, over the door\u2014a little side-door\u2014there was another sign-board: \"Private Hospital of Madame Alessandri,\" with all her titles.\n\nFrederick gave a knock. A chambermaid, with the figure of an Abigail, introduced him into the reception-room, which was adorned with a mahogany table and armchairs of garnet velvet, and with a clock under a globe.\n\nAlmost immediately Madame appeared. She was a tall brunette of forty, with a slender waist, fine eyes, and the manners of good society. She apprised Frederick of the mother's happy delivery, and brought him up to her apartment.\n\nRosanette broke into a smile of unutterable bliss, and, as if drowned in the floods of love that were suffocating her, she said in a low tone:\n\n\"A boy\u2014there, there!\" pointing towards a cradle close to her bed.\n\nHe flung open the curtains, and saw, wrapped up in linen, a yellowish-red object, exceedingly shrivelled-looking, which had a bad smell, and which was bawling lustily.\n\n\"Embrace him!\"\n\nHe replied, in order to hide his repugnance:\n\n\"But I am afraid of hurting him.\"\n\n\"No! no!\"\n\nThen, with the tips of his lips, he kissed his child.\n\n\"How like you he is!\"\n\nAnd with her two weak arms, she clung to his neck with an outburst of feeling which he had never witnessed on her part before.\n\nThe remembrance of Madame Dambreuse came back to him. He reproached himself as a monster for having deceived this poor creature, who loved and suffered with all the sincerity of her nature. For several days he remained with her till night.\n\nShe felt happy in this quiet place; the window-shutters in front of it remained always closed. Her room, hung with bright chintz, looked out on a large garden. Madame Alessandri, whose only shortcoming was that she liked to talk about her intimate acquaintanceship with eminent physicians, showed her the utmost attention. Her associates, nearly all provincial young ladies, were exceedingly bored, as they had nobody to come to see them. Rosanette saw that they regarded her with envy, and told this to Frederick with pride. It was desirable to speak low, nevertheless. The partitions were thin, and everyone stood listening at hiding-places, in spite of the constant thrumming of the pianos.\n\nAt last, he was about to take his departure for Nogent, when he got a letter from Deslauriers. Two fresh candidates had offered themselves, the one a Conservative, the other a Red; a third, whatever he might be, would have no chance. It was all Frederick's fault; he had let the lucky moment pass by; he should have come sooner and stirred himself.\n\n\"You have not even been seen at the agricultural assembly!\" The advocate blamed him for not having any newspaper connection.\n\n\"Ah! if you had followed my advice long ago! If we had only a public print of our own!\"\n\nHe laid special stress on this point. However, many persons who would have voted for him out of consideration for M. Dambreuse, abandoned him now. Deslauriers was one of the number. Not having anything more to expect from the capitalist, he had thrown over his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nFrederick took the letter to show it to Madame Dambreuse.\n\n\"You have not been to Nogent, then?\" said she.\n\n\"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Because I saw Deslauriers three days ago.\"\n\nHaving learned that her husband was dead, the advocate had come to make a report about the coal-mines, and to offer his services to her as a man of business. This seemed strange to Frederick; and what was his friend doing down there?\n\nMadame Dambreuse wanted to know how he had spent his time since they had parted.\n\n\"I have been ill,\" he replied.\n\n\"You ought at least to have told me about it.\"\n\n\"Oh! it wasn't worth while;\" besides, he had to settle a heap of things, to keep appointments and to pay visits.\n\nFrom that time forth he led a double life, sleeping religiously at the Mar\u00e9chale's abode and passing the afternoon with Madame Dambreuse, so that there was scarcely a single hour of freedom left to him in the middle of the day.\n\nThe infant was in the country at Andilly. They went to see it once a week.\n\nThe wet-nurse's house was on rising ground in the village, at the end of a little yard as dark as a pit, with straw on the ground, hens here and there, and a vegetable-cart under the shed.\n\nRosanette would begin by frantically kissing her baby, and, seized with a kind of delirium, would keep moving to and fro, trying to milk the she-goat, eating big pieces of bread, and inhaling the odour of manure; she even wanted to put a little of it into her handkerchief.\n\nThen they took long walks, in the course of which she went into the nurseries, tore off branches from the lilac-trees which hung down over the walls, and exclaimed, \"Gee ho, donkey!\" to the asses that were drawing cars along, and stopped to gaze through the gate into the interior of one of the lovely gardens; or else the wet-nurse would take the child and place it under the shade of a walnut-tree; and for hours the two women would keep talking the most tiresome nonsense.\n\nFrederick, not far away from them, gazed at the beds of vines on the slopes, with here and there a clump of trees; at the dusty paths resembling strips of grey ribbon; at the houses, which showed white and red spots in the midst of the greenery; and sometimes the smoke of a locomotive stretched out horizontally to the bases of the hills, covered with foliage, like a gigantic ostrich's feather, the thin end of which was disappearing from view.\n\nThen his eyes once more rested on his son. He imagined the child grown into a young man; he would make a companion of him; but perhaps he would be a blockhead, a wretched creature, in any event. He was always oppressed by the illegality of the infant's birth; it would have been better if he had never been born! And Frederick would murmur, \"Poor child!\" his heart swelling with feelings of unutterable sadness.\n\nThey often missed the last train. Then Madame Dambreuse would scold him for his want of punctuality. He would invent some falsehood.\n\nIt was necessary to invent some explanations, too, to satisfy Rosanette. She could not understand how he spent all his evenings; and when she sent a messenger to his house, he was never there! One day, when he chanced to be at home, the two women made their appearance almost at the same time. He got the Mar\u00e9chale to go away, and concealed Madame Dambreuse, pretending that his mother was coming up to Paris.\n\nEre long, he found these lies amusing. He would repeat to one the oath which he had just uttered to the other, send them bouquets of the same sort, write to them at the same time, and then would institute a comparison between them. There was a third always present in his thoughts. The impossibility of possessing her seemed to him a justification of his perfidies, which were intensified by the fact that he had to practise them alternately; and the more he deceived, no matter which of the two, the fonder of him she grew, as if the love of one of them added heat to that of the other, and, as if by a sort of emulation, each of them were seeking to make him forget the other.\n\n\"Admire my confidence in you!\" said Madame Dambreuse one day to him, opening a sheet of paper, in which she was informed that M. Moreau and a certain Rose Bron were living together as husband and wife.\n\n\"Can it be that this is the lady of the races?\"\n\n\"What an absurdity!\" he returned. \"Let me have a look at it!\"\n\nThe letter, written in Roman characters, had no signature. Madame Dambreuse, in the beginning, had tolerated this mistress, who furnished a cloak for their adultery. But, as her passion became stronger, she had insisted on a rupture\u2014a thing which had been effected long since, according to Frederick's account; and when he had ceased to protest, she replied, half closing her eyes, in which shone a look like the point of a stiletto under a muslin robe:\n\n\"Well\u2014and the other?\"\n\n\"What other?\"\n\n\"The earthenware-dealer's wife!\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders disdainfully. She did not press the matter.\n\nBut, a month later, while they were talking about honour and loyalty, and he was boasting about his own (in a casual sort of way, for the sake of precaution), she said to him:\n\n\"It is true\u2014you are acting uprightly\u2014you don't go back there any more?\"\n\nFrederick, who was at the moment thinking of the Mar\u00e9chale, stammered:\n\n\"Where, pray?\"\n\n\"To Madame Arnoux's.\"\n\nHe implored her to tell him from whom she got the information. It was through her second dressmaker, Madame Regimbart.\n\nSo, she knew all about his life, and he knew nothing about hers!\n\nIn the meantime, he had found in her dressing-room the miniature of a gentleman with long moustaches\u2014was this the same person about whose suicide a vague story had been told him at one time? But there was no way of learning any more about it! However, what was the use of it? The hearts of women are like little pieces of furniture wherein things are secreted, full of drawers fitted into each other; one hurts himself, breaks his nails in opening them, and then finds within only some withered flower, a few grains of dust\u2014or emptiness! And then perhaps he felt afraid of learning too much about the matter.\n\nShe made him refuse invitations where she was unable to accompany him, stuck to his side, was afraid of losing him; and, in spite of this union which was every day becoming stronger, all of a sudden, abysses disclosed themselves between the pair about the most trifling questions\u2014an estimate of an individual or a work of art.\n\nShe had a style of playing on the piano which was correct and hard. Her spiritualism (Madame Dambreuse believed in the transmigration of souls into the stars) did not prevent her from taking the utmost care of her cash-box. She was haughty towards her servants; her eyes remained dry at the sight of the rags of the poor. In the expressions of which she habitually made use a candid egoism manifested itself: \"What concern is that of mine? I should be very silly! What need have I?\" and a thousand little acts incapable of analysis revealed hateful qualities in her. She would have listened behind doors; she could not help lying to her confessor. Through a spirit of despotism, she insisted on Frederick going to the church with her on Sunday. He obeyed, and carried her prayer-book.\n\nThe loss of the property she had expected to inherit had changed her considerably. These marks of grief, which people attributed to the death of M. Dambreuse, rendered her interesting, and, as in former times, she had a great number of visitors. Since Frederick's defeat at the election, she was ambitious of obtaining for both of them an embassy in Germany; therefore, the first thing they should do was to submit to the reigning ideas.\n\nSome persons were in favour of the Empire, others of the Orl\u00e9ans family, and others of the Comte de Chambord; but they were all of one opinion as to the urgency of decentralisation, and several expedients were proposed with that view, such as to cut up Paris into many large streets in order to establish villages there, to transfer the seat of government to Versailles, to have the schools set up at Bourges, to suppress the libraries, and to entrust everything to the generals of division; and they glorified a rustic existence on the assumption that the uneducated man had naturally more sense than other men! Hatreds increased\u2014hatred of primary teachers and wine-merchants, of the classes of philosophy, of the courses of lectures on history, of novels, red waistcoats, long beards, of independence in any shape, or any manifestation of individuality, for it was necessary \"to restore the principle of authority\"\u2014let it be exercised in the name of no matter whom; let it come from no matter where, as long as it was Force, Authority! The Conservatives now talked in the very same way as S\u00e9n\u00e9cal. Frederick was no longer able to understand their drift, and once more he found at the house of his former mistress the same remarks uttered by the same men.\n\nThe salons of the unmarried women (it was from this period that their importance dates) were a sort of neutral ground where reactionaries of different kinds met. Hussonnet, who gave himself up to the depreciation of contemporary glories (a good thing for the restoration of Order), inspired Rosanette with a longing to have evening parties like any other. He undertook to publish accounts of them, and first of all he brought a man of grave deportment, Fumichon; then came Nonancourt, M. de Gr\u00e9monville, the Sieur de Larsilloix, ex-prefect, and Cisy, who was now an agriculturist in Lower Brittany, and more Christian than ever.\n\nIn addition, men who had at one time been the Mar\u00e9chale's lovers, such as the Baron de Comaing, the Comte de Jumillac, and others, presented themselves; and Frederick was annoyed by their free-and-easy behaviour.\n\nIn order that he might assume the attitude of master in the house, he increased the rate of expenditure there. Then he went in for keeping a groom, took a new habitation, and got a fresh supply of furniture. These displays of extravagance were useful for the purpose of making his alliance appear less out of proportion with his pecuniary position. The result was that his means were soon terribly reduced\u2014and Rosanette was entirely ignorant of the fact!\n\nOne of the lower middle-class, who had lost caste, she adored a domestic life, a quiet little home. However, it gave her pleasure to have \"an at home day.\" In referring to persons of her own class, she called them \"Those women!\" She wished to be a society lady, and believed herself to be one. She begged of him not to smoke in the drawing-room any more, and for the sake of good form tried to make herself look thin.\n\nShe played her part badly, after all; for she grew serious, and even before going to bed always exhibited a little melancholy, just as there are cypress trees at the door of a tavern.\n\nHe found out the cause of it; she was dreaming of marriage\u2014she, too! Frederick was exasperated at this. Besides, he recalled to mind her appearance at Madame Arnoux's house, and then he cherished a certain spite against her for having held out against him so long.\n\nHe made enquiries none the less as to who her lovers had been. She denied having had any relations with any of the persons he mentioned. A sort of jealous feeling took possession of him. He irritated her by asking questions about presents that had been made to her, and were still being made to her; and in proportion to the exciting effect which the lower portion of her nature produced upon him, he was drawn towards her by momentary illusions which ended in hate.\n\nHer words, her voice, her smile, all had an unpleasant effect on him, and especially her glances with that woman's eye forever limpid and foolish. Sometimes he felt so tired of her that he would have seen her die without being moved at it. But how could he get into a passion with her? She was so mild that there was no hope of picking a quarrel with her.\n\nDeslauriers reappeared, and explained his sojourn at Nogent by saying that he was making arrangements to buy a lawyer's office. Frederick was glad to see him again. It was somebody! and as a third person in the house, he helped to break the monotony.\n\nThe advocate dined with them from time to time, and whenever any little disputes arose, always took Rosanette's part, so that Frederick, on one occasion, said to him:\n\n\"Ah! you can have with her, if it amuses you!\" so much did he long for some chance of getting rid of her.\n\nAbout the middle of the month of June, she was served with an order made by the law courts by which Ma\u00eetre Athanase Gautherot, sheriff's officer, called on her to pay him four thousand francs due to Mademoiselle Clemence Vatnaz; if not, he would come to make a seizure on her.\n\nIn fact, of the four bills which she had at various times signed, only one had been paid; the money which she happened to get since then having been spent on other things that she required.\n\nShe rushed off at once to see Arnoux. He lived now in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and the porter was unable to tell her the name of the street. She made her way next to the houses of several friends of hers, could not find one of them at home, and came back in a state of utter despair.\n\nShe did not wish to tell Frederick anything about it, fearing lest this new occurrence might prejudice the chance of a marriage between them.\n\nOn the following morning, M. Athanase Gautherot presented himself with two assistants close behind him, one of them sallow with a mean-looking face and an expression of devouring envy in his glance, the other wearing a collar and straps drawn very tightly, with a sort of thimble of black taffeta on his index-finger\u2014and both ignobly dirty, with greasy necks, and the sleeves of their coats too short.\n\nTheir employer, a very good-looking man, on the contrary, began by apologising for the disagreeable duty he had to perform, while at the same time he threw a look round the room, \"full of pretty things, upon my word of honour!\" He added, \"Not to speak of the things that can't be seized.\" At a gesture the two bailiff's men disappeared.\n\nThen he became twice as polite as before. Could anyone believe that a lady so charming would not have a genuine friend! A sale of her goods under an order of the courts would be a real misfortune. One never gets over a thing like that. He tried to excite her fears; then, seeing that she was very much agitated, suddenly assumed a paternal tone. He knew the world. He had been brought into business relations with all these ladies\u2014and as he mentioned their names, he examined the frames of the pictures on the walls. They were old pictures of the worthy Arnoux, sketches by Sombary, water-colours by Burieu, and three landscapes by Dittmer. It was evident that Rosanette was ignorant of their value, Ma\u00eetre Gautherot turned round to her:\n\n\"Look here! to show that I am a decent fellow, do one thing: give me up those Dittmers here\u2014and I am ready to pay all. Do you agree?\"\n\nAt that moment Frederick, who had been informed about the matter by Delphine in the anteroom, and who had just seen the two assistants, came in with his hat on his head, in a rude fashion. Ma\u00eetre Gautherot resumed his dignity; and, as the door had been left open:\n\n\"Come on, gentlemen\u2014write down! In the second room, let us say\u2014an oak table with its two leaves, two sideboards\u2014\u2014\"\n\nFrederick here stopped him, asking whether there was not some way of preventing the seizure.\n\n\"Oh! certainly! Who paid for the furniture?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Well, draw up a claim\u2014you have still time to do it.\"\n\nMa\u00eetre Gautherot did not take long in writing out his official report, wherein he directed that Mademoiselle Bron should attend at an enquiry in chambers with reference to the ownership of the furniture, and having done this he withdrew.\n\nFrederick uttered no reproach. He gazed at the traces of mud left on the floor by the bailiff's shoes, and, speaking to himself:\n\n\"It will soon be necessary to look about for money!\"\n\n\"Ah! my God, how stupid I am!\" said the Mar\u00e9chale.\n\nShe ransacked a drawer, took out a letter, and made her way rapidly to the Languedoc Gas Lighting Company, in order to get the transfer of her shares.\n\nShe came back an hour later. The interest in the shares had been sold to another. The clerk had said, in answer to her demand, while examining the sheet of paper containing Arnoux's written promise to her: \"This document in no way constitutes you the proprietor of the shares. The company has no cognisance of the matter.\" In short, he sent her away unceremoniously, while she choked with rage; and Frederick would have to go to Arnoux's house at once to have the matter cleared up.\n\nBut Arnoux would perhaps imagine that he had come to recover in an indirect fashion the fifteen thousand francs due on the mortgage which he had lost; and then this claim from a man who had been his mistress's lover seemed to him a piece of baseness.\n\nSelecting a middle course, he went to the Dambreuse mansion to get Madame Regimbart's address,  sent a messenger to her residence, and in this way ascertained the name of the caf\u00e9 which the Citizen now haunted.\n\nIt was the little caf\u00e9 on the Place de la Bastille, in which he sat all day in the corner to the right at the lower end of the establishment, never moving any more than if he were a portion of the building.\n\nAfter having gone successively through the half-cup of coffee, the glass of grog, the \"bishop,\" the glass of mulled wine, and even the red wine and water, he fell back on beer, and every half hour he let fall this word, \"Bock!\" having reduced his language to what was actually indispensable. Frederick asked him if he saw Arnoux occasionally.\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Look here\u2014why?\"\n\n\"An imbecile!\"\n\nPolitics, perhaps, kept them apart, and so Frederick thought it a judicious thing to enquire about Compain.\n\n\"What a brute!\" said Regimbart.\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"His calf's head!\"\n\n\"Ha! explain to me what the calf's head is!\"\n\nRegimbart's face wore a contemptuous smile.\n\n\"Some tomfoolery!\"\n\nAfter a long interval of silence, Frederick went on to ask:\n\n\"So, then, he has changed his address?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Arnoux!\"\n\n\"Yes\u2014Rue de Fleurus!\"\n\n\"What number?\"\n\n\"Do I associate with the Jesuits?\"\n\n\"What, Jesuits!\"\n\nThe Citizen replied angrily:\n\n\"With the money of a patriot whom I introduced to him, this pig has set up as a dealer in beads!\"\n\n\"It isn't possible!\"\n\n\"Go there, and see for yourself!\"\n\nIt was perfectly true; Arnoux, enfeebled by a fit of sickness, had turned religious; besides, he had always had a stock of religion in his composition, and (with that mixture of commercialism and ingenuity which was natural to him), in order to gain salvation and fortune both together, he had begun to traffick in religious objects.\n\nFrederick had no difficulty in discovering his establishment, on whose signboard appeared these words: \"Emporium of Gothic Art\u2014Restoration of articles used in ecclesiastical ceremonies\u2014Church ornaments\u2014Polychromatic sculpture\u2014Frankincense of the Magi, Kings, &c., &c.\"\n\nAt the two corners of the shop-window rose two wooden statues, streaked with gold, cinnabar, and azure, a Saint John the Baptist with his sheepskin, and a Saint Genevieve with roses in her apron and a distaff under her arm; next, groups in plaster, a good sister teaching a little girl, a mother on her knees beside a little bed, and three collegians before the holy table. The prettiest object there was a kind of ch\u00e2let representing the interior of a crib with the ass, the ox, and the child Jesus stretched on straw\u2014real straw. From the top to the bottom of the shelves could be seen medals by the dozen, every sort of beads, holy-water basins in the form of shells, and portraits of ecclesiastical dignitaries, amongst whom Monsignor Affre and our Holy Father shone forth with smiles on their faces.\n\nArnoux sat asleep at his counter with his head down. He had aged terribly. He had even round his temples a wreath of rosebuds, and the reflection of the gold crosses touched by the rays of the sun fell over him.\n\nFrederick was filled with sadness at this spectacle of decay. Through devotion to the Mar\u00e9chale he, however, submitted to the ordeal, and stepped forward. At the end of the shop Madame Arnoux showed herself; thereupon, he turned on his heel.\n\n\"I couldn't see him,\" he said, when he came back to Rosanette.\n\nAnd in vain he went on to promise that he would write at once to his notary at Havre for some money\u2014she flew into a rage. She had never seen a man so weak, so flabby. While she was enduring a thousand privations, other people were enjoying themselves.\n\nFrederick was thinking about poor Madame Arnoux, and picturing to himself the heart-rending impoverishment of her surroundings. He had seated himself before the writing-desk; and, as Rosanette's voice still kept up its bitter railing:\n\n\"Ah! in the name of Heaven, hold your tongue!\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are going to defend them?\"\n\n\"Well, yes!\" he exclaimed; \"for what's the cause of this display of fury?\"\n\n\"But why is it that you don't want to make them pay up? 'Tis for fear of vexing your old flame\u2014confess it!\"\n\nHe felt an inclination to smash her head with the timepiece. Words failed him. He relapsed into silence.\n\nRosanette, as she walked up and down the room, continued:\n\n\"I am going to hurl a writ at this Arnoux of yours. Oh! I don't want your assistance. I'll get legal advice.\"\n\nThree days later, Delphine rushed abruptly into the room where her mistress sat.\n\n\"Madame! madame! there's a man here with a pot of paste who has given me a fright!\"\n\nRosanette made her way down to the kitchen, and saw there a vagabond whose face was pitted with smallpox. Moreover, one of his arms was paralysed, and he was three fourths drunk, and hiccoughed every time he attempted to speak.\n\nThis was Ma\u00eetre Gautherot's bill-sticker. The objections raised against the seizure having been overruled, the sale followed as a matter of course.\n\nFor his trouble in getting up the stairs he demanded, in the first place, a half-glass of brandy; then he wanted another favour, namely, tickets for the theatre, on the assumption that the lady of the house was an actress. After this he indulged for some minutes in winks, whose import was perfectly incomprehensible. Finally, he declared that for forty sous he would tear off the corners of the poster which he had already affixed to the door below stairs. Rosanette found herself referred to by name in it\u2014a piece of exceptional harshness which showed the spite of the Vatnaz.\n\nShe had at one time exhibited sensibility, and had even, while suffering from the effects of a heartache, written to B\u00e9ranger for his advice. But under the ravages of life's storms, her spirit had become soured, for she had been forced, in turn, to give lessons on the piano, to act as manageress of a table d'h\u00f4te, to assist others in writing for the fashion journals, to sublet apartments, and to traffic in lace in the world of light women, her relations with whom enabled her to make herself useful to many persons, and amongst others to Arnoux. She had formerly been employed in a commercial establishment.\n\nThere it was one of her functions to pay the workwomen; and for each of them there were two livres, one of which always remained in her hands. Dussardier, who, through kindness, kept the amount payable to a girl named Hortense Baslin, presented himself one day at the cash-office at the moment when Mademoiselle Vatnaz was presenting this girl's account, 1,682 francs, which the cashier paid her. Now, on the very day before this, Dussardier had entered down the sum as 1,082 in the girl Baslin's book. He asked to have it given back to him on some pretext; then, anxious to bury out of sight the story of this theft, he stated that he had lost it. The workwoman ingenuously repeated this falsehood to Mademoiselle Vatnaz, and the latter, in order to satisfy her mind about the matter, came with a show of indifference to talk to the shopman on the subject. He contented himself with the answer: \"I have burned it!\"\u2014that was all. A little while afterwards she quitted the house, without believing that the book had been really destroyed, and filled with the idea that Dussardier had preserved it.\n\nOn hearing that he had been wounded, she rushed to his abode, with the object of getting it back. Then, having discovered nothing, in spite of the closest searches, she was seized with respect, and presently with love, for this youth, so loyal, so gentle, so heroic and so strong! At her age such good fortune in an affair of the heart was a thing that one would not expect. She threw herself into it with the appetite of an ogress; and she had given up literature,  Socialism, \"the consoling doctrines and the generous Utopias,\" the course of lectures which she had projected on the \"Desubalternization of Woman\"\u2014everything, even Delmar himself; finally she offered to unite herself to Dussardier in marriage.\n\nAlthough she was his mistress, he was not at all in love with her. Besides, he had not forgotten her theft. Then she was too wealthy for him. He refused her offer. Thereupon, with tears in her eyes, she told him about what she had dreamed\u2014it was to have for both of them a confectioner's shop. She possessed the capital that was required beforehand for the purpose, and next week this would be increased to the extent of four thousand francs. By way of explanation, she referred to the proceedings she had taken against the Mar\u00e9chale.\n\nDussardier was annoyed at this on account of his friend. He recalled to mind the cigar-holder that had been presented to him at the guard-house, the evenings spent in the Quai Napol\u00e9on, the many pleasant chats, the books lent to him, the thousand acts of kindness which Frederick had done in his behalf. He begged of the Vatnaz to abandon the proceedings.\n\nShe rallied him on his good nature, while exhibiting an antipathy against Rosanette which he could not understand. She longed only for wealth, in fact, in order to crush her, by-and-by, with her four-wheeled carriage.\n\nDussardier was terrified by these black abysses of hate, and when he had ascertained what was the exact day fixed for the sale, he hurried out. On the following morning he made his appearance at Frederick's house with an embarrassed countenance.\n\n\"I owe you an apology.\"\n\n\"For what, pray?\"\n\n\"You must take me for an ingrate, I, whom she is the\u2014\u2014\" He faltered.\n\n\"Oh! I'll see no more of her. I am not going to be her accomplice!\" And as the other was gazing at him in astonishment:\n\n\"Isn't your mistress's furniture to be sold in three days' time?\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\"\n\n\"Herself\u2014the Vatnaz! But I am afraid of giving you offence\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Impossible, my dear friend!\"\n\n\"Ah! that is true\u2014you are so good!\"\n\nAnd he held out to him, in a cautious fashion, a hand in which he clasped a little pocket-book made of sheep-leather.\n\nIt contained four thousand francs\u2014all his savings.\n\n\"What! Oh! no! no!\u2014--\"\n\n\"I knew well I would wound your feelings,\" returned Dussardier, with a tear in the corner of his eye.\n\nFrederick pressed his hand, and the honest fellow went on in a piteous tone:\n\n\"Take the money! Give me that much pleasure! I am in such a state of despair. Can it be, furthermore, that all is over? I thought we should be happy when the Revolution had come. Do you remember what a beautiful thing it was? how freely we breathed! But here we are flung back into a worse condition of things than ever.\n\n\"Now, they are killing our Republic, just as they killed the other one\u2014the Roman! ay, and poor Venice! poor Poland! poor Hungary! What abominable deeds! First of all, they knocked down the trees of Liberty, then they restricted the right to vote, shut up the clubs, re-established the censorship and surrendered to the priests the power of teaching, so that we might look out for the Inquisition. Why not? The Conservatives want to give us a taste of the stick. The newspapers are fined merely for pronouncing an opinion in favour of abolishing the death-penalty. Paris is overflowing with bayonets; sixteen departments are in a state of siege; and then the demand for amnesty is again rejected!\"\n\nHe placed both hands on his forehead, then, spreading out his arms as if his mind were in a distracted state:\n\n\"If, however, we only made the effort! if we were only sincere, we might understand each other. But no! The workmen are no better than the capitalists, you see! At Elb\u0153uf recently they refused to help at a fire! There are wretches who profess to regard Barb\u00e8s as an aristocrat! In order to make the people ridiculous, they want to get nominated for the presidency Nadaud, a mason\u2014just imagine! And there is no way out of it\u2014no remedy! Everybody is against us! For my part, I have never done any harm; and yet this is like a weight pressing down on my stomach. If this state of things continues, I'll go mad. I have a mind to do away with myself. I tell you I want no money for myself! You'll pay it back to me, deuce take it! I am lending it to you.\"\n\nFrederick, who felt himself constrained by necessity, ended by taking the four thousand francs from him. And so they had no more disquietude so far as the Vatnaz was concerned.\n\nBut it was not long ere Rosanette was defeated in her action against Arnoux; and through sheer obstinacy she wished to appeal.\n\nDeslauriers exhausted his energies in trying to make her understand that Arnoux's promise constituted neither a gift nor a regular transfer. She did not even pay the slightest attention to him, her notion being that the law was unjust\u2014it was because she was a woman; men backed up each other amongst themselves. In the end, however, she followed his advice.\n\nHe made himself so much at home in the house, that on several occasions he brought S\u00e9n\u00e9cal to dine there. Frederick, who had advanced him money, and even got his own tailor to supply him with clothes, did not like this unceremoniousness; and the advocate gave his old clothes to the Socialist, whose means of existence were now of an exceedingly uncertain character.\n\nHe was, however, anxious to be of service to Rosanette. One day, when she showed him a dozen shares in the Kaolin Company (that enterprise which led to Arnoux being cast in damages to the extent of thirty thousand francs), he said to her:\n\n\"But this is a shady transaction, and you have now a grand chance!\"\n\nShe had the right to call on him to pay her debts. In the first place, she could prove that he was jointly bound to pay all the company's liabilities, since he had certified personal debts as collective debts\u2014in short, he had embezzled sums which were payable only to the company.\n\n\"All this renders him guilty of fraudulent bankruptcy under articles 586 and 587 of the Commercial Code, and you may be sure, my pet, we'll send him packing.\"\n\nRosanette threw herself on his neck. He entrusted her case next day to his former master, not having  time to devote attention to it himself, as he had business at Nogent. In case of any urgency, S\u00e9n\u00e9cal could write to him.\n\nHis negotiations for the purchase of an office were a mere pretext. He spent his time at M. Roque's house, where he had begun not only by sounding the praises of their friend, but by imitating his manners and language as much as possible; and in this way he had gained Louise's confidence, while he won over that of her father by making an attack on Ledru-Rollin.\n\nIf Frederick did not return, it was because he mingled in aristocratic society, and gradually Deslauriers gave them to understand that he was in love with somebody, that he had a child, and that he was keeping a fallen creature.\n\nThe despair of Louise was intense. The indignation of Madame Moreau was not less strong. She saw her son whirling towards the bottom of a gulf the depth of which could not be determined, was wounded in her religious ideas as to propriety, and as it were, experienced a sense of personal dishonour; then all of a sudden her physiognomy underwent a change. To the questions which people put to her with regard to Frederick, she replied in a sly fashion:\n\n\"He is well, quite well.\"'\n\nShe was aware that he was about to be married to Madame Dambreuse.\n\nThe date of the event had been fixed, and he was even trying to think of some way of making Rosanette swallow the thing.\n\nAbout the middle of autumn she won her action with reference to the kaolin shares. Frederick was informed about it by S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, whom he met at his own door, on his way back from the courts.\n\nIt had been held that M. Arnoux was privy to all the frauds, and the ex-tutor had such an air of making merry over it that Frederick prevented him from coming further, assuring S\u00e9n\u00e9cal that he would convey the intelligence to Rosanette. He presented himself before her with a look of irritation on his face.\n\n\"Well, now you are satisfied!\"\n\nBut, without minding what he had said:\n\n\"Look here!\"\n\nAnd she pointed towards her child, which was lying in a cradle close to the fire. She had found it so sick at the house of the wet-nurse that morning that she had brought it back with her to Paris.\n\nAll the infant's limbs were exceedingly thin, and the lips were covered with white specks, which in the interior of the mouth became, so to speak, clots of blood-stained milk.\n\n\"What did the doctor say?\"\n\n\"Oh! the doctor! He pretends that the journey has increased his\u2014I don't know what it is, some name in 'ite'\u2014in short, that he has the thrush.[L] Do you know what that is?\"\n\nFrederick replied without hesitation: \"Certainly,\" adding that it was nothing.\n\nBut in the evening he was alarmed by the child's debilitated look and by the progress of these whitish spots, resembling mould, as if life, already abandoning this little frame, had left now nothing but matter from which vegetation was sprouting. His hands were cold; he was no longer able to drink anything; and the nurse, another woman, whom the porter had  gone and taken on chance at an office, kept repeating:\n\n\"It seems to me he's very low, very low!\"\n\nRosanette was up all night with the child.\n\nIn the morning she went to look for Frederick.\n\n\"Just come and look at him. He doesn't move any longer.\"\n\nIn fact, he was dead. She took him up, shook him, clasped him in her arms, calling him most tender names, covered him with kisses, broke into sobs, turned herself from one side to the other in a state of distraction, tore her hair, uttered a number of shrieks, and then let herself sink on the edge of the divan, where she lay with her mouth open and a flood of tears rushing from her wildly-glaring eyes.\n\nThen a torpor fell upon her, and all became still in the apartment. The furniture was overturned. Two or three napkins were lying on the floor. It struck six. The night-light had gone out.\n\nFrederick, as he gazed at the scene, could almost believe that he was dreaming. His heart was oppressed with anguish. It seemed to him that this death was only a beginning, and that behind it was a worse calamity, which was just about to come on.\n\nSuddenly, Rosanette said in an appealing tone:\n\n\"We'll preserve the body\u2014shall we not?\"\n\nShe wished to have the dead child embalmed. There were many objections to this. The principal one, in Frederick's opinion, was that the thing was impracticable in the case of children so young. A portrait would be better. She adopted this idea. He wrote a line to Pellerin, and Delphine hastened to deliver it.\n\nPellerin arrived speedily, anxious by this display of zeal to efface all recollection of his former conduct. The first thing he said was:\n\n\"Poor little angel! Ah, my God, what a misfortune!\"\n\nBut gradually (the artist in him getting the upper hand) he declared that nothing could be made out of those yellowish eyes, that livid face, that it was a real case of still-life, and would, therefore, require very great talent to treat it effectively; and so he murmured:\n\n\"Oh, 'tisn't easy\u2014'tisn't easy!\"\n\n\"No matter, as long as it is life-like,\" urged Rosanette.\n\n\"Pooh! what do I care about a thing being life-like? Down with Realism! 'Tis the spirit that must be portrayed by the painter! Let me alone! I am going to try to conjure up what it ought to be!\"\n\nHe reflected, with his left hand clasping his brow, and with his right hand clutching his elbow; then, all of a sudden:\n\n\"Ha, I have an idea! a pastel! With coloured mezzotints, almost spread out flat, a lovely model could be obtained with the outer surface alone!\"\n\nHe sent the chambermaid to look for his box of colours; then, having a chair under his feet and another by his side, he began to throw out great touches with as much complacency as if he had drawn them in accordance with the bust. He praised the little Saint John of Correggio, the Infanta Rosa of Velasquez, the milk-white flesh-tints of Reynolds, the distinction of Lawrence, and especially the child with long hair that sits in Lady Gower's lap.\n\n\"Besides, could you find anything more charming than these little toads? The type of the sublime (Raphael has proved it by his Madonnas) is probably a mother with her child?\"\n\nRosanette, who felt herself stifling, went away; and presently Pellerin said:\n\n\"Well, about Arnoux; you know what has happened?\"\n\n\"No! What?\"\n\n\"However, it was bound to end that way!\"\n\n\"What has happened, might I ask?\"\n\n\"Perhaps by this time he is\u2014\u2014Excuse me!\"\n\nThe artist got up in order to raise the head of the little corpse higher.\n\n\"You were saying\u2014\u2014\" Frederick resumed.\n\nAnd Pellerin, half-closing his eyes, in order to take his dimensions better:\n\n\"I was saying that our friend Arnoux is perhaps by this time locked up!\"\n\nThen, in a tone of satisfaction:\n\n\"Just give a little glance at it. Is that the thing?\"\n\n\"Yes, 'tis quite right. But about Arnoux?\"\n\nPellerin laid down his pencil.\n\n\"As far as I could understand, he was sued by one Mignot, an intimate friend of Regimbart\u2014a long-headed fellow that, eh? What an idiot! Just imagine! one day\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"What! it's not Regimbart that's in question, is it?\"\n\n\"It is, indeed! Well, yesterday evening, Arnoux had to produce twelve thousand francs; if not, he was a ruined man.\"\n\n\"Oh! this perhaps is exaggerated,\" said Frederick.\n\n\"Not a bit. It looked to me a very serious business, very serious!\"\n\nAt that moment Rosanette reappeared, with red spots under her eyes, which glowed like dabs of paint. She sat down near the drawing and gazed at it. Pellerin made a sign to the other to hold his tongue on account of her. But Frederick, without minding her:\n\n\"Nevertheless, I can't believe\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"I tell you I met him yesterday,\" said the artist, \"at seven o'clock in the evening, in the Rue Jacob. He had even taken the precaution to have his passport with him; and he spoke about embarking from Havre, he and his whole camp.\"\n\n\"What! with his wife?\"\n\n\"No doubt. He is too much of a family man to live by himself.\"\n\n\"And are you sure of this?\"\n\n\"Certain, faith! Where do you expect him to find twelve thousand francs?\"\n\nFrederick took two or three turns round the room. He panted for breath, bit his lips, and then snatched up his hat.\n\n\"Where are you going now?\" said Rosanette.\n\nHe made no reply, and the next moment he had disappeared.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[I] A marriage may take place in France under the r\u00e9gime de communaut\u00e9, by which the husband has the enjoyment and the right of disposing of the property both of himself and his wife; the r\u00e9gime dotal, by which he can only dispose of the income; and the r\u00e9gime de s\u00e9paration de biens, by which husband and wife enjoy and exercise control over their respective estates separately.\u2014Translator.\n\n[J] A metre is about 3\u00bc feet\u2014Translator..\n\n[K] The reader will excuse this barbarism on account of its convenience.

Hurting my mother\nwas a mistake and I hate myself for\nit, and I hate my illness and I\nwant to control it. My father, on\nthe other hand, had no trouble\nslapping the shit out of me last\nnight, which I did not return\n`cause I could've killed him and I\ndidn't. He's sixty-five years old.\nYou don't think I could've beat the\nshit out of him? I mean....\n\nDR. PATEL\nHe was scared for your mother and\nyou hurt him as well.\n\nPAT\nYes, last night was a mess. Okay?\nAnd I think he probably just tried\nto do his best.\n\nDR. PATEL\nPat, you have to have a strategy. I\ntold you earlier. You need to\nrecognize these feelings coming to\nyou, otherwise you will be sent\nback to Baltimore. So when you get\nthese feelings, you need to get to\na quieter place, and be at peace\nwith yourself, however you can.\n\nPAT\nYeah, but that's easier said than\ndone.\n\nDR.

PATEL\nWhy did you have this overwhelming\nurgency to see your wedding video\nlast night?\n\nPAT\nOh, I don't know, because I'm\nmarried and I haven't seen my wife\nin eight and a half months?\n\nDR. PATEL\nMaybe you think that Nikki's not\naround and Tiffany's an attractive\ngirl and if you get drawn towards\nTiffany, you will spoil your\nchances of getting Nikki back to\nyou?\n\nPAT\nNot bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't\nthink I'm gonna blow it with Nikki\nbecause Tiffany's a slut.\n\nDR. PATEL\nWhy is she a slut?\n\nPAT\nAfter the dinner at Ronnie's, she\nsaid, quote, \"We can go to the back\nhouse and you can fuck me as long\nas we turn the lights out.\"\nUnquote. And she still wears her\nwedding ring. So she's a loyal,\nmarried-to-a-dead-guy slut.\n\nDR. PATEL\nMaybe she just needs a friend and\nshe thought if she offers you sex,\nit will be easier for you to become\nfriends with her.\n\nPAT\nShe said she's not a whore anymore,\nbut she likes that part of herself\nalong with all the other parts of\nherself and can I say the same?\n\nDR. PATEL\nCan you?\n\n65.\n\n\n\nPAT\nIs that....? You're asking me,\nyou're really asking me that\nquestion?\n\nDR. PATEL\nYes.\n\nPAT\nWith all my crazy sad shit? What,\nare you fucking nuts?\n\nDR. PATEL\nPat, the silver lining thing is\nyours. I'm just giving back your\nwords to you. This \"crazy sad\nshit,\" as you call it, made you a\nhappier, calmer person with a\nbeautiful positive philosophy of\ngoing outdoors, working out, and\nreading books.\n\nPAT\nNo, not the books.\n\nDR. PATEL\nYou said Nikki's friends with\nRonnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if\nyou become friends with Tiffany,\nNikki will think that you're a\nkind, generous, large-hearted\nperson, who helps people in need,\nwho is basically thriving.

I'm sorry you find them so\nnegative, but I disagree. I think\nthey are great works of art that\nreflect how hard life can be and\nthey can also help kids prepare\nthemselves for the hardness of\nlife. In spite of all these\npositive developments, Pat, I have\nto say if it's me reading the\nsigns, I need to see something to\nprove you are ready to resume our\nmarriage. Otherwise I find myself\nthinking that we might both be\nbetter off moving on with our lives\nseparately. Please don't react\nquickly to this, but take time to\nthink about it.

Cowboys are\ncowards. And I'll bet you're such a\ncoward, you won't take the ten.\nPlus, are you listening, plus\nwhatever their score is at the\ndance thing. (to Tiffany) What's\nthat? Tiffany, what's that?\n\nPAT\nWhat? No, no, no, no.\n\nRANDY\nYou're crazy to give away that many\npoints. That's ridiculous! I won't\ntake that! However, wait a second.\nI do like the idea of a parlay.\n\nDOLORES\nWhat? No parlay! No!\n\nPAT\nNo, don't do it. Don't do it.\n\nRANDY\nPat, how do they run this dance\ncompetition? I mean, how do they\nscore it and everything?\n\nPAT\nI don't know, I don't know how they\nfucking score! We're participating.\nWe're not, we're not a part of it.\nThere are people, this is a high-\nend dance contest. I don't know. Do\nnot put it as part of the parlay,\nRandy. Don't--\n\n130.\n\n\n\nTIFFANY\nThey go by the Philadelphia rules.\nEach dancer is scored on a scale of\none to ten, ten being the highest.\nYou have to average the four\njudges' scores.\n\nRANDY\nOkay, score is from one to ten,\nright? And you guys are how good?\n\nPAT\nWe suck.\n\nTIFFANY\nWe don't suck. Pat's a beginner,\nI'm okay, we're happy just to be\ngoing there.\n\nRANDY\nAnd how are the people you're\ncompeting against?\n\nTIFFANY\nThey're good. Some of them are\nprofessionals.\n\nRANDY\nThey're good? Better than you?\nPause. Tiffany says nothing.\n\nPAT\nA lot better.\n\nRANDY\nA lot better. So if I was to say\nyou only have to score five, I\nwould be really very generous,\nright?\n\nPAT\nNo, no, that would be amazing if we\ngot five.

Coraghessan Boyle", "lyrics": "Carnal Knowledge LyricsCarnal Knowledge\n1994\nAuthorLink: T. Coraghessan Boyle\n\nI\u2019d never really thought much about meat. It was there in the supermarket in a plastic wrapper; it came between slices of bread with mayo and mustard and a dill pickle on the side; it sputtered and smoked on the grill till somebody flipped it over, and then it appeared on the plate, between the baked potato and the julienne carrots, neatly cross-hatched and floating in a puddle of red juice. Beef, mutton, pork, venison, dripping burgers, and greasy ribs \u2014 it was all the same to me, food, the body\u2019s fuel, something to savor a moment on the tongue before the digestive system went to work on it. Which is not to say I was totally unconscious of the deeper implications. Every once in a while I\u2019d eat at home, a quartered chicken, a package of Shake \u2019n Bake, Stove Top stuffing, and frozen peas, and as I hacked away at the stippled yellow skin and pink flesh of the sanitized bird I\u2019d wonder at the darkish bits of organ clinging to the ribs \u2014 what was that, liver? kidney? \u2014 but in the end it didn\u2019t make me any less fond of Kentucky Fried or Chicken McNuggets. I saw those ads in the magazines, too, the ones that showed the veal calves penned up in their own waste, their limbs atrophied and their veins so pumped full of antibiotics they couldn\u2019t control their bowels, but when I took a date to Anna Maria\u2019s, I could never resist the veal scallopini.\n\nAnd then I met Alena Jorgensen.\n\nIt was a year ago, two weeks before Thanksgiving \u2014 I remember the date because it was my birthday, my thirtieth, and I\u2019d called in sick and gone to the beach to warm my face, read a book, and feel a little sorry for myself. The Santa Anas were blowing and it was clear all the way to Catalina, but there was an edge to the air, a scent of winter hanging over Utah, and as far as I could see in either direction I had the beach pretty much to myself. I found a sheltered spot in a tumble of boulders, spread a blanket, and settled down to attack the pastrami on rye I\u2019d brought along for nourishment. Then I turned to my book \u2014 a comfortingly apocalyptic tract about the demise of the planet \u2014 and let the sun warm me as I read about the denuding of the rain forest, the poisoning of the atmosphere, and the swift silent eradication of species. Gulls coasted by overhead. I saw the distant glint of jetliners.\n\nI must have dozed, my head thrown back, the book spread open in my lap, because the next thing I remember, a strange dog was hovering over me and the sun had dipped behind the rocks. The dog was big, wild-haired, with one staring blue eye, and it just looked at me, ears slightly cocked, as if it expected a Milk-Bone or something. I was startled \u2014 not that I don\u2019t like dogs, but here was this woolly thing poking its snout in my face \u2014 and I guess that I must have made some sort of defensive gesture, because the dog staggered back a step and froze. Even in the confusion of the moment I could see that there was something wrong with this dog, an unsteadiness, a gimp, a wobble to its legs. I felt a mixture of pity and revulsion \u2014 had it been hit by a car, was that it? \u2014 when all at once I became aware of a wetness on the breast of my windbreaker, and an unmistakable odor rose to my nostrils: I\u2019d been pissed on.\nPissed on. As I lay there unsuspecting, enjoying the sun, the beach, the solitude, this stupid beast had lifted its leg and used me as a pissoir \u2014 and now it was poised there on the edge of the blanket as if it expected a reward. A sudden rage seized me. I came up off the blanket with a curse, and it was only then that a dim apprehension seemed to seep into the dog\u2019s other eye, the brown one, and it lurched back and fell on its face, just out of reach. And then it lurched and fell again, bobbing and weaving across the sand like a seal out of water. I was on my feet now, murderous, glad to see that the thing was hobbled \u2014 it would simplify the task of running it down and beating it to death.\n\n\u201cAlf!\u201d a voice called, and as the dog floundered in the sand, I turned and saw Alena Jorgensen poised on the boulder behind me. I don\u2019t want to make too much of the moment, don\u2019t want to mythologize it or clutter the scene with allusions to Aphrodite rising from the waves or accepting the golden apple from Paris, but she was a pretty impressive sight. Bare-legged, fluid, as tall and uncompromising as her Nordic ancestors, and dressed in a Gore-Tex bikini and hooded sweatshirt unzipped to the waist, she blew me away, in any event. Piss-spattered and stupefied, I could only gape up at her.\n\n\u201cYou bad boy,\u201d she said, scolding, \u201cyou get out of there.\u201d She glanced from the dog to me and back again. \u201cOh, you bad boy, what have you done?\u201d she demanded, and I was ready to admit to anything, but it was the dog she was addressing, and the dog flopped over in the sand as if it had been shot. Alena skipped lightly down from the rock, and in the next moment, before I could protest, she was rubbing at the stain on my windbreaker with the wadded-up hem of her sweatshirt.\n\nI tried to stop her \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s nothing,\u201d as if dogs routinely pissed on my wardrobe \u2014 but she wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, rubbing, her hair flying in my face, the naked skin of her thigh pressing unconsciously to my own, \u201cno, this is terrible, I\u2019m so embarrassed \u2014 Alf, you bad boy \u2014 I\u2019ll clean it for you, I will, it\u2019s the least \u2014 oh, look at that, it\u2019s stained right through to your T-shirt \u2014 \u201d\n\nI could smell her, the mousse she used in her hair, a lilac soap or perfume, the salt-sweet odor of her sweat \u2014 she\u2019d been jogging, that was it. I murmured something about taking it to the cleaner\u2019s myself.\n\nShe stopped rubbing and straightened up. She was my height, maybe even a fraction taller, and her eyes were ever so slightly mismatched, like the dog\u2019s: a deep earnest blue in the right iris, shading to sea-green and turquoise in the left. We were so close we might have been dancing. \u201cTell you what,\u201d she said, and her face lit with a smile, \u201csince you\u2019re so nice about the whole thing, and most people wouldn\u2019t be, even if they knew what poor Alf has been through, why don\u2019t you let me wash it for you \u2014 and the T-shirt too?\u201d\n\nI was a little disconcerted at this point \u2014 I was the one who\u2019d been pissed on, after all \u2014 but my anger was gone. I felt weightless, adrift, like a piece of fluff floating on the breeze. \u201cListen,\u201d I said, and for the moment I couldn\u2019t look her in the eye, \u201cI don\u2019t want to put you to any trouble\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ten minutes up the beach, and I\u2019ve got a washer and dryer. Come on, it\u2019s no trouble at all. Or do you have plans? I mean, I could just pay for the cleaner\u2019s if you want\u2026\u201d\n\nI was between relationships \u2014 the person I\u2019d been seeing off and on for the past year wouldn\u2019t even return my calls \u2014 and my plans consisted of taking a solitary late-afternoon movie as a birthday treat, then heading over to my mother\u2019s for dinner and the cake with the candles. My Aunt Irene would be there, and so would my grandmother. They would exclaim over how big I was and how handsome and then they would begin to contrast my present self with my previous, more diminutive incarnations, and finally work themselves up to a spate of reminiscence that would continue unabated till my mother drove them home. And then, if I was lucky, I\u2019d go out to a singles bar and make the acquaintance of a divorced computer programmer in her mid-thirties with three kids and bad breath.\n\nI shrugged. \u201cPlans? No, not really. I mean, nothing in particular.\u201d\n\nAlena was housesitting a one-room bungalow that rose stumplike from the sand, no more than fifty feet from the tide line. There were trees in the yard behind it and the place was sandwiched between glass fortresses with crenellated decks, whipping flags, and great hulking concrete pylons. Sitting on the couch inside, you could feel the dull reverberation of each wave hitting the shore, a slow steady pulse that forever defined the place for me. Alena gave me a faded UC Davis sweatshirt that nearly fit, sprayed a stain remover on my T-shirt and windbreaker, and in a single fluid motion flipped down the lid of the washer and extracted two beers from the refrigerator beside it.\n\nThere was an awkward moment as she settled into the chair opposite me and we concentrated on our beers. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was disoriented, giddy, still struggling to grasp what had happened. Fifteen minutes earlier I\u2019d been dozing on the beach, alone on my birthday and feeling sorry for myself, and now I was ensconced in a cozy beach house, in the presence of Alena Jorgensen and her naked spill of leg, drinking a beer. \u201cSo what do you do?\u201d she said, setting her beer down on the coffee table.\nI was grateful for the question, too grateful maybe. I described to her at length how dull my job was, nearly ten years with the same agency, writing ad copy, my brain gone numb with disuse. I was somewhere in the middle of a blow-by-blow account of our current campaign for a Ghanian vodka distilled from calabash husks when she said, \u201cI know what you mean,\u201d and told me she\u2019d dropped out of veterinary school herself. \u201cAfter I saw what they did to the animals. I mean, can you see neutering a dog just for our convenience, just because it\u2019s easier for us if they don\u2019t have a sex life?\u201d Her voice grew hot. \u201cIt\u2019s the same old story, species fascism at its worst.\u201d\n\nAlf was lying at my feet, grunting softly and looking up mournfully out of his staring blue eye, as blameless a creature as ever lived. I made a small noise of agreement and then focused on Alf. \u201cAnd your dog,\u201d I said, \u201che\u2019s arthritic? Or is it hip dysplasia or what?\u201d I was pleased with myself for the question \u2014 aside from \u201ctapeworm,\u201d \u201chip dysplasia\u201d was the only veterinary term I could dredge up from the memory bank, and I could see that Alf\u2019s problems ran deeper than worms\n\nAlena looked angry suddenly. \u201cDon\u2019t I wish,\u201d she said. She paused to draw a bitter breath. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Alf that wasn\u2019t inflicted on him. They tortured him, maimed him, mutilated him.\u201d\n\n\u201cTortured him?\u201d I echoed, feeling the indignation rise in me \u2014 this beautiful girl, this innocent beast. \u201cWho?\u201d\n\nAlena leaned forward and there was real hate in her eyes. She mentioned a prominent shoe company \u2014 spat out the name, actually. It was an ordinary name, a familiar one, and it hung in the air between us, suddenly sinister. Alf had been part of an experiment to market booties for dogs \u2014 suede, cordovan, patent leather, the works. The dogs were made to pace a treadmill in their booties, to assess wear; Alf was part of the control group.\n\n\u201cControl group?\u201d I could feel the hackles rising on the back of my neck.\n\n\u201cThey used eighty-grit sandpaper on the treads, to accelerate the process.\u201d Alena shot a glance out the window to where the surf pounded the shore; she bit her lip. \u201cAlf was one of the dogs without booties.\u201d\n\nI was stunned. I wanted to get up and comfort her, but I might as well have been grafted to the chair. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d I said. \u201cHow could anybody \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve it,\u201d she said. She studied me a moment, then set down her beer and crossed the room to dig through a cardboard box in the corner. If I was moved by the emotion she\u2019d called up, I was moved even more by the sight of her bending over the box in her Gore-Tex bikini; I clung to the edge of the chair as if it were a plunging roller coaster. A moment later she dropped a dozen file folders in my lap. The uppermost bore the name of the shoe company, and it was crammed with news clippings, several pages of a diary relating to plant operations and workers\u2019 shifts at the Grand Rapids facility, and a floor plan of the laboratories. The folders beneath it were inscribed with the names of cosmetics firms, biomedical research centers, furriers, tanners, meatpackers. Alena perched on the edge of the coffee table and watched as I shuffled through them.\n\n\u201cYou know the Draize test?\u201d\n\nI gave her a blank look.\n\n\u201cThey inject chemicals into rabbits\u2019 eyes to see how much it\u2019ll take before they go blind. The rabbits are in cages, thousands of them, and they take a needle and jab it into their eyes \u2014 and you know why, you know in the name of what great humanitarian cause this is going on, even as we speak?\n\nI didn\u2019t know. The surf pounded at my feet. I glanced at Alf and then back into her angry eyes.\n\u201cMascara, that\u2019s what. Mascara. They torture countless thousands of rabbits so women can look like sluts.\u201d\n\nI thought the characterization a bit harsh, but when I studied her pale lashes and tight lipstickless mouth, I saw that she meant it. At any rate, the notion set her off, and she launched into a two-hour lecture, gesturing with her flawless hands, quoting figures, digging through her files for the odd photo of legless mice or morphine-addicted gerbils. She told me how she\u2019d rescued Alf herself, raiding the laboratory with six other members of the Animal Liberation Front, the militant group in honor of which Alf had been named. At first, she\u2019d been content to write letters and carry placards, but now, with the lives of so many animals at stake, she\u2019d turned to more direct action: harassment, vandalism, sabotage. She described how she\u2019d spiked trees with Earth-First!ers in Oregon, cut miles of barbed-wire fence on cattle ranches in Nevada, destroyed records in biomedical research labs up and down the coast and insinuated herself between the hunters and the bighorn sheep in the mountains of Arizona. I could only nod and exclaim, smile ruefully and whistle in a low \u201choly cow!\u201d sort of way. Finally, she paused to level her unsettling eyes on me. \u201cYou know what Isaac Bashevis Singer said?\u201d\n\nWe were on our third beer. The sun was gone. I didn\u2019t have a clue.\n\nAlena leaned forward. \u2018\u201cEvery day is Auschwitz for the animals.\u201d\u2019\n\nI looked down into the amber aperture of my beer bottle and nodded my head sadly. The dryer had stopped an hour and a half ago. I wondered if she\u2019d go out to dinner with me, and what she could eat if she did. \u201cUh, I was wondering,\u201d I said, \u201cif\u2026if you might want to go out for something to eat \u2014 \u201d\n\nAlf chose that moment to heave himself up from the floor and urinate on the wall behind me. My dinner proposal hung in the balance as Alena shot up off the edge of the table to scold him and then gently usher him out the door. \u201cPoor Alf,\u201d she sighed, turning back to me with a shrug. \u201cBut listen, I\u2019m sorry if I talked your head off \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean to, but it\u2019s rare to find somebody on your own wavelength.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. On your own wavelength: the words illuminated me, excited me, sent up a tremor I could feel all the way down in the deepest nodes of my reproductive tract. \u201cSo how about dinner?\u201d I persisted. Restaurants were running through my head \u2014 would it have to be veggie? Could there be even a whiff of grilled flesh on the air? Curdled goat\u2019s milk and tabbouleh, tofu, lentil soup, sprouts: Every day is Auschwitz for the animals. \u201cNo place with meat, of course.\u201d\n\nShe just looked at me.\n\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t eat meat myself,\u201d I lied, \u201cor actually, not anymore\u201d \u2014 since the pastrami sandwich, that is \u2014 \u201dbut I don\u2019t really know any place that\u2026\u201d I trailed off lamely\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Vegan,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter two hours of blind bunnies, butchered calves and mutilated pups, I couldn\u2019t resist the joke. \u201cI\u2019m from Venus myself.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, but I could see she didn\u2019t find it all that funny. Vegans didn\u2019t eat meat or fish, she explained, or milk or cheese or eggs, and they didn\u2019t wear wool or leather \u2014 or fur, of course.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. We were both standing there, hovering over the coffee table. I was beginning to feel a little foolish.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just eat here,\u201d she said\n\nThe deep throb of the ocean seemed to settle in my bones as we lay there in bed that night, Alena and I, and I learned all about the fluency of her limbs and the sweetness of her vegetable tongue. Alf sprawled on the floor beneath us, wheezing and groaning in his sleep, and I blessed him for his incontinence and his doggy stupidity. Something was happening to me \u2014 I could feel it in the way the boards shifted under me, feel it with each beat of the surf \u2014 and I was ready to go along with it. In the morning, I called in sick again.\n\nAlena was watching me from bed as I dialed the office and described how the flu had migrated from my head to my gut and beyond, and there was a look in her eye that told me I would spend the rest of the day right there beside her, peeling grapes and dropping them one by one between her parted and expectant lips. I was wrong. Half an hour later, after a breakfast of brewer\u2019s yeast and what appeared to be some sort of bark marinated in yogurt, I found myself marching up and down the sidewalk in front of a fur emporium in Beverly Hills, waving a placard that read how does it feel to wear a corpse? in letters that dripped like blood.\n\nIt was a shock. I\u2019d seen protest marches on TV, antiwar rallies and civil rights demonstrations and all that, but I\u2019d never warmed my heels on the pavement or chanted slogans or felt the naked stick in my hand. There were maybe forty of us in all, mostly women, and we waved our placards at passing cars and blocked traffic on the sidewalk. One woman had smeared her face and hands with cold cream steeped in red dye, and Alena had found a ratty mink stole somewhere \u2014 the kind that features whole animals sewed together, snout to tail, their miniature limbs dangling \u2014 and she\u2019d taken a can of crimson spray paint to their muzzles so that they looked freshly killed. She brandished this grisly banner on a stick high above her head, whooping like a savage and chanting, \u201cFur is death, fur is death,\u201d over and over again till it became a mantra for the crowd. The day was unseasonably warm, the Jaguars glinted in the sun and the palms nodded in the breeze, and no one, but for a single tight-lipped salesman glowering from behind the store\u2019s immaculate windows, paid the slightest bit of attention to us.\n\nI marched out there on the street, feeling exposed and conspicuous, but marching nonetheless \u2014 for Alena\u2019s sake and for the sake of the foxes and martens and all the rest, and for my own sake too: with each step I took I could feel my consciousness expanding like a balloon, the breath of saintliness seeping steadily into me. Up to this point I\u2019d worn suede and leather like anybody else, ankle boots and Air Jordans, a bombardier jacket I\u2019d had since high school. If I\u2019d drawn the line with fur, it was only because I\u2019d never had any use for it. If I lived in the Yukon \u2014 and sometimes, drowsing through a meeting at work, I found myself fantasizing about it \u2014 I would have worn fur, no compunction, no second thoughts.\n\nBut not anymore. Now I was the protestor, a placard waver, now I was fighting for the right of every last weasel and lynx to grow old and die gracefully, now I was Alena Jorgensen\u2019s lover and a force to be reckoned with. Of course, my feet hurt and I was running sweat and praying that no one from work would drive by and see me there on the sidewalk with my crazy cohorts and denunciatory sign.\n\nWe marched for hours, back and forth, till I thought we\u2019d wear a groove in the pavement. We chanted and jeered and nobody so much as looked at us twice. We could have been Hare Krishnas, bums, anti-abortionists, or lepers, what did it matter? To the rest of the world, to the uninitiated masses to whose sorry number I\u2019d belonged just twenty-four hours earlier, we were invisible. I was hungry, tired, discouraged. Alena was ignoring me. Even the woman in red-face was slowing down, her chant a hoarse whisper that was sucked up and obliterated in the roar of traffic. And then, as the afternoon faded toward rush hour, a wizened silvery old woman who might have been an aging star or a star\u2019s mother or even the first dimly remembered wife of a studio exec got out of a long white car at the curb and strode fearlessly toward us. Despite the heat \u2014 it must have been eighty degrees at this point \u2014 she was wearing an ankle-length silver fox coat, a bristling shouldery wafting mass of peltry that must have decimated every burrow on the tundra. It was the moment we\u2019d been waiting for.\n\nA cry went up, shrill and ululating, and we converged on the lone old woman like a Cheyenne war party scouring the plains. The man beside me went down on all fours and howled like a dog. Alena slashed the air with her limp mink, and the blood sang in my ears. \u201cMurderer!\u201d I screamed, getting into it. \u201cTorturer! Nazi!\u201d The strings in my neck were tight. I didn\u2019t know what I was saying. The crowd gibbered. The placards danced. I was so close to the old woman I could smell her \u2014 her perfume, a whiff of mothballs from the coat \u2014 and it intoxicated me, maddened me, and I stepped in front of her to block her path with all the seething militant bulk of my one hundred eighty-five pounds of sinew and muscle.\n\nI never saw the chauffeur. Alena told me afterward that he was a former kickboxing champion who\u2019d been banned from the sport for excessive brutality. The first blow seemed to drop down from above, a shell lobbed from deep within enemy territory; the others came at me like a windmill churning in a storm. Someone screamed. I remember focusing on the flawless rigid pleats of the chauffeur\u2019s trousers, and then things got a bit hazy.\n\nI woke to the dull thump of the surf slamming at the shore and the touch of Alena\u2019s lips on my own. I felt as if I\u2019d been broken on the wheel, dismantled, and put back together again. \u201cLie still,\u201d she said, and her tongue moved against my swollen cheek. Stricken, I could only drag my head across the pillow and gaze into the depths of her parti-colored eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re one of us now,\u201d she whispered.\n\nNext morning I didn\u2019t even bother to call in sick.\n\nBy the end of the week I\u2019d recovered enough to crave meat, for which I felt deeply ashamed, and to wear out a pair of vinyl huaraches on the picket line. Together, and with various coalitions of antivivisectionists, militant Vegans, and cat lovers, Alena and I tramped a hundred miles of sidewalk, spray-painted inflammatory slogans across the windows of supermarkets and burger stands, denounced tanners, furriers, poulterers, and sausage makers, and somehow found time to break up a cockfight in Pacoima. It was exhilarating, heady, dangerous. If I\u2019d been disconnected in the past, I was plugged in now. I felt righteous \u2014 for the first time in my life I had a cause \u2014 and I had Alena, Alena above all. She fascinated me, fixated me, made me feel like a tomcat leaping in and out of second-story windows, oblivious to the free-fall and the picket fence below. There was her beauty, of course, a triumph of evolution and the happy interchange of genes going all the way back to the cavemen, but it was more than that \u2014 it was her commitment to animals, to the righting of wrongs, to morality that made her irresistible. Was it love? The term is something I\u2019ve always had difficulty with, but I suppose it was. Sure it was. Love, pure and simple. I had it, it had me.\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Alena said one night as she stood over the miniature stove, searing tofu in oil and garlic. We\u2019d spent the afternoon demonstrating out front of a tortilla factory that used rendered animal fat as a congealing agent, after which we\u2019d been chased three blocks by an overweight assistant manager at Von\u2019s who objected to Alena\u2019s spray-painting meat is death over the specials in the front window. I was giddy with the adolescent joy of it. I sank into the couch with a beer and watched Alf limp across the floor to fling himself down and lick at a suspicious spot on the floor. The surf boomed like thunder.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThanksgiving\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nI let it ride a moment, wondering if I should invite Alena to my mother\u2019s for the big basted bird stuffed with canned oysters and buttered bread crumbs, and then realized it probably wouldn\u2019t be such a great idea. I said nothing.\n\nShe glanced over her shoulder. \u201cThe animals don\u2019t have a whole lot to be thankful for, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s just an excuse for the meat industry to butcher a couple million turkeys, is all it is.\u201d She paused; hot safflower oil popped in the pan. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for a little road trip,\u201d she said. \u201cCan we take your car?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, but where are we going?\u201d\n\nShe gave me her Gioconda smile. \u201cTo liberate some turkeys.\u201d\n\nIn the morning I called my boss to tell him I had pancreatic cancer and wouldn\u2019t be in for a while, then we threw some things in the car, helped Alf scrabble into the back seat, and headed up Route 5 for the San Joaquin Valley. We drove for three hours through a fog so dense the windows might as well have been packed with cotton. Alena was secretive, but I could see she was excited. I knew only that we were on our way to rendezvous with a certain \u201cRolfe,\u201d a longtime friend of hers and a big name in the world of ecotage and animal rights, after which we would commit some desperate and illegal act, for which the turkeys would be eternally grateful.\n\nThere was a truck stalled in front of the sign for our exit at Calpurnia Springs, and I had to brake hard and jerk the wheel around twice to keep the tires on the pavement. Alena came up out of her seat and Alf slammed into the armrest like a sack of meal, but we made it. A few minutes later we were gliding through the ghostly vacancy of the town itself, lights drifting past in a nimbus of fog, glowing pink, yellow, and white, and then there was only the blacktop road and the pale void that engulfed it. We\u2019d gone ten miles or so when Alena instructed me to slow down and began to study the right-hand shoulder with a keen, unwavering eye.\n\nThe earth breathed in and out. I squinted hard into the soft drifting glow of the headlights. \u201cThere, there!\u201d she cried and I swung the wheel to the right, and suddenly we were lurching along a pitted dirt road that rose up from the blacktop like a goat path worn into the side of a mountain. Five minutes later Alf sat up in the back seat and began to whine, and then a crude unpainted shack began to detach itself from the vagueness around us.\n\nRolfe met us on the porch. He was tall and leathery, in his fifties, I guessed, with a shock of hair and rutted features that brought Samuel Beckett to mind. He was wearing gumboots and jeans and a faded lumberjack shirt that looked as if it had been washed a hundred times. Alf took a quick pee against the side of the house, then fumbled up the steps to roll over and fawn at his feet.\n\n\u201cRolfe!\u201d Alena called, and there was too much animation in her voice, too much familiarity, for my taste. She took the steps in a bound and threw herself in his arms. I watched them kiss, and it wasn\u2019t a fatherly-daughterly sort of kiss, not at all. It was a kiss with some meaning behind it, and I didn\u2019t like it. Rolfe, I thought: What kind of name is that?\n\n\u201cRolfe,\u201d Alena gasped, still a little breathless from bouncing up the steps like a cheerleader, \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet Jim.\u201d\n\nThat was my signal. I ascended the porch steps and held out my hand. Rolfe gave me a look out of the hooded depths of his eyes and then took my hand in a hard calloused grip, the grip of the wood splitter, the fence mender, the liberator of hothouse turkeys and laboratory mice. \u201cA pleasure,\u201d he said, and his voice rasped like sandpaper.\n\nThere was a fire going inside, and Alena and I sat before it and warmed our hands while Alf whined and sniffed and Rolfe served Red Zinger tea in Japanese cups the size of thimbles. Alena hadn\u2019t stopped chattering since we stepped through the door, and Rolfe came right back at her in his woodsy rasp, the two of them exchanging names and news and gossip as if they were talking in code. I studied the reproductions of teal and widgeon that hung from the peeling walls, noted the case of Heinz vegetarian beans in the corner and the half-gallon of Jack Daniel\u2019s on the mantel. Finally, after the third cup of tea, Alena settled back in her chair \u2014 a huge old Salvation Army sort of thing with a soiled antimacassar \u2014 and said, \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d\n\nRolfe gave me another look, a quick predatory darting of the eyes, as if he weren\u2019t sure I could be trusted, and then turned back to Alena. \u201cHedda Gabler\u2019s Range-Fed Turkey Ranch,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd no, I don\u2019t find the name cute, not at all.\u201d He looked at me now, a long steady assay. \u201cThey grind up the heads for cat food, and the neck, the organs, and the rest, that they wrap up in paper and stuff back in the body cavity like it was a war atrocity or something. Whatever did a turkey go and do to us to deserve a fate like that?\u201d\n\nThe question was rhetorical, even if it seemed to have been aimed at me, and I made no response other than to compose my face in a look that wedded grief, outrage, and resolve. I was thinking of all the turkeys I\u2019d sent to their doom, of the plucked wishbones, the pope\u2019s noses,1 and the crisp browned skin I used to relish as a kid. It brought a lump to my throat, and something more: I realized I was hungry.\n\n\u201cBen Franklin wanted to make them our national symbol,\u201d Alena chimed in, \u201cdid you know that? But the meat eaters won out.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty thousand birds,\u201d Rolfe said, glancing at Alena and bringing his incendiary gaze back to rest on me. \u201cI have information they\u2019re going to start slaughtering them tomorrow, for the fresh-not-frozen market.\u201d\n\n\u201cYuppie poultry,\u201d Alena\u2019s voice was drenched in disgust.\n\nFor a moment, no one spoke. I became aware of the crackling of the fire. The fog pressed at the windows. It was getting dark.\n\n\u201cYou can see the place from the highway,\u201d Rolfe said finally, \u201cbut the only access is through Calpurnia Springs. It\u2019s about twenty miles \u2014 twenty-two point three, to be exact.\u201d\n\nAlena\u2019s eyes were bright. She was gazing on Rolfe as if he\u2019d just dropped down from heaven. I felt something heave in my stomach.\n\n\u201cWe strike tonight.\n\nRolfe insisted that we take my car \u2014 \u201cEverybody around here knows my pickup, and I can\u2019t take any chances on a little operation like this\u201d \u2014 but we did mask the plates, front and back, with an inch-thick smear of mud. We blackened our faces like commandos and collected our tools from the shed out back \u2014 tin snips, a crowbar, and two five-gallon cans of gasoline. \u201cGasoline?\u201d I said, trying the heft of the can. Rolfe gave me a craggy look. \u201cTo create a diversion,\u201d he said. Alf, for obvious reasons, stayed behind in the shack.\n\nIf the fog had been thick in daylight, it was impenetrable now, the sky collapsed upon the earth. It took hold of the headlights and threw them back at me till my eyes began to water from the effort of keeping the car on the road. But for the ruts and bumps we might have been floating in space. Alena sat up front between Rolfe and me, curiously silent. Rolfe didn\u2019t have much to say either, save for the occasional grunted command: \u201cHang a right here\u201d; \u201cHard left\u201d; \u201cEasy, easy.\u201d I thought about meat and jail and the heroic proportions to which I was about to swell in Alena\u2019s eyes and what I intended to do to her when we finally got to bed. It was 2:00 a.m. by the dashboard clock.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Rolfe said, and his voice came at me so suddenly it startled me, \u201cpull over here \u2014 and kill the lights.\u201d\n\nWe stepped out into the hush of night and eased the doors shut behind us. I couldn\u2019t see a thing, but I could hear the not-so-distant hiss of traffic on the highway, and another sound, too, muffled and indistinct, the gentle unconscious suspiration of thousands upon thousands of my fellow creatures. And I could smell them, a seething rancid odor of feces and feathers and naked scaly feet that crawled down my throat and burned my nostrils. \u201cWhew,\u201d I said in a whisper, \u201cI can smell them.\u201d\n\nRolfe and Alena were vague presences at my side. Rolfe flipped open the trunk and in the next moment I felt the heft of a crowbar and a pair of tin snips in my hand. \u201cListen, you, Jim,\u201d Rolfe whispered, taking me by the wrist in his iron grip and leading me half-a-dozen steps forward. \u201cFeel this?\u201d\n\nI felt a grid of wire, which he promptly cut: snip, snip, snip.\n\n\u201cThis is their enclosure \u2014 they\u2019re out there in the day, scratching around in the dirt. You get lost, you follow this wire. Now, you\u2019re going to take a section out of this side, Alena\u2019s got the west side and I\u2019ve got the south. Once that\u2019s done I signal with the flashlight and we bust open the doors to the turkey houses \u2014 they\u2019re these big low white buildings, you\u2019ll see them when you get close \u2014 and flush the birds out. Don\u2019t worry about me or Alena. Just worry about getting as many birds out as you can.\u201d\n\nI was worried. Worried about everything, from some half-crazed farmer with a shotgun or AK-47 or whatever they carried these days, to losing Alena in the fog, to the turkeys themselves: How big were they? Were they violent? They had claws and beaks, didn\u2019t they? And how were they going to feel about me bursting into their bedroom in the middle of the night?\n\n\u201cAnd when the gas cans go up, you hightail it back to the car, got it?\u201d\n\nI could hear the turkeys tossing in their sleep. A truck shifted gears out on the highway. \u201cI think so,\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cAnd one more thing \u2014 be sure to leave the keys in the ignition.\u201d\n\nThis gave me pause. \u201cBut \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cThe getaway.\u201d Alena was so close I could feel her breath on my ear. \u201cI mean, we don\u2019t want to be fumbling around for the keys when all hell is breaking loose out there, do we?\u201d\n\nI eased open the door and reinserted the keys in the ignition, even though the automatic buzzer warned me against it. \u201cOkay,\u201d I murmured, but they were already gone, soaked up in the shadows and the mist. At this point my heart was hammering so loudly I could barely hear the rustling of the turkeys \u2014 this is crazy, I told myself, it\u2019s hurtful and wrong, not to mention illegal. Spray-painting slogans was one thing, but this was something else altogether. I thought of the turkey farmer asleep in his bed, an entrepreneur working to make America strong, a man with a wife and kids and a mortgage\u2026but then I thought of all those innocent turkeys consigned to death, and finally I thought of Alena, long-legged and loving, and the way she came to me out of the darkness of the bathroom and the boom of the surf. I took the tin snips to the wire.\n\nI must have been at it half an hour, forty-five minutes, gradually working my way toward the big white sheds that had begun to emerge from the gloom up ahead, when I saw Rolfe\u2019s flashlight blinking off to my left. This was my signal to head to the nearest shed, snap off the padlock with my crowbar, fling open the doors, and herd a bunch of cranky suspicious gobblers out into the night. It was now or never. I looked twice round me and then broke for the near shed in an awkward crouching gait. The turkeys must have sensed that something was up \u2014 from behind the long white windowless wall there arose a watchful gabbling, a soughing of feathers that fanned up like a breeze in the treetops. Hold on, you toms and hens, I thought, freedom is at hand. A jerk of the wrist, and the padlock fell to the ground. Blood pounded in my ears, I took hold of the sliding door and jerked it open with a great dull booming reverberation \u2014 and suddenly, there they were, turkeys, thousands upon thousands of them, cloaked in white feathers under a string of dim yellow bulbs. The light glinted in their reptilian eyes. Somewhere a dog began to bark.\n\nI steeled myself and sprang through the door with a shout, whirling the crowbar over my head, \u201cAll right!\u201d I boomed, and the echo gave it back to me a hundred times over, \u201cthis is it! Turkeys, on your feet!\u201d Nothing. No response. But for the whisper of rustling feathers and the alertly cocked heads, they might have been sculptures, throw pillows, they might as well have been dead and butchered and served up with yams and onions and all the trimmings. The barking of the dog went up a notch. I thought I heard voices.\n\nThe turkeys crouched on the concrete floor, wave upon wave of them, stupid and immovable; they perched in the rafters, on shelves and platforms, huddled in wooden stalls. Desperate, I rushed into the front rank of them, swinging my crowbar, stamping my feet, and howling like the wishbone plucker I once was. That did it. There was a shriek from the nearest bird and the others took it up till an unholy racket filled the place, and now they were moving, tumbling down from their perches, flapping their wings in a storm of dried excrement and pecked-over grain, pouring across the concrete floor till it vanished beneath them. Encouraged, I screamed again \u2014 \u201cYeeee-ha-ha-ha-ha!\u201d \u2014 and beat at the aluminum walls with the crowbar as the turkeys shot through the doorway and out into the night.\n\nIt was then that the black mouth of the doorway erupted with light and the ka-boom! of the gas cans sent a tremor through the earth. Run! a voice screamed in my head, and the adrenaline kicked in and all of a sudden I was scrambling for the door in a hurricane of turkeys. They were everywhere, flapping their wings, gobbling and screeching, loosing their bowels in panic. Something hit the back of my legs and all at once I was down amongst them, on the floor, in the dirt and feathers and wet turkey shit. I was a roadbed, a turkey expressway. Their claws dug at my back, my shoulders, the crown of my head. Panicked now, choking on feathers and dust and worse, I fought to my feet as the big screeching birds launched themselves round me, and staggered out into the barnyard. \u201cThere! Who\u2019s that there?\u201d a voice roared, and I was off and running.\n\nWhat can I say? I vaulted turkeys, kicked them aside like so many footballs, slashed and tore at them as they sailed through the air. I ran till my lungs felt as if they were burning right through my chest, disoriented, bewildered, terrified of the shotgun blast I was sure would cut me down at any moment. Behind me the fire raged and lit the fog till it glowed blood-red and hellish. But where was the fence? And where the car?\n\nI got control of my feet then and stood stock-still in a flurry of turkeys, squinting into the wall of fog. Was that it? Was that the car over there? At that moment I heard an engine start up somewhere behind me \u2014 a familiar engine with a familiar coughing gurgle in the throat of the carburetor \u2014 and then the lights blinked on briefly three hundred yards away. I heard the engine race and listened, helpless, as the car roared off in the opposite direction. I stood there a moment longer, forlorn and forsaken, and then I ran blindly off into the night, putting the fire and the shouts and the barking and the incessant mindless squawking of the turkeys as far behind me as I could.\n\nWhen dawn finally broke, it was only just perceptibly, so thick was the fog. I\u2019d made my way to a blacktop road \u2014 which road and where it led I didn\u2019t know \u2014 and sat crouched and shivering in a clump of weed just off the shoulder. Alena wouldn\u2019t desert me, I was sure of that \u2014 she loved me, as I loved her; needed me, as I needed her \u2014 and I was sure she\u2019d be cruising along the back roads looking for me. My pride was wounded, of course, and if I never laid eyes on Rolfe again I felt I wouldn\u2019t be missing much, but at least I hadn\u2019t been drilled full of shot, savaged by farm dogs, or pecked to death by irate turkeys. I was sore all over, my shin throbbed where I\u2019d slammed into something substantial while vaulting through the night, there were feathers in my hair, and my face and arms were a mosaic of cuts and scratches and long trailing fissures of dirt. I\u2019d been sitting there for what seemed like hours, cursing Rolfe, developing suspicions about Alena and unflattering theories about environmentalists in general, when finally I heard the familiar slurp and roar of my Chevy Citation cutting through the mist ahead of me.\n\nRolfe was driving, his face impassive. I flung myself into the road like a tattered beggar, waving my arms over my head and giving vent to my joy, and he very nearly ran me down. Alena was out of the car before it stopped, wrapping me up in her arms, and then she was bundling me into the rear seat with Alf and we were on our way back to the hideaway. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she cried, as if she couldn\u2019t have guessed. \u201cWhere were you? We waited as long as we could.\u201d\n\nI was feeling sulky, betrayed, feeling as if I was owed a whole lot more than a perfunctory hug and a string of insipid questions. Still, as I told my tale I began to warm to it \u2014 they\u2019d got away in the car with the heater going, and I\u2019d stayed behind to fight the turkeys, the farmers, and the elements, too, and if that wasn\u2019t heroic, I\u2019d like to know what was. I looked into Alena\u2019s admiring eyes and pictured Rolfe\u2019s shack, a nip or two from the bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s, maybe a peanut-butter-and-tofu sandwich, and then the bed, with Alena in it. Rolfe said nothing.\n\nBack at Rolfe\u2019s, I took a shower and scrubbed the turkey droppings from my pores, then helped myself to the bourbon. It was ten in the morning and the house was dark \u2014 if the world had ever been without fog, there was no sign of it here. When Rolfe stepped out on the porch to fetch an armload of firewood, I pulled Alena down into my lap. \u201cHey,\u201d she murmured, \u201cI thought you were an invalid.\u201d\n\nShe was wearing a pair of too-tight jeans and an oversize sweater with nothing underneath it. I slipped my hand inside the sweater and found something to hold on to. \u201cInvalid?\u201d I said, nuzzling at her sleeve. \u201cHell, I\u2019m a turkey liberator, an ecoguerrilla, a friend of the animals and the environment, too.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, but she pushed herself up and crossed the room to stare out the occluded window. \u201cListen, Jim,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat we did last night was great, really great, but it\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d Alf looked up at her expectantly. I heard Rolfe fumbling around on the porch, the thump of wood on wood. She turned around to face me now. \u201cWhat I mean is, Rolfe wants me to go up to Wyoming for a little bit, just outside of Yellowstone \u2014 \u201d\n\nMe? Rolfe wants me? There was no invitation in that, no plurality, no acknowledgment of all we\u2019d done and meant to each other. \u201cFor what?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this grizzly \u2014 a pair of them, actually \u2014 and they\u2019ve been raiding places outside the park. One of them made off with the mayor\u2019s Doberman the other night and the people are up in arms. We \u2014 I mean Rolfe and me and some other people from the old Bolt Weevils in Minnesota? \u2014 we\u2019re going to go up there and make sure the Park Service \u2014 or the local yahoos \u2014 don\u2019t eliminate them. The bears, I mean.\u201d\n\nMy tone was corrosive. \u201cYou and Rolfe?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing between us, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. This has to do with animals, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike us?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot like us, no. We\u2019re the plague on this planet, don\u2019t you know that?\u201d\n\nSuddenly I was angry. Seething. Here I\u2019d crouched in the bushes all night, covered in turkey crap, and now I was part of a plague. I was on my feet. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\nShe gave me a look that let me know it didn\u2019t matter, that she was already gone, that her agenda, at least for the moment, didn\u2019t include me and there was no use arguing about it. \u201cLook,\u201d she said, her voice dropping as Rolfe slammed back through the door with a load of wood, \u201cI\u2019ll see you in L.A. in a month or so, okay?\u201d She gave me an apologetic smile. \u201cWater the plants for me?\u201d\n\nAn hour later I was on the road again. I\u2019d helped Rolfe stack the wood beside the fireplace, allowed Alena to brush my lips with a good-bye kiss, and then stood there on the porch while Rolfe locked up, lifted Alf into the bed of his pickup, and rumbled down the rutted dirt road with Alena at his side. I watched till their brake lights dissolved in the drifting gray mist, then fired up the Citation and lurched down the road behind them. A month or so: I felt hollow inside. I pictured her with Rolfe, eating yogurt and wheat germ, stopping at motels, wrestling grizzlies, and spiking trees. The hollowness opened up, cored me out till I felt as if I\u2019d been plucked and gutted and served up on a platter myself.\n\nI found my way back through Calpurnia Springs without incident \u2014 there were no roadblocks, no flashing lights and grim-looking troopers searching trunks and back seats for a tallish thirty-year-old ecoterrorist with turkey tracks down his back \u2014 but after I turned onto the highway for Los Angeles, I had a shock. Ten miles up the road my nightmare materialized out of the gloom: red lights everywhere, signal flares and police cars lined up on the shoulder. I was on the very edge of panicking, a beat away from cutting across the median and giving them a run for it, when I saw the truck jackknifed up ahead. I slowed to forty, thirty, and then hit the brakes again. In a moment I was stalled in a line of cars and there was something all over the road, ghostly and white in the fog. At first I thought it must have been flung from the truck, rolls of toilet paper or crates of soap powder ruptured on the pavement. It was neither. As I inched closer, the tires creeping now, the pulse of the lights in my face, I saw that the road was coated in feathers, turkey feathers. A storm of them. A blizzard. And more: there was flesh there too, slick and greasy, a red pulp ground into the surface of the road, thrown up like slush from the tires of the car ahead of me, ground beneath the massive wheels of the truck. Turkeys. Turkeys everywhere.\n\nThe car crept forward. I flicked on the windshield wipers, hit the washer button, and for a moment a scrim of diluted blood obscured the windows and the hollowness opened up inside of me till I thought it would suck me inside out. Behind me, someone was leaning on his horn. A trooper loomed up out of the gloom, waving me on with the dead yellow eye of his flashlight. I thought of Alena and felt sick. All there was between us had come to this, expectations gone sour, a smear on the road. I wanted to get out and shoot myself, turn myself in, close my eyes, and wake up in jail, in a hair shirt, in a straitjacket, anything. It went on. Time passed. Nothing moved. And then, miraculously, a vision began to emerge from behind the smeared glass and the gray belly of the fog, lights glowing golden in the waste. I saw the sign, Gas/Food/Lodging, and my hand was on the blinker.\n\nIt took me a moment, picturing the place, the generic tile, the false cheer of the lights, the odor of charred flesh hanging heavy on the air, Big Mac, three-piece dark meat, carne asada, cheeseburger. The engine coughed. The lights glowed. I didn\u2019t think of Alena then, didn\u2019t think of Rolfe or grizzlies or the doomed bleating flocks and herds, or of the blind bunnies and cancerous mice \u2014 I thought only of the cavern opening inside me and how to fill it. \u201cMeat,\u201d and I spoke the word aloud, talking to calm myself as if I\u2019d awakened from a bad dream, \u201cit\u2019s only meat.\u201dEmbed"}, {"_type":

You would think it's\nBecause Pac-Man looks like a yellow\nHockey puck, but actually it comes\nFrom the Japanese phrase paku-paku\nWhich means to flap ones mouth open\nAnd closed. They changed it over here\nBecause Puck-Man is too easy to\nVandalize. You know, scratch out the P\nAnd turn it into an F or whatever?\nKnives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move\n\nKNIVES CHAU\nOhmigod, like...wow\n\nSCOTT\nYeah. Wow\nThe game ends.

Scott takes\nHis shirt off. They tumble onto the bed and make out. Then-\n\nRAMONA\nI changed my mind\n\nSCOTT\nChanged it to what? From what?\n\nRAMONA\nI don't want to have sex with you\nPilgrim. Not right now\n\nSCOTT\nOhh...kay\n\nRAMONA\nIt's not like I'm gonna send you\nHome in a snowstorm or anything\nYou can sleep in my bed. And I\nReserve the right to change my mind\nAbout the sex later\nRamona curls up next to Scott\n\n\nSCOTT\nThis is cool, just this. It's been\nLike a really long time, and this\nIs...I think I needed this\nWhatever this is. So, thanks\n\nRAMONA\nYou're welcome\nThey exchange a smile.

He wears an evil grin and a jacket that\nBorders on flamboyant. He drags on a cigarette (blacked out)\n\nMATTHEW PATEL\nMr. Pilgrim. It is I, Matthew\nPatel. Consider our fight...begun!\n\nSCOTT\nWhat did I do?\nMatthew Patel leaps in the air and sails toward Scott\n\nSCOTT\nWhat do I do?!\n\nWALLACE\nFIGHT!\n\nScott throws his bass to Young Neil and BLOCKS Patel with his\nLeft arm, then PUNCHES him across the floor with his right\nPatel LANDS like a cat, FLIPS his fringe and GLARES at Scott\n\nMATTHEW PATEL\nAlright. Alright\n\nWALLACE\nWatch out! It's that one guy!\n\nSCOTT\nThank you, Wallace!\nPatel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and\nSends him flying into the air.

Is he a pirate?\nScott looks at Patel's outfit\n\nSCOTT\nAre you a pirate?\n\nMATTHEW PATEL\nPirates are in this year!\nPatel attacks again.

Scott looks up to Ramona\n\nSCOTT\nYou really went out with this guy?\n\nRAMONA\nYeah, in the seventh grade\nThe Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the\nBalcony. We see a sketchy childlike ANIMATED FLASHBACK\n\nRAMONA (CONT'D)\nIt was football season and for some\nReason, all the little jocks wanted\nMe. Matthew was the only non-white\nNon-jock boy in school, probably in\nThe entire state, so we joined\nForces and took 'em all out. We\nWere one hell of a team. Nothing\nCould beat Matthew's mystical\nPowers. Nothing but pre-teen\nCapriciousness. We only kissed\nOnce. After a week and a half, I\nTold him to hit the showers\n\n\nThe spotlight swings back onto Scott and Patel\n\n\nSCOTT\nDude, wait...mystical powers?\nPatel levitates into the air and points at Ramona\n\nMATTHEW PATEL\nYou'll pay for this, Flowers!\nPatel SNAPS his fingers and launches into a BOLLYWOOD SONG!\n\nMATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)\nIf you want to fight me, you're not\nThe brightest.

The house drum kit is trashed behind him\n\nMATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)\nLet us show him what we're all\nAbout\nScott hits the ground, dodging a third wave of fireballs\nThey explode Crash and the Boys in the wings\n\nSCOTT\nThat doesn't even rhyme\nScott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and\nThrows it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the\nEyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish\n\nMATTHEW PATEL\nThis is impossible, how can it be?!\nScott leaps into the air. Patel opens his eyes just in time\nTo see Scott Pilgrim's FIST racing towards his face\n\nSCOTT\nOpen your eyes. Maybe you'll see\nK.O! Scott punches Patel. He explodes into COINS.

His manuscript is quite fragmentary, quite obscure, but in it he speaks with such an accent of joy and fulfillment that he may truly have known happiness. If the scraps of his journal that have come down to me are the work of a madman, then I don't think the happiness all of us look for is far removed from madness. Perhaps his notes are somewhat incoherent, but then I distrust reason that's too cold and rational.\n\"When she wants to taste a guava,\" wrote Lieutenant Wheelbarrow, \"I immediately feel two, cold, acid streams flowing along my jaws. She doesn't need to speak. Our eyes meet, our hands clasp, and we rush out to the countryside . . .\"\nIt seems that they never rested, and that every night they ran through the mountains. Earl wrote in his journal:\n\"I hurt myself falling into a deep ravine. She picked me up and carried me into the grotto. My calf is half torn off, but I'm not suffering. She gathers fresh dew to bathe my wound; that's all. She takes care of me, and if by chance she sees a shadow of pain in my eyes, she simply puts her mouth to my wound, and immediately the pain is gone.\"\n\nEarl Wheelbarrow must have reached the point of human knowledge where one participates in every breath, every vibration, of living matter. He notes:\n\"Yesterday she told me that she would teach me to laugh like the flowers. For hours she directed my lessons. Then I felt a great peace and our bodies merged . . . \"\nHe relates further:\n\"Now I can stay for long minutes underwater . . . The fish come and go around us, come close, look at us, rub against us, and leave again with slow strokes . . . I can't make them snuggle into my hand yet the way she can . . . \"\nThen: \"Last night it was cold. I felt chilled. Then she beckoned. I slid behind her into the narrow fault in the grotto that descends almost straight down. We went down into the heart of the earth for perhaps an hour. At a point where the space widened, we stopped and settled in a crevice. There was a soft warmth everywhere. I felt the radiant life of the depths vibrating against my body and the trembling of the great thermal waters dancing under the earth's flesh. Some kind of little golden flies flitted around us. I penetrated her and we slept . . . We went back up when day broke . . . \"\nIf the manuscript is to be believed, life is a brotherhood among the Vien-Viens:\n\"Life is sometimes hard in the mountains, and it may happen that we're hungry. If I've picked a fruit, a bitter-sweet root, a sugary stalk, she won't eat if I won't bite our find with her, turn by turn . . . Then her eyes are the most loving color I've ever seen.\"\nNever was there a more intimate union than that of Earl Wheelbarrow and the survivor of the gentle Xemi people. I read in his pages:\n\"The other day, for just a few seconds my spirit wandered far, very far away. She knew it immediately. So she took the musician-bird that lives with us and closed my fingers around this bouquet of living feathers. At that moment, I felt all the vibrancy of her love, her love as large as life, pass through me . . . \"\nI decipher from another fragment: \"She takes my hands, rests her head against my chest, and stays there for long hours listening to my heart beat. I am merged with her . . . Often we play: she's the waterfall, and I bathe in the mad tumble of her blueblack hair . . . \"\n\nEarl Wheelbarrow was still young, yet he was constantly anxious about the passage of ever-fleeing time. I can make out these sentences:\n\"I have no impression of aging or using myself up. I feel sure that I'll go out like a candle some far-off day. May it be as far-off as possible, for she doesn't know what it is to cry! . . . She would tie herself to my remains and hold me tightly against her until death came for her, too. She would let herself starve to death, but she would never let me go . . . That was, she told me, what the wives of the great caciques did in the olden days: they accompanied their mates into the tomb . . .\"\n\nPerhaps the enchanted second lieutenant learned all the secrets of the Xemi people, the secrets we would like so much to know. In any case, it seems that several times he was in contact with other Vien-Viens. He relates:\n\"I saw the great red xem\u00e8s-god in the immense underground chasm . . . She told me the great samba of the Xemi people and taught me the words of the great, ancient areytos.\"\n\nI managed to read still more of the old, worn, tattered, ragged document whose letters are often faded by the water of heavy rains and by the sun's burning heat:\n\"With the rainy season, the great festivals of the sambas arrive. We blow three modulated notes into great conch shells, and our brothers and sisters on the mountains answer us from far away . . . Then we come together, we sing, we dance until the end of the rains . . . The music turns me into a wretched, torn-up thing; even my tearing is melodious and participates in hers . . .\"\n\nThat's all I can say about the life of the enchanted second lieutenant, about the bitter poetry, the strange love that made it flare up like a Bengal light in the violet, violent mountains of the St. Marc highlands. He would run by night like an elf, drunk with the splendors of the mountains. He would run every night with his companion in the greening of the earth, in the mouth of the wind, in the shimmering of the waters. During the day he lived in the grottoes where lay the treasures amassed by the Cacique of the House of Gold, the formidable Caonabo. He knew all the ancient spells, all the songs, all the dances of Queen Anacaona the Great, the Golden Flower, those songs and those dances that the mistresses-of-the-waters and the mistresses of the mountains keep alive on moon-lit nights.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/908604", "artist_names": "Jackie Wilson", "full_title": "Please Tell Me Why by\u00a0Jackie\u00a0Wilson", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/25e64f52b7a7ab823a3474f6181eb3b6.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/25e64f52b7a7ab823a3474f6181eb3b6.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 908604, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429311211, "path": "/Jackie-wilson-please-tell-me-why-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Jackie-wilson-please-tell-me-why-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1960, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1960", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1960", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/25e64f52b7a7ab823a3474f6181eb3b6.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/25e64f52b7a7ab823a3474f6181eb3b6.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Please Tell Me Why", "title_with_featured": "Please Tell Me Why", "updated_by_human_at": 1661588336, "url": "https://genius.com/Jackie-wilson-please-tell-me-why-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/91643", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fccfc86810e2433c490597837210b194.830x830x1.jpg", "id": 91643, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fccfc86810e2433c490597837210b194.830x830x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Jackie Wilson", "slug": "Jackie-wilson", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Jackie-wilson"}, "artist": "Jackie Wilson", "lyrics": "Please Tell Me Why LyricsI tried so hard to make you stay\nNow it doesn't matter what happens from day to day\nI sit alone with tears in my eyes\nOh, please tell me why\nNights seem so long since youve been gone\nI wonder why the feelin still lingers on\nI sit alone with tears in my eyes\nPlease tell me why\nBlack dirt under my feet\nStorm clouds over my head\nAll I do each and every night is just weep in my lonely bed\nI sit alone with tears in my eyes\nPlease tell me whyYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/218850", "artist_names": "Sam Cooke", "full_title": "That\u2019s It \u2014 I Quit \u2014 I\u2019m Movin\u2019 On by\u00a0Sam\u00a0Cooke", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/64d3c9329c058d01cfe42e1218eb3b91.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/64d3c9329c058d01cfe42e1218eb3b91.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 218850, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 218200, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1552569332, "path": "/Sam-cooke-thats-it-i-quit-im-movin-on-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Sam-cooke-thats-it-i-quit-im-movin-on-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1961, "month": 2, "day": 14}, "release_date_for_display": "February 14, 1961", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 14, 1961", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/64d3c9329c058d01cfe42e1218eb3b91.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/64d3c9329c058d01cfe42e1218eb3b91.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "That\u2019s It \u2014 I Quit \u2014 I\u2019m Movin\u2019 On", "title_with_featured": "That\u2019s It \u2014 I Quit \u2014 I\u2019m Movin\u2019 On", "updated_by_human_at": 1618116059, "url": "https://genius.com/Sam-cooke-thats-it-i-quit-im-movin-on-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/21689", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/399a24b21a57a79c100b5d8e20944270.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 21689, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/399a24b21a57a79c100b5d8e20944270.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Sam Cooke", "slug": "Sam-cooke", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Sam-cooke"}, "artist": "Sam Cooke", "lyrics": "That\u2019s It \u2014 I Quit \u2014 I\u2019m Movin\u2019 On LyricsWhen we used to say goodnight\nI'd always kiss and hold you tight\nBut lately you don't seem to care\nYou close the door and leave me\nStanding there. oh honey that's not fair\nThat's it!

thee\nI\u2019m the white boy knowing about COINTELPRO\nSo when I see racism I know how far back it goes\nBut y'all ain\u2019t looking for conscious flows so\nI tear up my home state harder than RTJ\nWhen they came with Che and the Brusier Brigade\nTore up St. Andrew\u2019s and left the smoldering decay\nWith Danny Brown putting the remains in an ash tray\nGot me hyped enough to punch Floyd Mayweather in the face\nKnock his teeth out and call it a day\nExcept Manny would have my head so let me collect it\nI see the bodies of wack MCs let me inspect it\nYou hear this shit and you gotta

a bitch off if she tries to steal my fucking resume, dawg!\nYeah, shit spitting in circles of nervous, attention, and criminals  confused about the power spoken out the uvula.....\nThose dots were for a pause on the beat if I screwed up and left my richest rhymes in locker, think that I forgot the code again\nSometimes i'm tired of being the ultimate and undefeated rap battler at my school\nBecause of what I spit automatic sunk Titanic number two, if I feel blue don't mean I always sing blues, double entendre\nToo messed up to think straight with the doctor, that a triple enten- DRE!\nKnow y'all

taught from him, guess i'm spitting as his offspring and i'm Drake's younger brother\nSo I should follow in there footsteps, it's 8:08 but where the bass at??? Continuing to build a Martian mask for my rock band\nThe man that has a verse after me named @Translucent and y'all might think I'm a nuisance to look into future\nAnd knew who the next verse was but the truth is I keep adding verses when turning superior\nJust like something I never saw, I don't wanna make a scene!\nPockets running empty but my money grows on trees!\nSomeone annotate my lyrics, justify the means\nTwist it if you want to, it'll haunt you in your dreams!\n\n\n[Verse 51: YoDawg111]\nOne verse to make it up top with the GOATs\nI\u2019ll give you my two cents with my cock in your girl\u2019s throat\nDeath multiplies by threes.
