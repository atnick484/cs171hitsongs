one to put it on your money\nI'm the one that make it happen it to you niggas, would you fuck around and do it for me?\n[Chorus: Tory Lanez]\nYeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty

player?\nShould've known it was litty when bitches start lyin' on my dick\nLie on that pussy like I hit\nCan't even be a side, side bitch\nI'm hittin' 9s, 10s, and you ain't even looking like you a 5\nBroke bitches tryna do it for Twitter, when they used to do it for Vine, woah!\nI'm the man of the hour, I'm the nigga with the airtime\nRolls Royce Wraith, put your bitch up in the stars like she in the airline\nNiggas talkin' 'bout my hair line, I laugh about it, I be feelin' them\nSee, we both be making M's: they be makin' memes, I be makin' millions\nI just counted up a Quentin Miller\nA \"QM\", that's a quarter milli\nThey don't wanna see Jae drop \"6,\" fly private when he go to Philly\nFunny money, yeah I know it's silly, but your ho feel me\nWhen I pull up and I got a pour a whole four on it\nI promise she gon' know it's litty, motherfucker, yeah\nYou might also like[Chorus: Tory Lanez]\nYeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again\nFly out a bitch from the

Paisley, Keith Urban, Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]\nAlmost heaven, West Virginia\nBlue ridge mountain, Shenandoah river\nLife is old there, older than the trees\nYounger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze\n\n[Chorus: Little Big Town, Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert\nBlake Shelton & George Strait]\nCountry roads, take me home\nTo the place I belong\nWest Virginia, mountain mama\nTake me home, country roads\n[Verse 2: Kacey Musgraves, Eric Church, Ronnie Milsap, Charley Pride, Dierks Bentley & Trisha Yearwood]\nIf I should stay\nAll my memories, they gather 'round her\nI would only be in your way\nA miner's lady, stranger to blue water\nSo I'll go, yet I know\nDark and dusty, painted on the sky\nI'll think of you every step of the way\nMisty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eye\n\n[Chorus: Lady Antebellum, Blake Shelton, George Strait, Darius Rucker & Martina McBride]\nCountry roads, take me home\nTo the place I belong\n(I will always love you)\nWest Virginia, mountain mama\nTake me home, country roads\n\n[Bridge: Jason Aldean, Rascal Flatts & Willie Nelson]\nOn the road again\nLike a band of gypsies, we go down the highway\nWe're the best of friends\nInsisting that the world keep turning our way\nAnd our way\n\n[Chorus: Brooks and Dunn, Alabama, Darius Rucker, Little Big Town, Brett Eldredge & Keith Urban]\nCountry roads (Country roads), take me home (Take me home)\nTo the place I belong\n(I will always love you)\nWest Virginia, mountain mama\n(Will always love you)\nOh, take me home, country roads\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Reba McEntire, Alan Jackson & Vince Gill]\nOh, I hope life treats you kind\nAnd I hope you have all you've dreamed of\nI wish you joy and happiness\nBut above all this, I wish you love\n\n[Chorus: Carrie Underwood, Brad Paisley, Martina McBride, Little Big Town, Dierks Bentley, Kacey Musgraves, Trisha Yearwood, Tim McGraw, Alan Jackson, Luke Bryan, Keith Urban, Faith Hill, Eric Church, Brett Eldredge, Ronnie Milsap, Reba McEntire, Miranda Lambert & Dolly Parton]\nAnd I will always love you\nI will always love you\nTake me home, country roads\nTake me home, country roads\nAnd I will always love you\nOn the road again\nI will always love you\nI just can't wait to get on the road again\nCountry roads\nThe life I love is makin' music with my friends\nI will always love you\nI can't wait to get on the road again\nTake me home, country roads\nI will always love you\nI'll always love you3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/2465509", "artist_names": "Chris Brown",

Lyrics[Intro: DMX]\nWhat these bitches want from a nigga?\n\n[Verse 1: Drake]\nOn some DMX shit\nI group DM my exes\nI tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever\nAnd I think we just get closer when we not together\nYou tell me that I'm confusin'\nMore immature than Marques Houston\nCuts too deep for a band-aid solution\nWe too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me\nLOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'\nHeard a lot about me 'fore we started off\nI know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras\nI know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars\nThat's why she always correctin' me when my time is off\nAnd my house is the definition\nOf alcohol and weed addiction\nYou got a different vision\nYou wanna walk around naked in the kitchen\nWithout runnin' into one of my niggas\nThat's not the way we livin'\nToo much goin' on, it's just not realistic\nThese days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em\nAnd you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people\nBut every time we speakin'\n[Chorus: Drake]\nIt's like a lot of games bein' played\nHow's it goin' down?\nIf it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now\nIs you wit' me or what?\nYeah\nIt's like a lot of games are bein' played\nHow's it goin' down?\nIf it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now\nIs you wit' me or what?\nYeah\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nI wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs\nWhere you're getting me\nAll that grey in our conversation history, you\nPlayin' mind games, when you sayin' things\nPlayin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing\nSlide on a late night\nYou like to slide on a late night\nYou sent a \"Are you here?\" text without an invite\nThat's that shit that I don't like\nWe both slide on a late night\nDo things in our off time\nWe both, yeah\nMade some mistakes, pon road\nYeah, how's that for real?\nYou toyin' with it like Happy Meal\n3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still\nWhile you're typin', make sure you tell me\nSee Drake

livin' at The London for a month\nService elevator up to 4201\nWe was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front\nGirl, I had your back when all you used to do was front\nThat's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'\nTime got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different\nI'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things\nAct like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'\nUnderstand I got responsibilities to people that I need\nAnd on my way to make this dough\nA lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow\nA lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow\nOhhh, ohhh\nTryna give your ass the world\nYou runnin' your fingers through my curls\nYou knew me when the kid had waves\nBut that's enough of that\nYou could never say I came up and forgot about your ass\nAnd that's some real shit91Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 8, "api_path": "/songs/2463392", "artist_names": "Drake", "full_title": "Fire &

home\nSpare my sins for the ark, I was too slow to depart\nI'm a cad, but I'm not a fraud, I've set out to serve the Lord\nAnd my heart was colder when you'd gone\nAnd I lost my head but found the one

every night you seen the same thing\nMoney wall to wall, young famous nigga, spend it all\nWhen you die you can't take it with ya\nBottle of Rose if I\u2019m drinking with ya\nCause most niggas is broke, they bank is injured\nThem bitches gonna ride with who they think\u2019s a winner\nAnd I'll be smiling in case they take a picture\nOh, I'm smoking weed, drinking liquor, make a hundred\nOn a show spend it all on my niggas\nWhen I go shopping I tell them pick one\n'Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision\nAlways about my business, don\u2019t play the cards\nI talked to the niggas who dealed them, uhh\nRoyal flush, now look up them niggas and baby girl you see us, yeah\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day?\nI'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away\n'Cause I can\u2019t take it when I\u2019m gone, gone, gone, gone\nNo I can't take it when I\u2019m gone, gone, gone\nI\u2019m gonna spend it all why wait for another day\nI\u2019ma take all this

car, they wanna feel that maximum speed\nNever had an absence of weed\nTired of being at the bar, everything Louie V\nPlus the most exclusive tree in my jar\nMaking my bank, spending it all\nAnd that expensive shit you paid for, she had it on\nShe taking it off, most of these niggas just talk, ain't caking at all\nBack in the day money was short, I\u2019m making it taller\nYou know what I mean, some say it\u2019s a problem\nBlowings my greens, not saving my collards\nNo NBA, they say I\u2019m a baller\nLive for today, stunt like my father\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day?\nI'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away\nCause I can\u2019t take it when I\u2019m gone, gone, gone, gone\nNo I can\u2019t take it when I\u2019m gone, gone, gone\nI\u2019m

you care to try your luck you can buy a seat for 15 bucks\nYou can call to raise or you can check and fold them\nI like five card stud but it is mostly Texas hold 'em\n\n[Chorus]\nMusic is playing up and down the block\nMostly Christian blues, country folk and southern rock\nIt's our little piece of paradise way out here in the woods\nThere is always something going on down in the trailerhood\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy new tattoos and farmer tans, rodeo and nascar fans\nDallas Cowboy football on TV\nWhen the storm starts getting bad, you hear the those sirens humming\nGrab a six pack and a lawn chair there is a tornado coming\n\n[Chorus]\nMusic is playing up and down the block\nMostly Christian blues, country folk and southern rock\nIt's our little piece of paradise way out here in the woods\nThere is always something going on down in the trailerhood\n\n[Outro]\nI got her made in the shade with the moonshine lemonade\nThere is a party going on down in the trailerhoodYou might

mate and say \"I'm gonna be with you no matter what\"\nYou know what I'm saying? Fuck it, I did wrong, you did wrong too\nYou know what I'm saying?\nBut we gotta put up with each others shit\nAnd the easiest thing to do is leave, you dig?\nAnyway, check this out...\n[Verse 1]\nI don't want to lose this relationship\nSo we gotta stay strong, don't wanna move on\nI know you're sick and tired of the fussing and the fighting, and the cussing\nWell, I love you ... and you love me too\n\n[Hook]\nI did you wrong, you did me wrong\nI take you back, you take me back\nI did you wrong girl, you did me wrong girl\nI'll take you back, I'll take you back\nNo matter what you do\nNo matter what you say\nNo matter how far you go\nDon't take your love away\nBecause I love you\nAnd girl, I want you\nAnd girl, I need you\nSo let's just work it out\n\n[Verse 2]\nI ain't tryna waste your time\nAnd, I ain't tryna waste my time\nThere ain't no need to waste no time\nCause we done put in too much time\nI ain't tryna waste your time\nI ain't tryna waste my time\nAin't no need to waste no time\nCause we done put in too much time\nWhen you're in a relationship\nThe easiest thing for you to do\nIs to leave\nYou gotta stick it out, and work it out\nAnd stick it out, and work it out\nAnd stick it out\nCause at the end of the day...\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI did you wrong, you did me wrong\nI take you back, you take me back\nI did you wrong girl, you did me wrong girl\nI'll take you back, I'll take you back\nNo matter what you do\nNo matter what you say\nNo matter how far you go\nDon't take your love away\nBecause I love you\nAnd girl, I want you\nAnd girl, I need you\nSo let's just work it out\n\n[Bridge]\nI love you baby, I need you in my life\nYou know what I'm saying?\nI'm sick and tired of the arguing and all that good stuff\nI mean, I'm pleading on this track because I really really love you\nAnd, I really want us to work out\nYou know?

on your car\nI might even be a rockstar\nI might even be a rockstar\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes I wish when the phone rings\nThat it would be you saying, \"Let's hang out\"\nThen you confess that there's something special\nBetween us, why don't we find out?\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nBut you don't even know me\nGuess you don't need me\nWhy you're not seeing what you're missing?\nOn the outside shying away\nOn

land that I heard of\nOnce in a lullaby\n[Verse 2]\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nSkies are blue\nAnd our dreams, the dreams that you dare to dream\nReally do come true\n\n[Chorus]\nSomeday I'll wish upon a star\nAnd wake up where the clouds are far behind me\nWhere troubles melt like lemon drops\nAway above the chimney tops\nThat's where you'll find me\n\n[Verse 3]\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nBluebirds fly\nBirds fly over the rainbow\nThen why, then oh why, can't I?\n\n[Outro]\nIf happy little bluebirds fly\nBeyond the rainbow\nWhy, oh, why can't I?\nOh, hmmYou might also

pot of gold at the end of my rainbow\nBut I don't mind cause baby I got you\n\nThe rain keeps the flowers from dyin'\nThe sun lights the world when it shines\nThe midnight sky has a blanket of stars and a moon\nAnd baby I got you\nI can't imagine one day without you in it\nLife alone just wouldn't be worth livin'\nLove would be a wish that never came true\nLord knows I've got more than I deserve\nBut I don't question the prayer that I've had ansered\nI did something right cause\nBaby I got you\n\nThe rain keeps the flowers from dyin'\nThe sun lights the world when it shines\nThe midnight sky has a blanket of stars and a moon\nAnd baby I got you\n\nThe rain keeps the flowers from dyin'\nThe sun lights the world when it shines\nThe midnight sky has a blanket of stars and a
