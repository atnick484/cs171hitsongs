way\nBut there were planes to catch and bills to pay\nHe learned to walk while I was away\nAnd he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew\nHe'd say, \"I'm gonna be like you, Dad\nYou know I'm gonna be like you\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon\nLittle boy blue and the man on the moon\n\"When you comin' home, Dad?\"\n\"I don't know when, but we'll get together then\nYou know we'll have a good time then\"\n[Verse 2]\nMy son turned ten just the other day\nHe said, \"Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play\nCan you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today\nI got a lot to do.\" He said, \"That's okay\"\nAnd he walked away but his smile never dimmed\nIt said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah\nYou know I'm gonna be like him\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon\nLittle boy blue and the man on the moon\n\"When you comin' home, Dad?\"\n\"I don't know when, but we'll get together then\nYou know we'll have a good time then\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, he came from college just the other day\nSo much like a man I just had to say\n\"Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?\"\nHe shook his head and he said with a smile\n\"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys\nSee you later, can I have them please?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon\nLittle boy blue and the man on the moon\n\"When you comin' home, son?\"\n\"I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad\nYou know we'll have a good time then\"\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nI've long since retired, my son's moved away\nI called him up just the other day\nI said, \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind\"\nHe said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time\nYou see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu\nBut it's sure nice talking to you, Dad\nIt's been sure nice talking to you\"\nAnd as I hung up the phone it occurred to me\nHe'd grown up just like me\nMy boy was just like me\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon\nLittle boy blue and the man on the moon\n\"When you comin' home, son?\"\n\"I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad\nWe're gonna have a good time then\"17Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/141992", "artist_names": "Al Green", "full_title": "Sha-La-La (Make Me Happy)

wild time had just begun\nI guess you kind of scared yourself, you turn and run\nBut if you have a change of heart\n\n[Chorus]\nRikki, don't lose that number\nYou don't wanna call nobody else\nSend it off in a letter to yourself\nRikki, don't lose that number\nIt's the only one you own\nYou might use it if you feel better\nWhen you get home\n[Verse 2]\nI have a friend in town, he's heard your name\nWe can go out driving on Slow Hand Row\nWe could stay inside and play games, I don't know\nAnd you could have a change of heart\n\n[Chorus]\nRikki, don't lose that number\nYou don't wanna call nobody else\nSend it off in a letter to yourself\nRikki, don't lose that number\nIt's the only one you own\nYou might use it if you feel better\nWhen you get home\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nYou tell yourself you're not my kind\nBut you don't even know your mind\nAnd you could have a change of heart\n\n[Chorus]\nRikki, don't lose that number\nYou don't wanna call nobody else\nSend it off in a letter to yourself\nRikki, don't lose that number\nIt's the only one you own\nYou might use it if you feel better\nWhen you get home\nYou might also like[Outro]\nRikki, don't lose that number\n(Rikki,

stood I saw she was crying\nAnd through her tears I heard her say\n[Chorus:]\nBilly, don't be a hero\nDon't be a fool with your life\nBilly, don't be a hero\nCome back and make me your wife\n\nAnd as he started to go\nShe said, \"Billy, keep your head low.\"\nBilly, don't be hero\nCome back to me\n\n[Verse 2:]\nThe soldier blues were trapped on a hillside\nThe battle raging all around\nThe sergeant cried, \"We've got to hang on, boys!\nWe've got to hold this piece of ground.\"\n\nI need a volunteer to ride up\nAnd bring us back some extra men.\"\nAnd Billy's hand was up in a moment\nForgetting all the words she said\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nI heard his fiancee got a letter\nThat told how Billy died that day\nThe letter said that he was a hero\nShe should be

been before\nHe left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again\nYou might say he found a key for every door\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen he first came to the mountains, his life was far away\nOn the road and hangin' by a song\nBut the string's already broken and he doesn't really care\nIt keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long\n[Chorus]\nBut the Colorado Rocky Mountain high\nI've seen it rainin' fire in the sky\nThe shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby\nRocky Mountain high (Colorado)\nRocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)\n\n[Verse 3]\nHe climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below\nHe saw everything as far as you can see\nAnd they say that he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun\nAnd he lost a friend, but kept the memory\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow he walks in quiet solitude, the forests and the streams\nSeeking grace in every step he takes\nHis sight has turned inside himself to try and understand\nThe serenity of a clear blue mountain lake\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the Colorado Rocky Mountain high\nI've seen it rainin' fire in the sky\nTalk to God and listen to the casual reply\nRocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)\nRocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)\nYou might also like[Verse 5]\nNow his life is full of wonder, but his heart still knows some fear\nOf a simple thing he cannot comprehend\nWhy they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more\nMore people, more scars upon the land\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the Colorado Rocky Mountain high\nI've seen it rainin' fire in the sky\nThough he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly\nRocky Mountain high\n\n[Outro]\nColorado Rocky Mountain high\nI've seen it rainin' fire in the sky\nFriends around the campfire and everybody's high\nRocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)\nRocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)\nRocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)\nRocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)\nRocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)\nRocky Mountain high (High in

that's just the way the story goes\nYou always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows\nYes, it shows\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo, I can't forget tomorrow\nWhen I think of all my sorrow\nWhen I had you there but then I let you go\nAnd now it's only fair that I should let you know\nWhat you should know\n[Chorus]\nI can't live if living is without you\nI can't live, I can't give anymore\nI can't live if living is without you\nI can't give, I can't give anymore\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, I can't forget this evening\nOr your face as you were leaving\nBut I guess that's just the way the story goes\nYou always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows\nYes, it shows\n\n[Chorus]\nCan't live if living is without you\nI can't live, I can't give anymore\nI can't live if living is without you\nI can't live, I

soft shoe\nHe jumped so high, jumped so high\nThen he\u2019d lightly touch down\n\nI met him in a cell in New Orleans I was\nDown and out\nHe looked to me to be the eyes of age\nAs the smoke ran out\nHe talked of life, talked of life, laughed\nClicked his heels and stepped\nHe said his name \"Bojangles\" and he danced a lick\nAcross the cell\nHe grabbed his pants and feathered stance\nOh he jumped so high and then he clicked his heels\nHe let go a laugh, let go a laugh\nShook back his clothes all around\n\nMr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles\nMr. Bojangles, dance\n\nHe danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs\nThroughout the south\nHe spoke through tears of 15 years how his dog and him\nTraveled about\nThe dog up and died, he up and died\nAfter 20 years he still grieves\nHe said \"I dance now at every chance in honky tonks\nFor drinks and tips\nBut most the time I spend behind these county bars\nCause I drinks a bit\"\nHe shook his head, and as he shook his head\nI heard someone ask him please\n\nMr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles\nMr. Bojangles, dance...See The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like1Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

sweetly\nTonight the light of love is in your eyes\nBut will you love me tomorrow?\n\n[Verse 2]\nIs this a lasting treasure\nOr just a moment's pleasure?\nCan I believe the magic of your sighs?\nWill you still love me tomorrow?\n[Bridge]\nTonight with words unspoken\nYou say that I'm the only one\nBut will my heart be broken\nWhen the night (When the night)\nMeets the morning (Meets the morning)

heard the story of the hot rod race that fatal day\nWhen a Ford and a Mercury went out to play\nWell this is the inside story, and I'm here to say\nI was the kid that was drivin' that Model A\nIt's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up\nThat Model A body makes it look like a pup\nIt's got twelve cylinders; uses them all\nWith an overdrive, that just won't stall\nIts got a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust\n4.11 gears you can really get lost\nIt's got safety tubes, and I'm not scared\nThe brakes are good, and the tires are fair\nWe left San Pedro late one night\nThe moon and the stars was shinin' bright\nEverything went fine up the Grapevine Hill\nWe was passing cars like they was standing still\nAll of a sudden like a flick of an eye\nA Cadillac sedan had passed us by\nThe remark was made \"Theres the car for me\"\nBy then the taillight were all you could see\nNow the fellas ribbed me for bein' behind\nSo I started to make that Lincoln unwind\nI took my foot off the gas and man alive\nI shoved it on down into overdrive\nWound it up to a hundred-and-ten\nTwist the speedometer off at the end\nI had my foot feed clear to the floor\nSaid that's all there is and there ain't no more\nWent around a corner and I passed a truck\nI whispered a prayer just for luck\nFenders was clickin' the guardrail posts\nThe guys beside me were white as a ghost\nI guess that thought I'd lost my sense\nThe telephone poles looked like a picket fence\nThey said, \"Slow down! I see spots!\nThe lines on the road just look like dots.\"\nSmoke was rollin' out of the back\nWhen I started to gain on that Cadillac\nI knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass\nWhen I did I'd be short on gas\nWent arround a corner with the tires in the side\nYou could feel the tension, man what a ride\nI said, \"Hold on, I've got a license to fly\"\nAnd the Cadillac pulled over and let me by\nAnd then all of the sudden a rod started knockin'\nWhen down in the dips she started to rockin'\nI look in my mirror; and a red light was blinkin'\nCops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!\nWell they arrested me and put me in jail\nAnd called my pop to throw my bail\nHe said, \"Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'\nYou don't quit drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln!\"You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 502, "api_path": "/songs/141146", "artist_names": "James Joyce", "full_title": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe) by\u00a0James\u00a0Joyce", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "id": 141146, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 149810, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1654772452, "path": "/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-annotated", "pyongs_count": 10, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1922, "month": 2, "day": 2}, "release_date_for_display": "February 2, 1922", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 2, 1922", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 361, "hot": false, "pageviews": 50035}, "title": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe)", "title_with_featured": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe)", "updated_by_human_at": 1654772453, "url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/22971", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/98f10611fc0aa6a525b9fbcab2ffa297.1000x600x1.jpg", "id": 22971, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9997f2e769ef85b9f941405cac99d1af.570x570x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "James Joyce", "slug": "James-joyce", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/James-joyce"}, "artist": "James Joyce", "lyrics": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe) LyricsThe Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance.

Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube.

And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug?

It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall.

J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.)

He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.)

You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach.

You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.)

I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer.

The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs.

We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge!

It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported.

(She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S.

Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah.

Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.\n\nLYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.\n\n(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!\n\nBLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!\n\nBELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.\n\nBELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.\n\nLYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.\n\nZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.\n\nSTEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous.

Hillyho!\n\n(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)\n\nSIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!\n\n(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)\n\nTHE CROWD\n\nCard of the races.

The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!\n\nGARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.)

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.\n\n\nZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!\n\n\nFLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.\n\n\nBLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier.

Here! Hold on!

After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C.

I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.)

He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/172627", "artist_names": "Oliver Stone (Ft.

Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'\nThe prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a\nstiletto and in the empty black void we:\n\nCUT TO\n\nOpening Montage - Documentary Footage:\n2 THE DISEMBARKATION\nfrom the harbor in Mariel, Cuba. Vessels of every nature,\nwaving masses, demonstrations....\n\n3 THE CROSSING\nSun and storm.\n\n4 THE LANDING - KEY WEST\nThe flag of the United States. Choppers swooping over the ragged coastline of the Keys. Emerald waters dotted with fishing trawlers and pleasure craft, an \"America the Beautiful\"-type Immigration theme surging over this.\n\n5 THE PROCESSING\nLong lines. Immigration and Nationalization Officials, customs, Public Health, FBI, Church and Relief Organizations.\nBabies bawling, arguments over paperwork, refugees being\ninterviewed by TV news, people crying, people eating,\nfamilies huddled on floors... chaos.\nThe music theme continuing in stately calm as we:\n\nCUT TO\n6 INT.

We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we\nencompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --\nmuscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and\non the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.\nHe is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken\ncardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from\nprison.\n\nOver this:\n\nVOICE #1 (o.s.)\nOkay so what do you call yourself?\n\nVOICE #2 (o.s.)\nComo se llama?\n\nMONTANA\nTony Montana...you?\n\nVOICE #1\nWhere'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?\n\nMONTANA\nMy old man -- he was American.

No way.\n\nWe now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.\n\nMAN #l\n(checking off a list)\nYou been in a mental hospital, Tony?\n\nTONY\n(grinning)\nYeah, in the boat coming over.\n\nMAN #1\nHow 'bout homosexuality, Tony? You like men, y'like to dress up like a woman?\n\nTONY\n(to Man #2)\nNever tried it. What the fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he think I am?\n\nMAN #2\nJust answer the questions, Tony.\n\nThe voices of the men remain cool and collected throughout.\n\nTONY\n(to Man #1)\nFuck no.\n\nMAN #1\nArrested? Vagrancy? Marijuana?\n\nTONY\nNO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.\n\nHis eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)\nand he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the\ntips of the fingers. Man #3 is stepping forward out of the\nshadows.\n\nMAN #3\nSo where'd you get the beauty scar?\n\nTONY\nThis?..\n(scratching the scar, shrugs)\nI was a kid. You should see the other kid.\n(a grim chuckle)\n\nMAN #3\nAnd this?\n\nHe holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between the\nthumb and second finger -- a heart with the word \"Madre\"\nscaled through it.\n\nTONY\nOh that was for my sweetheart.\n\nMAN #3\nSweetheart?\n(to the other men)\nWe been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin\nor something. This one's new... You want to tell us, Montana or you want to take a little trip to the detention center?\n\nTONY\nHey, so I was in the can once for buying dollars. Big deal.\n\nMAN #3\nThat's pretty funny, Tony.\n\nTONY\nSome Canadian tourist....\n\nMAN #3\nWhat'd you mug him first? Get him outta here!\n(starts to walk out)\n\nTONY\nHey, so I fuck Castro, what's it to you? You a Communist or something?\nHow would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta! You want a stoolie on every block? You wanna work eight hours a day and you never own nothing? I ate octopus three times a day, fucking octopus is coming out my ears, fuckin' Russian shoes are eating through my feet. Whaddaya want? You want me to stay there? Hey, I'm no little whore, I'm no stinking thief! I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?\n\nSilence.\nThere's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but\nit falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.\n\nMAN #l\nCarter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?\n\nMAN #3\n(walking out)\nI... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him. A long look.\n\nTONY\nHey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings.\n\nMan #3 at the door stops, looks back.\n\nTONY\nSend me here, send me there. This.\nThat.

He takes the Baby Ruth out\nof Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then\nreturns the empty wrapper to Manny,\n\nTONY\nSo what'd you tell them?\n\nMANNY\nI told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.\n\nTONY\nI didn't tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.\n\nThe bus pulling out now.\n\nMANNY\nIs that what you told me? You didn't tell me that.\n\nTONY\nYou know if you hadn't opened your mouth, they woulda thought you were a horse. I told you to tell them you had TB and was cured.\n\nMANNY\nFuck you Tony....\n\nTONY\nYou did nothing right. I shoulda left you in Cuba.\n\n7-B EXT.

TONY'S TENT - FREEDOMTOWN - NIGHT (SIX MONTHS LATER) 8\n\nA movie projector...\n...the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid. We're watching a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra-Madre. It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking to himself just before the bandits get him....\n\nThe rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,\nthe camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,\neyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.\n\nBOGART\nWhat a thing.\nConscience. Conscience.\nIf you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you? Makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense.\nTime to go to sleep.\n(closes his eyes\nbut not for long)\n\nCUT TO\n\n9 INT.

Hunh? Like me....\n\nHe hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,\nimitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with\nzig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,\nTony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a\npop button pinned to his shirt that says \"Fuck Off and Die.\"\nAnd his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence\nmore pronounced.\n\nTONY\n. . . don't trust nobody.\n\nMANNY\nYeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.\n\nTONY\nNever happen to me, Chico. That's one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that.\n\nMANNY\nYeah, how do you know....\n\nTONY\nI know.\n\nMANNY\nI don't know. Sometimes you crazy, too, Tony.\n\nTONY\nAssholes, I go crazy. You Manny, I never go crazy with you. You're\nlike my brother, I love you!\n\nMANNY\nYeah, sure.\n\nTONY\nHey, c'mon.\n\nTony playfully punches Manny and they walk on into the humid night, intersecting a young punk, Chi-Chi.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(to Manny; Spanish)\nHey Manny.\n\nMANNY\nOye Chi-Chi, what's going down.\n\nCHI-CHI\nUsual shit. Want some peanuts? Pago's carrying tonight.\n\nMANNY\nI don't know, I get all fucked up on it....\n\nCHI-CHI\nWant some new snatch?

It talks.\n\nAs they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head\nfor Manny. \"Later.\"\n\nHe's in the middle of the \"Boulevard\" where a bustling black\nmarket in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transvestites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack neon.\n\nHe ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,\npast a \"Viva Carter!\" proclamation in graffiti....\n\nTRANSVESTITE\n(passing)\nWhat about you sugar -- you wanna party?\n\nTONY\n(passing her)\nYeah with whose cock, honey?\n\nCUT TO\n\n10 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN GROUNDS - NIGHT 10\nTony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in, trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.\n\nTony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone\nnumber written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he\nfinishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see\na young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,\nstanding together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in\nshadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with\nhandling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone\nrings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have\nnot yet seen in Tony.\n\nSomeone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His\nexpression alters to uncertainty.\n\nVOICE\nYes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?\n\nTony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those\nin line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony\nignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his\npants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.\n\nHe walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes\nsomebody in another phone booth and goes over.\n\nAngel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on\nthe phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a\nworn phone book in his hand.\n\nTONY\nAngel, how ya doin'?\n\nANGEL\nYou know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of 'em to find my brother!\n\nTONY\n(in passing)\nDon't waste your dime, Chico. You know your brother hates you.\n\nANGEL\nGo fuck yourself, Tony.\n\nManny catches up to Tony.\n\nTONY\nWhatcha hanging around with that hustler for?\n\nMANNY\nHey Chi-Chi's okay, he hears things,\n\nTONY\nWhat's he hear I don't hear.\n\nAngel comes over, listens.\n\nMANNY\nHe hears we got problems. Immigration is having these hearings, y ' know? And they're saying nine out of ten of us is gonna get shipped back!\n\nTONY\nOh yeah?\n\nMANNY\nYeah.

You think they're gonna let us out? They're gonna throw away the key, that's what.\n\nANGEL\nOh shit!\n\nMANNY\nWhat's I say. This is gonna end bad, muchachos....\n\nTONY\nHey, I tell you guys this isn't Cuba here, this is the United States. They got nothing but lawyers here. We're on the television. We're in the newspapers. Whatta they gonna do -- ship us back to Cuba? Castro-- he don't want us. Nobody no place wants us so whatta they gonna do -- put us in a gas chamber so all the people can see? They're stuck with us, Chico -- they gotta let us go!\n\nMANNY\nYeah, well, what if we gotta sit here another six months, hunh?\n\nTONY\nYou worry too much, mi hermano. Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh?\n\nTony winks and walks off.\n\nThe radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.\n\nTONY\n(in awful imitation)\n'Oh yeah America! Love-to love you baby, oh yeah!'\n\nCUT TO\n\n11 EXT.

PROCESSING ROOM - DAY - A MONTH LATER\n\nAn Immigration Officer passes a sheaf of documents across a desk into a pair of hands. The camera gliding along a Green Card pinned to the top of the stack.\n\nIt says \"ANTHONY MONTANA\" and it has picture and stamps. It's official, as the camera moves with triumphant immigration theme music to the face of Mr. Montana examining quite contentedly the rewards of his efforts.\n\nEnd of montage.

DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY\nThe new Miami is rising ubiquitously above Biscayne Bay,\nthe camera moving past blossoming skyscrapers, workmen,\nhuge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a\nbeautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white\nclouds... past a giant billboard:\n\nHOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?\nCOME TALK TO US...\nAT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...\nTODAY!\n\nPast banks of glass (Caribank, Banco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...\n\nInsert a car sticker going by with the image of the American flag and the reminder: \"Will the last American leaving Miami please bring flag?\"\n\nTony and Manny bop along the street in their hand-me-down\nclothes, oogling the chicas and the bodegas (in a plush\nmodern area of Miami). Boats. Buildings. Cars.\n\nTONY\n(looking around)\nBoy -- can you believe this place, Chico?\n\nMANNY\n(Spanish)\nMan, they weren't kidding around.\n\nTONY\n(pointing to a little old man walking towards them)\nSee that old guy over there?\n\nMANNY\nYeah.\n\nTONY\nMillionaire.\n\nMANNY\nHow do you know?\n\nTONY\nGo over there.

You wanna score one of these chicks, watch me. Mira!\n\nHe wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small\nwhirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in\nthe flick of an eye.\n\nTONY\n...the fuck was that?\n\nMANNY\nYou didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.\n\nDoes it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head\npeeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.\n\nTONY\nWhat the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin'.\n\nMANNY\nYou think so hunh? Well you don't know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.\n\nDoes it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window.\n\nMANNY\n(doing it again)\nTakes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it....\n\nTONY\nOooh... cono! How 'bout that one?\n\nPointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.\n\nMANNY\nNo problem.\n\n27-B EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY\nTony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arm\nand stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't\ngive a shit.\n\nTONY\nCome on?\n\nManny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a\ncar screeching to a halt in front of him.\n\nTONY\n(points)\nOkay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.\n\nThe blonde has paused to look in a shop window.\n\nManny stops alongside, pretends to look. When he catches\nher eyes, he flicks his tongue.\n\nShe looks at him, confused, then back into the window.\nManny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.\n\nTony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber\nchild, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his\nown version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at\nhim puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now\nsmiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles\nand moves along.\n\nMeanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face\nand walks away.\n\nTony walks over to him, mocking.\n\nTONY\nPobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up.\nThis country first you gotta get the money, then you get\nthe power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls. Por los conjones.\n\nMANNY\nThere you go talking big again man. You don't know shit about the world. Who was it got us the green card, who got us the friends with the connections, hunh -- who's getting us a job? You or me? Not you man. You lucky you have any friends.

It combines the social functions of a family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night watering hole for various beasts of prey.\n\nThe waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths\nto the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The\ncamera following past the pots and the pans and the steam\nand the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of\nthis dungeon....\n\n. . . To reveal Tony Montana stubbing grease off the pots and\nManny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and\nexhausted. A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes\nto the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.\n\nTONY\nYour big shot friend better come up with something soon. I didn't come to America to break my fucking back, querido.\n\nMANNY\n(equally irritated)\nHey he's coming okay! What do you want?\n\nCUT TO\n\n29 INT./EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT - HOURS LATER\nWe are looking through a cubbyhole at the diners. Young\nCuban guys with chiquitas drift in with their fancy clothes,\ndiamonds and -- the mark of status -- large bodyguards.\nThey're out front with the flash, shaking hands with friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.\n\nStaring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and\nManny, wiping the sweat off their faces with towels.\n\nMANNY\nLook at that chick man, wow! Look at them knockers.\n\nTONY\nYeah, look at the punk with her.\nWhat's he got that I don't got?\n\nMANNY\nHe's good-looking that's what, look at his clothes, flash Chico, pizzazz!

PARKING LOT OUTSIDE LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nOmar Suarez (El Mono -- \"The Monkey\") is so named cause he\nlooks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish\nintelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing\nbetween words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor... with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.\n\nMANNY\n(leaning in the window)\nHey Omar, Waldo, coma esta... my friend I told you about. Tony Montana... Omar Suarez, Waldo Rojas....\n\nWaldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move back to Manny.\n\nOMAR\nI got something for you.\n\nMANNY\nOh yeah! That's great... What do we gotta do?\n\nOMAR\nWe gotta unload a boat -- grass, twenty-five tons -- that's what we gotta do.

What was the Rebenga hit -- game of dominoes or somethin'? You're talkin' to important guys here.\n\nMANNY\n(shocked)\nHey Tony, c'mon, it's okay Omar, we...\n\nTONY\nShaddup!\n\nOmar sniggers, his eyes shifting to Waldo who shakes his\nhead and laughs.\n\nOMAR\n(to Manny only)\nSo what's it with this dishwasher, Chico? Don't he think we coulda gotten some other space cadet to do Rebenga -- cheaper maybe. Fifty bucks?\n\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nSo why didn't you? And who the fuck you calling a dishwasher, I'll wipe your monekyshit ass all up and down this Boulevard.\n\nSteps forward. Manny grabs him.\n\nMANNY\nHey! -- Tony, Tony....\n\nIn the car, Omar looks over at Waldo.\n\nOMAR\nGuy's a lunatic, let's go.\n\nWALDO\nWhat about them Indians ---\n\nThe idea crosses Omar's mind, He buys it, somewhat amused.\n\nOMAR\nYeah...\n(back to Tony)\nAll right, smart ass, you wanna make some big bucks?

You get the money then. Something happens to the money, pobrecito, and my boss' gonna stick your head up your asses faster'n a rabbit gets fucked.\n\nThrows the remains of his cigarette at their feet and pulls the Coupe De Ville out of the lot.\n\nTONY\nI'm scared.\n\nMANNY\n(relieved)\nTony you're pushin' your luck.\n\nTONY\n(walking away)\nYou worry too much Manny -- you' re gonna get yourself a heart attack one of these days.\n\nMANNY\n(catching up)\nYeah, so who are these Colombians?\n\nTONY\nSo what does it matter?\n\nMANNY\nSo whatcha have that look on for when Omar bring it up?\n\nTony strips off his greasy apron.\n\nTONY\nSo nothin'.

MIAMI BEACH - DAY - MOVING SHOT\nThe somewhat run-down, art-deco cheaper hotels of South\nMiami Beach. The porches are filled with senior citizens\nplaying cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the\nstreet.\n\nThe ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,\nrattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,\njacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and\nneeding paint. You'd arrest these guys on sight.\n\n32 INT./EXT. TONY'S CADILLAC - MIAMI BEACH - DAY\nseen from the inside of the sedan. Tony turns down the salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette tensely. Manny is driving. In the dilapidated backseat are Angel, the baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.\n\nManny, reflecting the tension, whistles a rapid series of notes under his breath as he waits for a light to change.\n\nMANNY\nHey look at that chick, hunh? Lookit those tits man, she's begging for it!\n\nAt the curb, an old crone hunchbacks her way in front of the teenage chick, who is coming off the beach in a bikini, blocking her off.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(looking over)\nWhatta you crazy? She's 103 years old.\n\nMANNY\nNot her stupido! Her....\n\nCamera revealing the teenager.\n\nTONY\n(the light changing)\nDrive, willya.\n\nMANNY\n(mocking)\nSure, sure. Not to worry, Tony -- You get a heart attack.\n(looking in the rearview mirror)\nAngel, whatcha wearing the face for?\n\nANGEL\n(tense, making light of it)\nAh, it's okay. I just y'know forgot to make an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.\n\nMANNY\nYou still going to that cuncha?\n\nANGEL\nShe knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and Chango like nobody y'ever heard.\n\nAs he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around\nhis neck -- Chango, God of Fire and Thunder, his black face\ntilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes\nrolling in orgasmic imagery, his head crowned with gold.\nMany of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,\nalso pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red\nand white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-\nbangled bracelets, etc., all relating to their Afro-Catholic\nspiritualism.\n\nMANNY\n(making fun)\nYeah, Chango looking out for us,\n\nCHI-CHI\nAngel?\n\nANGEL\nChango looking out for all the 'bandidos' everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y'know. You gotta let him know you respect him. You don't, Chango -- he gets pissed an'...\n\nTONY\n(angry)\nHey, shaddup -- all of ya! I told you before I don't go for that mystical voodoo shit. That's for the old cunchas waving their rooster cocks in some dark alley, There's no gods, there's no Chango -- nowhere! You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.\n\nSilence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.\n\nTONY\nOkay, this is it. Pull over across the street.\nThe motel is coming closer in silence.\n\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nMoney stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?\n\nANGEL\nSure thing.\n\nAs Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10\nmachine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches\nof kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it\ncan be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:\n\nTONY\nLet's go....\n\nCUT TO\n\n33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nTony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior\ncorridor to a room marked \"9\". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.\nPause.\n\n34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, \"The Toad\". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.\n\nTOAD\nHey, oye amigo....\n\nSpreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.\n\n35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nTony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and\nblue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.\n\nTONY\n(as he steps in)\nHow you doing amigo...?\n\nThe other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark\nColombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, \"The Lizard\"; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.\n\nThe Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.\n\nTONY\n(checking out the room)\nMind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?\n\nToad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,\nthe conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.\n\nTOAD\nSure, no problem... This is Marta.\n\nTONY\nHello, Marta.\nShe nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the\ntelevision set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists\nintermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.\n\nTOAD\nI'm Hector...\n\nPause.\n\nTONY\nYeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.\n\nTOAD\nYeah, Omar's okay.\n\nTONY\nYou know Omar.\n\nTOAD\nOmar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.\n\nTONY\nOkay...\n\nTOAD\nOkay... so you got the money?\n\nTONY\nYeah, you got the stuff?\n\nTOAD\nSure I got the stuff, but I don't\ngot it right here with me.

The Lizard staring at him...\n\nTOAD\nNot far.\n\nPause. Everything seems okay.\n\nTONY\nSo what do we do, walk in and start over?\n\nTOAD\n(changes subject)\nWhere you from?\n\nTony's eyes check out the bathroom.\n\nTONY\nWhat fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?\n\nTOAD\nI like to get to know who I do business with.\n\nIt's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a\nmove somewhere off-center and is now sitting on the bed,\ncoiled and always watching.\n\nTONY\nYou get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.\n\nTOAD\nHey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't...\n\nTONY\nOkay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?\n\n36 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThere's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then\ncommotion.\n\nANGEL\nTony!\n\nTony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening\nfemale shriek, like a bird.\n\nLIZARD\n(slang Spanish)\nDon't! Get up! Now shithead!\n\nShe's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to shoot.\n\nThe Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony. Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more\nColumbians, \"The Kids\".\n\nThey slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang.\n\nAs Toad strips the handgun from Tony:\n\nTONY\nFrog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead.\n\nToad shrugs, he couldn't care less.\n\nTOAD\nYeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?\n\nTONY\nTry sticking your head up your ass.\nSee if it fits.\n\nToad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto\ntaped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something\nin hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel\ninto the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.\nEven more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now\npulls out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begins\nassembling it as Lizard, still covering Tony with her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, ironically not in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n37 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\n\nChi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across\nthe street.

Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.\n\nTony, covered by the two kids, watches from the lip of the\nbathroom. He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their\npistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.\nAngel looks at Tony; the eyes between them steady. They're\ndead and they know it.\n\nToad, well-prepared, connects a voltage adapter and extension cord.\n\nTOAD\n(to Tony)\nYou watch what happens to your friend okay? If you don't want this to happen to you, you get the money.\n\nLizard reenters the room, shakes her head at the Toad who\nnods and turns on the whirring machine.\n\nThe Toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly\ntowards Angel.\n\nThe two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at his\nbrains... Off-camera, we know what's happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.\n\nLizard has no expression on her face. The machine cuts off.\n\nThe Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his shirt, examining his first cut like a butcher. He glances at Tony.\n\nTOAD\nNow the leg, hunh?\n\nA brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.\n\nCUT TO\n\n41 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with\nChi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel. They\nsignal and separate.\n\nCUT TO\n\n42 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.\n\nTony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.\n\nTOAD\nOkay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me.\n\nHe nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel\nlying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of\nhis blood, piss dead.\n\nCUT TO\n\n43 EXT.

In the background, the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.\n\nIn sharp foreground, the Lizard crumples forward on her knees, foaming blood.\n\nTony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram.\n\nIn the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical, gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.\n\nChi-Chi, climbing through the window, fires at him.\n\nMeanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces\na knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol.\n\nHe blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.\n\nTony, yelling, whirls after the Toad.\n\nTONY\nI got him!\n\nManny, holding his side, empties his pistol on kid one, who is still twitching.\n\nChi-Chi sees Angel, gags.\n\nCUT TO\n46 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY 46\nThe senior citizens, playing Mahjong on the porch, mutter\nin astonishment, as the Toad staggers out into the parking lot, blood flying, chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.\n\nTheir eyes follow.\n\nAs Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.\nThere's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all\nthat counts. He stands behind the Toad.\n\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nYour turn, cabron!\n\nThe Toad whips around to the voice, eyes stark with terror.\n\nTony empties the clip into the Toad, blowing him apart.\n\nThe bystanders just stare, stunned by the ferocity. Then\nan old lady faints.\n\nThe Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony\nturns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his\naudience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance\nand the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identification.\n\nCUT TO\n\n47 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nTony intersects Manny holding his side, with Chi-Chi.\n\nTONY\nManny, you okay?\n\nManny nods.\n\nTONY\nChi-Chi, get the car. Fast!\n\nCHI-CHI\nSi!\n\n48 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM\nTony strides into the shambles of Room 9, past the bodies\nand busted furniture to the suitcase on the bed from which\nthe Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in the corner.\n\nInside are several kilo-sized stacks of cocaine.\n\nHe shuts the suitcase, exits, stops, looks in the bathroom at the corpse of Angel off-camera. He goes, stoops, brings Angel's Change charm into our view, fingers it, tosses it back in the tub. He goes.\n\nCUT TO\n49 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\n\nChi-Chi has the sedan waiting in the parking lot. Tony\nhurries out, jumps in, the car speeding off. (Pisalo hasta la tabla -- Step on it.)\n\nPast the senior citizens who are retreating inside their\nrooms.\n\nThe camera swinging to hold on the blue and black Monte Carlo disappearing into the traffic of the Strip as two cop cars\ncome screaming past them from the opposite direction.\n\nCUT TO\n50 EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - PHONE BOOTH - DUSK\nThe booth is in the busy parking lot, Tony on the phone, Chi-Chi and Manny wait in the sedan.\n\nTONY\nYeah, bunch of cowboys! ...somebody fucked up Omar.\n\nOMAR'S VOICE\n(shaken)\nLook, let me check it out right away!\n\nTONY\nYou do that, Omar, you do that.\n\nOMAR'S VOICE\nYou got the money?\n\nTONY\nYeah -- and I got the yeyo.\n\nOMAR'S VOICE\nYou got the yeyo?

He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.\n\nLOPEZ\nHow ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet you. How 'bout a drink?\n\nTONY\nMr. Lopez... real pleasure.\n\nLOPEZ\nCall me Frank, Tony. Everybody calls me Frank. My Little League team, even the prosecutors 'round town, they all call me Frank.\n\nTONY\nOkay Frank.\n\nFrank shakes hands with Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\nHowya doing?\n\nMANNY\n(awed)\n...Fine yeah.\n\nTONY\nManny Ray, he was with us on the job.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Manny)\nI hear you caught one?\n\nManny shrugs, works his arm, showing us the wound doesn't bother him too much.\n\nMANNY\nJust the flesh. Went right through.\n\nLOPEZ\n(heading for the bar)\nYeah, Omar here tells me good things about you boys.\n\nTONY\n(glances at Omar)\nYeah. Omar's terrific.\n\nLOPEZ\nNot to mention of course the nice job you guys did for me on that Commie sonufabitch Emilio Rebenga.\n\nTONY\nYou don't have to mention it. That was fun.\n\nLOPEZ\n(smiles, likes the kid's balls)\nScotch? Gin? Rum?\n\nTONY\nGin's fine.\n\nLOPEZ\n(pouring)\nYeah, I need a guy with steel in his balls. I need him close to me, a guy like you Tony -- and your compadre here.\n\nTONY\nYeah... well.\n\nStill a little overwhelmed by the opulence of the place, his clothes feeling narrow and cheap on him, Tony steps forward and puts the suitcase up on the bar with the gin, which Lopez passes to him, eyeing the suitcase.\n\nTONY\n...that's it. That's the two keys. Angel died 'cause of this shit. And here's the money.\n(produces the money)\nIt's my gift to you -- from me.\n\nPause. Lopez shakes his head, sighs.\n\nLOPEZ\nIt's too bad about your friend, Tony, if people'd do business the right way, there'd be no fuckups like this....\n\nHe glances hard at Omar who squirms.\n\nWithout opening it, Lopez signals the bodyguard who takes\nthe suitcase and the money from under Tony's nose.\n\nLOPEZ\nDon't think I don't appreciate this gesture, Tony. You find in this business, you stay loyal you move up and you move up fast. Salud!\n\nThey drink the toast. With their eyes.\n\nLOPEZ\nThen you find out your biggest head ache's not bringing in the stuff but figuring out what to do with all the goddamn cash.\n(drinks)\n\nTONY\nYeah, I hope I have that problem someday.\n\nLopez looks, distracted., down the corridor from which he came, to Ernie, the bodyguard.\n\nLOPEZ\nWhere the hell's Elvira? Go get her, will you, Ernie?\n\nThe big bodyguard exits smoothly.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to the others)\nThe broad spends half her life dressing, the other half undressing.\n\nTONY\nI guess you gotta catch her in the middle, hunh?\n\nLopez laughs.\n\nLOPEZ\nYeah. When she's not looking. What do you say guys, to a little food?\n(finishes his drink at his impatient pace)\n\nTONY\nYeah sure, I could eat a horse.\n\nERNIE\nHere she comes, Mr. Lopez.\n\nTONY looks up, his eyes tumbling on the most beautiful blonde he's ever seen. The lady, is coming down the glassed-in elevator, adjusting her $10,000 Yves St. Laurent burgundy dinner dress.\n\nLOPEZ\nOooh sweetheart, you look like a million bucks.\n\nShe doesn't answer, her eyes flicking disinterestedly over to Tony and Manny, knowing what the evening's going to be and not too happy about it.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE**\nLOPEZ\nWhere you been baby, it's ten o'clock, I'm hungry.\n\nELVIRA\nYou're always hungry, you should try starving.\n\nLopez laughs.\n\nLOPEZ\nI want you to meet a friend of mine.\nTony Montana...

I got nothing but friends.\n\nELVIRA\nYou never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.\n\nNeatly avoiding his intended smooch, she slips by him towards the door, her throat flashing a $20,000 strip of jewelry.\n\nELVIRA\nCome on, Frank, let's go.\n\nTracking a cool, polished hauteur, she exits the apartment.\n\nLopez, after a pause, snaps at his men.\n\nLOPEZ\nOkay, let's go.\n\nCUT TO\n54 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nWe know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them\nout of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Corniches in a long snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.\n\n55 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nThe interior is built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games, computers and a restaurant. It's a lavish fun spot that will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of South America.\n\nThe crowd, a combination of Caucasian and Latin, is mostly\nyoung, rich and happy and a lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses, trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they dance to a black American music beat, \"Celebrating\" or \"Partying Down Tonight\".\n\nThe waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel\nhats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose\nand high heels.\n\nRich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their\nnecks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.\n\nDown at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and\ntough-looking tank tops with \"Motherfuckah\" and \"Fuck Me\"\nwritten on them. Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to pick one of them up.\n\nMANNY\nSo whaddaya say, hunh?\n\nHe flashes his tongue. She looks at him, amused.\n\nCHICK\nYou got a buck?\n\nMANNY\nSure I got a buck, whaddaya think I am, poor?\n\nCHICK\n(indicates the machine)\nPut it in, let's play.\n\nMANNY\nI had other things in mind.\n\nCHICK\nYou check out on this and we'll talk about other things.\n\nMANNY\n(looks off, concerned, then confronts the complex machine)\nFuck, how do you play this thing?\n\nCUT TO\n56 INT. BABYLON CLUB 56\nFrank Lopez, intoxicated, takes his heart pill with a slug\nof champagne. He sits next to Tony, who is agog at all this wealth. Omar and Ernie look on. Elvira is in conversation with a girl friend who has stopped by. They're sitting at the best table in the place, finishing up a giant meal. The empty spot belongs to Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nOver there that's Ronnie Echeverria.\nHim and his brother Miguel, they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson....\n\nTheir point of view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent looking man in conversation with a party of people.\n\nLOPEZ\nThat guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar Gomez. Bad news. Stone killer there ever was one. Stay away.\n\nTheir point of view -- Gaspar Gomez at a table with another\nguy and gorgeous woman.\n\nLOPEZ\n...the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho Contreras -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know it to look at him but he's got more cash than anybody in here. A real haza....\n\nTheir point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.\n\nLOPEZ\n. ..you know what a haza is, Tony?\n\nTONY\n'Haza'? No Frank, what's a haza?\n\nLOPEZ\nIt's Yiddish for pig. It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it! Lesson number one -- don't underestimate the other guy's greed.\n\nELVIRA\nLesson number two -- don't get high on your own supply.\n\nThe girl friend has departed and Elvira turns her attention back to them, bored.\n\nLOPEZ\nThat's right. Course not everybody follows the rules.\n(eyeing Elvira)\n\nHEAD WAITER\nThere you go, Mr. Lopez.\n\nHe's popped the champagne cork and pours Dom Perignon for Lopez.\n\nLOPEZ\nGive it to everybody and bring another, willya Jack?\n\nHead Waiter nods.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nFive hundred fifty dollars for this bottle Tony, what do you think of that, hunh? For a bunch of fucking grapes -- isn't that something?\n\nELVIRA\n(to Tony)\nIn France, it cost $100 but don't tell anybody in Miami.\n\nTony catches her eye. She looks away, interested.\n\n57 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nA Man passes the table. Lopez calls out.\n\nLOPEZ\nHey, George -- buddy.\n\nMAN\nHey, Frank.. -how's the case coming?\n\nThe Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.\n\nLOPEZ\nOy, I shoulda come to you 'stead of that putz, Neufeld.\n\nSHEFFIELD\nJack's a good lawyer. I taught him everything he knows.\n\nLOPEZ\nYeah, almost everything.\n\nSHEFFIELD\n(to Elvira)\nElvira, you look terrific...\n(to all)\nEnjoy yourselves.\n\nHe ambles off.\n\nLOPEZ\n. . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami. Cost a brick to pick up a phone.\n\nTony looking off at him, remembering it.\n\nLOPEZ\n(raising his champagne glass)\nSo... here's to old friends...and new friends.\n\nThey toast, Tony tasting it like it was Holy Water.\n\nLOPEZ\nWell, Tony?\n\nTONY\nHey, yeah, you're not kidding, this is good stuff, Frank.\n\nLopez laughs, likes the kid, tweaks him on the cheek.\n\nLOPEZ\n(checking Tony's threads)\nYeah, get you some new clothes, some $500 suits, you'll look real sharp. I'd like you and your boys to handle some stuff for me, Tony, work with Omar here. We're doing something big next month. Running a string of mules out of Columbia. You do good on that, there'll be other things.\n\nOmar doesn't like it but glances away.\n\nTONY\nHey, that sounds like fun, Frank. Thanks.\n\nThe music shifts to slow dancing.\n\nELVIRA\n(waving away cigar smoke)\nSo, you want to dance, Frank or you want to sit here and have a heart attack?\n\nLOPEZ\nDance? I'd rather have a heart attack.\n\nELVIRA\n(rising)\nDon't foam into the Dom Perignon.\n\nGlancing at Omar, sitting there obediently. Her eyes say forget it.\n\nELVIRA\n(to Tony)\nHow about you?\n\nTony nods sure, looks at his boss.\n\nLOPEZ\n(waves)\nGo on!\n\nThey go.\n\n58 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nIt's interesting to watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It's not so much an act of walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes forward. It's not that he doesn't see the people he bumps off, it's that he couldn't care less.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Omar)\nWhat do you think?\n\nOMAR\nI think he's a fucking peasant.\n\nLOPEZ\nYeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for you.\n\nCUT TO\n59 INT.

So where you from?\n\nHe bumps into an elderly couple dancing, ignores them.\n\nELVIRA\nBaltimore...\n\nTONY\nBaltimore? Where's that?\n\nELVIRA\nLook, it doesn't really matter. I'm getting a headache.\n\nTONY\nJust trying to be friendly.\n\nELVIRA\nI've got enough friends -- and I don't need another one, 'specially one who just got off the banana boat.\n\nHe makes a point of looking at her.\n\nTONY\nHey, I didn't come over on no banana boat. I'm a political refugee here.\n\nELVIRA\nOh, part of the Cuban crime wave?\n\nTony, pissed, bangs once more into the elderly couple.\nThe man stops dancing, looks at him exasperated but Tony\ndoesn't see.\n\nTONY\nWhatta you talking crazy for, whatsa matter with you?\n\nELVIRA\n(interrupting)\nI'm sorry. I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.\n\nTONY\nWhy you got this beef against the world? You got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you got this look in your eyes like you haven't been fucked good in a year. What's the problem, baby?\n\nElvira laughs at him, furious.\n\nELVIRA\nYou know you're even stupider than you look. Let me give you a crash course, Jose whatever your name is, so you know what you're doing around here.\n\nTONY\n(interrupting)\nNow you're talking to me, baby!\n\nELVIRA\nFirst who, where, why and how I fuck is none of your business, second don't call me 'baby,' I'm not your baby and last, even if I was blind, desperate, starved and begging for it on a desert island, you'd be the last thing I'd ever fuck. You got the picture now -- so fuck off.\n\nTONY\nHey, thataway.\n\nShe whips off the floor, pissed. He watches her, amused.\n\nCUT TO\n\n63 CAR - DAWN\nTony and Manny drive home in the broken down Monte Carlo sedan through the streets of Little Havana.\n\nThey've been partying all night, clothes rumpled, Tony smoking his cigar, feeling good.\n\nTONY\nThat chick he's with... she loves me.\n\nMANNY\n(driving)\nOh yeah, how you know that?\n\nTONY\nThe eyes, Manny -- they don't lie.\n\nMANNY\nYou're serious? Tony, that's Lopez's lady. He'll kill us.\n\nTONY\nWhat are you kidding -- he's soft.\nI seen it in his face -- booze and a cuncha tells him what to do.\n\nPause.\n\n63-A OMITTED\n\n64 EXT.

You wanna score one of these chicks, watch. Mira!\n\nHe wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small\nwhirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in\nthe flick of an eye.\n\nTONY\n...the fuck was that?\n\nMANNY\nYou didn't see it?

How 'bout that one?\n\nPointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.\n\nMANNY\nNo problem.\n\nEXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY.\n\nTony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arms and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit.\n\nTONY\nCome on!\n\nManny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a\ncar screeching to a halt in front of him.\n\nTONY\n(points)\nOkay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.\n\nThe blonde has paused to look in a shop window.\n\nManny stops alongside, -pretends to look. When he catches\nher eyes, he flicks his tongue.\n\nShe looks at him, confused, then back into the window.\nManny looks back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.\n\nTony, exiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber\nchild, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his\nown version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at\nhim puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now\nsmiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles and moves along.\n\nMeanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde socks him across the face and walks away.\n\nTony walks up to him, mocking.\n\nTONY\nI'm telling you man you got it- all mixed up.\nThis country first, you gotta get the money; then you get the power, and when you got the power, then you get the women -- then, chico, you got the world by the balls.

TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nThe interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled\nwith religious objects from macumba and waist-high black\nJesus statues in various corners. The floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.\n\nStepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his nineteen-year-old sister Gina. Their eyes lock.\n\nTONY\n(moved)\nHi Gina...\n\nGINA\nTony?\n\nShe looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,\ncurly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and\nlarge-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.\n(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in\nTony's possession.)\n\nTONY\n(covering his unwanted emotion)\nYeah, look at you, you're beautiful... what's it been seven years?

Tony pulls\nout another present, for her.\n\nTONY\n...for you too Mama, look....\n\nMoving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an\nexquisite pearl necklace. She stares at it, doesn't take it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.\n\nGINA\nIt's beautiful... Mama,\n(offers it, an unspoken 'why don't you take it?')\n\nMama doesn't. Gina puts it away with her own.\n\nTONY\n(holding Gina by the shoulder, making light of it)\nWell anyway, here we are hunh? The three musketeers! We made it to America hunh? Let's toast!\n\nTossing the empty package aside, he pulls the last gift -- a\nbottle of champagne.\n\nTONY\nOye ! To America!\n(singing)\n'America. America....'\n\nCUT TO\n69 INT.

I'm doing hair. Remember Hiram Gonzalez? His father had the babershop?\n\nTony nods.\n\nGINA\nIt's his place. Plus I'm going to junior college -- Miami Dade -- and in two more years I get my cosmetology license and then I'll be making enough...\n\nTONY\nYeah, well surprise, all that's over\nwith starting today. I didn't bring\nup my kid sister to work in no hair\nshop....\n\nMama looks over at him on the words \"bring up\" and he\ncatches her look.\n\nTONY\n...and Mama don't have to sew in no factory.\n\nHe pulls out a bundle of cash, fifties and hundreds, and\nstarts peeling them off on the table. Mama stops working,\nlooks.\n\nTONY\n(to Mama as he counts)\nYeah, your son's made it Mama, he's a success. I wanted to surprise\nyou. That's how come I didn't show my face around before. I wanted you to see what a good boy I been.\n\nPushes a thousand dollar stack towards her.\n\nTONY\nThat's a thousand dollars right there, Mama -- for you.\n\nShe approaches it cautiously, her fingers riffling the\nbills, then looks back at her son.\n\nMAMA\nWho'd you kill for this Tony?\n\nGINA\n(aghast)\nMama!\n\nTONY\nI didn't kill nobody Mama,\n(lying)\n\nMAMA\nNo?

Things are different.\nI'm working with this anti-Castro group.\nI'm an organizer now, we get a lotta political contributions....\n\nMAMA\nSure you do Tony -- with a gun sticking in somebody's face.

What about....\n\nGINA\n(springing to her feet)\nWhat are you saying Mama! He's your son!\n\nMAMA\nSon? I wish I had one. He's a bum! He was a bum then and he's a\nbum now!\n(to Tony, she's worked up like a madwoman now)\nWho do you think you are, we haven't heard a word from you in five years and you suddenly show up here and throw some money around and you think you can get my respect? You think you can buy me with jewelry?\nYou think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes and your gutter manners and make fun of....\n\nTONY\nHey Mama, come on, you don't know what you're talking about.....\n\nMAMA\n(continuing)\nNo, no, that's not the way I am Tony and that's not the way I --\n(emphasizing it)\nI raised Gina to be. You're not going to destroy her. I don't need your money, thanks. I work for my living -- and I don't want you in this house anymore and I don't want you around Gina. So leave us alone... go on, get out! And take this lousy\nmoney with you, it stinks!\n\nShe casts the bundle of bills back across the table at him\nlike dead lettuce.\n\nA silence. Tony sits there livid, soothing his scar, about to explode, but doesn't. Gina mutters something in the silence.\n\nGINA\nOh Mama... why do you got to spoil it for everybody.\n(to Tony)\nI'm sorry Tony, I....\n\nTony nods his head at his mother.\n\nTONY\n(gently)\nOkay, Mama, okay....\nCUT TO\n\n70 EXT.

He was a bum!\n\nGINA\n(continuing)\n. . . she's got a lot of hate in her Tony, she's proud, you got to understand that?\n\nTONY\n(making light of it now)\nHey it's okay, it's Mama, what do you want, she's Old World.\n\nGINA\nTony, I know you did some bad things\nback then. The Army, I know you got into some trouble.\n\nTONY\nCommunists you know, they're always trying to tell you what to do.\n\nGINA\nMama, she doesn't understand-- but I just want you to know, y'know, I don't care. Five years, ten years, it doesn't matter how long you been away, you're my blood. Always.\n\nPause. She stares intently at him, emphasizing it.\n\nTONY\nHey I know... I know.\n\nShe gives him a soft kiss. He takes out his money roll.\n\nTONY\nSay, I want you to keep this for yourself. Okay? Help Mama out, but don't tell her I gave you this, okay?\n\nShe hesitates... He nudges her on the cheek and slaps the whole wad into her palm.\n\nTONY\nGo on! Go out and have some fun, what the hell? You gonna beat yourself to death at nineteen, pussycat like you?\n\nHe gets in the car. She peers in.\n\nGINA\nYou can come by the shop y'know, any afternoon, I'll be there okay?\n\nHer eyes fall on Manny at the wheel.\nHe smiles back with charm.\n\nGina's eyes pause on him, then withdraw.

GOLF COURSE - MIAMI - DAY 86\nFrank Lopez has Tony and Chi-Chi out on the golf course.

Does a toot,\nstaring at her. She's uncomfortable. When he finishes he ,\nmakes as if to return it to her. She leans to take it. He\nkisses her. She goes with it.\n\nPause. She pulls back.\n\nELVIRA\n(same tone of voice as before)\nDon't get confused, Tony. I don't fuck around with the help.\n\nAs he puts the key into the ignition, Tony has this wolfish grin on his face.\n\nCUT TO\nINT. COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93\nSubtitle appears:\n\nCOCHABAMBA, BOLIVA\nAlejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy\nhair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a\ncasual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.\n\nOn his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with \"Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money.\n\nAccompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense\nvenomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the\nlook of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in\nproximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person\nor persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte\nposition, his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who\nmight glance at him. He is a continual source of tension\nunderplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar\nwho is insecure to begin with.\n\nSosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing\nlab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with massive iron\nkettles bubbling with coca paste... across to a row of ovens\nwhere the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians\nworking there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey\" as he passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard.\n\nSOSA\nSo this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200\nkilos refined every month of the year. Problem is, I have no steady\nmarket. Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way ---\n\nOMAR\nI know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month...\n\nSosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his\nskinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his\nnervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.\n\nTony, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to\nlook at a sample of the dried coke.\nThe Shadow stops, eyeballs him.\n\nTony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then\nsamples the coke off his thumb into his nose.\nPause. His expression says I like it. He moves on.\nThe Shadow moves with him.\n\nSOSA\n(meanwhile)\n...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like -- say 150 kilos a month.\n\nOMAR\nThat's a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It's too bad Frank's not here. Something like that you should talk to him.\n\nSOSA\nYes, it would've been nice if he could have come.\n\nTONY\n(cutting in)\nand he'd like meeting you too Mr. Sosa. But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand?\n\nSOSA\n(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic)\nSo he sent you?\n\nTONY\nYeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit.\n\nLooking over the laboratory like it was his.\nOmar glances at him, annoyed.\n\nSOSA\nWe'll talk at my house. Shall we go...\n\nCUT TO\n94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94\nThe camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains\nto a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings\nfrom the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.\nAt the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.\nHe eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).\n\nSOSA\n(to Omar)\n...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.\n\nOMAR\nWell, we do that, we gotta take the\nrisk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You\nknow what that means?\n\nTONY\nThat means we gotta go to war with\n`em.\nlooks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make\nSosa\nof this guy.\nSOSA\nWhen we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.\n\nTONY\nSplit the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama.\n\nSOSA\nPanama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.\n\nTONY\n13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You\nknow what that's like these days?\nThey got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it.\n\nOmar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.\n\nSOSA\nWhat do you suggest is a fair...?\nExcuse me.\n\nInterrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly\nappears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves\nhim in.\n\nThe black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man\nwith academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair\non a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.\n\nSosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.\nA beat.\nHe whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.\nThen he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.\nSosa glances at his gold Rolex.\n\nOMAR\n(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)\nShaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here!\n\nTony shrugs.\n\nSOSA\nWhere were we?\n\nTONY\nPanama. You're looking for a partner, right?\n\nOmar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.\n\nSOSA\n...something like that.\n(chuckles)\n\nOMAR\nLook Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we...\n\nTONY\nHey Omar, why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.\n\nOMAR\nHey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!\n\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nFrank'll love it. Don't worry about it.\n\nOMAR\nThat's up to Frank -- not you.\n\nHe looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing\n-- also an advantage in the split.\n\nOMAR\nI'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...\n\nSOSA\nIt's all right. Maybe your partner's right. Maybe you should talk to\nFrank.\n\nOMAR\n(a beat)\nOkay. I don't think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.\n\nSOSA\n(without hesitation)\nGood. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that'll have you in Miami in five hours.\nYou can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.\n\nOmar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.\n\nOMAR\nYeah. I guess so....\n\nTONY\nGreat.\n\nSOSA\n(glancing at Tony, to Omar)\n...leave your friend here. While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.\n\nOMAR\n(doesn't get it)\nI don't think that...\n\nTONY\n(lighting a cigar)\nHey, it's okay. You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him...\n\nSosa laughs. Omar scowls.\n\nCUT TO\n\n95 EXT. SOSA VILLA - DAY 95\n\nThe helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with the Shadow. They both stare at:\nOmar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.\n\nThe chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the\npolo players exercising in the distance... a woman on a\nhorse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.\n\nSosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.\n\nTONY\nYou know why they say Cubans are all screwed up?\n\nSOSA\nWhy?\n\nTONY\nCause the island's in the Caribbean, the government's in Russia, the Army's in Angola, and the people live in Miami.\n\nSosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.\n\nTONY\n(overlapping the joke)\nThey got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.\n\nSOSA\nMaybe he'll move to Miami too...\nGabriella, my rose -- how was the ride?\n\nSosa changes his personality completely with her, dewy-eyed and loving. They peck each other's cheek lightly.\n\nGABRIELLA\n(distracted)\nLovely... but the sheep in the north pasture, they're destroying the grass, it's turning yellow. You must move them darling.\n\nSOSA\nI'll take care of it myself.\n\nGABRIELLA\n(turning to him)\n...and don't forget we have the Rinaldi's at eight.\n\nSOSA\nOf course not. Uh -- an associate of mine. From Miami. Tony Montana...\n(to Tony)\nMy fiance, Gabriella Montini.\n\nTONY\nHello....\nShe nods to him in that somewhat uninterested, rude, upperclass Latin way.\n\nGABRIELLA\nIt's a pleasure.\n\nShe withdraws. Tony watches her go.\n\nTONY\nI gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.\n\nSosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.\n\nSOSA\n(focusing the binoculars)\nI like you Tony. There's no lying in you... Unfortunately I don't feel\nthe same way about the rest of your organization.\n\nTony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.\n\nTONY\nIn-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?\n\nSOSA\nI mean Omar Suarez.\n\nTony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.\n\nSosa passes him the binoculars.\n\nSOSA\nThis garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.\nFrom several years ago, in New York. He was an informer for the police....\n\nTony, astonished, looks up.\n\n96 THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - OMAR 96\nterrified, being positioned at the door of the chopper by\nthe Shadow and the Skull, his hands tied to his back and a\nlength of thick rope looped around his neck. He is struggling backwards in vain.\n\nSOSA\nHe put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life. My associate used to work up there.\n\nThrough the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of the\nchopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.\nA silence.\n\n\n97 TONY 97\nshaken, lowers the binoculars.\nSosa watches him closely for his reaction.\nTony looks back at him, contemplative.\nSosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.\n\nSOSA\nSo how do I know you're not a 'chivato' too Tony?\n\nTONY\n(awry, stalks up to him)\nHey Sosa -- get this straight right now ! I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him okay! All I got's my two balls-- and my word -- and I don't break 'em. For nobody.\nThat piece of shit up there I never liked, I never trusted..\nFor all I know he's the guy who set me up and got my buddy Angel Fernandez killed.\nBut that's history. I'm here. He's not. You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!\n\nSOSA\n(moves away)\nI think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this\nLopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judgment stinks. So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organization...hunh? You tell me Tony.\n\nTONY\nHey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal. It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you.\n(then)\nYou got my word on that.\n\nSosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him,\nmakes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony\nfollowing the pantomime, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.\n\nSOSA\nYou speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together. Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me.\n\nTheir eyes locked together.\n\nCUT TO\nAERIAL VIEW - MIAMI - TWILIGHT 98\nIn all its Caribbean splendor with the long curving beach\nand rich white buildings, bathed in a lovely violet light.\nMusic theme continuing over.\n\nREVERSE WIPE TO\n\n99 EXT. LOPEZ MOTORS AUTO DEALERSHIP - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY 99\nIn long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands and acting like everybody's favorite uncle... 'till we see him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny\noutside his office.\nHe jerks his head. Inside. They go.\n\nCUT TO\n100 INT.

He doesn't get up from\nhis desk. His hair is flaming red. We saw him before, at the\nMutiny Club.\n\nSHEFFIELD\nWhat can I do for you Montana?\n\nTONY\n(indicates Manny)\nMy partner.

BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 105\n\nThe place is raging tonight as Tony and Manny arrive, in\ntuxedos, making their way through the crowd greeting the\nmany people who know them now. We might note Tony has\nrefined the art of walking and no longer bulls people out\nof his path, he angles through them.\n\nOWNER\n(indicating a table)\nOver here.\n\nTony stops, spots his sister Gina, in an expensive looking\ndress, with a flashy young Cuban guy in a burgundy suit.\n\nTONY\nWhat the fuck is she doing here, she's....\n(heading towards her)\n\nMANNY\n(stops him)\nHey c'mon Tony, it's okay, it's justa disco for chrissake.

We tell you who's moving against you, we shake down who you want shaken down, if you have a real problem in a collection, we'll step in for you. I got eight killers with badges working for me.

You feed me a bust now and then, some new cowboy wants to go into business you let us know -- we like snacks, it looks good on the record.\n\nTONY\nS'pose I give you the money, how do I know you're the last bull I gotta grease? What about Metro, Lauderdale, DEA -- how do I know what rock they're gonna come out from under?\n\nBERNSTEIN\nThat's none of our business, Tony, we don't cross no lines.\n(getting up)\nI don't want this discussion going any farther than this table. MY WYS have families, they're legitimate cops, I don't want none of `em getting' embarrassed `cause if my guys are gonna suffer, then they're gonna make you suffer. Comprendre?\n...Oh yeah, and I got a vacation comin' up. I wanna take the wife to\nLondon, England. We never been there. Throw in two round-trip tickets. First class.\n\nTony just stares at him. Bernstein smiles, points.\n\nBERNSTEIN\nI like the scar. Nice. Like Capone.\nBut you oughta smile more, Tony. Enjoy yourself.\nEveryday aboveground's a good day.\n\nHe winks and goes. Tony sits there brooding on it, eyes flicking back to the dance floor.\n\nBurgundy suit there is snuggling up to Gina on the dance floor. Too close.\nTony is getting pissed, he looks around for Manny, then spots....\n\n107 INT. BABYLON CLUB ENTWWCE - NIGHT 107\nElvira walking into the club, followed by Lopez and Ernie,\nthe bodyguard.

There's only one thing that gives and gets orders, cabron -- balls.\n\nPause. Something's about to pop, turns back just at the\ncrest. Lopez abruptly turns away.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Elvira)\nLet's go!\n\nELVIRA\nFrank, this is ridiculous....\n\nLOPEZ\nC'mon!\n\nHe crowds her. she goes.

I like the weather here just fine.\n\nHe stops, his eyes darting to pick out Gina laughing as she\nfollows burgundy suit out of the main room and down the\nstairs to the toilets.\nWithout hesitation, his irritation peaking now, Tony darts\nafter her.\n\nMANNY\nHey, where you going?\n\nHe doesn't answer.\n\nCUT TO\n108 INT.

I'll go out with who I want and if I want to fuck them then I'll fuck them!\n\nTony, raging, smacks her the face. She reels back across into the toilet.\nTony stands there, abated.\n\nThe crowd is silent.\n\nManny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina who is sobbing.\n\nMANNY\n(tender)\nCome on, baby, it's okay... it's okay, he didn't mean it.\n(strokes her face)\n\nTONY\n(disturbed, to Manny)\nGet her home, get her outta here!\n\nHe turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd,\nno regrets, but disturbed.\n\nManny helps Gina to her feet.\n\nMANNY\nCome on, pussycat, I'll buy you a\ncup of coffee.\n\nCUT TO\n110 INT.

Cause you don't know what you're missing....\n\nShe leans across the front seat and lightly lays a challenging kiss on his cheek. The ladykiller is rigid in his terror.\n\nShe gets out of the car, crosses in front of his headlights, towards the house, looking at him. He watches.\n\nCUT BACK TO\n113 INT. BABYLON CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT 113\nThe Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting to Sinatra's \"Strangers In The Night'.\n\nOWNER\nAll right, you coneheads, another exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?\nNow I want you to check out this next hombre. I found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia' !\n\nLights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as\nsad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-\nlight drawing immediate laughter.\n\nHe is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo\nmask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.\nWith a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to \"Saturday Night Fever\" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.\n\nTony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.\nMore laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.\nWhen the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome\nface of a young clown in white paint with the large\nblackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing\naudience.\n\nTony is hooked by the image, looks on.\nThe clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and\npulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,\nbouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry...\n\n...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the\nsharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to\nits close, a haunting figure of mockery....\n\nTony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time. His\nantennae warn him. Out of the side of his eye, he sees....\n\nThe two hitters moving on him.\nHe sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,\nsmashing the mirrors...\nScreams, crowd diving for cover...\n\nTony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Beretta out of\nhis ankle, firing...\nHits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings...\n\nTony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing...\nThe second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more\nmirrors, and more screaming.\n\nTony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the\ndoor, his clothes ripped with blood and glass.\n\nThe clown, Octavia, lies dead on the silent dance floor.\n\nCUT TO\n114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114\nTony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.\n\nExchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot, he runs out of ammunition.\nHe jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.\n\nThe second hitter, wounded, running out of the club towards him.\nThe third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.\n\nTony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.\n\nCarhops scattering, the hitters seeking cover.\nHitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head exploding like squashed watermelon.\n\nTony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap\nacross the shattered windows.\nHe guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off\nthe armor plating, whining against the shutters.\n\nTony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the\ngear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile in reverse, accelerates, climbing to top speed...\nAs hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of\nthere, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.\n\nCUT TO\n\n115 INT. SAFEHOUSE - THAT NIGHT 115\nTony, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who\nreveals to us an ugly wound on his rib cage. Tony looks at\nit, doesn't express a reaction.\n\nDOCTOR\nIt's going to be sore for a few months.\n\nTONY\nSomebody else gonna be a lot sorer...\n(to Chi-Chi)\nFind out where Lopez is....\n\nCUT TO\n116 INT.

SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 12:\nTony ignores the doctor taping him, checking his watch.\n\nTONY\n(to Nick)\nNick, when we get there, call Lopez at three exactly. You got that?\n\nNICK\nYeah, don't worry Tony. I got it.\n\nTONY\nAll you say is you're one of the guys at the-club -- 'Hello, Mr. Lopez, there was a fuckup, he got away...'\n\nNICK\nYeah, Tony, I got it, no problem...\n\nCUT TO\n122 INT. LOPEZ MOTORS - NIGHT 122\nWaldo remains outside, covering the street as Tony, Manny\nand Chi-chi move gingerly along the darkened showroom...\nLopez's voice on the phone through the half-opened office door.\n\nLOPEZ'S VOICE\n...you're kidding! Three to two?\nSon of a bitch!...\n(cradling the phone)\nGuess what. My softball team, y'know, the Little Lopezers? They won the Division tonight. We're going to Sarasota for the State Championship... Hunh!\n\nMUFFLED VOICE\nCongratulations. That's great Frank.\n\nTony, Manny and Chi-chi slide into the room, the latter two\nwith guns casually drawn.\n\n123 INT. LOPEZ MOTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 123\n\nTONY\nYeah, it sure is Frank. What'd you do -- fix the umpire?\n\nLopez, his nose in a glass of scotch, almost muffs it right\nthere and then, but manages to recover.\n\nLOPEZ\nTony...? Uh, I'll call you back -- yeah.\n\nHangs the phone up and rocks forward at his desk.\nLopez's bodyguard, Ernie, gets the message from Chi-chi\nsliding along the wall next to him, Manny covering the\nother side of the room.\n\nLOPEZ\nTony... what happened to you, hunh?\n\nTONY\nYeah, lookit. They spoiled one of\nmy $800 suits.\n\nLOPEZ\nJesus! Who?\n\nin his ripped suit, shoulder in a sling, face cut, Tony, shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.\n\nTONY\nHitters. Somebody musta brought 'em.\nNever seen 'em before...Hiya\nii:;. Is there an answer to this too?\n\nBERNSTEIN\n(uneasy)\nAlways is Montana, always is...\n\nLOPEZ\nJesus, Tony, maybe it was the Diaz Brothers, they got a deep beef going back to the 'Sun Ray' thing.\n\nTONY\nHey, you might be right.\n\nLOPEZ\nAnyway I'm glad you made it Tony, we'll return the favor for you.

But he got hot tonight, y'know, about the broad. He fucked up.\n\nTONY\nYeah, so did you, Bernstein.\n\nHis eyes...

I'm talking ten million a month now. That's serious money.

The fact is we can't even take anymore of your money unless we raise the rates on you.\n\nTONY\nYou gonna what, Jerry?\n\nBANKER\nTony, Tony, we gotta. The IRS is coming down heavy on South Florida, y'know. That Time Magazine cover didn't help any. We gotta do it Tony, we got stockholders, we gotta go ten percent on the first twelve million; that's in denominations of twenty. We'll go eight percent on your ten dollar bills and six points on your fives.\n\nTONY\nTen points!\n\nwe go someplace else.\nHey, Tony,\n\nBANKER\nTony, Tony -- it's no conspiracy, we're all doing it.

That's why you pay us what you do -- you trust us.\n\nTony looks broodingly. Jerry glances at his watch, suggesting\nhe has another engagement,\n\nBANKER\nStay with us, you're an old and well-liked customer. You're in good hands with us... gentlemen, I gotta run. How's married life? Say hello to the princess for me -- okay. She's beautiful.\nSee you. Take care.\n\nGoing.\n\nTony watches, raging inside. He pulls a drawer open and reaches for a private cocaine supply. It's the first indication we have of this. As he snorts:\n\nTONY\nThat prick, that WASP whore. Jhat's\ncome over he think I am, some maricon on a boat....\n\nSo why don't we talk to this Jew Seidelbaum? He's got his own exchange, he charges four percent tops -- and he's connected.\n\nTONY\nI don't know.

I'm here changing dollar bills is all.\nSo you wanna waste everybody's time here, I call my lawyer. Best lawyer in Miami.

TONY'S BATHROOM - DAY 164\n\n\"Drug King Posts Record $5 Million Bond\" -- a front page photo\nof Tony, Elvira, and Sheffield, the lawyer.\n\nCUT TO\n165 XNT. TONY'S BATHROOM - DAY 165\n\nTony, tense, checks himself in the mirror, adjusts his\nhair. A vial of coke appears. He snorts a large amount,\ngoes out. It's the first time we sense he might be using\nthe stuff on a steady and increasingly heavy basis.\n\nCUT TO\n\n166 INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nTony is pacing nervously. Manny looks on. Red-headed\nSheffield rasps through a cloud of cigarette smoke behind\nhis desk.\n\nSHEFFIELD\n. ..you give me a check for a hundred grand plus three hundred in cash and I guarantee you walk on the conspiracy charge. But they're gonna come back at us on a tax evasion -- and they'll get it.\n\nTONY\nWhat am I looking at?\n\nSHEFFIELD\nFive years, you'll be out in three, maybe less if I can make a deal.\n\nTONY\nFor what! Three years in the can!\nFor washing money? This whole country's built out of washed money!\n\nMANNY\nHey, Tony, what's three years? lt's not like Cuba here. It's like going to a hotel.\n\nTony shakes his head, grimacing like he's having an\nepileptic fit.\n\nSHEFFIELD\nI'll delay the trial. A year and a half, two years, you won't start doing time till '85.\n\nTONY\nNo...no, they never get me back in a cage.. -never! HeyI George I go another four hundred grand -- I go 800,000 dollars, okay? With that you can fix the Supreme Court, hunh?\n\nSHEFFIELD\nTony... the law has to prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' I'm an expert at raising that doubt but when you got a million three undeclared dollars staring into a videotape camera, honeybaby, it's hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxi cab.\n\nTony paces back and forth like a tiger, corking his fury.\nAbruptly coming to a decision, he whirls and leans across\nSheffield's desk.\n\nTONY\nAll right -- all right. I do the three fuckin' years but lemme tell\nyou about my law, George. It's realsimple. There's no 'reasonable doubt.' If you're rain-making the judge or you fuck me for the four hundred grand and I come in guilty on the big rap -- you, the judge, the prosecutor, nothing's gonna stop me, y'hear?\nI'm gonna come and tear your fuckin' eyeballs out.\n\nPause.\n\nSHEFFIELD\n(cool)\nThe point is made. Now where's the money?\n\nTony nods to Manny who hauls a briefcase up on Sheffield's\ndesk. Tony abruptly walks out, a vial appearing in his\nhands as he steps out of the office. He sniffs.\n\nCUT TO\n\n167 EXT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 167\nCamera follows Tony with Ernie and Chi-Chi dowr'the outside\ngallery onto the veranda where Sosa is reclining with\nseveral other men -- all in casual clothes, enjoying their\ncoffee after lunch.\n\nSOSA\n(rising)\nTony...Tony.\n\nTONY\nAlex.\n\nThey hug like they were the closest of friends.\n\nSOSA\nI'm glad you made it on such short notice. I appreciate it. How`s Elvira?\n\nTONY\nShe's okay. How's your wife?\n\nSOSA\nThree more months.\n\nTONY\nThat's great.\n\nSOSA\nAnd you, when are you going to have another Tony to take your place.\n\nTONY\n(sore point)\nI'm working on it.\n\nSOSA\nI guess you'll have to work harder, Tony.\n\nThey laugh, nervously. Sosa is a little more reserved with\nhim than before -- in tune.with the other men at the meeting.\n\nSOSA\nTony, come, I want you to meet some friends of mine.\n\nHe smoothly guides Tony towards the group of men who rise.\n\nSOSA\nThis is Pedro Quinn, chairman of Andes Sugar here...Tony Montana.\n\nPEDRO QUINN\nA pleasure, Mr. Montana.\n\nCamera tracking through ad-lib introductions, the music\nassuming a faint martial stride.\n\nSOSA\nGeneral Eduardo Strasser, Commander of the First Army Corps...Tony Montana.\n\nThe man is in civilian clothes.\n\nSOSA\nAriel Bleyer, from the Ministry of the Interior... Tony Montana.\n\nThe cameras moving past Sosa's black aide, the Skull (who\nnailed Omar) silent behind his sunglasses, to an American-\ntype in a Brooks Brothers suit who stands.\n\nSOSA\nCharles Goodson -- a friend of ours from Washington.\n\nTONY\nHi....\n\nGOODSON\nHow do you do, Mr. Montana...\n\nHe smells like a government guy. Sosa summons the black aide -- in a hushed voice.\n\nSOSA\nNicky, have Albert meet us in the living room.\n\nThe black aide goes.\n\nSOSA\n(solicitous)\nTony, come, please sit here.\n\nTony is shown a chair in the middle of the veranda,\nsurrounded on all sides. There is a strained beat to the\nproceedings. Ernie and Chi-Chi hang around the edges.\n\nHe suddenly catches a glimpse of the sloe-eyed Gabriella\nmoving with another woman past a window of the house. Then\nshe's gone.\n\nSosa pulls up a chair right opposite Tony, almost touching\nknees.\n\nSOSA\nTony, I want to discuss something that concerns all of us here....\n\nTONY\nSure, Alex.\n\nSOSA\nTony, you have a problem; we have a problem... I think we can solve both our problems.\n\nTony waits.\n\nSOSA\nWe all know you have tax troubles in your country -- and you may have to do a little time. But we have some friends in Washington who tell us these troubles can be taken care of... maybe you'll have to pay a big fine and some back interest, but there's no time....\n\nPause. Tony looks. The American guy, Goodson, shifts his\ngaze away.\n\nTONY\nAnd your problem, Alex?\n\nSosa looks around, stands up.\n\nSOSA\nCome, I'll show you.\n\nTony cautiously stands to follow him.\n\nCUT TO\n168 INSERT - INT. SOSA VILLA LIVING ROOM - DAY - VIDEOTAPE - 168\nMATOS STUDY\nA \"Phil Donahue-type\" setting. A segment now in progress\nwith the \"Donahue-type\" interviewing Dr. Orlando Gutierrez.\nGutierrez is a young charismatic man, very well dressed and\npolished in a South American manner who exudes a sense of\nenormous passion.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nMore than 10,000 of our people are being tortured and held without trial. In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? It\nsells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!\n\nINTERVIEWER\nI've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nThe irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,\nJim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.\n\nINTERVIEWER\nSo what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine... that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?\n\nGUTIERREZ\n(laughs)\nLet me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --\n\nGutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TV\nscreen, dour, ruthless.\n\nGUTIERREZ\n. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country. Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.\nNow if he's supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register?\n\nLaughter.\n\n169 TONY 169\nwatching, touching his nose a lot, blowing it, hyped from\nthe coke usage.\n\nSOSA\nA Communist -- financed by Moscow.\n\n170 GUTIERREZ 170\nholds up another photograph -- insert the face on the\nTV screen.\n\nGUTIERREZ\n...this is Alejandro Sosa. Interesting character. A wealthy landowner. Educated in England. Good family. The business brain and drug overlord of an empire stretching across the Andes. Not your ordinary drug dealer....\n\nINTERVIEWER\nWhat are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?\n\nGUTIERREZ\n(passionate)\nThe United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.\n\n171 TONY 171\nstaring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nYou Americans have no idea how important your country is as a\nsymbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....\n\nSosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He's alone with Tony.\n\nSOSA\n...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. He's embarrassing, Tony...\nThat's our problem.\n\nTONY\nYeah.\n\nSosa looks up.\n\nThe Shadow (seen before at the disposal of Omar) comes into\nthe room, thin and quiet, his venomous eyes flicking over\nTony. The Skull leads him in.\n\nSOSA\nYou've met Alberto before?...\n\nTONY\n(remains seated)\nSure. How could I forget?\n\nSOSA\nAlberto, you know Tony Montana -- my partner from Florida.\n\nAlberto nods icily, remains standing adjacent.\n\nSOSA\n(to Tony)\nSo you see Alberto here is going to help fix our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business -- but he doesn't know his way around the States too well, he doesn't speak English, and he needs a little help...\n(*en)\nIs that a problem, Tony?\n\nTony looks around the faces, then:\n\nTONY\nThat's no problem, Alex....\n\nAlex nods, pleased.\nHold on Tony. He blows his nose again.\n\nCUT TO\n\n175 INT. THE RESTAURANT - MIAMI - NIGHT\nA millionaire's place, like \"The Forge\" on Arthur Godfrey\nRoad. Tony, Elvira, and Manny are shown to their table by the maitre d'. Tony, a little loaded, intersects a group of people at another table and stops, putting his hand on a heavyset man's shoulder.\n\nTONY\nHey, Vic, I watch your show everyday.\n\nVic -- who we saw before editorializing on television.--\ncranes his leonine white head of hair around with a\npatrician annoyance reserved for bores in restaurants.\n\nVIC\nOh, is that so?\n\nTONY\nYeah. Hey, you know that two hundred kilo DEA bust you was congratulating the cops for on the toob the other night?\n\nVIC\nAren't you... Tony Montana?\n\nTONY\n(beaming now, ignoring Manny who comes to retrieve him)\nYeah, that's me.\n\nThe half-dozen rich people in the dinner party are intrigued.\n\nTONY\n(waves to them)\nHi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vic, check it out. I heard like it was 220 kilos went down. That means twenty is missing, right? Ask your friends, the cops, about that -- and keep up the good work, Vie, but don't believe everything you hear, y'know what I mean? Okay, have a good dinner, nice to meet you people.\n\nWaves farewell to them, pats Vic once more on the shoulder, and leaves them murmuring.\n\nMANNY\n(reproving)\nHey, Tony, that's not cool, he's got a lotta friends in....\n\nTONY\nI don't give a fuck. He's an ass-hole! Never fucking tells the truth on TV! That's the trouble in this country. Nobody fucking tells the truth!\n\nNot caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip\nof an anguish he does not understand.\n\nCUT TO\n\n173 TONY\nsits with Manny and Elvira, who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap. Another huge meal is being consumed, the best roast beef, bottles of red and white wine, cigars....\n\nMANNY\nSo what's the big mystery, what happened down there with Sosa?\n\nTONY\nLot of bullshit, that's what. Politics.\nThe whole world's turning into politics.\n\nHe pulls out his own vial under the table between eating and drinking.\n\nMANNY\nThe one thing we always stayed out of was politics, Tony.\n\nTONY\nYeah, so what do you think Emilio Rebenga was? Politics or what?\n\nManny remembers.\n\nTONY\nNo free rides in this world, kid.\n\nMANNY\nSo who's this guy you brought back with you, the guy who don't blink?\n\nELVIRA\nWhat guy?\n\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nYou stay out of it. Run things down here. I'll be up in New York next week.\n\nHe takes a hit, unnoticed.\n\nELVIRA\n(unheard)\nWhat guy?\n\nMANNY\n(to Tony)\nI don't like it.\n\nTONY\nYou don't like it! It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!\n\nWhat's Seidelbaum got to do with this?\nTony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the\ntable with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to\nElvira's untouched plate.\n\nTONY\nWhy don't you eat your food, what's\nwrong with it?\n\nELVIRA\nI'm not hungry.\n\nShe quickly does one nostril with a quick, practiced move-\nment of her hand.\n\nTONY\nSo what'd you order it for?\n\nELVIRA\nI lost my appetite.\n\nShe does the other nostril. Tony looking at her. One beat.\nTwo beats. He passes a silent burp.\n\nMANNY\n(trying to shift the mood)\nSo what about the trial? I heard Sheffield thinks he can get a new postponement....\n\nTony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues to look at Elvira, then away, encompassing the restaurant.\n\nTONY\n(ignoring the question)\nIs this it? Is that what it's all about, Manny?\nEating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what?\nYou're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?\nIs that what it's all about?\n\nMANNY\nIt's not so bad Tony, could be worse....\n\nTONY\n(doesn't hear)\n. . . is that what I worked 'for? With these hands? Is that what I killed for? For this?\n(turns his gaze stonily on Elvira)\nA junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for a wife? Who never eats nothing, who wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps all day with black shades on, who won't fuck me cause she's in a coma!\n\nMANNY\n(gently)\nTony, you're drunk.\n\nTONY\n...is this how it ends? And I thought I was a winner? Fuck it\nman, I can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby!\n\nElvira reacts -- wanting to kill. She gets up and dumps\nher plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.\n\nELVIRA\nYou sonufabitch! You fuck!\n\nThey got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping\naround to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food\noff himself.\n\nELVIRA\nHow dare you talk to me like that!\nYou call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?\nOh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming!\n\nThe audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over\nthe faces of Vie and his rich friends.\n\nTony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.\n\nTONY\nSit down before I kill you.\n\nELVIRA\n. . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons\naround all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that?\n(in a softer tone)\nOh Tony don't you see? Don't you see what we've become? We're losers, honey, we're not winners, we're losers...\n\nSilence. Tony's fury has passed. So has Elvira's. There's\nthis awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot\ntheir lines.\n\nTONY\n(softly)\nGo on, get a cab home, you're stoned.\n(to Manny)\nManny.\n\nELVIRA\nNo, I'm not stoned Tony. You're stoned. You're so stoned you don't\neven know it.\n\nTONY\nAll right I'm stoned.\n\nMANNY\n(rising, trying to put his arm on Elvira)\nCome on, baby.\n\nELVIRA\nNo, no you stay right there Manny, I'm not going home with you... I'm not going home with anybody. I'm going home alone...\n(staring at Tony)\nI'm leaving you. I don't need this shit anymore.\n\nPause. She starts wobbling out.\nPast the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. Manny rises to follow.\n\nTONY\nLet her go! ...Another Quaalude and she'll love me again.\n\nStumbling once, Elvira disappears out the door.\nTony's eyes follow her. Pause.\n\nThe whole room is watching him sitting there covered with\nfood, the silence cathedral. He stands, wiping at the food\nand throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,\nthen looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.\n\nTONY\nYou're all assholes. You know why?\nCause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be.\n\nHe wobbles against the table. Manny tries to help. Tony\nshakes him loose.\n\nTONY\nYou need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!' So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth -- even when I lie.\n\nHe starts out, staggers.\n\nTONY\nSo say good night to the bad guy...\nYou're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.\n\nHe walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room\nis empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without\nits star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror\nand delight.\n\nCUT TO\n174 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT\nA quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers\nstroll past with their dog. A moment of silence. Tony\nmoves into frame.\n\nBehind him, the Shadow (Alberto) moves towards a sedan\nparked along the curb, carrying an airline bag. Be slips\nunder the car.\n\nTony looks:\n\n175 ERNIE\ndown the street at the intersection of the avenue, surveying\ntraffic, signals okay.\n\n176 CHI-CHI\nwaits in Tony's sedan double-parked down the block.\n\nTony, feeling everything's okay, does .a nervous, quick\nsnort, paces next to the vehicle the Shadow disappeared\nunder.\n\nGround level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes\nthe bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the\ncamera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,\ntaped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of\nthe Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an\naxle of the car.\n\n177 ERNIE\nsignals.\n\n178 TONY\nsees it.\n\nA cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,\ntowards us.\n\nGround level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.\nTony hurries to the car, bends down.\n\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nPsst! La Jara! Apaga.\n\nThe Shadow douses it and freezes in position.\n\nTony looks up just as the cop car pulls alongside, the\npassenger cop, a female, noticing him, saying something to her partner who eases the car to a halt.\n\nTony hurries out into the street, taking the initiative.\n\nTONY\nHey officer, uh you haven't seen a little dog have you, a little white poodle, it's around here somewhere?\nJesus, my kid's gonna go crazy when he hears I lost 'im. Oh boy am I gonna be in trouble.\n\nFEMALE COP\nWhy don't you check the ASPCA okay? They handle that stuff....\n\nTONY\nThe ASPCA?

The Shadow, unsmiling, appears from under the car.\ngun drawn, glowing with perspiration.

MOTHER'S HOUSE 218\nTony stomps into his white Corniche, Ernie discreetly\nclosing the door and getting in with Chi-Chi as Mama rips\nopen her door in b.g. and stands there staring from the\ndoorway -- weeping and staring across the dark.

HOUSE - COCONUT GROVE - THAT NIGHT 219\nTony in the backseat of the Corniche with Chi-Chi studies\nthe house from across the curb. It's quiet, rich, suburban,\nnot calling attention to itself.\n\nTony, seething, snorts another line of coke laid out on the\ncrystal bar dividing the backseat, and rewed, goes.\n\nTONY\n(to Chi-Chi)\nWait here.\n\nHe approaches the front door, listening, the hand sliding into his pocket. Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits.\nHold the pause. The door opens casually. Standing there is Manny -- with a towel around his waist.\n\nMANNY\n(surprised)\nTony?\n\nTony stares, stunned.\nGina now comes into view behind Manny -- in a bathrobe, a\nbig smile of welcome for her brother.\n\nGINA\nTony!\n(eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm)\n\nTony with his Beretta pointed at Manny, his expression filled with loathing.\n\nManny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony over the edge.\n\nMANNY\nHey Tony, c'mon we was....\n\nThe gun fires.\n\nGINA\nTony! No!\n\nTony fires a second time.\nManny slowly slumps downward against the doorjamb, eyes on Tony, terribly surprised.\n\nTony holds the gun, staring down, separated from himself.\nManny lies at his feet, dead.\n\nGINA\nManny!\n\nShe goes down to her knees, stunned out of her mind, shakes him.\n\nGINA\nManny!\n\nShe looks up, insanely, at Tony, her eyes huge with disbelief.\n\nGINA\nYou killed him?\n\nShaking her head at him incredulously.\n\nGINA\nWe got married just yesterday.

We gotta get out of here\n(to Gina)\nCome on baby...Gina!\n\nSuddenly she goes berserk.\n\nGINA\nNoooooooooooo!\n\nAnd shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him. She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed.\n\nChi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands. They manage at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to scream.\n\n220 EXT. MANNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 220\nLights coming on in the houses around the neighborhood.\n\nChi-Chi and Ernie, desperate now, drag her forcefully along\nthe pavement into the Corniche.

Tony snaps out of it.\n\nTONY\nYeah!\n\nHe goes. Chi-Chi lifting Manny's body, hauling it.\nTony getting into the Corniche, Ernie pinning Gina against the front seat. Chi-Chi propping Manny into the driver's seat with him. The car roars away.\n\nThe camera closing on Gina as she looks through the glass partition of the Corniche, at the slumped head of Manny in foreground, the music surging inexorably.\n\nGINA\nManny! ...Manny!

TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - THAT NIGHT 222\nIt goes roaring by the front gate and up the driveway,\ngravel flying.\n\nThe camera curving to reveal two sedans inching up the\nshadowed street, towards us, their lights out. The cars stop.\nEight men emerge silently, blending into the shadows of the trees.\n\n223 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 223\n\nTony, scratches across his face, strides through the front\ndoor into the marble foyer. Another Marielito is waiting\nfor them at the door.\n\nErnie and Chi-Chi are almost carrying Gina, who is numb with shock.\n\nCHI-CHI\nWhat do we do with her Tony?\n\nTONY\nDo what? Where? Put her upstairs.\nPut her in my bedroom.\n(to Gina)\nIt'll be all right, pussycat, you'll see everything'11 be okay, I'll take\ncare of you....\n\nShe looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face. Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares, upset but passive.\nThey trundle her up the stairs. Tony turns and walks away.\n\n224 INT. TONY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 224\nTony slumps on his couch. A haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.\nOblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table.\n\nErnie and Chi-Chi come in.\n\nCHI-CHI\nWe got some pills into her, she's cooling down.\n\nTony pays no attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile of coke.\nFlashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table.\nPause as he lets it sink in.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(worried)\nBoss, what we gonna do now?\n\nTONY\nDo? We're gonna war that's what we gonna do.\nWe gonna eat Sosa for breakfast.

The eyes are uncompromising.\nErnie, a little scared of him now, turns away. Chi-Chi follows.\n\nTony starts on another trek along the coffee table.\n\nCUT TO\n225 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225\nThe Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.\nA monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.\nThe monkeys listen quietly.\nThe flamingoes flutter.\n. . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go...\n\n. . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.\n. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the\nbalustrade. He's done so much coke now he's practically\ncatatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.\n\nTONY\n(insensate)\n. . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let 'em try, I bury the cocksuckers....\n\nHis point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.\nTony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!\n\nTONY\n...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...\nWell what the hell happened, hunh?\nWhat the hell happened to us?...\n\nIn far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:\n\nThe main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures spring\nout at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.\n\nAnother monitor now reveals two more figures moving into\nthe interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.\n\nA third monitor carries another image of shadows moving\nthrough the trees on the estate.\n\nOn the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost\nincoherent.\n\nTONY\n...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would\nyou sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...\n\nAs Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:\n\nTONY\n...we still are Manny, we still are-- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy, you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines. Fan mail. Television stars, movie stars, shooting stars -- he's a star....\n\n\n226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226\nAs he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.\nTony sees her.\nShe steps forward, offering her body almost naked to her\nbrother.\n\nGINA\nIs this what you want Tony?...\n\nTony shocked.\n\nGINA\nYou can't stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.\n\nShe fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.\n\nThe bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.\n\nGINA\nI'm all yours Tony, I'm all yours now.\n\nBullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.\n\nGINA\nCome and get me Tony. Before it's too late.\n\nHe spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put\ndistance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an\nexpression like a demented angel.\n\nGINA\nCome on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!\n\nAdvancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair\nspilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony\nsquirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling\nover to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:\n\nA young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the\nhitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.\nHe doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.\n\nGina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the\nroom, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.\n\nTony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.\nThe punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.\n\nThe punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds\nat the base of the balcony.\nTony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and\nempties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.\n\nErnie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---\n\nERNIE\nGet outta here!\nTony, they're everywhere!\n\nErnie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.\n\nWe catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,\nmoving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly\nunderneath the balcony on which Tony stands.\n\nTony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back\ninto his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.\nIt takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.\n\nTONY\n(gently)\nHey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.\n\nRunning his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers.\n\nTONY tx:\nCome on Gina, get off the floor.\nYou're all dirty now, you need a bath...\nMami's gonna be angry baby\n-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..\nCome on open your eyes my baby,\nopen your eyes.. -give me a smile.\n\nThere's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.\nOne of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door\npounding it.\n\nCHI-CHI\nBoss ! Hey boss. Open up!\n\nOn the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire\ndown into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade\ngoes off, blows him up against the door.\n\nTONY\nCheeee!\n\nHe now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his\nsideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.\n\nOn the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the\nfoyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.\nThree of them are already huddled outside the door, around\nthe corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.\n\nTony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,\ntalking to himself.\n\nTONY\nSo you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.\n\nKarroooomph!\nThe rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.\nIt sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.\n\nTony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex\nof the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.\n\nTONY\nWhores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?\n\nAnother hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.\n\nTONY\nWho you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes. I take you all to fuckin' hell!\n\nAnother hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.\nA grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing\naway.

The boys hare off just ahead of them. They take a turn down a back alley way and the crowds of screaming girls are after them.\n\n2.\tEXT. TERMINAL\n\nThey rush on through the narrow cobbled passageway and into the main station, quickly show their tickets at the barrier for the London train, and get onto the platform as hordes of yelling and screaming girls reach the closed gates.\n\n3.\tEXT. TERMINAL PLATFORM\n\nWe see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines, and endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in their haste to get onto the platform to see the boys.\nNORM has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to where all their baggage, instruments and the drums are waiting, piled up to be put into the guards' van. The boys turn and see the oncoming stream of girls pushing through the barriers and descending on them with yells and shouts. They grab their instruments, RINGO makes for the drums. NORM plugs into a handy transformer and using their instruments like a gun volley to stop the onrush of females, the boys blast fire into a number and start to sing. This stops the girls in their tracks and they settle down on whatever they can to listen to them playing.\n\nAs the boys are playing, we CUT BACK into the crowds. In the centre we see PAUL struggling and pulling to fight his way through the girls to join the other boys. He is dragging a very reluctant old man behind him. The old man seems most disgruntled and we can see by his gestures how unwilling he is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the girls.\n\nAt last PAUL reaches the other boys. He sits the old man down on a pile of cases and joins in the number to the squeals of delight from the fans. The old man sits aloof and proud ignoring the whole proceedings. JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO look enquiringly at PAUL who gives a noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say, \"it's not my fault\" and the number proceeds.\n\nSHOT of sudden horror on JOHN's face. PAUL follows his eye line only to see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily collecting money from a disconcerted crowd. PAUL dives hastily into the crowd, and with suitable apologies extracts the old man and with a long suffering sigh drags him back to the group. GEORGE and PAUL hold him firmly as they finish the number, the old man standing there between them.\n\nAs the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with delight, the guard blows his whistle. NORM and SHAKE grab the instruments and the drums, and with the rest piles the lot into the guards' van. The BOYS head into their reserved compartment pursued by the fans but the train moves off. They have successfully repelled all extra boarders.\n\nTHE BOYS stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line ... the girls running along to the end of the platform waving and calling out.\n\n4.\tINTERIOR  RESERVED COMPARTMENT IN THE TRAIN\n\nThe boys relax, sitting down on one side of the compartment. They are about to settle down and make themselves at home when first RINGO nudges GEORGE who in turn nudges JOHN. Opposite them is sitting the LITTLE OLD MAN. He is holding himself stiff, erect and very aloof.\n\nThe three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate sniff he looks away from them and out of the window.\n\nPAUL catches his eye and winks at the LITTLE OLD MAN. He winks back at PAUL, scowls at the other three then looks firmly out of the window again.\n\nThe boys turn on PAUL crowding around him.\n\nJOHN\nEh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?\n\nPAUL\nWhat little old man?\nJOHN\n(pointing)\nThat little old man.\n\nPAUL\nOh, that one. That's me Grandfather.\n\nGEORGE\nThat's not your Grandfather.\n\nPAUL\nIt is, y'know.\n\nGEORGE\nBut your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.\n\nPAUL\nOh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.\n\nJOHN\nHow d'you reckon that one out?\n\nPAUL\nWell ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.\n\nJOHN\n(long suffering)\nWell we know that but what's he doing here?\nPAUL\nWell, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.\n\nRINGO\nHow's that?\n\nPAUL\nOh ... he's nursing a broken heart.\n\nThe lads all look intently at the GRANDFATHER.\n\nJOHN\nAah ... the poor old thing.\n\nHe leans across to GRANDFATHER.\n\nJOHN\nEh, Mister... are you nursing a broken heart then?\n\nThe GRANDFATHER nods soulfully glares at him, in a way that indicates yes.\n\nPAUL\n(whispering)\nYou see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.\n\nGEORGE\nA butcher?\n\nPAUL\nYeah, she was fickle.\n\nJOHN\nAye and fond of fresh meat and all.\n\nPAUL\n(seriously)\nNo ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.\n\nJOHN\nOh, I see.\n\nHe inspects GRANDFATHER carefully.\n\nJOHN\n(to PAUL)\nEh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?\n\nPAUL\nOh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.\n\nThey all agree with PAUL.\n\nJOHN has been examining GRANDFATHER. He now leans forward to him.\n\nJOHN\n(in an over-friendly voice)\nHello, Grandfather!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHello.\n\nJOHN\n(delightedly)\nHe can talk then?\n\nPAUL\n(indignantly)\nCourse he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?\n\nRINGO\n(grinning)\nWell ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?\n\nThe lads all laugh.\n\nJOHN\nAnd we're looking after him, are we?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI'll look after meself.\n\nPAUL\nAye, that's what I'm afraid of!\n\nJOHN\nHe's got you worried, then?\n\nPAUL\nHim, he costs you a fortune in breach-of-promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.\n\nGEORGE\n(disbelieving)\nGerron.\n\nPAUL\nNo, straight up.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThe lad's given you the simple truth. I'm cursed wid irresistible charm, I'm too attractive to be let loose.\n\nAt this moment, SHAKE, a tall man who works with the BOYS, pulls open the door of the compartment.\n\nSHAKE\nYou got on all right then?\n\nBOYS\nHi, Shake.\n\nSHAKE\nWe're here. Norm'll be along in a mo' with the tickets.\n\nHe sees GRANDFATHER.\n\nSHAKE\nMorning!\n(whispers)\nWho's that little old man?\n\nGEORGE\nIt's Paul's grandfather.\n\nSHAKE\nOh aye, but I thought ...\n\nJOHN\n(cutting in)\nNo, that's his other one.\n\nSHAKE\nThat's all right then.\n\nJOHN\n(displaying Grandfather)\nClean though, isn't he?\n\nSHAKE\nOh yes, he's clean all right.\n\nNORM the road manager appears behind SHAKE.\n\nNORM\nMorning, lads.\n\nBOYS\nMorning ... Hi, Norm.\n\nNORM\n(checking them quickly)\nWell, thank God you're all got here. Now, listen, I've had this marvellous idea ... now just for a change, let's all behave like ordinary responsible citizens. Let's not cause any trouble, pull any strokes or do anything I'm going to be sorry for, especially tomorrow at the television theatre, because ...\n\nHe looks sharply at JOHN who is polishing his nails.\n\nNORM\nAre you listening to me, Lennon?\n\nJOHN\n(off-hand)\nYou're a swine, isn't he George?\n\nGEORGE\n(disinterested)\nYeah ... a swine.\n\nNORM\n(just as indifferent)\nThanks...\n\nHe sees the GRANDFATHER.\n\nNORM\nEh ... .\n\nBOYS IN CHORUS\n... Who's that little old man?\n\nNORM\nWell, who is he?\n\nRINGO\nHe belongs to Paul.\n\nNORM\n(accepting the situation)\nAh well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?\n\nPAUL\nWe'll follow you down.\n\nGRANDFATHER rises.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI want me coffee.\n\nNORM\nHe can come with Shake and me if you like.\n\nPAUL\nWell, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.\n\nNORM\nDon't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.\n\nGRANDFATHER joins SHAKE and NORM.\n\nNORM\n(over Grandfather's head)\nHe's very clean, isn't he?\n\nSHAKE and NORM collect GRANDFATHER and are in the process of leaving the compartment when a fat upper class city Englishman, JOHNSON, attempts to enter. There is a bit of confusion and they get tangled up with each other.\n\nJOHNSON\nMake up your minds, will you!\n\nAt last SHAKE, NORM and GRANDFATHER sort themselves out and JOHNSON enters with his case. The other three go to coffee.\n\nJOHNSON puts his case up on the luggage rack, then sits down. All his movements are disgruntled ... he finally picks up his copy of the Financial Times and burying himself behind it, starts to read. After a moment he looks up, notices the compartment window is open. He gets up and without so much as a \"by your leave\" he closes it, glares at the BOYS and sits down again.\n\nThe boys exchange looks as if to say ... \"Hello, Saucy!!\"\n\nPAUL\n(politely)\nDo you mind if we have it opened?\n\nJOHNSON\n(briefly)\nYes, I do.\n\nJOHN\nYeah, but there are four of us, like, and we'd like it open, if it's all the same to you, that is.\n\nJOHNSON\n(rudely)\nWell, it isn't. I travel on this train regularly twice a week, so I suppose I've some rights.\n\nRINGO\nAye, well, so have we.\n\nHe disappears behind his paper before the BOYS can say another word.\n\nRINGO pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his portable radio. A pop number is playing.\n\nJOHNSON puts down his paper firmly.\n\nJOHNSON\nAnd we'll have that thing off as well, thank you.\n\nRINGO\nBut I ...\n\nJOHNSON leans over and switches it off.\n\nJOHNSON\nAn elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts would tell you I'm perfectly within my rights.\n\nHe smiles frostily.\n\nPAUL\nYeah, but we want to hear it and there's more of us than you. We're a community, like, a majority vote. Up the workers and all that stuff!\n\nJOHNSON\nThen I suggest you take that damned thing into the corridor or some other part of the train where you obviously belong.\n\nJOHN\n(leaning forward to him)\nGie's a kiss!\n\nPAUL\nShurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.\n\nJOHNSON\nI travel on this train regularly, twice a week.\n\nJOHN\nKnock it off, Paul, y' can't win with his sort. After all, it's his train, isn't it, Mister?\n\nJOHNSON\nAnd don't you take that tone with me, young man!\n\nGEORGE\nBut...\n\nJOHNSON\n(accusingly)\nI fought the war for your sort.\n\nRINGO\nBet you're sorry you won!\n\nJOHNSON\nI'll call the guard!\n\nPAUL\nAye ... but what? They don't take kindly to insults you know. Ah, come on, you lot. Let's get a cup of coffee and leave Toby the manger.\n\nThe boys troop out of the door into the corridor. JOHNSON smiles triumphantly. He is about to settle down to his paper when there is a tap on the corridor window. He looks up and we see pressed against the window a collection of hideous Beatle faces.\n\nPAUL\nEh, Mister ... can we have our ball back!\n\nThe man jumps to his feet.\n\n\n5.\tINTERIOR  OF THE CORRIDOR\n\nThe boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear round the corner.\n\n\n6.\tINTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR\n\nFrom the P.O.V. of the door leading to the restaurant car.\n\nThe boys come down the corridor in full flight, laughing away like happy idiots. GEORGE and PAUL pull open the sliding doors. The boys look inside.\n\n7.\tINTERIOR  RESTAURANT CAR\n\nFrom their P.O.V. we see the car is half empty and at a table in the centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting. On the table is a pile of photos of the boys. NORM and SHAKE are arguing. NORM is being very aggressive, much to SHAKE's discomfort.\n\nNORM\nYeah, you want to watch it.\n\nSHAKE\n(unhappily)\nIt's not my fault.\n\nNORM\nWell, you stick to that story, son.\n\nSHAKE\nI can't help it, I'm just taller than you.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(To NORM slyly)\nThey always say that.\n\nNORM\nYeah, well I got me eye on you.\n\nSHAKE\nI'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller\nthan you.\n\nNORM\nWell, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ...\n(he is about to thump SHAKE.)\n\nJOHN\n(enjoying himself)\nIf you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.\n\nNORM\nHe started it.\n\nSHAKE\nNo, I didn't you did ...\n\nGEORGE\nWell, what happened?\n\nSHAKE\nThe old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'\n\nPAUL\nAnd?\n\nNORM\nYour Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.\n\nPAUL\nI knew it, he started it, I should have known.\n\nNORM\nY'what?\n\nPAUL\nYou two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.\n\nThe BOYS, i.e., JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO, look at each other then at PAUL.\n\nPAUL\nAye and we'll have to watch it and all.\n\nGEORGE\nI suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.\n\nNORM\nYou're right. Here you are, old devil.\n\nSHAKE and NORM leave. GRANDFATHER grins triumphantly and collects them, then with a sweet smile he turns to PAUL.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWould you ever sign this one for us, Pauly?\n\nPAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he gets suspicious. GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so PAUL finishes signing.\n\nJOHN\nCome on let's get this coffee.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nBefore you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!\n\nJOHN, RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away. They all pretend to be girls, RINGO jumps into PAUL's arms.\n\nGEORGE\n(coyly)\nOh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!\n\nJOHN\n(invitingly, in a Marlene Dietrich voice)\nIf I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?\n\nPAUL\n(choked)\nI'll murder you, Grandfather!\n\nJOHN waltzes PAUL down to an empty table and the lads sit down.\n\nGEORGE\nEh, look at that talent.\n\nThey all gaze across the aisle. From their P.O.V. we see two very attractive young girls, RITA and JEAN, having coffee.\n\nJOHN\nGive 'em a pull.\n\nPAUL\nShall I?\n\nGEORGE\nAye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.\n\nPAUL\nNow what's that supposed to mean?\n\nGEORGE\n(grinning)\nI don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?\n\nJOHN\nGeorge Harrison, The Scouse of Distinction.\n\nWe follow PAUL as he crosses over to the two girls. He places a bowler on his head.\n\nPAUL\n(in posh accent)\nExcuse me, but these young men I'm sitting with wondered if two of us could join you; I'd ask you meself only I'm shy.\n\nThe two girls giggle together.\n\nJOHN and GEORGE are about to move over when GRANDFATHER suddenly appears by their sides.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(sternly)\nI'm sorry, miss, but you mustn't fraternise with my prisoners.\n\nJEAN\nPrisoners!!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nConvicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs. Typical old lags, the lot of 'em.\n\nTHE BOYS\nY'what!!!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nQuiet, you lot, or I'll give you a touch of me truncheon.\n(He points at Ringo)\nThat little one's the worst. If we don't keep him on tablets he has fits.\n\nRINGO\n(protesting)\nNow look here!!\n\nGRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces them into RINGO'S mouth.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nGet out while you can, ladies, his time's\ncoming round for one of his turns.\n\nThe frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car. The boys look in amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER. They are completely flabbergasted. GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly.\n\n\n8.\tINTERIOR OF RAILWAY COMPARTMENT\n\nSHAKE and NORM are seated. SHAKE is buried in a science fiction book.\n\nNORM looks at his watch, slightly worried.\n\nNORM\nHe's been gone a long time.\n\nSHAKE\n(without looking up)\nWho?\n\nNORM\nPaul's grandfather.\n\nSHAKE\nOh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?\n\nNORM\nDown the ... er ...\n\nSHAKE\nOh, down the ... er ...?\n\nNORM\nYeah, down the ... er ...\n\nSHAKE\nWell, give a couple of minutes ...\n\nHe resumes reading. But NORM goes on worrying.\n\n9.\tINTERIOR OF ANOTHER RAILWAY COMPARTMENT\n\nGrandfather is in full flight of conversation with a charming elderly lady, AUDREY, who is listening intently.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(proudly)\nYes, I'm their manager, I discovered them.\n\nLADY AUDREY\nDid you indeed, Mr. McCartney?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nNow, Audrey, I told you, the name's John. We show biz people are a friendly lot.\n\nAUDREY\nOf course, John.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. \"Mister, can you spare us a copper?\" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.\n\nAUDREY\nThe usual ten per cent?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nOh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?\n\nAUDREY\n(her eyes lighting up)\nHow fascinating. Do go on ...\n(pause)\n... John.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...\n\n10.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN\n\nNORM and SHAKE meet with the BOYS as they are returning from coffee.\n\nNORM\nEh, have you got Paul's grandfather?\n\nJOHN\nOf course, he's concealed about me person.\n\nNORM\nNo ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.\n\nPAUL\n(accusingly)\nHave you lost him?\n\nNORM\nDon't exaggerate.\n\nPAUL\nYou've lost him.\n\nSHAKE\nPut it this way, he's mislaid him.\n\nPAUL\nYou can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.\n\nSHAKE\nHe can't be far.\n\nJOHN\nI hope he fell off.\n\nPAUL\n(mildly)\nDon't be callous.\n\nRINGO\nHe doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.\n\nGEORGE\nYou've got an inferiority complex, you have.\n\nRINGO\nYeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.\n\nJOHN and PAUL run down the corridor. SHAKE and NORM turn from the door and go in the opposite direction, GEORGE and RINGO follow after the other two boys.\n\n11.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR OF TRAIN\n\nPAUL and JOHN look into various compartments. CLOSE SHOT of RINGO looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho Marx. In one of the compartments we see from RINGO'S P.O.V. the occupant, a glamorous woman, TANIA, with a small lap dog.\n\nShe is beautifully and most expensively dressed. She looks up and sees RINGO.\n\nRINGO smiles at her and she smiles back. She then beckons him to join her.\n\nHe looks around to see if she means someone else. She nods a negative. RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say: \"Who, me?\"\n\nTANIA smiles enthusiastically.\n\nGEORGE has been watching all this.\n\nGEORGE\nAre you going in?\n\nRINGO\nNo, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.\n\nGEORGE\nYou never know, you might be lucky this time.\n\nRINGO\nNo, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.\n\nHe blows the glamorous lady a kiss, then moves sadly on.\n\n12.\tINTERIOR  FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR\n\nPAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN. The TWO GIRLS, RITA and JEAN, from the restaurant car are sitting there.\n\nPAUL\nExcuse me but have you seen that little old man we were with?\n\nThe girls jump up, surprised.\n\nJOHN\nWe've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!\n(he extends his hands as if handcuffed)\nEh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.\n\nPAUL\nWill you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...\n\nHe starts to drag JOHN after him.\n\nJOHN\nI was innocent. I was framed. I won't go back.\n\nJOHN is now by the door; he leers at the girls horribly.\n\nJOHN\nI bet you can guess what I was in for.\n\nHe cackles like a maniac before disappearing, the door closing after him.\n\nA waiter carrying a tray with champagne and glasses on it passes into one of the compartments with the blinds down.\n\nPAUL\nHow about that one?\n\nHe moves towards the compartment.\n\nPAUL\n(to Ringo and George)\nDid you look in here?\n\nGEORGE\nNo. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.\n\nPAUL\nWell, let's broaden our outlook.\n\nPAUL opens the door of the compartment.\n\n13.\tINTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT\n\nFrom the BOYS' P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly lady, AUDREY, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(looking up)\nCongratulate me, boys, I'm engaged.\n\nPAUL enters and crosses over to him.\n\nPAUL\nOh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nIt's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.\n\nPAUL\nOh, well that's all right.\n(realising)\nWhat?\n\nAUDREY\nYoung man, kindly moderate your tone when you address my fiance.\n\nPAUL\nI'm sorry, Missus, but the betrothal's off.\n(He grabs GRANDFATHER by the arm.)\nI'll refuse me consent, he's over-age!\n\nAUDREY grabs GRANDFATHER's other arm and pulls back.\n\nAUDREY\nLeave him alone, after all he's done for you is this the way you repay him?\n\nA tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY.\n\nPAUL\n(pulling)\nHim? he's never done anything for anybody in his life.\n\nAUDREY\n(pulling)\nYou dare to say that when even those ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!!\n\nJOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on.\n\nJOHN\nCome on, Auntie, you're winning.\n\nGEORGE\nGet in there, Paul, she's weakening.\n\nRINGO attempts to interfere.\n\nRINGO\nLook, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding, you see, he's ...\n\nAUDREY\nKeep away from me, you depraved lout, I know all about your terrible past.\n\nRINGO\nY'what?\n\nShe hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling with PAUL for GRANDFATHER. RINGO grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him.\n\nRINGO\nHe's given me a bad character, blackguarding me name to all and sundry. He's got to be stopped. It's not fair.\n\nRINGO pushes out into the corridor, forgetting that he is holding the woman's handbag.\n\nA voice shouts off from outside.\n\nVOICE OFF\nThat's one of them ... stop thief!\n\n14.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR\n\nFrom Ringo's P.O.V. we see down to the right the city man, JOHNSON, approaching with a GUARD. RINGO turns the other way to the left when he is joined by [the] three other boys. From their P.O.V. down the corridor we see the two girls, autograph books in hand, followed by ten girls from the same school.\n\nBoth groups are closing in on the BOYS. There's no escape.\n\nRINGO\n(looking down at the handbag in his hand)\nOh Mother!!\n\n15.\tINTERIOR  LUGGAGE VAN\n\nVery dark, and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER. He is sitting crouched up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable. He turns towards the CAMERA; in the foreground of the SHOT we see PAUL standing.\nIn the background an impassive GUARD is reading a paper which he does throughout the scene.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(bitterly)\nAnd to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!\n\nPAUL\nDon't dramatise.\n\nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage compartment of the guards' van. In with him are a crate of chickens and a dog. The chickens peck at him; GRANDFATHER moves listlessly away.\n\nPAUL\nLet's face it, you're lucky to be here. If they'd have had their way you'd have been dropped off at Stafford already.\n\nGRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so he can still see his face.\n\nPAUL\nWell, you've got to admit you've upset a lot of people. At least I can keep my eye on you while you're stuck in here.\n\nGRANDFATHER turns away again.\n\nPAUL\nAll right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...\n\nGRANDFATHER\nA harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.\n\nPAUL\nOh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(cutting in)\nYou're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?\n\nPAUL\nYeah ... so what?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWhy do you always use your left hand?\n\nPAUL\nWell, don't be daft, I've got to.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.\n\nPAUL grins. After a moment of looking at him, PAUL opens the door of\nthe luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a box.\n\nPAUL\nShove up!\n\nGRANDFATHER produces a penny.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nOdds or evens?\n\nPAUL sighs.\n\nPAUL\nOdds.\n\nGRANDFATHER flips the coin.\n\nThe guards' van door opens and JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO come in, with them are the girls, RITA and JEAN.\n\nJOHN\n(as he sees PAUL behind the bars)\nDon't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.\n\nPAUL\nOh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.\n(to Ringo)\nAnyroad up ... It's all your fault.\n\nRINGO\nMe? Why?\n\nGEORGE\nBag-snatcher.\nGRANDFATHER\nThat's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.\n\nJOHN\n(casually)\nEvery morning.\n\nJOHN has been looking around the guards' van.\n\nJOHN\nGaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...\n(he pats the dog)\n'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.\n(he shudders)\nCome on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.\n\nPAUL\nLike what?\n\nJOHN\nWell, I've got me gob stopper.\n(he produces his mouth organ.)\nLook, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.\n\nAnd to RINGO's beat on a tea chest they are off, PAUL and GEORGE improvising other sounds, much to the GIRLS' delight. During the number, GRANDFATHER quietly lets the latch off the chicken crate and chickens begin to wander through the scene.\n\n16.\tEXTERIOR  TRAIN IN MOTION FROM ABOVE (NIGHT)\n\nWhile the number is progressing, the train is getting nearer and nearer to London.\n\n17.\tEXTERIOR  PLATFORM TERMINUS (NIGHT)\n\nSHOTS of the station full of GIRLS waiting for the BOYS.\n\n18.\tINTERIOR  GUARDS VAN\n\nBy the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a sharp halt that sends them all sprawling, BOYS and GIRLS.\n\nNORM enters the guards' van.\n\nNORM\nDon't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.\n\nJOHN\nPlease, can I have one to surge with?\n\nNORM\nNo.\n\nJOHN\nAh, go on, you swine.\n\nNORM\nNo, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.\n\nHe points and we see a big car parked across the road.\n\nThe BOYS prepare to depart, lining up with GRANDFATHER at the door.\n\n19.\tEXTERIOR  PLATFORM TERMINUS\n\nJust as they are ready to go, a line of taxis draws up parallel to the train and now separates them from the big car waiting for them.\n\nNORM\nOh no!\n\nGRANDFATHER pushes past the BOYS, holding his coat closed.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAll right, lads, follow me.\n\nAnd before NORM can stop him, he darts out of the door, PAUL after him. The fans further down the platform see PAUL and charge forward ... in a panic NORM and the others follow, JOHN just having time to kiss both the girls.\n\nJOHN\nVive l'amour!\n\nNORM drags him away.\n\n20.\tEXTERIOR  RAILWAY STATION\n\nThe BOYS manage to follow GRANDFATHER by leaping onto a motorized luggage carrier, GEORGE driving and the other three posing as a frozen tableau on the back. GRANDFATHER has arrived at a taxi door. He flings it open and runs through, opening the other door, thus making a safe bridge to the car.\n\nThe BOYS follow and manage to make it to the big car safely. They run towards grandfather's taxi. The FANS have followed the BOYS and we see streams of GIRLS piling through all the taxis one of which contains JOHNSON the city man, opening and shutting the doors to get through, much to the indignation of the TAXI DRIVERS.\n21.\tINTERIOR  BIG CAR\n\nNORM is sitting in front with the driver, FRANK. The four BOYS and GRANDFATHER are squashed together in the back.\n\nNORM\n(to the driver)\nGo like the clappers, son!\n\nFRANK\n(smoothly)\nThat was my entire intention, sir.\n\n22.\tEXTERIOR  STATION\n\nThe car moves off surrounded by the FANS; from a height we see them converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of the station and off.\n\nIt moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey to the hotel begins.\n\n23.\tINTERIOR  HOTEL SUITE  NIGHT\n\nThere is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are presumably bedrooms, bathroom, etc. JOHN is lying sprawled out on a settee listening to a transistor radio, demolishing a basket of fruit. PAUL is sitting at an upright piano and GRANDFATHER is mooching about the room. One of the doors opens and GEORGE enters followed by RINGO, none of the BOYS are wearing coats.\n\nRINGO\nI don't snore.\n\nGEORGE\nYou do - repeatedly.\n\nRINGO\n(to John)\nDo I snore?\n\nJOHN\n(eating a banana)\nYou're a window rattler, son.\n\nRINGO\nWell, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?\n\nPAUL\n(stopping playing)\nWith a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nDon't mock the afflicted, Pauly.\n\nPAUL\nOh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWell, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.\n\nNORM enters with three piles of fan mail and places them in front of JOHN on a table. RINGO is almost in tears, examining his nose in a mirror.\n\nNORM\nPaul, John, George - get at it.\n\nJOHN\nHello the income tax have caught up with us at last.\n\nPAUL and GEORGE gather round the low table. RINGO is left out of it.\n\nRINGO\nNone for me, then?\n\nNORM\nSorry.\n\nJohn hands RINGO a single envelope.\n\nJOHN\nThat'll keep you busy.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nIt's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...\n\nRINGO\nYou go and pick on your own.\n\nSHAKE enters with a stack of mail about three times larger than all the others put together.\n\nJOHN\nIs that yours?\n\nSHAKE\nFor Ringo.\n\nHe dumps it in Ringo's arms who staggers into an armchair. The BOYS send him up.\n\nJOHN\nThat must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.\n\nGEORGE\nHe comes from a large family.\n\nRINGO\n(dumping the letters)\nWell.\n\nRINGO opens his letter and reads it. It contains a large embossed card.\n\nRINGO\nEh, what's Boyd's Club?\n\nThe lads gather round him and PAUL takes the card from him and reads.\n\nPAUL\n\"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr Richard Starkey\"--that's you--\"in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet.\" Blimey!\n\nRINGO\n(surprised)\nAnd they want me?\n\nJOHN\nOh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.\n\nNORM\n(snatching the card)\nWell you're not going.\n\nRINGO\nAh.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(taking card from Norm)\nQuite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!\n\nHe pockets the card himself.\n\nRINGO\nThat's mine.\n\nNORM\nHave done, and you lot get your pens out.\n\nBOYS\nWhy?\n\nNORM\nIt's homework time for all you college puddings. I want this lot\n(he indicates the fan letters)\nall answered tonight.\n\nThe BOYS all protest.\n\nNORM\nI'll brook no denial!\n\nJOHN\nIt's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.\n\nNORM\nCome on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their\npenmanship.\n\nHe goes followed by SHAKE.\n\nThere is a pause and JOHN deliberately rises slowly and crosses to his coat. He puts it on and walks to the door.\n\nJOHN\nWhile the swine's away the piglets can play. Well, come on, what are we waiting for?\n\nWith a whoop PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO collect their coats and head for the door.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWhat about all these letters?\n\nBOYS\nRead 'em!\n\nThey disappear. After a moment GRANDFATHER takes out Ringo's card.\n\nC.U. GRANDFATHER\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd a free champagne buffet.\n\nHe grins to himself. At this moment a WAITER enters with a tray. He is clad in tails and GRANDFATHER eyes them longingly, measuring himself the while alongside the startled waiter. He leaves us with no doubt in our minds what he wants, i.e., the waiter's suit.\n\n\n24.\tINTERIOR  DANCING CLUB  NIGHT\n\nThe club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all enjoying themselves. The CAMERA wanders around the club till it finally picks out JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO all crowded around one small table. The music is blaring away from a juke box and the BOYS join the dancers. They are recognised and given smiles and nods of encouragement\nby all the other customers. During this scene we\n\nCUT AWAY\n\n25.\tINTERIOR  BOYD'S CLUB  NIGHT\n\nThe whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth. Around the baccarat table the rich, bored customers sit barely moving a face muscle as they languidly murmur \"suivez\" and \"banco\" to the dealer as he operates the shoe. The manager of the club is beaming with satisfaction as he surveys his customers. One of these customers is clad in evening dress and he has his back to us. The rest of the players (male) are in suits. By each of them is standing a lush lady with a bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted on. From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary evening dress player is GRANDFATHER. He looks around him and wipes off his look of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores everyone in the room.\n\nDEALER\nAlors, M'sieur?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(nonchalant)\nSoufl\u00e9e.\n\nHe turns to the buxom BLONDE, who is dripping over him.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI bet you're a great swimmer. My turn? Bingo!\n\nCROUPIER\nPas \"Bingo,\" M'sieur... Banco.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(taking)\nI'll take the little darlings anyway.\n\nHe takes up the cards and can't understand that they are unnumbered.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nTwo and one is three, carry one is four.\n\nThe buxom BLONDE leans over him.\n\nBLONDE\nLay them down.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(disturbed by his eyeline)\nEh?\n\nBLONDE\nLay them down.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWe'd be thrown out.\n\nBLONDE\nYour cards... lay them down... face up.\n\nHe does so.\n\nCROUPIER\nHuit \u00e0 la pointe... et sept.\n(He pushes chips and box to Grandfather.)\n\nBLONDE\nYou had a lovely little pair, y'see.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI did?\n\nCROUPIER taps impatiently on box (shoe).\n\nBLONDE\nThey're yours.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThey are?\n\nBLONDE\nThe cards... you're bank.\n\n26.\tINTERIOR  DANCING CLUB\n\nThe BOYS are having a rare old time and the place is really moving.\n\n27.\tINTERIOR  BOYD'S CLUB\n\nGRANDFATHER is playing and a waiter is checking the requirements of the players.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nBingo!\n\nCROUPIER\n(wearily)\nM'lord dit \"Bingo.\"\n\nWAITER\n(to Grandfather)\nA little light refreshment.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(lordly)\nA glass of the old chablis to wash down a gesture of giblets wouldn't go amiss.\n(He resumes his game.)\nSoufl\u00e9e, chop chop.\n\nThe CROUPIER uses the spatula to pick up a card. GRANDFATHER grabs it and scoops some sandwiches off a passing tray.\n28.\tINTERIOR  DANCING CLUB\n\nThe BOYS are at their table again laughing and enjoying themselves, when suddenly their faces freeze.\n\nFrom their P.O.V. we see NORM standing glowering down at them. With him is SHAKE. Reluctantly the BOYS arise and follow NORM out.\n\n29.\tINTERIOR  BOYD'S\n\nGRANDFATHER is looking worried at the call of the card he loses and we see that all his chips have gone. He notices the waiter delivering snacks and champagne to a couple, so quick as a flash, he places a handkerchief over his arm and writing a bill out on a piece of paper, presents it to the couple and collects payment in chips. He then resumes playing.\n\n30.\tINTERIOR  HOTEL ROOM\n\nWaiter is sitting on chair in underclothes, reading. He hears a noise, says \"The manager!\" and hides in outer clothes closet. NORM and the BOYS enter saying:\n\nNORM\nNow get on with it.\n\nJOHN\nWe were going to do it.\n\nNORM\nAye, well, now!\n(He goes through bedroom.)\n\nRINGO goes to hang up coat in closet. He does so, then crosses to rest.\n\nRINGO\nAny of you lot put a man in that cupboard?\n\nALL\nA man? No.\n\nRINGO\nWell somebody did.\n\nGEORGE goes to cupboard. We see the WAITER from his P.O.V. He closes door, returns to group.\n\nGEORGE\nHe's right, y'know.\n\nBOYS\n(disinterested)\nAh well, there you go.\n\nSHAKE enters front door, goes to hang up coat and drags WAITER out.\n\nSHAKE\nEh, what's all this?\n\nPAUL\nOh, him... He's been lurking.\n\nJOHN\nAye, he looks a right lurker.\n\nSHAKE\n(to WAITER)\nYou're undressed. Where are your clothes?\n\nWAITER\nThe old gentlemen borrowed them to go gambling at Boyd's.\n\nPAUL\nNo!\n\nRINGO\nOh, he's gone to my club, has he?\n\nPAUL\n(turning on Ringo)\nYeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.\n\nJOHN\nWell, what are we waiting for?\n\nSHAKE\nAye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours\nis worse than any of you lot.\n\n31.\tINTERIOR  BOYD'S\n\nGRANDFATHER is drinking champagne in locked arms with BLONDE.\n\nWAITER\nEncore de champagne, Monsieur?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYes, and I'll have some more champagne as well.\n\nHe takes another swig of his glass.\n\nMANAGER\n(beaming)\nLord John McCartney, he's the millionaire Irish Peer, filthy rich of course.\n\nCUSTOMER\nOh I don't know, looks rather clean to me.\n\nThe MANAGER comes to grandfather's side.\n\nMANAGER\nPlay is about to resume, m'lord.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(handing him a chip)\nLead me to it, I've a winning itch that only success can pacify.\n\nHe takes his place at the table. The MANAGER watches for a moment then moves away from the table towards the club reception desk.\n\n32.\tINTERIOR  RECEPTION DESK  BOYD'S CLUB\n\nJOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, NORM and SHAKE are trying to gain entrance.\n\nATTENDANT\nI'm sorry sir, members and invited guests only.\n\nPAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, JOHN\nI've got to get in.\nIt's urgent and important.\nI've had an invite.\nTake me to your leader.\n\nNORM\nShurrup.\n\nThe BOYS do and meanwhile the MANAGER has walked into SHOT. He recognises the BOYS and welcomes them with false enthusiasm. They all start to enter the main room.\n\nNORM\nAll we want to know is have you got a little\nold man in there?\n\nMANAGER\n(pleasantly)\nDo you mean Lord McCartney?\n\nCLOSE-UP PAUL\n\nPAUL\nHe's at it again. Look, I'm his grandfather... I mean...\n\nBLONDE\n(standing next to Grandfather)\nOh, it must be the dolly floor show.\n\nJOHN\nStay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWho are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... (etc.)\n\nThey grab the protesting GRANDFATHER and drag him into the reception area. He keeps trying to return to BLONDE and table. GEORGE and RINGO each take an end of the velvet cord hanging between the two stanchions. They exchange ends and re-hook it, thus encircling GRANDFATHER by the\nentrance desk. They then go to settle up.\n\nMANAGER\n(with false charm)\nBefore you go, gentlemen, there's the small matter of the bill.\n\nHe snaps his fingers and a waiter hands him the bill.\n\nNORM\n(taking it)\nI'll settle that.\n\nHe glances at it.\n\nNORM\nA hundred and eighty pounds!\n\nMANAGER\n(icily)\nI beg your pardon, guineas.\n\nAt that moment a WAITER appears with a tray full of pound notes.\n\nWAITER\nYour winnings, my lord, one hundred and ninety\npounds.\n\nThe MANAGER tears up the bill and takes the money.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHow about me change?\n\nMANAGER\nCloak room charge.\n\nHe hands GRANDFATHER his old mackintosh.\n\nRINGO\n(brightly)\nAh well, easy come, easy go.\n\nThe others glower at him.\n\nRINGO\nWell.\n\n33.\tINTERIOR  BIG CAR (MOVING ON WAY TO STUDIOS)\n\nThe BOYS have settled down.\n\nJOHN\nShould I say it?\n\nGEORGE\nFollow your impulse.\n\nRINGO\nIt'll only get you into trouble.\n\nJOHN\n(to RINGO)\nAah, shurrup, misery!\n\nJOHN slouches forward.\n\nJOHN\n(urgently)\nO.K. Driver, follow that car!!\n\nThe driver [Frank] is an urbane young man in a handsome grey uniform.\n\nFRANK\n(indicating the traffic)\nWould you like to be a little more precise, sir?\n\nJOHN\nWell, that's the wrong line for a start.\n\nFRANK\nSorry?\n(meaning: \"I beg your pardon.\")\n\nGEORGE\nOh, don't pay any attention to him, he was just fulfilling a lifelong ambition.\n\nFRANK\nI see.\n\nJOHN\nYeah, you know, \"O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!\"\n\nFRANK\nOh, yes, now I'm with you.\n[he changes his accent]\nBut, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...\n\nThe car is stopped in traffic behind a bus. JOHN gets out of car and walks to the front. JOHN leans in window delightedly, he flashes his wallet.\n\nJOHN\nEver seen one of these before?\n\nFRANK\nAh ... a shamus, eh?\n\nJOHN\nI see you go to the night court.\n\nFRANK\nI've made the scene.\n\nJOHN\nWell, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.\n\nGEORGE\nI don't think that bit's right.\n\nJOHN\nWhat do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?\n\n\n34.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nAs the big car overtakes a Company Director's Rolls. JOHN lowers his window and the boys let out an imaginary hail of bullets at the Executive in the back. He reacts violently and starts to shout at them. As he does so, he presses the button of his window, so that we hear only part of it. But what we do is unpleasant. He immediately presses the button and the window rises.\n\nRINGO and PAUL jump out of the car. RINGO takes two drumsticks from his coat pocket and, using them as banderillas, inserts them with style into the radiator grill (V.O. \"Ole\" from the BOYS). PAUL, then, using his coat as a matador's cloak, does a butterfly pass at the car which\nhas just started up, narrowly missing him, but he keeps in the matador position.\n\n35.\tINTERIOR  CAR\n\nNORM\nWill you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.\n\nJOHN\n(as Ringo and Paul climb in)\nWell, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.\n\nFRANK\n(to Norm)\nWe're nearly there, sir.\n\nJOHN\nEh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.\n\nCLOSE SHOT of a long suffering NORM.\n\nNORM\nAnd I was happy in the bakery. I'll never know\nwhy I left.\n\n36.\tEXTERIOR OF AN OLD VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL THEATRE\n\nWhich has been converted to the T.V. studios.\n\nThere are a few groups of GIRL FANS standing outside the front of the theatre, but against the kerb of the pavement is a night-watchman's canvas hut and brazier.\n\nThe car approaches.\n\n37.\tINTERIOR OF THE CAR\n\nNORM\nGet ready John, open the door and as it draws up, out you go and straight in.\n\nJOHN nods and opens the door. The FANS start to swarm 'round them. To escape, the BOYS dash into the night-watchman's canvas hut, pick it up and run with it to the stage door, revealing the night watchman, staring in astonishment.\n\nAt the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre.\n\n38.\tINTERIOR  STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE\n\nAs the BOYS enter, two P.R.O. men in dark suits, stiff white collars\nand old school ties step forward and smile menacingly.\n\nFIRST P.R.O. MAN\n(menacingly)\nPress conference, they're waiting for you.\n\nNORM\n(jovially)\nGive us a couple of shakes to get our breath.\n\nFIRST P.R.O. MAN\n(more menacingly)\nThey're waiting now!\n\nAnd without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle.\n\nPAUL\nEh this lot means it. They're even taking\nhostages.\n\nThe BOYS, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly disappearing NORM, who by now is half way up the stairs.\n\n39.\tINTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM\n\nIt is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve, standing behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches. The dark suited MEN enter with NORM and close behind them follow GRANDFATHER, SHAKE and the boys. The group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time to look about and see the food but before they can get to it, from all directions NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them..\n\nNow begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various PHOTOGRAPHERS using their flash attachments and REPORTERS to capture a Beatle and in the midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying to interview them. Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the room and while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks, to the annoyance of the BARMAIDS.\n\nEvery time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a drink, it is either too late, the plate is empty, or they are intercepted. The single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and pulling, heavy impersonal handling, the boys are just things to be placed like still life in one advantageous position after another. During the scene these individual exchanges take place:\n\nSOUND REPORTER\nWhat's your philosophy of life?\n\nJOHN\nI'm torn between Zen and I'm all right, Jack.\n\nREPORTER\nHas success changed your life?\n\nRINGO\nYes.\n\nREPORTER\nDo you like playing the guitar?\n\nGEORGE\nNext to kissing girls it's favourites.\n\nPAUL is surrounded by newspapermen.\n\nPAUL\nNo, actually, we're just good friends.\n\nHIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease their way out until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle; completely unnoticed, they slip through.\n\n40.\tINTERIOR  THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE\n\nThe BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper. GRANDFATHER and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches.\n\nPAUL\n(ironically)\nAnything to spare?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWe've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.\n\nGEORGE\nSure.\n(He does so).\n\nPAUL\nAh well. Eh, look!\n\nHe points, and from PAUL'S P.O.V. we see on stage, the setting up of the show, scenery and lights, cameras and sound equipment are being put into position by a small army of studio staff. DANCERS and SINGERS are milling about as well.\n\nPAUL\nLet's go and muck in.\n\nJOHN\nAye, before anyone stops us.\n\nThey exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and extended right into the stalls, which are partly covered up.\n\n41.\tINTERIOR  STAGE\n\nEveryone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS, who wander about and examine the studio equipment. A load of three drum sets are being brought on stage and a voice shouts out:\n\nVOICE\nHere, what about these electric guitars?\n\nSHAKE\nWhere are they?\n\nVOICE\nBack here, mate.\n\nSHAKE\n(going towards the voice)\nI'm coming.\n\nRINGO is busy setting up his drums, and men are setting up the other sets. He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER retrieves it and is about to tap the drum. The FLOOR MANAGER is a languid young man.\n\nRINGO\nLeave them drums alone.\n\nFLOOR MANAGER\nOh, surely one can have a tiny touch.\n\nRINGO\nIf you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm\nout on strike.\n\nFLOOR MANAGER\nAren't you being rather arbitrary?\n\nRINGO\nThat's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?\n\nFLOOR MANAGER\nSpoil sport!\n\nRINGO\nWell!\n\nRINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums. The FLOOR MANAGER is furious.\n\nGEORGE\nHe's very touchy about those his drums, they loom large in his legend.\n\nRINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop whatever they are up to and hurry over.\n\nPAUL\nWhat's up?\n\nGEORGE\n(pointing)\nHe's sulking again.\n\nJOHN\nI'll show him.\n\nHe picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO, who does a more complicated drum roll. GEORGE now joins in and to PAUL'S encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised. During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars are brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order. PAUL first, then JOHN and GEORGE take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel emerges one of their numbers.\n\n42.\tINTERIOR  RAMP\n\nAs the number finishes a baldheaded man (he is the T.V. director) storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress circle.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(with over-exaggerated calm)\nAll right I'm sorry and let's hear no more about it. If that's your opinion, you're probably right. Look, if you think I'm unsuitable let's have it out in the open, I can't stand these back-stage politics.\n\nBy the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN who takes the scene in his stride.\n\nJOHN\nAren't you tending to black and white this whole situation?\n\nDIRECTOR\nWell, quite honestly I wasn't expecting \"a musical arranger\" who would question my ability ... picture-wise.\n\nJOHN\n(to the others)\nI could listen to him for hours.\n\nPAUL\nHeave to, what's all this about a musical arranger?\n\nDIRECTOR\nMr. McCartney Senior!\n\nThe BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment GRANDFATHER appears from behind the DIRECTOR.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHey Pauly, they're trying to fob you off wid this musical charlatan but I've given him the test.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(bravely)\nI'm quite happy to be replaced.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(indicating the director)\nHe's a typical buck-passer.\n\nDIRECTOR\nI won an award.\n\nJOHN\nA likely story.\n\nDIRECTOR\nIt's on the wall in my office.\n\nAt this moment NORM comes on the stage, confident, cigar in mouth and serene.\n\nNORM\nHello our lot, everyone happy?\n\nThe BOYS, the DIRECTOR, FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn on him and stare silently.\n\nNORM\nAll right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.\n\nDIRECTOR\nPlease do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.\n\nHe glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back. The DIRECTOR walks away with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him.\n\nDIRECTOR\nGive me a bottle of milk and a packet of\nOblivion. Oh, it's a plot, I see it now, it's\nall a plot.\n\nThey go left towards the back-stage.\n\nNORM\n(producing key)\nNow, come on, I've got the key.\n\nHe leads the lads off right. RINGO is last as he is putting his drum sticks down safely.\n\nNORM and the BOYS turn on him.\n\nNORM\nLet's have you.\n\nJOHN\nCome on speedy!\n\nPAUL\nRingo!\n\nGEORGE\nWake up!\n\nRINGO glares at them and follows quickly. As the BOYS move off after NORM, they pass the next act waiting for rehearsal. It is an elegant man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting his cuff-links. Beside him is a free-standing sign reading \"Leslie Jackson and his ten disappearing doves.\" The BOYS pass him and go through the door. GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI can't tell you how much I've enjoyed your act.\n\nHe slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie. There is the sound of a dove, a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the man's coat and he and GRANDFATHER look down at the floor. The man glares at GRANDFATHER, takes out a pen from his pocket, crosses out \"10\" on his sign, and writes \"9\" in its place, puts the pen back in his pocket and starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performer's smile as he does.\n\n43.\tINTERIOR  THEATRE  BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR\n\nThe BOYS move down the narrow stairs, and out of the ground floor dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses. They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the actors are all making for the stage door. As the actors push past the boys we see the boys' excited faces, their mouths watering for the costumes. JOHN touches the costume on one actor.\n\nJOHN\n(to actor)\nGear costume!\n\nACTOR\n(eyeing him)\nSwap?\n\nNORM\nRight, first floor and no messing about.\n\nNORM, leading the way, goes up the stairs but as they turn the first corner they are confronted by a group of girls, a game of manners starts, \"after you,\" \"No, after you.\" NORM who is ahead of the group looks down on them in disgust.\n\nNORM\nLennon, leave them girls alone or I'll report you.\n\nThe BOYS let the GIRLS pass and resume the journey, always surrounded by people.\n\n44.\tINTERIOR  DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR\n\nRINGO'S attention is caught by a door. He crosses and opens it, looking out to a fire escape. The others join him and the four boys step through the door and onto the fire escape.\n\n45.\tEXTERIOR  TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE\n\nFrom the BOYS' P.O.V. we see down below into the property yard behind nthe theatre. It is a long narrow yard full of old coaches, motor cars and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre shows. Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow alleyways.\n\nThe BOYS scamper down the fire escape.\n\nWhen they reach the bottom of the alleyways, there is a large door. They open it and look through.\n\nFrom their P.O.V. we see a large green field quite empty. The boys step through the doorway into the field. We now see from a HELICOPTER SHOT the four BOYS standing together surrounded by space.\n\nIt is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day.\n\nThey look at each other and grin ... then first GEORGE and PAUL let out a whoop and run towards the centre of the field, after a moment JOHN and RINGO follow them. The BOYS pick up some loose straw and insert it under JOHN'S cap and sleeves, turning him into a scarecrow.\n\nThe four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another and generally horsing around. Out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and although there is no ball the game is fast and furious. After a few moments the long shadow of a man falls across the grass.\n\nMAN'S VOICE\n(off)\nI suppose you know this is private property.\n\nThe boys freeze.\n\nFrom their P.O.V. we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering at them. The boys exchange rueful glances and, under the big man's eye, mooch back towards the gateway they came in by. JOHN is the last to go through. He turns to the man.\n\nJOHN\nSorry if we hurt your field, Mister.\n46.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR  BACK-STAGE\n\nGRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor, a pile of photos under his arm.\n\n47.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  UNDERNEATH THE STAGE\n\nUnder the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage with lots of furniture and a single light is on; it is placed by the orchestra's entrance to the orchestra pit. GRANDFATHER comes down the stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light. He spreads the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and, adjusting an old- fashioned pair of glasses, ball-point pen in hand begins to copy the BOYS' signatures on to the fresh photos, tutting at his failures and chuckling at his successes. After a moment, there is a sound of someone coming down the stairs. GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of sight.\n\nThe menacing shadows appear on the stairway.\n\nNORM (voice off)\nThere's no one here.\n\nSHAKE (voice off)\nThis is the only way they could have gone.\n\nWe now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in, he is on some sort of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of some sort. Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends out of shot with a light that grows bigger above him.\n\n48.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE STAGE\n\nA rehearsal of the toast scene from a Strauss Operetta. The entire stage is full of SINGERS, glasses in hand they are singing away at each other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the audience. Slowly in-between the leading man and leading woman, who are about to embrace, a stage trap opens and a blinking, surprised, GRANDFATHER appears. Here we INTERCUT to the T.V. Control Room for amazed reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW.\n\nBack now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the leading man and woman rush into each other's arms, GRANDFATHER sandwiched between them.\n\n\n48A.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR AS BOYS PASS THRU ON WAY TO DRESSING ROOM\n\nJOHN is behind them. JOHN, BOYS and MILLIE are walking towards each other.\n\nMILLIE\n(as all pass)\nHello.\n\nJOHN\n(stopping... the boys carry on past, not noticing her)\nHello.\n\nMILLIE\nOh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...\n\nJOHN\nNo, not me.\n\nMILLIE\n(insistently)\nOh you are, I know you are.\n\nJOHN\nNo, I'm not.\n\nMILLIE\nYou are.\n\nJOHN\nI'm not, no.\n\nMILLIE\nWell, you look like him.\n\nJOHN\nOh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.\n\nMILLIE\nOh you do, look.\n\nJOHN looks at himself in the mirror.\n\nJOHN examines himself in the mirror carefully.\n\nJOHN\nMy eyes are lighter.\n\nMILLIE\n(agreeing)\nOh yes.\n\nJOHN\nAnd my nose...\n\nMILLIE\nWell, yes your nose is. Very.\n\nJOHN\nIs it?\n\nMILLIE\nI would have said so.\n\nJOHN\nAye, but you know him well.\n\nMILLIE\n(indignantly)\nNo I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.\n\nJOHN\n(knowingly)\nThat's what you tell me.\n\nMILLIE\n(suspiciously)\nWhat have you heard?\n\nJOHN\n(blandly)\nIt's all over the place, everyone knows.\n\nMILLIE\nIs it? Is it really?\n\nJOHN\nMind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.\n\nMILLIE\nI knew I could rely on you.\n\nJOHN\n(modestly)\nThanks.\n\nMILLIE touches his arm then walks away. After a moment she turns.\n\nMILLIE\nYou don't look like him at all.\n\nJOHN winks at her and she winks back.\n49.\tINTERIOR  DRESSING ROOM\n\nNORM and SHAKE enter the room. The BOYS' TAILOR is there waiting for the BOYS.\n\nSHAKE\nOh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.\n\nNORM\nThat's too easy for Lennon.\n\nHe crosses to door leading to fire escape.\n\nNORM\n(dramatically)\nHe's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.\n\nSHAKE\nYou're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.\n\nNORM\nOh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.\n\nSHAKE\nBut John hasn't got any.\n\nNORM\nWhat?\n\nSHAKE\nNerves.\n\nNORM\nI know, that's the trouble.\n\nHe puffs nervously at his cigarette.\n\nNORM\nOh, I've toyed with the idea of a ball and chain but he'd only rattle them at me... and in public and all. Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing me suffer.\n\nHe hears something.\n\nNORM\nGet behind that door, they're coming. Someone's coming. Quick, hide!\n\nThe two men hide behind the door. The boys enter the room, as JOHN is last he shuts the door and faces SHAKE and NORM.\n\nJOHN\nWhat are you doing there?\n\nSHAKE\nHiding.\n\nJOHN\nI think you're soft or something.\n\nNORM\nWe weren't hiding.\n\nTAILOR\nNow?\n\nNORM\nNow. We were trying to catch you redhanded. I thought I told you lot to stay here?\n\nRINGO\nWell ...\n\nNORM\nWhen I tell you to stay put, stay put.\n\nJOHN\n(down on his knees)\nDon't cane me, sir, I was led astray.\n\nNORM\nOh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting\nfor you in the studio.\n\nRINGO\nOh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.\n\nNORM\nGood lad, Ringo.\n\nPAUL\nOh, listen to teacher's pet.\n\nGEORGE\nYou crawler.\n\nJOHN\nHe's betrayed the class.\n\nRINGO\nOh, leave off!!!\n\nJOHN\nTemper! Temper!\n\nRINGO\nWell ...\n\nCLOSE-UP on NORM's long suffering face.\n\nNORM\nWill you all get a move on! They're waiting for\nyou!\n\nBy this time the TAILOR has his tape stretched between his hands to measure GEORGE's shoulders. But since GEORGE has moved away, he is measuring space. JOHN takes up his scissors and cuts the tape.\nJOHN\nI now declare this bridge open.\n\nThe BOYS run out the door.\n\n50.\tINTERIOR  BACKSTAGE AREA\n\nFive beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume. One is knitting a loose wool sweater which is almost completed. There is the sound of a juggling act's music off and a few of the girls are looking off towards the centre stage. At the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered with green baize. On it are three spaced white plates.\n\nFrom the door off stage, above which is a sign \"To Canteen and Production Offices\", GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate of spaghetti on toast. The knitting GIRL sees him and, in mime, asks him to stand still so that she can measure the sweater against him. GRANDFATHER, eager to help, puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and\nthree. He goes to be measured with the sweater.\n\nFrom the onstage area, a juggler's ASSISTANT (pretty girl) in costume backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up, without looking, plate number ONE and throws it off screen towards centre stage. There is a drum roll from orchestra. She then throws plate number TWO. We CUT on stage to the JUGGLER now balancing the two spinning plates on two poles, one in each hand. He has another pole in his mouth and nods to his ASSISTANT, asking for the THIRD plate.\n\nWe CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who, still not looking, throws plate THREE which is GRANDFATHER's. There is the sound of an orchestra raggedly stopping and all the hangers-on in the scene look off interestedly.\n\nWe hear the DIRECTOR's voice.\n\nDIRECTOR (V.O.)\nAll right, hold it, hold it... O.K. John, wipe him down and we'll carry on with the next act.\n\nWe\n\nCUT TO\n\ncentre stage. The JUGGLER is as before but the spaghetti is covering his head, having slipped off the third plate.\n\nThe FLOOR MANAGER is bustling around, trying to help.\n\nWe CUT BACK to back-stage. GRANDFATHER has finished being measured and goes to the green table where he put his plate down. He picks up the only remaining plate, looks at it, wondering where his food has gone, shrugs and heads back towards the exit door as we hear the DIRECTOR's VOICE.\n\n51.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\n\nCLOSE-UP on the distraught DIRECTOR.\n\nDIRECTOR\nWhere are they? I said, where are they? Where are they?\n\nFLOOR MANAGER\n(placating)\nThey're coming, I promise you.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(fiercely)\nNow look, if they're not here on this floor in thirty seconds there's going to be trouble ... understand me ... trouble!!!\n\nTwo STAGE HANDS are walking disinterestedly past, they look at the DIRECTOR.\n\n1st STAGE HAND\nWhat's he on about, Taff?\n\nWELSH STAGE HAND\nWell ... he's being the director. Of course, he lives in a world of his own, mind.\n\nAt this moment the boys, NORM, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER appear. The BOYS grab their instruments and prepare to play.\n\nJOHN\n(to the director)\nStanding about, eh? Some people have it dead easy, don't they?\n\nThe director is about to blow his top but manages to hold on and mutter to the heavens.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(to himself)\nOf course, once you're over thirty, you're finished. It's a young man's medium and I just can't take the pace.\n\nRINGO\nAre you as young as that, then?\n\nBOYS\nShurrup!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nIsn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.\n\nPAUL\n(to Shake)\nShove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?\n\nSHAKE\nI'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.\n\nPAUL\n(threateningly)\nI'll set John on you!\n\nSHAKE\n(hastily)\nOh, anything you say, Paul.\n\nHe leads GRANDFATHER away.\n\nThe BOYS are placed in position, instruments ready. The boom moves in near them. There is a mike hovering just over JOHN'S head. JOHN starts attacking it.\n\nDIRECTOR'S VOICE (over Tannoy)\nRun through the number and try not to jiggle out of your positions.\n\nThe BOYS start the number, as the stage hands adjust their settings. When they've finished, they stand about spare.\n\n52.\tINTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM\n\nThe room is crowded with the usual personnel, P.A., elecs, racks, etc.... make-up supervisor and wardrobe mistress.\n\nDIRECTOR\nThat was more or less all right for me. I'll give them one more run through then leave them alone until the dress ...\n(to make-up woman)\nOh how about make-up?\n\nMAKE-UP WOMAN\nNot really, they don't need it any. We'll just powder them off for shine.\n\nDIRECTOR\nGood. Norm, get them along to make-up will you?\n\nNORM\n(rising)\nSure.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(looking into the monitor)\nAnd hurry, they're not looking too happy.\n\nFrom the director's P.O.V. we see into the monitor. The boys crowding around RINGO. We cut through the monitor into the same position in the studio.\n\n53.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\n\nPAUL\n(to Ringo)\nWhat's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.\n\nRINGO\n(briefly)\nYou were twanging too loud.\n\nJOHN\nHow'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?\n\nGEORGE\nYou're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.\n\nRINGO\nThat's right. It's always me, isn't it?\n\nJOHN\nSince you ask, yes.\n(he laughs)\nAah, come on, Ring, we love you.\n\nHe puts his arm around Ringo's shoulder.\n\nRINGO\nWell!\n\nJOHN\nHe'll get over it.\n\nNORM appears down the ramp speaking as he approaches.\n\nNORM\nAll right, our lot, make-up.\n\n54.\tINTERIOR  MAKE UP ROOM\n\nA smallish room with a line of chairs facing a wall mirror and a long table. Each place is clearly marked and above each mirror a girl's name: Betty, Angela, Deirdre, Jenny.\n\nSHAKE and GRANDFATHER are sitting in splendid isolation. They are staring each other out.\n\nSHAKE\nYou blinked!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI never did, you did.\n\nThe BOYS enter.\n\nSHAKE\nHello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.\n\nGEORGE\nWell, it must be catching. He's given it to the\nchamp here.\n\nHe indicates RINGO who ignores him.\n\nNORM\nStop picking on him.\n\nRINGO\nI don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.\n\nJOHN\nLeave him alone, he's got swine fever.\n\nNORM\nSit down, the lot of you.\n\nAt this moment several actors come into the room. They are all dressed in the uniform of officers in Wellington's army. Together with the boys they sit down, Beatles and soldiers all mixed up.\n\nNow a group of several pretty make-up girls make an entrance and the boys herald their arrival with a chorus of \"aye aye's\" and wolf whistles. JOHN meanwhile has helped himself to a big beard and the other lads are generally messing about with assorted make-up things.\n\nHEAD MAKE UP GIRL\nOh, this is impossible! We'll never get you all done in time.\n\nACTOR\nWell, you'll just have to do us first... It makes no difference to them whether they're made up or not.\n(sees John with beard)\nAnd who's me, then?\n\nJOHN\n(charmingly)\nMy name's Betty...\n(pointing to the name on the mirror)\nDo you want a punch up your frogged tunic?\n\nNORM fights his way to JOHN.\n\nNORM\nNow listen, John, behave yourself or I'll murder you and, Shake, take that wig off, it suits you.\n\nSHAKE has a long blond girl's wig on. With the assistance of the girls, NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door. For some reason RINGO now has a Guardsman's busby wedged down almost over his eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier, reading a copy of \"Queen\" Magazine.\n\nNORM\n(to Ringo)\nWhat do you think are you're up to?\n\nRINGO\nSomeone put it on me.\n\nJOHN\nExcuses, that's all we get and you know you fancy yourself in the Coldstreams.\n\nThe GIRLS now move in and put make up bibs on the BOYS and start to powder them off.\n\nJOHN\nYou won't interfere with the basic rugged\nconcept of my personality, will you, girl?\n\nPAUL\nEh, don't take out me lines.\n\nGEORGE\nYeah, they give him that \"Je ne sais quoi\"\nrakish air.\n\nThe lads laugh with pleasure.\n\nRINGO decides to try a little joke.\n\nRINGO\n(indicating the busby he is still\nwearing)\nShort back and sides, please.\n\nThe other look at him with mock disgust.\n\nPAUL\nBehave...\n\nJOHN\nForeign devil ...\n\nGEORGE\nControl yourself...\n\nGRANDFATHER has been watching the powdering process.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nIn my considered opinion you're a bunch of sissies.\n\nJOHN grabs a powder puff from his girl.\n\nJOHN\nYou know you're only jealous!\n\nAnd dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to GRANDFATHER's annoyance.\n\nNORM\nLeave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.\n\nJOHN\nYou wouldn't!\n\nNORM\nI would though.\n\nNORM goes out.\n\nPAUL\nWhat's he know?\n\nJOHN\nNothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(impatiently)\nLookit, I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery and so far I've seen a train and a room, a car and a room and a room and a room. Well, that's maybe all right for a bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but I'm feeling decidedly strait-jacketed. This is no life for a free-booting agent of my stamp. I'm a frustrated man and that class of McCartney is a dangerous McCartney.\n\nGIRL\n(admiringly)\nWhat a clean old man.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(touchingly)\nYou're too young for a fella of my cosmopolitan tastes, so don't press your luck.\n\nJOHN\nHe's sex-obsessed, the older generation are leading this country to galloping ruin.\n\nNORM returns leaving the door open, the boys hear the sound of music coming from the studio.\n\nNORM\nThey're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.\n\nJOHN\n(jumping from his seat)\nGear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.\n\nJOHN'S GIRL\nI don't think its allowed.\n\nJOHN\nWell ... it wouldn't be any fun if it was!\n\nThe BOYS drag the make-up GIRLS out of the room and into the studio.\n\nThe GIRLS are still trying to finish making the BOYS up.\n\nAs the BOYS and MAKE-UP GIRLS dance past, we see one of the \"Strauss\" singers combing his long hair straight back. Two STAGE HANDS swing a wind machine past him and his hair is blown straight forward into a Beatle cut.\n\nJOHN\n(passing him)\nNever.\n\nDuring dance, GEORGE takes off wig and places it on dummy, revealing identical hair underneath.\n\n55.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\n\nThe work is still going on and the music is up full blast, the BOYS enter and with the GIRLS [and] they start a wild dance, hippy, shake, zulu, blue beat, the lot. LIONEL and DANCERS are doing their routine on one side of the stage ... it becomes a challenge dance between both groups. JOHN swings his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA, Western style, and starts to track through the GROUP. GEORGE is on another CAMERA.\n\n56.\tINTERIOR  CONTROL ROOM\n\nThe whole control room crew are watching the dance on all the monitors. The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL P.A. glares at him, with a shrug he lets the dance go on.\n\nWe now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual dancing down on the studio floor. When the recorded music stops, they grab their instruments and go into a number.\n\nSo we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors it gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four.\n\nWhen the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor.\n\n57.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\n\nDIRECTOR'S VOICE OVER TANNOY\nThank you gentlemen, you can break now while we push on with the show.\n\nThe boys acknowledge this with a quaver of guitar chords and a drum roll.\n\nNORM is on them at once.\n\nNORM\nThat was great, you've got about an hour but don't leave the theatre.\n\nJOHN grabs the arm of a sexy girl dancer.\n\nJOHN\nShe's going to show me her stamp collection.\n\nPAUL\n(grabs a showgirl)\nSo's mine.\n\nNORM\nJohn, I'm talking to you. This final run through is important. Understand? Important.\n\nJOHN\n(like a pig)\nOink! Oink!\n\nThey dash off with the two beauties.\n\nGRANDFATHER is hovering in the background with SHAKE.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI want me cup of tea.\n\nNORM\nShake.\n\nSHAKE\nI'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.\n\nNORM\nClever.\n(he turns)\nGeorge.\n\nBut GEORGE is disappearing out of the door.\n\nNORM turns to RINGO.\n\nNORM\nLook after him.\n\nRINGO\nBut...\n\nNORM\nDo I have to raise me voice?\n\nRINGO\n(choked)\nOh, all right. Come here, Grandad.\n\nAnd the two of them walk off, Ringo leading.\n57A.\tINTERIOR  BACKSTAGE\n\nA man, whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head, is swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets. He starts rehearsing his act, which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks. Next to him, a JUGGLER is practising with four table tennis balls.\n\nGRANDFATHER passes him and bumps his arm slightly. Only 3 balls come down. There is the sound of coughing off.\n\nWe\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HEAD-PLAYER being patted on the back. The ball drops out of his mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor.\n\n58.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO CANTEEN\n\nThe canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as Nazi soldiers, with mock blood bandages and arm bands. Also there are a sprinkling of T.V. people. At a table sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO. RINGO is deeply engrossed in a book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of tea in front of him. The old man is bored and looks about him slyly. He then looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied, a malicious gleam comes into GRANDFATHER's eye. He decides to have a go at RINGO and sits staring at him. RINGO gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(disgustedly to no one in particular)\nWill you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!\n\nRINGO\nWell ... what's the matter with that?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(taking the book from him)\nHave you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?\n\nRINGO\n(snatching back his book)\nYou can learn from books.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nCan you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.\n\nRINGO\nOut where?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAny old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!\n\nRINGO\n(defiantly)\nBooks are good!\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(countering)\nParading's better!\n\nRINGO\nParading?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(marching up and down the canteen)\nThat's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!\n\nRINGO\nWell, I am living, aren't I?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYou're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?\n\nRINGO\nEh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAt least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!\n\nRINGO\nAaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nSo you are a man after all.\n\nRINGO\nWhat's that mean?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nDo you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.\n\nRINGO\n(not too sure)\nOh ... I dunno.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(confidingly)\nAnd that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.\n\nRINGO\nYeah ... that's right.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd what's it all come to in the end?\n\nRINGO\n(defensively)\nYeah ... what's in it for me?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nA book!\n\nRINGO\nYeah ... a bloomin' book!\n\nHe throws the book down.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWhen you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.\n\nRINGO\nYeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(nodding)\nYou're only right.\n\nRINGO\n(nodding back)\nI'm not wrong.\n\nThere is a pause, then RINGO rises and crosses to the door.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWhere are you off to?\n\nRINGO\nI'm going parading before it's too late!\n\nRINGO leaves and GRANDFATHER laughs at what he has done, then realizes its full meaning and looks worried.\n\n59.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR and STAIRWAY\n\nRINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs. Half-way down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming up the stairs.\n\nGEORGE\nEh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?\n\nRINGO\n(passing him)\nNo. I don't.\n\nAs he goes round the corner RINGO turns on the surprised GEORGE.\n\nRINGO\nYou want to stop being so scornful, it's twisting your face.\n\n60.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOORMAN'S OFFICE\n\nJOHN and PAUL are chatting up a couple of girls, when they see RINGO approaching they break off the conversation.\n\nJOHN\nHere he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.\n\nRINGO looks at JOHN hard.\n\nPAUL\nEh. I thought you were looking after the old man.\n\nRINGO\n(with simple dignity)\nGet knotted!\n\nPAUL and JOHN gape at him. For good measure Ringo takes a quick photograph of them before he leaves them flabbergasted and walks off into the street.\n\nPAUL\nWe've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.\n\nJOHN\nCan't he? He's done it, son!\n\nGEORGE runs towards them.\n\nGEORGE\nEh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...\n\nPAUL\nWe do.\n\nGEORGE\nYes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.\n\nPAUL\nHe hasn't.\n\nGEORGE\nYes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.\n\nPAUL\nThe old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.\n\nThe three of them go into the street.\n\n61.\tEXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE\n\nThe boys look up and down but RINGO has completely disappeared.\n\nPAUL\nWe'll split up and search for him, he can't be far.\n\nThey now all start to go off in the same direction, they pause, there are three roads they can take but each time they begin to move they all go the same way.\n\nJOHN\nIt's happened at last, we've become a limited company.\n\nGEORGE\nI'll look in here again.\n\nPAUL gives him a push to the left and GEORGE to the right and going straight ahead himself they part and go their separate ways.\n\n62.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nRINGO is walking along taking photographs with his camera when some girls recognise him and start to follow him. They quicken their pace and RINGO runs ahead of them. He turns and comes into another street. He sees a second-hand clothes shop with a sign saying \"We Buy Anything\" and enters the shop just before the pursuing girls come round the corner. The girls stand about looking in all directions. After a moment RINGO comes out of the shop. He is wearing a long mackintosh and a natty cap pulled well down. He is ignored by the girls who don't recognise him. Realising this he goes back and ogles one of them. She glares at him.\n\nRINGO\nHello.\n\nGIRL\nGet out of it, short house!\n\nCLOSE-UP on Ringo's secret but happy smile as he walks briskly down the road.\n\n63.\tEXTERIOR  TOW PATH  CANAL\n\nRINGO kicks at a brick. He kicks stylishly but misses so tries again, misses again, but finally kicks the stone which doesn't budge so he bends down and pulls it out of the ground. It is quite big. Three quarters of it being below the surface. Having got it he now decides to throw it away. As he does so the same POLICEMAN rides past on a bicycle.\n\nPOLICEMAN\nAin't you got no more bleeding sense than to go round chucking bricks about.\n\nBefore RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared.\n\nRINGO\n(shouting after him)\nSoutherner!\n\nHe looks at the canal water moodily; at this moment a large lorry tyre rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the back, sprawling him on the path, the tyre on top of him. A small boy appears after the tyre and stands over the prostrate RINGO.\n\nBOY\nHere, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.\n\nRINGO\nHoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?\n\nBOY\nOh don't be so stroppy!\n\nRINGO\n(getting up)\nWell! A boy of your age bowling \"hoop\" at people. How old are you anyway?\n\nBOY\n(aggressively)\nNine.\n\nRINGO\nBet you're only eight and a half.\n\nBOY\n(countering swiftly)\nEight and two thirds.\nRINGO\nWell, there you are and watch it with that hoop.\n\nBOY\nGerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.\n\nRINGO\nShurrup!\n\nBOY\nI bet you're\n(searching for an age)\n-- sixteen!\n\nRINGO\nFifteen and two thirds, actually.\n\nBOY\nWell --\n\nRINGO\nAll right, take your hoop and bowl.\n\nHe moves off and the BOY follows.\n\nBOY\nOh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.\n\nRINGO\nY'what?\n\nBOY\nYou heard, it gets on my wick.\n\nRINGO\nWell that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?\n\nBOY\nI'm a deserter.\n\nRINGO\n(smiling in spite of himself)\nAre you now?\n\nBOY\nYeah, I've blown school out.\n\nRINGO\nJust you?\n\nBOY\nNo, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.\n\nRINGO\nDing Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?\n\nBOY\nYeah, that's right, they was supposed to come\nwith us but they chickened.\n\nRINGO\nYeah? And they're your mates are they?\n\nBOY\n(sighing)\nYeah.\n\nRINGO\nNot much cop without 'em, is it?\n\nBOY\n(defensively)\nOh, it's all right.\n\nRINGO\n(disbelievingly)\nYeah?\n\nBOY\nYeah.\n\nRINGO\nWhat they like?\n\nBOY is glad to have something to talk about.\n\nBOY\n(enthusiastically)\nGinger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.\n\nRINGO\nHow about Ding Dong?\n\nBOY\nHe's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.\n\nRINGO nods his head understandingly and they mooch on together.\n\nBOY\nWhy aren't you at work?\n\nRINGO\nI'm a deserter, too.\n\nBOY\nOh.\n\nAt this moment a child's voice shouts out \"Charley\" and from RINGO'S P.O.V. we see three kids. RINGO turns to the BOY and looks at them enquiringly.\n\nBOY\n(to Ringo)\nSee you.\n\nThe BOY runs off to join his mates. As he joins them they punch and scuffle together. They are obviously a gang. RINGO is left alone.\n\n64.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR T.V. THEATRE\n\nGEORGE comes round the corner, looking for RINGO, then grins and walks past a sign saying \"Canteen and Production Office Opposite.\" He comes to the exit door, crosses to a modern building across from the theatre. He enters [the] building.\n\n65.\tINTERIOR  OFFICE\n\nIt is the reception room that leads to an inner office. Behind a desk sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE enters. He is surprised when he sees the girl; she looks up and speaks to him at once.\n\nSECRETARY\nOh, there you are!\n\nGEORGE\nOh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.\n\nSECRETARY\n(tartly)\nYou haven't, you're just late.\n(She rises and crossing over to him examines him critically.)\nOh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.\n\nGEORGE\nIs he?\n\nSECRETARY\nYes, you're quite a feather in the cap.\n(She crosses to the desk and picks up the inter-office phone.)\nHello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.\n(she smiles)\nOf course, right away.\n\nShe crosses to the inter-office door. On the door is written SIMON MARSHAL ... she opens it.\n\nSECRETARY\nWell ... come on.\n\nGEORGE\nSorry.\n\nHe follows her quickly in.\n\n66.\tINTERIOR  THE INNER OFFICE\n\nA large room, part production office with models and sets, drawing board with ground plans, the other part of the room a mixture of Pop and Queen's magazine decor.\n\nBehind a large desk sits SIMON MARSHAL, a bland but slightly irritable young man of about thirty-five. He is wearing the ultimate in the current smart set fashion. He is attended by a couple of underlings ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the wall is a poster of a girl. Across the poster is printed, \"Way Out, your own T.V. Special with Susan Campey. Director, Simon Marshal.\"\n\nSECRETARY\n(proudly)\nWill this do, Simon?\n\nSIMON\n(looking at George)\nNot bad, dolly, not really bad.\n(he motions to George)\nTurn around, chicky baby.\n\nGEORGE does so.\n\nSIMON\nOh yes, a definite poss. He'll look good alongside Susan.\n(he indicates the girl on the poster)\nAll right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless. Don't breathe on me, Adrian.\n\nADRIAN has recognised GEORGE and is trying to stop SIMON.\n\nGEORGE\nLook, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.\n\nSIMON\n(sharply)\nOh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.\n\nGEORGE\nI'm afraid I don't understand.\n\nSIMON\nOh, my God, he's a natural.\n\nSECRETARY (anxiously)\nWell, I did tell them not to send us any more real ones.\n\nSIMON\nThey ought to know by now the phonies are much easier to handle. Still he's a good type.\n\nHe now speaks to GEORGE in the loud voice that the English reserve for foreigners and village idiots.\n\nSIMON\nWe want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.\n\nGEORGE\nOh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.\n\nSIMON\nWell, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.\n(to secretary)\nCan he read?\n\nGEORGE\nOf course I can.\n\nSIMON\nI mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?\n\nGEORGE\nI'll have a bash.\n\nSIMON\nGood. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?\n\nGEORGE\nTa.\n\nSIMON\nWell, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.\n\nA collection of shirts are produced and GEORGE looks at them. While he is doing this SIMON briefs him.\n\nSIMON\nNow, you'll like these. You really \"dig\" them. They're \"fab\" and all the other pimply hyperboles.\n\nGEORGE\nI wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.\n\nSIMON\nGrotty?\n\nGEORGE\nYeah, grotesque.\n\nSIMON\n(to secretary)\nMake a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.\n\nGEORGE\nBut I won't.\n\nSIMON\nYou can be replaced you know, chicky baby.\n\nGEORGE\nI don't care.\n\nSIMON\nAnd that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.\n\nGEORGE\nAnd who's this Susan when she's at home?\n\nSIMON\n(playing his ace)\nOnly Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.\n\nGEORGE\nOh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?\n\nSIMON\nI beg your pardon?\n\nGEORGE\nOh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.\n\nSIMON\nShe's a trend setter. It's her profession!\n\nGEORGE\nShe's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.\n\nSIMON\nGet him out of here!!\n\nGEORGE\n(genuinely surprised)\nHave I said something amiss?\n\nSIMON\nGet him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!\n\nThe underlings hustle GEORGE to the door.\n\nGEORGE\n(smiling)\nSorry about the shirts.\n\nHe is ejected through the door.\n\nSIMON\nGet him out.\n(he stops in mid-shout)\nYou don't think he's a new phenomenon, do you?\n\nSECRETARY\nYou mean an early clue to the new direction?\n\nSIMON\n(rummaging in his desk)\nWhere's the calendar?\n(he finds it)\nNo, he's just a trouble maker. The change isn't due for three weeks. All the same, make a note not to extend Susan's contract. Let's not take any unnecessary chances!\n\n67.\tEXTERIOR  STREET  PUB ON THE CORNER\n\nThe sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms. RINGO is standing looking up at it. He decides to go in and does so.\n\n68.\tINTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM\n\nThe atmosphere is tense. GRANDFATHER is standing miserable in front of the DIRECTOR, the criminal confronted by the judge. SHAKE and NORM are flanking him grimly.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI'm sorry lads, I didn't mean it, honest.\n\nDIRECTOR\nIf he says that again, I'll strike him.\n\nSHAKE\n(unconvincingly)\nThey'll be back, they're good lads, they'll be back.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(disgusted)\nYes? Well they've got only ten minutes to the final run-through.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI meant no harm. I was only trying to encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself.\n\nNORM\n(grimly, C.U.)\nGod knows what you've unleashed on the unsuspecting South. It'll be wine, women and song all the way with Ringo once he's got the taste for it.\n\n69.\tINT. PUB  PUBLIC BAR\n\nCLOSE-UP on RINGO. He is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at the end. He puts it down with disgust. He has a lager glass in his hand.\n\nBARMAID\n(accusingly)\nThat was fresh this morning.\n\nWe now see the pub is full of enormous cockney workmen downing pints. RINGO is very much alone. He moves away from the bar towards a group that is standing together, they've an average height of over six-foot. There is a group at a dart board. Another group is playing bar skittles and a third group is around a pin-ball table.\n\nNear the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players. There is a caged parrot nearby.\n\nBARMAID\n(to Ringo)\nThat'll be two and nine...\n\nRINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket. A few coppers fall from his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as the crucial point has been made. The men glare at him. Embarrassed, he moves away and without looking, places his glass on the skittles table just as a player swings the string, which hits Ringo's glass. More embarrassed, RINGO backs\naway, unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning score is about to be reached. He bumps it very slightly, but enough to cause it to TILT. He then moves to the dart board. By this time most of the pub is staring at him. With great style he takes the darts. The first throw goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration. The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see RINGO shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting angrily, off. The BARMAID has had enough.\n\nBARMAID\nRight ... On your way!\n\nRINGO\nY'what?\n\nBARMAID\nYou heard, on your way, troublemaker!\n\nNow the centre of attention, RINGO backs out of the pub, followed by every eye in the place, the BARMAID and a few players following him to the door ...\n\n70.\tEXTERIOR  STREET OUTSIDE PUB\n\nRINGO comes out and crosses road, watched by the POLICEMAN who is now quite suspicious.\n\n71.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nPAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO. In the street is an old building, the sort of place that is highly favoured for TV rehearsals. There is a sign on the door, \"TV Rehearsal Room.\" As PAUL draws near, a load of actors and extras, etc. are leaving, they are in costume, they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word rehearsal. When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go inside.\n\n72.\tINTERIOR  HALL\n\nPAUL enters and wanders about. He reaches a door, pushes it open and looks in. He sees a GIRL clad in period costume. She is moving around the room and obviously acting. PAUL watches her for a moment and then decides to go in.\n\n73.\tINTERIOR  REHEARSAL ROOM\n\nPAUL goes into the room. The GIRL is in mid-flight. She is very young and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing. The room is absolutely empty except for PAUL and herself. She is acting in the manner of an eighteenth-century coquette, or, to be precise, the voice English actresses use when they think they are being true to the costume period ... her youth however makes it all very charming.\n\nGIRL\nIf I believed you, sir, I might do those things and walk those ways only to find myself on Problem's Path. But I cannot believe you, and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me.\n\nShe dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she was.\n\nGIRL\n(surprised)\nOh!\n\nPAUL\n(enthusiastically)\nWell ... go 'head, do the next bit.\n\nGIRL\nGo away! You've spoilt it.\n\nPAUL\nOh, sorry I spoke.\n\nHe makes no attempt to go. He simply continues to look steadily at the girl; then he smiles at her. She is undecided what to do next.\n\nGIRL\nAre you supposed to be here?\n\nPAUL\nI've got you worried, haven't I?\n\nGIRL\nI'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.\n\nPAUL\nD'you know something, \"They\" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...\n\nGIRL\nYou're from Liverpool, aren't you?\n\nPAUL\n(ironically)\nHow'd you guess?\n\nGIRL\n(seriously)\nOh, it's the way you talk.\n\nPAUL\n(innocently)\nIs it ... is it, really?\n\nGIRL\n(suspiciously)\nAre you pulling my leg?\n\nPAUL\n(looking her straight in the eye)\nSomething like that.\n\nGIRL\n(unsure)\nI see.\n(airily)\nDo you like the play?\n\nPAUL\nYeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.\n(smiles to himself)\nYeah, it's gear on a girl.\n\nGIRL\nGear?\n\nPAUL\nAye, the big hammer, smashing!\n\nGIRL\nThank you.\n\nPAUL\nDon't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?\n\nGIRL pouts.\n\nPAUL\nYou don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...\n\nGIRL\n(cutting in)\nI'm not ...\n\nPAUL\nOh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?\n\nGIRL\nNo.\n(aggressively)\nI'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.\n\nPAUL\nOh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?\n\nGIRL\nYes.\n\nPAUL\nAye, I knew you were.\n\nGIRL\nWhat's that mean?\n\nPAUL\nWell, the way you were spouting, like ....\n(he imitates her)\n\"I don't believe you, sir...\" and all that. Yeah, it was gear.\n\nGIRL\n(dryly)\nThe big hammer?\n\nPAUL\n(smiling)\nOh aye, a sledge.\n\nGIRL\nBut the way you did it then sounded so phony.\n\nPAUL\nNo ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.\n\nHe moves and stands about like an actress.\n\nGIRL\nBut that's not like a real person at all.\n\nPAUL\nAye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?\n\nGIRL\nThey ought to be.\n\nPAUL\nOh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?\n\nGIRL\n(teasingly)\nWhat are you?\n\nPAUL\nI'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.\n\nGIRL\nI bet you don't sound like real people.\n\nPAUL\nWe do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.\n\nGIRL\nIs it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?\n\nPAUL\nWhat of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.\n\nHe laughs and with a gesture takes in the whole studio\n\nPAUL\n... all this and a jam butty too!!\n\nGIRL\nI only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.\n\nPAUL\nWhy? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?\n\nGIRL\nWhy selfish?\n\nPAUL\nWell, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.\n\nShe looks at him in surprise.\n\nPAUL\nNo, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, \"Go and give some to the other kids.\" So, I said I would but I thought to meself, \"She must think I'm soft.\" Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't nmind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?\n\nGIRL\nNot really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?\n\nPAUL\nWell, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?\n\nGIRL\nIs she?\n\nPAUL\nOf course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...\n(Paul starts acting a Liverpool girl, he minces about then turns, extending his leg)\nEh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!\n\nGIRL\n(shattered)\nAnd you honestly think that's what she meant?\n\nPAUL\nOh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.\n\nHe laughs.\n\nGIRL\nWell, it's nice to know you think we're clever.\n\nPAUL\n(grinning)\nAnd cunning.\n\nGIRL\nAnd what do you do about it?\n\nPAUL\nMe? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.\n\nGIRL\nPity.\n\nPAUL\n(not noticing the invitation)\nAye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.\n\nGIRL\nYes.\n\nPAUL\n(going)\nSee you.\n\nGIRL\nOf course.\n\nPAUL stands at the doorway, shrugs then goes out.\n74.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nIn the street, workmen are collecting shovels, drinking tea and doing all the things people do around building sites. RINGO mooches around. In the road is a hole with a diameter of about 3 feet, and at least 6 feet deep. RINGO looks down and a man is busily working at the bottom of the hole. He glares at RINGO. After a moment RINGO turns away. We now see a very elegant young lady coming towards RINGO. She is daintily avoiding a series of puddles. RINGO has an idea and does a Sir Walter Raleigh with his large Mac spreading it over one of the puddles. The girl walks across it smiling graciously. RINGO proceeds with the coat to the next puddle and to the next backing gradually towards the hole. At last he spreads the coat, without noticing what he is doing, over the hole. The girl steps onto the coat and disappears sharply. RINGO looks down the hole where the girl is held in the workman's arms. The workman rises out of the manhole until he is waist height. At this point an elegantly dressed gentleman appears (the girl's husband) he looks at his wife in the workman's arms and hits the workman. RINGO backs away through the puddles, and is nicked by the POLICEMAN.\n\n[Scenes 75 and 76 deleted in revision.]\n\n77.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  NEAR STAGE DOOR\n\nThe DIRECTOR is pacing up and down the corridor. NORM is also walking up and down, SHAKE is leaning against the wall quite unconcerned. NORM gives SHAKE a push.\n\nNORM\nWorry, will you!\n\nSHAKE adjusts his features to a worrying expression.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(bitterly)\nWell, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...\n\nNORM\nI'll murder that Lennon.\n\nDIRECTOR\nBut I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...\n\nSHAKE\n... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.\n\nNORM\nShurrup, cheerful.\n\nThe horrible prospect hits the DIRECTOR.\n\nDIRECTOR\nYou don't think...\n\nNORM\n(reassuring him)\nThey'll be here.\n\nDIRECTOR\nOh now, they can't do that to me.\n(turning on Norm)\nIt's all your fault.\n(overriding Norm)\nOh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...\n\nSHAKE\n(helping out)\n... tea in China. Oh you're right, neither would I.\n\nHe steps away from NORM and stands near the DIRECTOR.\n\nNORM\nTraitor!\n\nSHAKE nods his agreement to this assessment of his character.\n\nSHAKE\nOf course.\n\nAt this moment JOHN, GEORGE and PAUL enter from the stage door. They are completely unconcerned and walk past the DIRECTOR, SHAKE and NORM.\n\nJOHN\n(as he passes by)\nHi Norm!\n\nNORM\n(preoccupied)\nHi, our lot!\n\nThe BOYS walk on when after a moment NORM snaps to.\n\nNORM\nOur lot!\n\nGEORGE\n(mildly)\nDid you want something.\n\nNORM\n(beaming with delight)\nI could eat the lot of you.\n\nJOHN\nYou'd look gear with an apple in your gob.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(accusingly)\nDo you realise you could have missed the final run-through?\n\nGEORGE\nSorry.\n\nSHAKE\nEh, there's only three of them.\n\nPAUL\nAye, we were looking for Ringo. But we realised he must have come back.\n\nDIRECTOR\nDo you realise we are on the air, live, in front of an audience, in forty-five minutes and you're one short.\n\nJOHN\nControl yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.\n\nNORM\nAye, let's try the dressing room.\n\nEveryone starts along the passage. NORM and PAUL last.\n\nPAUL\nEh, where's my grandfather?\n\nNORM\nDon't worry about him. He can look after himself.\n\nPAUL\nAye, I suppose so.\n\nThey run after the others.\n\n78.\tEXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  CLOSE-UP\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHere they are, personally signed and handwritten by your own sweet boys. The chance of a lifetime. Be the envy of your less fortunate sisters!\n\nThe CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded by girls who have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk trade with the old man. He has a large sign on which is written: \"Get your genuine autographed Beatles photographs.\" On the edge of the crowd two POLICEMEN are trying to force the girls back into the queue. Finally they wade through the girls and confront GRANDFATHER. They look at the old man quizzically; he stares back coldly. They indicate he should hop it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at them. So with a sigh, they grab an arm each and escort the old man off.\n\n79.\tINTERIOR  POLICE STATION\n\nIt is the reception desk and behind it is the DESK SERGEANT. After a moment RINGO is dragged in by the POLICEMAN we saw him with before.\n\nRINGO\nLook, I'm Ringo Starr... I've got a show to do in a few minutes you've got to let me go... I'm Ringo...\n\nPOLICEMAN\nSure, they all say that these days ... Anyway ... I don't care who you are... you can save that for the stipendary. Here you are, Sarge.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat is he?\n\nPOLICEMAN\n(reeling off the list)\nI've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.\n\nSERGEANT\nOh, a little savage, is he?\n\nPOLICEMAN\nA proper Aborigine.\n\nRINGO\n(on his dignity)\nI demand to see me solicitor.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat's his name?\n\nRINGO\nOh, well if you're going to get technical --\n\nAt that moment there is a loud series of noises off camera, furious shouting and dull crashes of wood.\n\nSERGEANT\nHello, it's going to be one of those nights, is it?\n(to policeman)\nSit Charley Peace down over there.\n\nThe POLICEMAN takes RINGO to a bench and sits him down as GRANDFATHER and the two POLICEMEN who were with him enter. The sign is tattered and is being lugged after them.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWell, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.\n(kicks the nearest policeman)\nOh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.\n\nSERGEANT\nIs there a fire, then?\n\nGRANDFATHER leans across the desk and hisses at the SERGEANT.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYou ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.\n\nSERGEANT\nEh?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat's he on about?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(squaring up)\nI'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.\n\nSERGEANT\n(to policemen)\nGet Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.\n\nThe POLICEMEN hurtle GRANDFATHER firmly but gently over to the bench on which RINGO is sitting and then return to the desk for a whispered conference with the SERGEANT. Meanwhile in full conspiratorial fashion GRANDFATHER talks to RINGO out of the side of his mouth.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nRingo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?\n\nRINGO\nWell I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nShush! Have they roughed you up yet?\n\nRINGO\nWhat?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(whispering)\nKeep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.\n\nRINGO\n(disturbed)\nHave they?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThat sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.\n\nRINGO\n(horrified)\nMe!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.\n\nRINGO\n(hopefully)\nOh, they seem all right to me.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThat's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.\n\nSERGEANT\n(calling)\nWould you two like a cup of tea?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYou see, sly villains.\n\nRINGO\n(miserable)\nNo thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir.\n\nWe now have a CLOSE SHOT of POLICEMEN around the sergeant's desk.\n\nSERGEANT\nSo you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.\n\nPOLICEMAN\nYeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.\n\nSERGEANT\nWell, he can't stop here.\n\nShot of GRANDFATHER watching POLICEMEN intently and muttering words as he does.\n\nRINGO\nWhat are you doing?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nLip reading.\n\nRINGO\nWhat are they saying?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nNothing good.\n\nThe POLICEMEN make a move towards GRANDFATHER and RINGO.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWell son, it's now or never.\n\nHe jumps to his feet and scurries towards the door.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAll right, you paid assassins. Johnny McCartney'll give you a run for your threepence ha'penny.\n\nHe dashes out of the door followed by the POLICEMAN who has his pile of photos.\n\nSERGEANT\nNow, what's he up to?\n\nRINGO\nHe's allergic to Bobbies, especially English Bobbies.\n\nThe POLICEMAN with the photos returns.\n\nPOLICEMAN\n(Irish accent)\nYour man disappeared like a leveret over a hill.\n\nRINGO\nTurncoat!\n\nThe POLICEMEN turn on RINGO and walk towards him.\n\nCLOSE-UP  RINGO\n\nRINGO\nMother!\n\n80.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nGRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street. He is breathing heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of hell. The street however is entirely empty and no one is even in sight. As he reaches the top of the street he pauses and turning, looks around him. From his P.O.V. we see just how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of relief GRANDFATHER cackles to himself. His triumph is short lived. At this precise moment down the street comes a parade of police vehicles, a Black Maria, an escorting police motor bike patrol and an ordinary squad car. The procession draws up and the street is full of policemen getting out of the Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes.\n\nCLOSE-UP  GRANDFATHER's horrified face.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nBe God, they've called up reinforcements, the dragnet's out!\n\nHe dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre. He has been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are lining up for a last minute inspection by the inspector in charge. The inspector is like a commander-in-chief of a spear-head attack force.\n\nThey smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER.\n\n81.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  CONTROL ROOM\n\nDIRECTOR\n(watching the clock)\nOnly half an hour and you're on!\n\nGEORGE\nCan I say something?\n\nThe director clutches at any straw.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(hopefully)\nYes, anything.\n\nGEORGE\n(earnestly)\nIt's highly unlikely we'll be on... I mean the law of averages are against you and it seems that, etc., etc....\n\nBut his speech is drowned by the pitiful moans of the DIRECTOR.\n\n82.\tEXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  STAGE DOOR\n\nThe four little boys from the canal are being driven away by the\nsecurity guard.\n\nGUARD\n(going back into theatre)\nI'll have the hides off of you lot.\n\nThe kids retreat as GRANDFATHER pants into shot, ignoring the kids he enters the stage door but in a second he is out again, grasped firmly by the collar by the security guard.\n\nGUARD\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI must see Pauly.\n\nGUARD\nGo home then and see him on the telly.\n\nThe GUARD re-enters the stage door.\n\nGRANDFATHER looks around him and sees the four kids. He hustles over and after a whispered conference we hear his offer.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nCan you fix him for me?\n\nBOYS\nYeah.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nSixpence.\n\nBOY\nEach?\n\nGRANDFATHER is about to argue.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nOh, all right.\n\nBOY\nAnd in advance.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(disgusted)\nMercenary!\n\nBut he hands over the money. The kids rush in the stage door and after a moment the furious GUARD chases them out and down the alley. GRANDFATHER, chuckling, nips in the door.\n\n83.\tINTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM  ON STAGE\n\nGRANDFATHER is being chased by several studio attendants; he is dodging behind equipment. He finally gets on a sound boom trolley and uses it as a weapon to keep his pursuers at bay.\n\n84.\tINTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM\n\nThe DIRECTOR, BOYS, and NORM and SHAKE see GRANDFATHER on the monitors. They dash out of the room and on to the stage.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(shouting)\nIt's all right, leave him alone.\n\nPAUL\nGrandad, where's Ringo?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThe police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.\n\nBOYS\nThe police station.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHe'll be pulp by now.\n\nJOHN\nWhat are we waiting for?\n\nGEORGE\nCome here.\n\nPAUL, JOHN and GEORGE rush off.\n\nCLOSE-UP DIRECTOR\n\nDIRECTOR\nWe've only got twenty minutes.\n\n85.\tEXTERIOR  STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION\n\nPAUL, JOHN and GEORGE come running down the street in single file, their knees  high in the air, they skid to a halt at the police station and without pausing they dash inside. After a moment they reappear -- only this time RINGO is behind them. They dash off down the street. They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single file. They are also pounding along knees high in the air. The BOYS and the coppers disappear around the corner. At once, they reappear from the other direction, then run down the street still followed by the policemen. When they reach the police station another group of police bars their way so they are forced to run up the stairs and inside.\n\n86.\tINTERIOR  POLICE STATION\n\nThe DESK SERGEANT is standing behind his desk looking very surprised. At this moment the boys run in and stand panting in front of the desk. Before the SERGEANT can start speaking the pursuing POLICEMEN arrive. They, too, are out of breath.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat is all this?\n\nJOHN\n(heaving and panting)\nHold on until we get our breath.\n\nThe BOYS and POLICEMEN pant on until JOHN seems to have recovered.\n\nSERGEANT\nAll right now?\n\nJOHN\nSure.\n(to boys)\nReady?\n\nThe BOYS nod and without further ado they turn and run through the surprised rank of POLICEMEN and out into the street.\n\n87.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\nTHE CHASE CARRIES ON.\n\nShots of BOYS being pursued (still in single file) by police, including the sergeant with one shot where the BOYS are chasing the POLICEMEN. Finally, as they approach the theatre, they are seen by the girl fans who swarm around the police, over running them. The boys grin to each other and are about to make off when from their P.O.V. we see the INSPECTOR and POLICEMEN blocking it.\n\nJOHN\nAh well, it was worth a try.\n\nINSPECTOR\n(calling to Sergeant)\nWhat do you think you're up to?\n\nSERGEANT\nArrest those boys, sir.\n\nINSPECTOR\nThat's all we need to start a real riot!\n(to Boys)\nCome on lads, they're waiting for you.\n\n###\tINTERIOR  THEATRE BACKSTAGE\n\nThe Inspector now hustles the BOYS through the crowds and in through the main entrance of the theatre where SHAKE and NORM are waiting. NORM looks suspiciously at RINGO who is still wearing his cap. RINGO whips it off and NORM delightedly hugs him. The BOYS dash through the stalls entrance and on stage. The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears with relief. NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed into their show costumes. All around them last-minute preparations are going on.\n\nDIRECTOR\nBoys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.\n\nNORM\nAren't you supposed to be in that box?\n\nThe DIRECTOR gives NORM a final glare and dashes off.\n\nPAUL\nAnd another thing, where's that old mixer?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHere, Pauly.\n\nAnd sitting on a box sadly chastened sits GRANDFATHER.\n\nPAUL\nWell, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.\n\nJOHN\nAw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.\n\nPAUL\n(hotly)\nWhat's old got to do with it?\n\nJOHN\nYou needn't bother.\n\nPAUL\nY'what?\n\nJOHN\nPractising to be thick-headed, you're there already.\n\nPAUL\nLook he's a mixer and a trouble maker!\n\nJOHN\nThat's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?\n\nFrom JOHN's P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER. He looks what he is, a tired old man.\n\nJOHN\nYou see.\n(to Grandad)\nYou know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(fighting back)\nBut I'm clean.\n\nThe BOYS giggle and slap him on the back.\n\n88.\tINTERIOR  TV THEATRE AUDITORIUM\n\nWe see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down in their places for the show. There is the usual business of getting the show ready and we see SHOTS of the girls' faces, then JOHN, PAUL, RINGO and GEORGE looking at them. At last on cue from the floor manager the BOYS start their act to the audience's screams. During the number we constantly CUT away to the audience with various SHOTS of the ecstatic girls. In the middle of these shots we see NORM standing at the side of the audience his face glowing with satisfaction. We follow his gaze and from NORM'S P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE, but in spite of this, the old man is enjoying himself. The BOYS now perform a medley of numbers, i.e., a little of all the songs we have heard during the story. This gives the impression of a full set and we finish after their bows. While they are doing so they look again in the general direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their P.O.V., we see SHAKE is beating time to the music but from his wrist dangles an empty set of handcuffs. GRANDFATHER has gone again. As the BOYS are reacting to GRANDFATHER's disappearance once again, the trap door on the stage opens and GRANDFATHER appears in the centre of the group as they finish their act and take their final bows.\n\n89.\tINTERIOR  STUDIO CORRIDOR\n\nNORM is waiting for the boys. With him are two studio attendants carrying the boys' luggage. As the BOYS excitedly appear he speaks to hem.\n\nNORM\nI've got the stuff. Come here.\n\nPAUL\nAren't we ...\n\nNORM\nNo, we're not!\n\nHe hurries them along.\n\nNORM\nThe office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.\n\nJOHN\nTonight? We can't make it ...\n\nNORM\nYou've got a midnight matinee.\n\nJOHN\nNow, look here, Norm ...\n\nNORM\nNo, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.\n\nJOHN\nWhat?\n\nNORM\nYou're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!\n\nNORM turns down a side exit where the door is open to the field. In it is an eight-passenger helicopter.\n\n90.\tEXTERIOR  STAGE DOOR  T.V. THEATRE\n\nThe BOYS and NORM come out of the building and start to run towards the helicopter.\n\nPAUL\n(looking behind him)\nWhere's my grandfather?\n\nNORM\n(arriving at helicopter door)\nDon't start. Look.\n\nThe boys look in the passenger bay and there is GRANDFATHER. He is still handcuffed to SHAKE but clutching his pile of photos.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(beckoning them in with his free hand which holds the photos)\nCome on, you're hanging up the parade.\n\nThe boys shout \"Get rid of those things, etc.\"\n\n91.\tEXTERIOR  FIELD\n\nThe final shot is of the helicopter rising up (SHOT FROM BELOW). As it disappears, a shower of photos come from its window.\n\nWe cut to a CLOSE-UP of one signed photo as it hits the ground and SUPER the closing credits over it.Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

Overkill: Appendix of Case Studies LyricsParamilitary drug raids have been growing in number for 25 years. As they\u2019ve become more frequent, so too have incidents in which these raids have gone wrong. Criminologist Peter Kraska says his research shows that between 1989 and 2001, at least 780 cases of flawed paramilitary raids reached the appellate level, a dramatic increase over the 1980s, where such cases were rare, or earlier, when they were practically nonexistent.280 Yet despite the ongoing reporting of botched raids in media outlets, the phenomenon is still consistently dismissed by supporters of paramilitary policing as a series of \u201cisolated incidents.\u201d The truth is, mistaken raids continue to happen with disturbing regularity. They can\u2019t all be isolated incidents. This section will catalogue an extensive list of botched raids between 1995 and April 2006 found over the course of several months of research. It is by no means comprehensive. The Cato Institute has also plotted an expanded list of cases on an interactive map, which can be found at http://www.cato.org /raidmap. The aim of this section is to demonstrate that botched paramilitary drug raids\u2014and the death, injury, and terrorizing of innocents that come with them\u2014aren\u2019t merely a regrettable, infrequent consequence of an otherwise effective police tactic. Rather, they\u2019re the inevitable consequence of a flawed, overbearing, and unnecessary form of drug policing. Wrong Address The botched drug raids that seem to generate the most public outrage are those in which police force entry into a home that turns out to be the wrong address. It\u2019s bad enough to have a system in place that is needlessly violent and provocative for known or suspected drug offenders. But it\u2019s particularly frustrating to see wholly innocent people terrorized, injured, and killed because police, policymakers, and judges cling to a flawed policy.281 No case better illustrates the preventable, tragic consequences of this flawed system than the death of Alberta Spruill. Alberta Spruill.On May 16, 2003, a dozen New York City police officers stormed an apartment building in Harlem on a no-knock warrant. They were acting on a tip from a confidential informant who told them a convicted felon was dealing drugs and guns from the sixth floor. There was no felon. The only resi-dent in the building was Alberta Spruill, described by friends as a \u201cdevout churchgoer.\u201d282 Before entering, police deployed a flashbang grenade. The blinding, deafening explosion stunned the 57-year-old city worker. As the officers realized their mistake and helped Spruill to her feet, the woman slipped into cardiac arrest. She died two hours later. A police investigation would later find that the drug dealer the raid team was looking for had been arrested days earlier and was still in police custody. He couldn\u2019t possibly have been at Spruill\u2019s apartment. The officers who conducted the raid did no investigation whatsoever to corroborate the informant\u2019s tip.283 Worse, a police source later told the New York Daily News that the informant had offered police tips on several occasions, none of which had led to an arrest. His record was so poor, in fact, that he was due to be dropped from the city\u2019s informant list.284 Nevertheless, police took his tip on the excon in Spruill\u2019s building to the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which approved the application for a no-knock entry. A judge then issued the warrant resulting in Spruill\u2019s death. The entire process took only a matter of hours. After the Spruill case, the media began to take notice of other victims of botched noknocks, including the following three cases in the fall of 2002, about six months before the raid that killed Spruill.\n\n\u2022 Williemae Mack. On September 3, 2002, police broke down the door of Brooklyn resident Williemae Mack in a pre-dawn drug raid. Her twin 13-yearold sons were asleep at the time. One, frightened by the noise and the explosive device police used to gain entry, hid under the bed. Police pulled him out and put a gun to his head. Police then handcuffed both boys at gunpoint. They found no drugs. They had raided the wrong address.285\n\n\u2022 Robert and Marie Rogers.On October 15, 2002, about 20 police armed with pistols and shotguns served a no-knock warrant on the home of retired police officer Robert Rogers and his wife Marie. The two were watching television when the officers stormed their home in Queens. Mr. Rogers initially grabbed his handgun, believing the police to be intruders. Once he recognized they were law enforcement, he dropped his weapon and covered it with his body. Rogers later told Newsday that had the raiding officers seen his gun, \u201cI\u2019d be dead.\u201d Again, the police had the wrong address.286Marie Rogers would take the news of Alberta Spruill\u2019s death especially hard. \u201cWhen I heard about what happened to this woman, I broke down and cried,\u201d Rogers later told the New York Post, \u201cYou would have thought that I knew her. Then I was angry.\u201d287\n\n\u2022 Michael Thompson. A day before the raid on the Rogerses, police also burst into the home of Michael Thompson, also of Queens. That raid left the man\u2019s large mahogany front door broken into pieces. The police then trained their guns on Thompson\u2019s chest while they searched his home and the upstairs apartment of a tenant for drugs. Once again, they had raided the wrong address.288 The victims of the above three raids were represented in civil suits filed by Norman Siegel, former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. Mr. Siegel told the New York Times in the fall of 2003 that according to police data, police were conducting about 460 such searches of private residences each month, with the vast majority of those served under no-knock warrants.289 In fact, just days after the raid on the Rogerses\u2019 home, Siegel held a press conference and pled with police to end the practice of no-knock raids. Nearly predicting the Spruill raid that would happen a year later, Siegel warned: \u201cWe must do a better job of no-knock search warrants. Otherwise, someone might wind up dead as a result of how we implement this procedure.\u201d290\n\n\u2022 Timothy Brockman.Just two days before the Spruill raid, police from NYPD and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms displayed extraordinary ineptitude in executing another botched no-knock raid, this time on the home of former Marine Timothy Brockman. Acting on a tip from a confused anonymous informant, police stormed the public housing apartment of the 61-year-old Brockman, who used a walker to get around. Police deployed a flashbang grenade, setting Brockman\u2019s carpet on fire, then handcuffed the man and threw him to the floor while they searched his home for drugs. They had the wrong address. Brockman would later be cleared of all charges.291 The Brockman case is another illustration of how the mishmash of court precedents governing the use of no-knock raids can lead to errors. In Brockman\u2019s case, New York police wanted to raid the apartment on the basis of the testimony of a single informant who had visited the targeted residence on just one occasion. State law required more evidence for a no-knock warrant. Federal law, however, is more deferential to police and, in this case, allowed for a no-knock entry. New York investigators merely called the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, who sent an agent from Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms along for the raid. The Brockman raid was now a federal case, governed by federal guidelines. Miscommunication between local and federal police led to series of errors that caused the police to mistakenly break down Brockman\u2019s door. Though a potentially grave and inexcusable error on the part of federal and local police, the Brockman case was ignored by the media and treated with indifference by the police. As the Times writes, \u201cAt the time, the incident received no publicity and no serious attention from the police leadership.\u201d292 In a follow-up piece published months after Spruill\u2019s death, the Village Voicereported that complaints about police abuses with respect to no-knocks had been pouring in for years. \u201cUntil Spruill\u2019s death, the NYPD had done nothing to stem the number of incidents,\u201d the Voice wrote, \u201cdespite receiving a memo from the Citizen Complaint Review Board in January noting the high number of raid complaints. Last March, the NAACP also approached NYPD commissioner Raymond W. Kelly about the raids.\u201d293 Indeed, the New York Times ran a story back in 1998, a full five years before Spruill\u2019s death, headlined, \u201cAs Number of Police Raids Increase, So Do Questions.\u201d294 The paper noted that the number of narcotics search warrants issued in New York City doubled from 1,447 in 1994 to 2,977 in 1998. Most of these, according to the Times, were no-knock warrants.295 The Times also profiled several cases of botched no knocks from the late 1990s. Among them were the following:\n\n\u2022 Mary and Cornelius Jefferson. The article began with a description of a botched no-knock on the home of Cornelius and Mary Jefferson, a couple in their 60s, in which police used a battering ram to obliterate the front door of an apartment \u201cwhere plastic slipcovers protect the sofas and diplomas and awards line the walls.\u201d Cornelius told the Times, \u201cI thought they were coming to rob us, coming to kill us.\u201d They had the wrong address.296\n\u2022 Ellis Elliott. On February 27, 1998, police conducted a no-knock raid on the Bronx home of Elliott, on the basis of information they later determined to be \u201cmiscommunication with an informant.\u201d As police attempted to break down his door, Elliott feared he was being attacked and fired a shot through the door. Police responded with a barrage of 26 bullets, all of which miraculously missed Elliott. Elliott was then dragged out of his home, naked, allegedly peppered with racial epithets, then arrested on charges of possessing an unlicensed weapon. Police later admitted their error and paid $1,000 to have Elliott\u2019s door repaired.297Elliott pled guilty to disorderly conduct for firing at the officers and was given a conditional discharge. No police officers were charged or disciplined for the error.298\n\n\u2022 The Crown Heights Raid. On May 1, 1998, police broke down the door to a home in Brooklyn\u2019s Crown Heights neighborhood in a no-knock raid that was based on the word of a single confidential informant. They expected to find a drug den. Instead, according to the Times, police found \u201ca retired banker, a home health attendant, and their two daughters.\u201d One of the daughters was mentally disabled, and was showering at the time of the raid. Police pulled her from the shower, handcuffed her, and despite her pleas to the officers that she was menstruating, refused to give her a sanitary pad until she began visibly bleeding.299\n\n\u2022 Sandra Soto. On June 5, 1997, police carried out a no-knock warrant based on information from an anonymous informant in the East New York area of Brooklyn. The warrant instructed them to raid a gray door marked \u201c2M.\u201d Finding no such door, they simply broke down the nearest door, which was red and marked \u201c2L.\u201d They found a woman, Sandra Soto, and her two children\u2014but no drugs.300\n\n\u2022Shaunsia Patterson. New York Times columnist Bob Herbert later reported that on the same dayas the raid on Ellis Elliott\u2019s home, New York City police raided the Bronx apartment of Shaunsia Patterson and her two children, ages three and two. Patterson was eight months pregnant. Police first grabbed Patterson\u2019s sister Misty, 15, who was also in the room, and threw her to the floor. They then confronted Patterson, who was sitting on her bed. One officer pushed Patterson onto her back. Another jumped on top of her. Patterson was eventually pushed to the floor and handcuffed while, in Patterson\u2019s words, \u201cone of the cops stepped on the side of my face and pressed my face into the floor.\u201d When Patterson asked what the police wanted, she says, she was told to \u201cshut the fuck up.\u201d Police handcuffed Patterson while she wore only her underwear. Officers then screamed expletives at the two women while they scoured the apartment for drugs\u2014demolishing the furniture, kitchen, and floor in the process. The raid so frightened Patterson, she urinated on herself. The police refused to allow her to change. Police also refused to show her a warrant. Hours later, an officer told her, \u201cWe got the wrong apartment,\u201d and released her from her handcuffs. One confidential police source told New York Times columnist Bob Herbert, referring to the Patterson and Elliott raids, \u201cTwo in one day\u2014that\u2019s bad. But I\u2019ll tell you what I honestly believe\u2014I don\u2019t think this happens that often.\u201d301 Those kinds of assurances from police officials are common in New York and elsewhere. Despite repeated media reports of \u201cwrong door\u201d raids throughout the late 1990s, city officials continued to insist such incidents were uncommon\u2014and nothing to be alarmed about. But in February 1998, the New York Police Department circulated a memo among the city\u2019s police officers instructing them how to contact locksmiths and door repair services should they break down the door to the wrong address, suggesting that mistakes were in fact fairly common. 302 As discussed earlier, the review procedures New York City had in place to deal with police brutality failed as well. The Civilian Complaint Review Board, hamstrung by bureaucracy, limited jurisdiction, and squabbles with the police union, was helpless to effect any real change to stem the tide of \u201cwrong door\u201d warrants. New York had plenty of warnings that a case like Spruill\u2019s might happen. The city\u2019s public officials did little to heed them.\n\nJust after Spruill\u2019s death and ensuing media coverage, Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields set up a hotline for victims of erroneous no-knock raids. For the first time, city officials encouraged victims of mistaken raids to come forward. The hotline received more than 100 calls in its first week of operation.303Fields\u2019s staff followed up with many of those calls, and her office published a report detailing its findings. Among the cases included in that report are the following:\n\n\u2022 Lewis Caldwell. On March 6, 2003, six police officers in riot gear broke down the door to the home of Lewis Caldwell. Police handcuffed Caldwell, a lung cancer patient, and forced him to the floor. Caldwell\u2019s wife returned home from work to find her home filled with police officers and dogs. She pled with the officers to release her husband from the handcuffs. They kept him restrained for more than an hour. Caldwell says police were \u201claughing and joking\u201d while searching his apartment. When the Caldwells filed a complaint, a lieutenant called to tell them the raid was justified, and \u201cthere\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d No drugs were found, and no criminal charges were ever filed against either of the Caldwells.304\n\n\u2022 Kim Stevenson. On April 9, 2003, about 20 police officers broke down the door of the West Harlem home of Kim Stevenson, asking \u201cwhere the drugs were.\u201d They handcuffed Stevenson and took her to another room, while other officers kept their weapons fixed on her 12-year-old daughter. Stevenson pled with police to explain why they were in her home, but they refused to answer her. A female officer took Stevenson into a bathroom to do a body search. After finding no drugs on her, the officers again handcuffed her while other officers finished searching her apartment. According to Stevenson, officers \u201cmade jokes and ridiculed\u201d her during the search. When they left, they told her to \u201chave management fix her door.\u201d Her landlord refused. At the time the Fields report was published, Stevenson\u2019s door had yet to be repaired. She was never charged with a crime.305\n\n\u2022 Kim Yarbrough.On May 2, 2003, police broke into the Staten Island home of Kim Yarbrough, an employee at the city\u2019s Department of Corrections. No one was home at the time, but Yarbrough\u2019s son was told by his brother-in-law that \u201c20 to 30\u201d police had raided his mother\u2019s home. When her son came to the house to investigate, he was handcuffed and thrown on the couch. Yarbrough came home from work with a supervisor to see that her door had been broken down and her home trashed. She and her son say police laughed and made jokes when she asked for names and badge numbers. Neither Yarbrough nor her son was ever charged with a crime.306\n\n\u2022 Margarita Ortiz.On February 29, 2003, police broke into the home of Margarita Ortiz. Police handcuffed the woman and her 12-year-old son for two and a half hours while searching the apartment. After five hours of searching, police left without explanation. Ortiz says that the police knew \u201cwithin 15 minutes\u201d that her apartment had no drugs and that they never showed her their badges or provided a search warrant. At the time of the Fields report, Ortiz had been unable to get any information from the city regarding the raid on her home.307\n\n\u2022 Sara Perez. On November 27, 2001, police broke into the Harlem home of. Sara Perez and put a shotgun to her head. They held her children and grandchildren at gunpoint, including onemonth-old twins. Police never showed Perez a search warrant, nor did they explain why they were in her home. Perez later learned that the raid was based on faulty information supplied by a 15-year old informant. After five months, the police department paid to repair her door.308\n\n\u2022 Jeanine Jean. On May 7, 1998, police broke down the door and deployed a flashbang grenade in the home of Jeanine Jean. Frightened, Jean ran into a closet with her six-year-old son and called 911. Police pulled Jean from the closet, handcuffed her, then questioned her at gunpoint in front of her son. Jean, who had had surgery the day before, began bleeding when her surgical wound ruptured during the raid. After 90 minutes, police realized they had the wrong apartment and left without explanation. They left Jean\u2019s door hanging from its hinges.309\n\n\u2022 Atlee Swanson.On July 9, 1997, police conducted a 6 a.m. no-knock raid at the East Harlem home of Atlee Swanson. Police broke into Swanson\u2019s home and demanded to know where \u201cJoey, Jason, and Sean\u201d were. Swanson said she knew no one by those names. The officers refused to show Swanson a search warrant, handcuffed her, and told her she faced 7 to 15 years in prison for selling drugs from her home. Police then put her in a holding cell for 31 hours. She returned home to find her apartment \u201ctrashed and vandalized.\u201d Swanson got a copy of the search warrant in the mail three years later. Police had mistakenly entered the wrong apartment building.310 The following raids weren\u2019t mentioned in the Fields report, but they also occurred at about the same time as the Spruill raid.\n\n\u2022 Cynthia Chapman. Chapman was in the shower at about 6 a.m. on April 2, 2003, when police broke open her door and deployed a flashbang grenade. The grenade struck Chapman\u2019s son Bobby, 15, in the foot. Police found Chapman in the bathroom, forced her to the ground, and put a gun to her head. According to Chapman, one officer asked, \u201cWhere is it,\u201d and when Chapman responded that she didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, he replied, \u201cDon\u2019t get smart with me or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Chapman and her son were handcuffed, taken to a police station, and released hours later when police discovered they\u2019d raided the wrong home. In 2004, Chapman settled with the city of New York for $100,000.311\n\u2022 Ana Roman.In 2004, the family of Ana Roman filed an $11 million lawsuit against the city of New York. The suit stemed from a September 12, 1996, noknock raid on the home Roman, then 70, shared with her husband and adult son. Police were acting on a faulty tip from a confidential informant that drugs were being dealt from Roman\u2019s home. Roman emerged from her bedroom to find police pointing assault weapons at her, her husband, and her son. Roman had a heart attack and spent the following two weeks in a cardiac unit. Her family maintains that Roman never fully recovered and died of congestive heart failure six years later as a direct result of the attack she suffered during the raid.312\n\n\u2022 Mary Bardy. Bardy went to the city council hearings to give her account of a January 2002 botched raid on her home. Police mistakenly believed her son was dealing drugs. The raiding officers broke down her door and, at gunpoint, ordered everyone inside\u2014including her 2-year-old granddaughter\u2014to lie down.313 \u201cI saw what happened to that poor woman [Spruill] and I said, this is crazy. This can\u2019t keep happening,\u201d Bardy told the New York Daily News. 314 Bardy, who had recently retired after an administrative career with the NYPD, said she wrote \u201cdozens of letters\u201d and \u201cmade lots of phone calls\u201d after the raid on her home but found no one who could give her answers about the circumstances of the investigation leading to the night police broke into her home. Her son was never charged.315 A day after the Spruill city council hear-ings, Manhattan Borough President Fields held hearings of her own. According to the Village Voice: Dozens of black and Latino victims\u2014 nurses, secretaries, and former officers\u2014 packed her chambers airing tales, one more horrifying than the next. Most were unable to hold back tears as they described police ransacking their homes, handcuffing children and grandparents, putting guns to their heads, and being verbally (and often physically) abusive. In many cases, victims had received no follow-up from the NYPD, even to fix busted doors or other physical damage. The Voicethen echoed the Newsday report: Some complainants reported that they had filed grievances with the [Citizen Complaint Review Board] and were told there was no police misconduct. Unless there is proven abuse, the CCRB disregards complaints about warrants that hold a correct address but are faulty because of bad evidence from a [confidential informant].316 The key recommendation from the Fields report was that NYPD produce an annual report detailing \u201call statistics regarding the execution of warrants.\u201d Fields believed such a report would provide some transparency and accountability in the issuance and execution of drug warrants, particularly those authorizing no-knock raids. NYPD issued no such report in 2005. Less than a year after Spruill\u2019s death, NYPD was back in the headlines with the mistaken raid on Martin and Leona Goldberg, mentioned earlier.317 Another high-profile wrong-door raid that provoked local media and public officials to take a harder look at the use of paramilitary drug raids was the Denver, Colorado, case of Ismael Mena. Ismael Mena. On September 29, 1999, a Denver SWAT team executed a no-knock drug raid on Mena\u2019s home. Mena, a Mexican immigrant, believed he was being robbed and confronted the SWAT team with a gun. Police said they fired the eight shots that killed Mena only after Mena ignored repeated warnings to drop his weapon and first fired at them. Mena\u2019s family says police never announced themselves, and that it was the police who fired first.318 Police later discovered they had raided the wrong home, on the basis of bad information from a confidential informant.319They found no drugs in Mena\u2019s house, nor were any found in his system.320 Subsequent investigations by the city police department\u2019s internal affairs division and by a special prosecutor found no wrongdoing on the part of the SWAT team. But weeks later, new details began to emerge about the Mena case. An aide to the special prosecutor, for example, said that Mena\u2019s body had been moved at least 18 inches after he was shot. A lab report then found that the gunshot residue found on Mena\u2019s hand didn\u2019t match Mena\u2019s gun but was instead only consistent with the residue given off by the submachine guns the SWAT team uses. Police found no fingerprints on Mena\u2019s gun, or on the ammunition inside it, raising speculation that the gun was tampered with or planted.321 An internal affairs investigation cleared the SWAT team of wrongdoing but did find that the officer who prepared the search warrant for Mena\u2019s home falsified information.322As the shooting gained traction in the media, Denver city officials began to portray Mena as a Mexican criminal refugee wanted for murder (Mena had shot a man in Mexico in self-defense but had been cleared of any wrongdoing), a \u201cblame the victim\u201d strategy unfortunately common in police brutality cases. 323 Members of the police department also later started what local media would call a \u201cspy file\u201d on a citizens\u2019 organization agitating for a more thorough investigation of Mena\u2019s death. Worse, the head of the police intelligence unit that kept a \u201cspy file\u201d on Mena\u2019s supporters was also the head of the SWAT team that conducted the raid on Mena\u2019s home.324\n\nMena\u2019s family eventually hired former FBI agent James Kearney to conduct a private investigation. Over the course of that investigation, Kearney became convinced that Denver police murdered Mena, then planted the gun to cover up the botched raid. Kearney found evidence not uncovered by previous investigations, including two slugs in the floor of Mena\u2019s apartment that suggest the raid didn\u2019t happen as SWAT officials said it did. Kearney made his accusations on a local radio station, leading to a lawsuit against the station and Kearney by members of the SWAT team. The radio station settled. Kearney in turn filed suit against the SWAT team and sought to prove his allegations of a cover-up in court.325 The suit was thrown out in federal court, but as of November 2005 Kearney was still waiting on word of his appeal.326 Mena\u2019s family ultimately settled with the city of Denver for $400,000.327 To its credit, the city of Denver instituted some strong reforms in response to Mena\u2019s death. The reforms drastically cut down on the number of no-knock warrants carried out in the city, though reforms stopped short of an outright prohibition on no-knock warrants for drug raids.328 Denver is the exception, however. Most high-profile SWAT tragedies temporarily put reporters on the scent for similar abuses, light a fire under activists, and put policymakers on the defensive. But that public scrutiny is usually followed by a return to business as usual. The case that spurred the Capital Times indepth investigation of SWAT team proliferation to small-town Wisconsin stemmed from an incident in tiny Dalton, a rural town 50 miles north of Madison. Wendy and Jesus Olveda. Wendy Olveda, who was five months pregnant, her husband Jesus, and their three-year-old daughter Zena were at home one evening in October 2000 when a black-clad SWAT team broke down their front door and threw the couple facefirst to the floor. Zena Olveda looked on from the couch. Jesus Olveda told the paper that as he lifted his head to tell police they had the wrong address, \u201cone of them put a knee on my head and ground it into the floor.\u201d329 Police had the wrong address. When they realized their error, they rushed through the Olveda\u2019s garage door to the home next door. The Times reported that one officer went back to the Olveda\u2019s home minutes later to retrieve the search warrant. The Olvedas filed a claim for compensation against the police departments in charge of carrying out the raid. The claim was rejected.330 Two years before the Olveda raid, police in another small Wisconsin town mistakenly raided the home of Daniel and Cythia Cuervo, holding the couple at gunpoint while the officers ransacked their home. The Cuervos eventually accepted a settlement in their lawsuit against the responsible local police agencies. The mistaken raid on their home inspired a significant reorganization of the Multi-jurisdictional Enforcement Group narcotics unit in the Lake Winnebago area of Wisconsin.331 But the rash of media reports of botched raids in Wisconsin in the year 2000 came a full five years after the state had already done some introspection on paramilitary police tactics when such tactics had ended with a man\u2019s death. Scott Bryant. On April 17, 1995, police in Dodge County, Wisconsin, forcefully entered the mobile home of Scott Bryant after finding traces of marijuana in his garbage. The officers would later say they knocked and announced before entering, but neighbors who witnessed the raid say police entered without doing either. Moments later, Detective Robert Neuman shot an unarmed Bryant in the chest, killing him. Bryant\u2019s eight-yearold son was asleep in the next room. Neuman told investigators he \u201ccan\u2019t remember\u201d pulling the trigger.332 Dodge County sheriff Stephen Fitzgerald compared the shooting to a hunting accident.333 Two years later, Bryant\u2019s family was awarded a $950,000 settlement by Dodge County.334 After the Bryant case made headlines, three victims of a similar raid by the Dodge County Sheriff\u2019s Department also filed suit. According to that lawsuit, police raided a home in Juneau, Wisconsin, after finding traces of marijuana and material \u201csuspected of packing cocaine\u201d in garbage bags outside the house. Police entered the home \u201csuddenly and violently\u201d at 2:45 a.m., threw the three occupants to the floor, and handcuffed them. Police then searched the house for more than three hours. No charges were filed.335 After the settlement in the Bryant case, and a year after the shooting, Sheriff Fitzgerald seemed remorseful. He told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that his own department would make substantial changes to the way it conducts searches. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say any time there\u2019s a tragic accident like this that people would want to do things differently,\u201d he said.336 Unfortunately, that message didn\u2019t make it to other small towns in Wisconsin. According to the Capital Times, 18 new SWAT teams have been formed across the state since the Bryant shooting.337 Although the case studies listed here cut off in the mid-1990s, the epidemic of botched military-style drug raids goes back to the early 1980s.338 As far back as 1990, an article in Playboy magazine took note of a curious rise in media accounts of botched drug raids and published a list of more than a dozen documented \u201cwrong door\u201d raids from the 1980s.339 In 2004, USA Today ran an editorial citing the Spruill and Goldberg raids and calling for reform in the execution of drug warrants. But the same paper ran a similar story more than a decade earlier, in 1993 (and even earlier, in 1989), ticking off a list of botched raids and a critique of noknock and paramilitary raids in general, including the problems with confidential informants, asset forfeiture, lack of oversight, and the militarization of civilian policing described in this study.340 The editorial also included responses from law enforcement officials dismissing botched raids as \u201cisolated incidents.\u201d341 So not only is the problem of mistaken raids not new, neither is the cycle of media and public officials temporarily taking notice of them, then neglecting to enact any real reforms. Here, in reverse chronological order, is a partial list of other documented wrongdoor raids dating back to 1995:\n\n\u2022 H. Victor Buerosse. On December 30, 2005, police in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, broke into the home of 68-year-old H. Victor Buerosse in a predawn raid. Buerosse was thrown into a closet door, then to the ground, and hit in the head with a police shield. Despite his protests that police had the wrong address, they didn\u2019t concede their mistake until a sergeant arrived later. They left without an apology. The SWAT team eventually raided the correct residence, where they found a small amount of marijuana. Buerosse, a retired attorney, told a local reporter: \u201cSWAT teams are not meant for simple pot possession cases. The purpose of SWAT teams it to give police departments a specially trained unit to react to a violent situation, not to create one. This should not happen in America. To me you can\u2019t justify carrying out simple, routine police work this way.\u201d342\n\n\u2022 Michelle Clancy. At 5:30 a.m. on December 21, 2005, police in Paterson, New Jersey, stormed the home of Michelle Clancy on a drug warrant, breaking off her doorknob. Clancy, her 65-year-old father, and her 13-year-old daughter were home at the time. Police later confirmed they had raided the wrong apartment. Police spokesman Lt. Anthony Traina told one reporter, \u201cThese things do happen.\u201d343\n\n\u2022 The Baker Family. Early in the morning on September 30, 2005, police in Stockbridge, Georgia, conducted a noknock raid on the home of Roy and Belinda Baker. Officers broke down the couple\u2019s front door with a battering ram and tossed in flashbang grenades. The police held the couple at gunpoint, handcuffed them, and then sent them out onto their porch, only partially clothed. Police ruined a family Bible and antique coffee table during the raid. The raiding officers eventually realized the intended target of their raid lived next door. Police Chief Russ Abernathy called the raid \u201cinexcusable\u201d and \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and blamed poor street lighting for the mistaken address. But Abernathy added that no one would be fired and that the raids would go on, albeit after \u201creviewing procedures.\u201d The Bakers are considering a lawsuit.344\n\n\u2022 Harold and Carolyn Smith. In September 2005, police in Bel Aire, Kansas, raided the home of Harold Smith, the town\u2019s former mayor, after mistaking sunflowers in the man\u2019s backyard for marijuana plants. Police had taken pictures of the plants and showed them to a judge, who then approved the search warrant. Police rifled through the mayor and his wife\u2019s belongings and took videotape of their home before realizing their mistake.345\n\n\u2022 David Scheper. On August 18, 2005, police in Baltimore, Maryland, forced their way into the home of David Scheper and Sascha Wagner. Thinking they were being robbed, Wagner called 911, telling the operator, \u201cThere\u2019s someone breaking into my house.\u201d Scheper had already slammed the door on the officer, who never announced they were police. The police then shattered the glass on the home\u2019s front door. Scheper stood just inside, holding his 12-gauge shotgun. He didn\u2019t have ammunition but hoped that racking the gun within earshot of the door would scare off the intruders. When they wouldn\u2019t leave, Scheper retreated to his basement and grabbed the only functioning weapon in his house, a CZ- 52 semiautomatic. As Scheper struggled to load the weapon, it accidentally discharged, sending a round into the floor of his basement. Police took $1,440 in cash Scheper says he had recently withdrawn to buy a used truck. According to the Baltimore City Paper, police also \u201chit a 70-year-old art-deco-style metal desk with an ax. They took 18 of Scheper\u2019s guns\u2014mostly inoperable antiques, he says. \u2018They threatened to blow up my safe,\u2019 Scheper says, so he opened it for them.\u201d The police were mistaken. They were looking for a tenant Scheper had evicted weeks earlier. Nevertheless, police still put Scheper\u2019s antique gun collection on display for the local news as part of a \u201croundup\u201d of illegal weapons they\u2019d found in two raids. Police charged Scheper for firing the weapon in his basement, a charge that carried a possible $1,000 fine and a year in prison. Prosecutors eventually dropped that charge, but only after Scheper\u2019s lawyer successfully fought to get Wagner\u2019s 911 call admitted as evidence.346\n\n\u2022 Cedelie Pompee.In August 2005, police in Newark, New Jersey, raided a home owned by 59-year-old Cedelie Pompee while looking for drugs and guns. Pompee, her family, and the family to whom she rents an apartment said police cursed them while ravaging through their belongings. Officials from the state police SWAT team and the DEA later realized they had raided the wrong address. The Associated Press reports that state police had made a similar mistake four months earlier.347\n\n\u2022 John Simpson. On June 15, 2005, Nampa, Idaho, police serving a search warrant tossed a flashbang grenade into the home of Vietnam veteran John Simpson. The frightened Simpson first took cover and attempted to protect his wife. He then composed himself, assumed he was being attacked by intruders, and ventured out with the only weapon he could find, the hose from his vacuum cleaner. The police had targeted the wrong side of Simpson\u2019s duplex. \u201cI guess we\u2019re going to have to seek psychological help, I hate to say that,\u201d Simpson told the Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m not nuts or anything, but I\u2019m still shaking. Put a shotgun next to your ear and pull the trigger to get an idea of the noise.\u201d Police later picked up Simpson\u2019s neighbor with four ounces of marijuana.348\n\n\u2022 The Chidester Family.In May 2005 in Utah County, Utah, Larry Chidester awoke to hear explosions at the home next to his. He went outside and saw members of a local SWAT team preparing to raid his neighbor\u2019s home. According to a lawsuit filed by the Chidester family, one of the SWAT officers spotted Larry Chidester, pointed at him, and exclaimed, \u201cThere\u2019s one!\u201d Chidester threw his hands in the air and repeatedly said, \u201cI\u2019m not resisting.\u201d The officer tackled Chidester and, according to Chidester, \u201cshoved his face into the ground and rocks.\u201d Larry Chidester was later taken to the emergency room for treatment. Police then kicked open a side door to the Chidester home and swarmed the bedroom where Lawrence Chidester\u2014Larry\u2019s father\u2014was dressing. They threw him to the floor and trained a gun to the back of his head. SWAT officers later conceded they had raided the wrong home. Utah County sheriff Jim Tracy later admitted the Chidester home wasn\u2019t the original target of the raid, but that police decided to raid their home as \u201can ancillary issue.\u201d He said police disputed the accuracy of the Chidesters\u2019 account of the raid, but wouldn\u2019t give details.349\n\n\u2022 Queen Moore. On October 10, 2004, police in Omaha, Nebraska, conducted a narcotics raid on the home of Queen Moore, an elderly woman. When Moore filed suit for the damage officers did to her home, the police initially refused to be interviewed, on advice from the police union. Worse, the police department told Moore her complaint wasn\u2019t valid because union rules required it to be handwritten, not typewritten. Moore\u2019s lawyer responded that requiring her to personally write out her complaint \u201cis not only illegal, but unduly burdensome and harassing,\u201d as Moore could barely sign her own name. Police found no contraband in Moore\u2019s home. She was never charged or arrested.350\n\n\u2022 Teresa Guiler and James Elliott. In September 2004, a SWAT team in Clarksville, Tennessee, erroneously raided the home of Teresa Guiler, 55, and James Elliott, 54. Elliot, who is deaf, was recovering from a liver transplant at the time of the raid. The warrant had identified the wrong home. Police Chief Mark Smith said he would investigate to make sure the same mistake didn\u2019t happen again.351\n\u2022 Blair Davis. On July 27, 2004, police in Houston, Texas, broke open the door of Blair Davis, a landscape contractor. Police screamed \u201cDown on the Floor! Down on the Floor!\u201d while pointing an assault weapon at Davis\u2019s head. Davis\u2019s first thought was that the invaders were criminals dressed as police, a continuing problem in the Houston area. A team of 8\u201310 police officers pushed Davis to the ground and handcuffed him while they searched his home. They were acting on a tip from a confidential informant who said Davis was growing marijuana in his home. The plants in question turned out to be hibiscus plants. Police never apologized to Davis. Dan Webb, operations commander for the police team that conducted the raid, later said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that Davis \u201cgot caught up in this situation,\u201d but that \u201cif the situation came up today, we would\u2019ve probably done the same thing.\u201d Webb added, \u201cIt\u2019s not a mistaken search warrant . . . if we believe it\u2019s marijuana, until we go look at it, we\u2019re not really going to know for sure,\u201d overlooking the fact that an innocent person was needlessly terrorized due to his unit \u201cnot knowing for sure.\u201d352\n\n\u2022 Donald and Amber Mundy. In February 2004, police in San Bernardino, California, looking for cocaine broke open the door to an apartment occupied by Donald Mundy and his twin sister, Amber. When officers realized they had raided apartment \u201c204\u201d instead of apartment \u201c214\u201d as specified in the warrant, they conducted a search anyway and arrested Amber Mundy on charges of misdemeanor marijuana possession.353\n\n\u2022 Marion Waltman. In September 2003, an informant\u2019s tip led police in Gulfport, Mississippi, to raid land leased by Marion Waltman. Waltman was growing kenaf plants, which are commonly used for deer food. Police raided the property and mistakenly destroyed more than 500 plants, believing they were marijuana. A judge later ruled that the city wasn\u2019t obligated to compensate Waltman for the destruction of his property because the sheriff\u2019s department made an \u201chonest mistake.\u201d354\n\n\u2022 Earline Jackson.At 3 a.m. on September 5, 2003, a dozen Chicago police officers used a battering ram to break down the door of 73-year-old widow Earline Jackson\u2019s apartment. \u201cI asked them, \u2018What did I do?\u2019 And they told me to get out of the way because they were looking for drugs,\u201d Jackson told the Chicago Tribune. A warrant for Jackson\u2019s address said police believed a man was using her apartment to sell drugs. Police had mistaken Jackson\u2019s apartment for an apartment one block south.355\n\n\u2022 Francisca Perez. On August 2, 2003, police from the Bexar County, Texas, sheriff\u2019s department raided the home of Francisca Perez and her children. The raid was based on a tip from an informant that a woman named Rosalinda Mendez was selling cocaine from the house. Police handcuffed Perez and her 13-year-old daughter, while her 11-yearold daughter and three-year-old son watched in horror as police destroyed her house looking for drugs. They found nothing incriminating. Four weeks later, police still hadn\u2019t told Perez whether or not she was under investigation. According to the latest media reports available, Perez, the widow of a Gulf War veteran, was still attempting to get the police to clear her name. She told a local newspaper that she was reluctant to take legal action because her children were terrified that if she did, the police would come back to raid their home again.356\n\n\u2022 Gabrielle Wescott. On July 29, 2003, police in Montana raided the home of Gabrielle Wescott and her daughter Annabelle Heasley. According to a 2005 lawsuit, agents from the Northwest Drug Task Force donned black hoods and SWAT gear and raided their home at 7:30 a.m. on a marijuana warrant. Police forced the two to the ground, handcuffed them, and according to the lawsuit, \u201cmistreated, threatened, cursed at, and terrorized\u201d them, while police \u201cransacked the house\u201d and \u201ccut pieces of drywall out of the basement.\u201d The complaint alleges that the police affidavit leading to the search warrant \u201ccontains half-truths and inaccuracies and clearly was not completed in good faith,\u201d and that police never identified themselves. The women were never charged.357\n\n\u2022 The Phoenix Hell\u2019s Angels.In July 2003, police in Phoenix, Arizona, conducted a pre-dawn drug raid on a Hell\u2019s Angels club. Police knocked, then waited just six seconds before deploying a flashbang grenade and forcing their way into the clubhouse. Michael Wayne Coffelt, who was asleep at the time, awoke to the grenade and quickly armed himself with a pistol. When Coffelt, who thought the clubhouse was being robbed, approached the door, Officer Laura Beeler shot and wounded him. Beeler claims Coffelt fired at her, though a ballistics test later confirmed that Coffelt never discharged his gun. Police did not find any drugs in the clubhouse. Prosecutors later brought charges against Coffelt for assaulting a police officer. In dismissing the charges, Maricopa Superior Court judge Michael Wilkinson described the raid as an \u201cattack\u201d in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and said Coffelt\u2019s actions were \u201creasonable behavior, given the hour and the fact that the house was under attack.\u201d Wilkinson also determined that Beeler\u2019s mistaken belief that Coffelt had fired at her was also understandable, given the volatility of such a raid and that the officer may have misinterpreted the flashbang grenade for a gunshot.358\n\n\u2022 The Holguin Family.According to court documents filed in conjunction with a lawsuit, the Holguin family of Albuquerque, New Mexico, say police blew their door off its hinges, deployed flashbang grenades, then stormed their home on June 5, 2003. Carmen Holguin, 80, required medical treatment for injuries she sustained during the raid. The lawsuit also alleges that Julia Holguin, 55, was injured when an officer stepped on her back, and that police kicked an unnamed 14-year-old girl while executing the warrant. None of the four were charged, and police seized nothing from the home. A paralegal for the family\u2019s lawyer told the Associated Press that police had made a controlled cocaine buy on the street where the Holguins lived and indicated they may have mistaken the family\u2019s home for the place they had bought the drugs.359\n\n\u2022 Sandy Cohen. In 2002, police in Philadelphia raided the home of 85- year-old Sandy Cohen as she was taking a shower. Cohen got to her door just as police were blowing it off its hinges. When she protested to police that they had raided the wrong home, one replied, \u201cThat\u2019s what they all say.\u201d Police later conceded they\u2019d made a mistake. Cohen\u2019s neighbors had told the raiding officers they were making a mistake while they were planting the explosives outside her door.360\n\n\u2022 The Huerta Family. On November 20, 2002, a San Antonio, Texas, SWAT team deployed tear gas canisters, shattered a glass door with bullets, then stormed an apartment occupied by three Hispanic men. \u201cWe were kicked and punched at least 20 times. I couldn\u2019t talk. I was good and scared,\u201d Salvador Huerta told the San Antonio News-Express. His cousin Marcos Huerta was taken to the hospital with a cut face and bruised head. Vincent Huerta added, \u201cThe way they entered, I never thought it could be police.\u201d All three thought the raid was a robbery. Police had the wrong address.361 Police later blamed the mistake on darkness, and \u201ca cluster of look-alike buildings,\u201d despite the fact that officers stated on the warrant that they had conducted surveillance on the suspected residence for two days.362\n\n\u2022 Irene Gilliam Hensley. On August 14, 2002, police in La Porte, Texas, stormed the home of 88-year-old Irene Gilliam Hensley on a paramilitary raid after a tip that her grandson Charles Gilliam was growing marijuana in her backyard. The tip came from an aunt who had had an argument with Gilliam, and police decided to raid after an officer peeked over Hensley\u2019s fence and confirmed the presence of marijuana. According to the Houston Chronicle, the warrant specifically stated that the officer who peeked over the fence had experience identifying marijuana plants. The plants turned out to be okra. Police found no drugs in the home.363\n\n\u2022 The Gilbertson Family. In February 2002, a SWAT team in Denver\u2019s Highland neighborhood shattered a window in anticipation of a raid. Upon looking inside, they discovered they had broken into the wrong townhouse. They were preparing to deploy a flashbang grenade in the home, occupied by Erik Gilbertson and his pregnant wife. The couple was at the opera at the time of the raid. A police spokesman called the raid an \u201cunderstandable mistake.\u201d364\n\n\u2022 Maria Flores. In May 2001, police in Austin, Texas, raided the home of Maria Flores, a grandmother. A flashbang grenade shattered her window, and the SWAT team entered behind by kicking in her door. Police shoved Flores to the ground, bound her, and held her at gunpoint while they tore apart her home in a search for cocaine. They had mistaken her house for the house next door. Flores was taken to the hospital with internal bruising. \u201cFor about 20 minutes, I was on the floor crying, wondering \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Flores told the Austin American Statesman. \u201cI\u2019m just glad my grandkids weren\u2019t here.\u201d Six months after the raid, police acknowledged the raid was a \u201cterrible mistake.\u201d Assistant Police Chief Jim Fealy said, \u201cWe violated that woman\u2019s privacy and needlessly [sic] by mistake.\u201d He attributed the error to \u201csloppy police work.\u201d365\n\n\u2022 Estelle Newcomb. In October 2001, a drug task force in Middlesex, Virginia, broke down the door of 50-year-old Estelle Newcomb and her 80-year-old aunt. Police had targeted the wrong home after miscommunicating with an informant. The investigating officer told the Associated Press: \u201cI knew this was not right. To be honest with you, it was sloppy police work\u2014not being thorough enough.\u201d The previous July, the same task force, along with the National Guard and state police, conducted a raid on a suspect they thought was growing marijuana. The plants turned out to be tomatoes.366\n\n\u2022 Charles and Debora Alexander. On August 17, 2001, police in Waco, Texas, served a drug warrant on the home of Debora and Charles Alexander. According to the Waco Tribune-Herald, police charged the residence with guns drawn, yelling \u201cPolice, search warrant!\u201d before realizing they had entered the wrong apartment. The Alexanders\u2019 visiting nine-year-old grandson, who has Down\u2019s Syndrome, went into a seizure. Debora Alexander fainted. Charles Alexander says that upon realizing their mistake, police left without apologizing, or offering to help either Debora or the grandson. Just seconds before the raid, Debora had been unpacking boxes, one of which contained her husband\u2019s gun. Charles told the TribuneHerald, \u201cGod only knows what would have happened if they would have walked down that hall with her holding that gun.\u201d Remarkably, on August 20\u2014three days after the raid\u2014Lieutenant Gary McCully told the paper he wasn\u2019t aware that his own officers had entered the wrong apartment until a reporter had called and told him.367\n\n\u2022 Sandra Smith. In May 2001, a Travis County, Texas, SWAT team conducted a raid on the home of Sandra Smith for suspicion of growing marijuana. After departing from a helicopter, storming Smith\u2019s home, kicking her dog, ransacking her belongings, and holding her and three visitors at gunpoint, police discovered the plants were ragweed. \u201cThis is the most terrifying thing that\u2019s ever happened to me in my life,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in trouble with the law.\u201d Smith filed a lawsuit against the city for damage to her home. At the time the suit was filed in 2002, her name was in the department\u2019s database as a narcotics offender. Travis County settled with Smith and her visitors for $40,000. The Travis County SWAT team was later dissolved after a series of questionable raids.368\n\n\u2022 Henry and Denise McKnight. On February 27, 2001, at about 10:30 p.m., police in Topeka, Kansas, kicked open the front door, detonated a flashbang grenade, and held Henry and Denise McKnight and their seven children at gunpoint on a drug warrant. They had mistaken the McKnight\u2019s home for the home next door. The McKnights\u2019 subsequent lawsuit alleged that police questioned them at gunpoint and continued to search the home even after realizing they\u2019d made a mistake. Police Chief Ed Klumpp acknowledged the mistake and said that the police department would make \u201cminor adjustments\u201d to its procedures, though he wouldn\u2019t say what those adjustments would be \u201cbecause it would jeopardize the safety of our officers.\u201d The Topeka City Council eventually settled with the family for $95,000.369\n\n\u2022 Susan Wilson. On February 15, 2001, a SWAT team dressed in full-assault attire stormed the home of Muskego, Wisconsin, resident Susan Wilson, 49. Wilson was standing in her driveway with her dog when the Waukesha County Metro Drug Enforcement Group apprehended her. Police forced her face down on her snowcovered drive, handcuffed her, and held her at gunpoint while police searched her home. They had the wrong address.370\n\n\u2022 Sandra Hillman.On January 19, 2001, police from Russellville and Franklin County, Alabama, raided the home of Sandra Hillman and her daughter Marquita. Agents with a no-knock warrant kicked down the door to Hillman\u2019s apartment and held the two women handcuffed and at gunpoint while conducting their search. Police never identified themselves. Hillman made two subsequent trips to an emergency room for heart problems related to the raid. Police had the wrong address.371\n\n\u2022 John Adams. On October 4, 2000, at about 10 p.m., police in Lebanon, Tennessee, raided the home of 64-year-old John Adams on a drug warrant. In what Lebanon police chief Billy Weeks would later say was a \u201csevere, costly mistake,\u201d police had identified the wrong house. According to Adams\u2019s wife, police would not identify themselves after knocking on the couple\u2019s door. After she refused to let them in, they broke down the door and handcuffed her. Adams met the police in another room with a sawed-off shotgun. Police opened fire and shot Adams dead. One officer was fired after the incident, and several others were suspended, but no criminal charges were filed.372 Adams\u2019s widow eventually won a $400,000 settlement from the city.373\n\n\u2022 Daniel and Rosa Unis.In 2000, federal agents in Pueblo, Colorado, stormed the home of Daniel and Rosa Unis after suspecting their sons of cocaine distribution. With no warrant, police in black ski masks broke into the Unis home at gunpoint and arrested Marcos and David Unis. The two were kept in custody for two days but were never charged. When the Unis family filed a federal lawsuit in 2005, the lawyer for the agent in charge of the raid conceded that the raid was illegal. One officer described the incident as \u201cunfortunate\u201d and said \u201cmiscommunication\u201d led to the wrongful raid, arrests, and detainments.374\n\n\u2022 William and Geneva Summers. On May 22, 2000, police in Pulaski, Virginia, conducted a 4 a.m. raid on the home of William and Geneva Summers. The SWAT team broke through the couple\u2019s back door, woke them, and held them at gunpoint. Police had the wrong address. They had raided the home on the basis of a tip from a \u201creliable\u201d informant that there was a methamphetamine lab inside. Magistrate Judge Jill Long concluded that police assertions that the informant was \u201creliable\u201d were sufficient to establish probable cause for a pre-dawn, forced-entry search. The informant later admitted he had lied.375\n\n\u2022 Brandon and Richelle Savage.On April 6, 2000, police in Chicago raided the apartment of Brandon and Richelle Savage on bad information from an informant. Police broke down the door and ordered the couple out of bed at gunpoint before realizing their mistake. Police officials then ignored the Savages\u2019 request to pay for damage done to their apartment until a columnist reported the incident in the Chicago Sun-Times. 376\n\n\u2022 Dovie Walker. On December 4, 1999, police in El Dorado, Arkansas, conducted a drug raid on the home of Dovie Walker. Officers tore the woman\u2019s front door from its hinges with a battering ram, damaged another door to her bed-room, broke a latch on a third door, overturned and broke Walker\u2019s furniture, and generally \u201cdemolished\u201d her house. Police officers had handcuffed Walker\u2019s three children at gunpoint before realizing they had mistaken her house for the one next door. Walker was also babysitting children of ages one, two, and three at the time of the raid. When a police department spokesman told a local newspaper police had no intention of paying for the damage they did to Walker\u2019s home, El Dorado\u2019s mayor promised four days later to begin work on the damage to Walker\u2019s house \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d377\n\n\u2022 The Tyson Family. On October 20, 1999, police from the DEA, the FBI, and Connecticut Department of Public Safety conducted 30 drug raids at locations around the Hartford area. One of those raids was on the home of 59-yearold Emma Tyson, her daughter-in-law, and her 13-year-old grandson. Twelve police officers broke into Tyson\u2019s home, causing her to have an asthma attack. Police were looking for a suspected drug dealer who had moved out of the home four months earlier, when Tyson bought it. Tyson filed a lawsuit two years later, when federal and local police authorities had yet to apologize or make an effort to clear her name.378\n\n\u2022 Mario Paz. On August 9, 1999, 20 police officers from the El Monte, California, SWAT team conducted a late-night raid on the home of 65-yearold Mario Paz. By the end of the raid, Paz had been fatally shot in the back by police. The police version of events changed several times from the night of the raid. Police first said Paz was armed. They next said he wasn\u2019t armed but was reaching for a gun. Their final account was that Paz was reaching not for a gun but to open a drawer where a gun was located. Paz was unarmed when he was shot. Police later revealed that they had conducted the raid after finding the Paz address on the driver\u2019s license, vehicle registration, and an old cell phone bill of suspected drug dealer Marcos Beltran Lizarraga (charges against Lizarraga were subsequently dropped, in part because the videotape that was supposed to contain a recording of the search of his home turned up blank).379 As mentioned earlier, one El Monte police official would later say that anticipated \u201cproceeds\u201d from the Paz family in asset forfeiture also played a part in the raid. The Paz family explained that Lizarraga had lived next to them in the 1980s and had convinced Mario Paz to let him receive mail at their residence after he moved. Three weeks after the raid, the El Monte Police Department announced that they had no evidence that anyone in the Paz family was involved in any illicit drug activity, nor did the SWAT team have any reason to think so on the night Paz was shot.380 During the raid, police seized more than $10,000 in cash and announced plans to claim the money for themselves via asset forfeiture laws. Police backed off those plans when the Paz family proved the money to be their life savings. Shortly after the Paz shooting made headlines, El Monte police conducted another raid on the home of an immigrant family. Police confronted Rosa Felix on September 22, 1999, after breaking into her home. According to a lawsuit Felix would later file, the officers told her that they knew her family was trafficking drugs, that they had information that she knew Paz, and that unless she gave them incriminating information about Paz, they would handcuff her, arrest her, and take away her children. Felix refused, insisting that her only interaction with Paz was from buying used cars from him. Charges were never filed against Felix.381 In October 2001, the officer who shot Paz was exonerated in investigations by both the Department of Justice and the LAPD. A county prosecutor insisted that Officer George Hopkins \u201cacted lawfully in self-defense\u201d during the raid.382 El Monte\u2019s police department was known to be highly militaristic\u2014but also effective. The town\u2019s police department boasted an assault vehicle with gun turret dubbed the \u201cpeacekeeper,\u201d as well as a helicopter. In 1992\u2014five years before the Paz shooting\u2014a federal appeals court had found \u201cChief Wayne Clayton, as a policymaker, acquiesced in a custom of complacency, if not hostility, toward allegations of misconduct by the department\u2019s officers.\u201d One mayor who tried to clean up the police department was voted out of office with help from the town\u2019s police union. \u201cThey run city hall. Nobody has control over the police,\u201d former El Monte mayor Pat Wallach told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThey can do as they damn well please. They have a helicopter, a tank. They have carte blanche.\u201d383 In 2002, the city of El Monte settled with the Paz family for $3 million. The city also agreed to 13 conditions put forth by the family, mostly reforms in the way it carries out search warrants and deploys its SWAT team. Even in agreeing to the settlement, however, many city officials insisted the police did nothing wrong. \u201cWe don\u2019t view it as whether we were liable for his death,\u201d said city attorney Clarke Moseley. \u201cWe believe the family was involved [in narcotics trafficking] to some extent.\u201d No member of the Paz family was ever charged with a crime.384\n\n\u2022 Ralph Garrison. On December 16, 1996, a SWAT team wearing black balaclavas raided a rental property owned by 69-yearold Ralph Garrison. Police were acting on a tip that the property contained equipment being used by methamphetamine addicts to print counterfeit checks and currency. Police conducted the 6 a.m. raid with the aid of a helicopter from U.S. Customs and two K-9 units. As the raid commenced, Garrison confronted the police and asked why they were on his property. Raiding officers claim they told Garrison they were police executing a warrant. Just how clear they were is in dispute. Garrison immediately returned to his home to call 911. He asked the dispatcher to send police, because vandals with \u201caxes and all kinds of stuff\u201d were breaking into his rental property. Garrison later told the dispatcher, \u201cI\u2019ve got my gun. I\u2019ll shoot the son of a bitch.\u201d According to raiding officers, Garrison then emerged from his house with a gun, whereupon three officers opened fire on him with AR-15 assault rifles, killing him. Police handcuffed Garrison after shooting him, then searched his home. They also shot his dog, a 14-year-old chow, and handcuffed his wife, 69-year-old Molly Garrison, who said police didn\u2019t remove their hoods or identify themselves until after the raid. Police made no arrests. One of the officers involved in the Garrison raid, Howard Neal Terry, had been subject to three federal excessiveforce lawsuits in the previous six years, causing the city of Albuquerque to pay a total of $375,000 in settlements. In 1999, a federal court dismissed the Garrison estate\u2019s lawsuit against the police department, holding that the officers had \u201cqualified immunity,\u201d which protects them from civil damages in any lawsuit where it is determined that police did not clearly violate any established constitutional protections.385\n\n\u2022 Catherine Capps and James Cates. In May 1999, police stormed the Durham, North Carolina, home of 73-year-old Catherine Capps. Also in the house at the time was Capps\u2019s friend, 71-year-old James Cates. Police say they obtained a warrant for the home after a confidential informant bought crack cocaine there. Capps had poor vision, was deaf, and according to her family, \u201ccould not even cook an egg without being extremely out of breath.\u201d When police raided the home, they ordered Cates to stand. Hobbled by a war wound and frightened, Cates stumbled at the order and fell into a police officer. Sgt. L. C. Smith apparently mistook Cates\u2019s stumble as a lunge for the officer\u2019s pistol. Smith responded by punching the elderly man twice in the face. Cates, 79, wasn\u2019t permitted to use the bathroom during the search, causing him to urinate on himself. Both Cates and Capps were also strip-searched. No drugs were found in the home or on Capps\u2019s or Cates\u2019s person.386 Capps later died from health maladies her family says she incurred during the raid. She was never charged with selling crack cocaine to the informant because, according to prosecutors, trying her would have required them to release the informant\u2019s name.387Subsequent investigations conducted by the Durham Police Department, the FBI, and the local district attorney found no wrongdoing on the part of police.388 About six months prior to the CappsCates raid, the city of Durham had set up a citizens\u2019 review board, in part due to community complaints about other allegations of excessive force on the part of police. But like similar review boards in other parts of the country, proceedings were often conducted in secret, complainants weren\u2019t given access to witnesses or evidence, and laws regarding search warrants kept vital information sealed. When Capps\u2019s family attempted to file a complaint with the review board, the board instituted a new rule denying a hearing to any complainant who had previously sought financial compensation from the city, and applied the rule retroactively. Though neither Capps nor her family had asked for compensation, Cates had, giving the review board cause to refuse to even listen to a complaint about the raid.389\n\n\u2022 Tina and Margie Peterson.On April 4, 1999, police conducted a drug raid on a home in Kaysville, Utah, four days after obtaining the warrant and three weeks after obtaining the information to get the warrant. Despite the fact that a moving van sat in front of the apartment the officers carried on with the raid. They burst in on Tina and Margie Peterson, two sisters who were just moving into the apartment. Police charged in with guns drawn, and ordered the sisters and their two guests to the floor. According to the Petersons, officers continued to detain and question them even after they showed identification and proof that they were new tenants. The sisters filed suit against the police department in 2004.390\n\n\u2022 Edwin and Catherine Bernhardt. On February 9, 1999, police in Hallandale, Florida, conducted a late-night raid on the home of Catherine and Edwin Bernhardt. Edwin, whose job requires him to get up at 4 a.m., was asleep. Catherine was on the couch. Police busted open the Bernhardt\u2019s window and jammed an assault rifle inside. Edwin Bernhardt woke up and ran downstairs in the nude. Police pushed Catherine to the floor and handcuffed her at gunpoint. They then subdued, handcuffed, and forced Edwin Bernhardt down into a chair, while a police officer outfitted him with a pair of his wife\u2019s underwear. He was arrested and spent several hours in jail, still clad only in the underwear, until police realized their mistake and drove him home. When the couple later filed suit, the city of Hallandale fought back. City attorney Richard Kane told the Miami Herald that citizens should expect such tactics as the price of the drug war. \u201cThey made a mistake. There\u2019s no one to blame for a mistake,\u201d Kane said. \u201cThe way these people were treated has to be judged in the context of a war.\u201d When asked to comment on the suit, Fort Lauderdale police captain Tom Tiderington said: \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no perfect formula for success. It could happen at any time.\u2019\u2019 The Herald reported recent similar \u201cwrong door\u201d raids in Seminole County (twice), Largo, and Tampa.391 A year later, police in Hallandale made another botched raid, storming the home of a pregnant woman and her three young children. Police insisted they had the correct house, based on a tip from an informant who said he\u2019d bought drugs there. They didn\u2019t find any drugs. The woman whose home was raided, Tracy Bell, had complained to police about drug activity in the neighborhood and says police had confused her home with the one next door. Bell\u2019s neighbor, who had a criminal record, admitted to having friends involved in drug distribution. Bell had no record. Hallandale police insisted that this time, unlike with the Bernhardt raid, they had the correct address. Bell\u2019s attorney noted that police seem to have made the same mistakes, and offered the same excuse, for this raid as they had with the Bernhardt raid. Attorney Gary Kollin told the Miami Herald, \u201cIt appears that they continue to use informants as their scapegoats when they mess up and then they hide behind the confidentiality of the informants to avoid a proper investigation into who is telling the truth.\u201d392\n\n\u2022 Earl Richardson. In June 1998, police in Raleigh, North Carolina, broke down the door of 66-year-old Earl Richardson in a mistaken drug raid. Police ordered Richardson to the floor while they rummaged through his belongings. They had meant to raid an unmarked apartment to the rear of Richardson\u2019s home. After an apology from Raleigh mayor Tom Fetzer, Richardson said: \u201cI don\u2019t have anything against the city. I\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t get shot.\u201d393 Five months later, Raleigh police would conduct another botched raid at the home of Priscilla Clark. \u201cI looked out my bedroom door and saw this big gun coming down the hall and a man dressed in black,\u201d said Clark, who was pregnant at the time. Police locked Clark and her two children in a bedroom for more than hour before realizing they\u2019d raided the wrong home.394\n\n\u2022 LaDana Ford. In March 1998, state troopers and local police in Harvey, Illinois, deployed a flashbang grenade then initiated a no-knock raid on the home of LaDana Ford. Police handcuffed Ford\u2019s 13-year-old and questioned her 7-year-old, while keeping the entire family at gunpoint. They later realized they\u2019d raided the wrong address. Harvey police chief Phil Hardiman was unapologetic. \u201cWe make out search warrants when we get information from drug informants,\u201d he told the Chicago SunTimes. \u201cSometimes they give us incorrect information, and warrants are made out for one house when we\u2019re really looking for the house next door. I think that\u2019s what happened here. That happens from time to time in any police department.\u201d When asked if the department would apologize, Hardiman replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019d apologize. It\u2019s not unusual for that to happen sometimes, but I will say it doesn\u2019t happen that often.\u201d395\n\n\u2022 The Fulton Family.On March 18, 1998, police raided the Bronx apartment of a grandmother, her daughter, and her sixyear-old grandson. The Fulton family was watching television when police pounded on the door, then broke it open and began tearing through the apartment looking for drugs. They had the wrong apartment.396\n\n\u2022 Jennifer Switalski and Tenants. On February 2, 1998, police in Milwaukee conducted a 6:30 a.m. raid on a building owned by Jennifer Switalski. Switalski wasn\u2019t home at the time, but her two tenants were. After breaking down the door, police handcuffed the two tenants while a terrified two-year-old girl looked on. Police had the wrong address. Switalksi later tried to sue the city for emotional distress and loss of income after her frightened tenants moved out. City officials balked. \u201cIf it happened to me, I would be upset, too,\u201d said city attorney Louis Elder. \u201cBut the taxpayer should not have to pay for hurt feelings because those deputies inadvertently entered the wrong home.\u201d Elder also said Switalski was filled with \u201cgrandiose ideas\u201d for attempting to sue the city, though she herself hadn\u2019t witnessed the raid.397\n\n\u2022 The Baines Family. On November 8, 1997, police in Suffolk County, New York, received a tip from a drug suspect that residents of a home in Wyandanch were stashing \u201c a black automatic pistol, two machine guns, a stainless steel sawed-off shotgun, ammunition, bulletproof vests, crack cocaine, proceeds from drugs sales and drug paraphernalia.\u201d Within hours of the tip, and with no corroborating investigation, a judge issued a no-knock warrant and police executed a raid on the address given by the informant. The address turned out to be the home of Denise Baines and her two sons. Baines\u2019s 10-year-old son\u2019s bedroom was trashed in the raid. Police apologized to the Baineses upon realizing they\u2019d raided the wrong home but defended the practice of executing quick, no-knock raids based on the tip of a single informant, even one who himself was a drug suspect.398\n\n\u2022 June Nixon. On August 19, 1997, police in Kaufman County, Texas, kicked down the door to the home of June Nixon, her daughter Melissa Cheek, and her granddaughter. Police handcuffed the women and strip-searched them at gunpoint before realizing they\u2019d raided the wrong house. The same sheriff\u2019s department was forced to apologize to two families in 1989 for mistaken drug raids that, according to the Dallas Morning News, \u201cturned up no drugs, but left houses damaged and family members shaken.\u201d399\n\n\u2022 Salt Lake Tortilla Factory Raid. In 1997, police in Salt Lake City, Utah, raided a tortilla factory and restaurant owned by Rafael Gomez, a naturalized citizen. Seventy-five heavily armed police officers stormed the business on a tip from a confidential informant. Expecting to find heroin and cocaine, they found only two 24-pill packs of the painkiller Darvon and two bottles of penicillin. Gomez says he was struck in the face and knocked to the floor, and that police trained a gun on his six-yearold son. One secretary says she was dragged to the floor by her hair. Police handcuffed 80 people, mostly Hispanic, in the raid and forced them to lie down for up to three hours as police searched the premises. Gomez spent a large sum of money fighting charges resulting from the raid, which were later dismissed. Bad publicity from the raid and the length of time it took to clear his name killed Gomez\u2019s business and dashed his hopes of opening a large shopping center in the area. He settled with the city of Salt Lake in 2004 for $290,000.400\n\n\u2022 The Tarkus Dillard Family. In June 1996, police raided the Pontoon Beach, Illinois, home of Tarkus Dillard, Vickie Blakely, and the couple\u2019s two young children. According to Dillard and Blakely, one officer pointed a gun directly in the face of their three-year-old daughter. Police had mistakenly raided their home instead of the home next door. Police Chief Michael Crouch apologized to Dillard and Blakely but insisted police had done nothing wrong. A federal judge threw out a $1 million lawsuit against the police department in 1998. A lawyer for the police officers called the suit\u2019s dismissal a \u201ctremendous vindication\u201d of the officers\u2019 actions and said he was contemplating suing Dillard and Blakely, to recoup the city\u2019s legal costs.401\n\n\u2022 Jeffrey and Phyllis Hampton. In May 1995, police in Concord, North Carolina, mistakenly stormed the home of Jeffrey and Phyllis Hampton. The Hamptons were relaxing at around 9:30 p.m. when police broke down the Hamptons\u2019 door, came into the house with assault weapons, and ordered the couple to the floor. Police realized their mistake after about a half hour of interrogation.402 Three years later, Concord police would wrongly raid another home, that of Leonard Mackin, Charlene Howie, and their four children. Police burst into that home with guns drawn on the night of May 22, 1998, and ordered the family to the floor. After repeated pleas by Mackin to police that they had the wrong house, Detective Larry Welch recognized Mackin as a co-worker with the city and asked, \u201cLeonard, is that you?\u201d A confidential informant had given police the wrong address.403 In 1999, police in the same town shot 15-year-old Thomas Edwards Jr. in the back while he was on his hands and knees under orders from another police paramilitary unit on a drug raid. Edwards and five other children, all aged 13\u201317, were at the house playing video games when police conducted the raid. Officer Lennie Rivera shot Edwards just below the hip when, according to an internal police investigation, \u201ca sudden movement jolted his gun, causing him to tighten his grip on it and pull the trigger.\u201d Police found a small amount of marijuana and cocaine at the home. Police Chief Robert E. Cansler said that his officers had done surveillance on the home an hour or two prior to the raid and that \u201cat that time there were no indications of a group of children present.\u201d Officer Rivera was found to have improperly held his finger on the gun\u2019s trigger and was assigned to more training.404\n\n\u2022 Richard Brown.On March 12, 1996, acting on a tip from an informant, a Miami SWAT team fired 122 rounds into the home of 73-year-old Richard Brown, while his 14 year-old great-granddaughter feared for her life in the bathroom. Brown was killed in the gunfire.405 Police found no drugs in Brown\u2019s home. The city has since paid a $2.5 million settlement to Brown\u2019s survivors, and police on the SWAT team that raided Brown\u2019s home were later indicted for lying about the details of the raid. Internal Affairs supervisor and 25-year police veteran John Dalton, now retired, told the Herald that the head of internal affairs at the time, a former SWAT team member, discouraged a thorough investigation of the Brown case. \u201cThey were very defensive about this shooting from the beginning,\u201d Dalton said, adding that he\u2019d been \u201cchewed out\u201d for asking difficult questions.\n\n\u2022 Charles Inscor.In March 1995, police in Oldsmar, Florida, smashed through a glass door, deployed flashbang grenades, and stormed what they thought was the apartment of a drug dealer. Instead, they found 31-year-old Charles Inscor, a wheelchair-bound man with a respiratory problem. The SWAT team soon realized it had raided the wrong home. Inscor was hospitalized for a week as a result of the raid. An ensuing investigation found that though deputies made many mistakes during the investigation and raid, no disciplinary action would be taken because no rules were broken. According to the St. Petersburg Times, police couldn\u2019t be disciplined because \u201cthe Sheriff\u2019s office had no policies concerning how the SWAT team should serve search warrants.\u201d406 Caught in the Crossfire Even when police have the correct address and have identified the correct suspect, and even if the suspect is correctly considered dangerous, too often they don\u2019t take note of innocent relatives, acquaintances, neighbors, or children who may be present during the raid and unnecessarily put in harm\u2019s way. Perhaps the most notable example of an innocent caught in drug raid crossfire is the case of 11-year-old Alberto Sepulveda. Alberto Sepulveda.Early in the morning on September 13, 2000, agents from the DEA, the FBI, and the Stanislaus County, California, drug enforcement agency conducted raids on 14 homes in and around Modesto, California after a 19-month investigation. According to the Los Angeles Times, the DEA and FBI asked that local SWAT teams enter each home unannounced to secure the area ahead of federal agents, who would then come to serve the warrants and search for evidence. Federal agents warned the SWAT teams that the targets of the warrants, including Alberto Sepulveda\u2019s father Moises, should be considered armed and dangerous.407 After police forcibly entered the Sepulveda home, Alberto, his father, his mother, his sister, and his brother were ordered to lie face down on the floor with arms outstretched. Half a minute after the raid began, the shotgun that officer David Hawn had trained on Alberto accidentally discharged, instantly killing the 11-year-old. No drugs or weapons were found in the home.408 The Los Angeles Times reports that when Modesto police asked federal investigators if there were any children present in the Sepulveda home, they replied, \u201cNot aware of any.\u201d409There were three. A subsequent internal investigation by the Modesto Police Department found that the DEA\u2019s evidence against Moises Sepulveda\u2014who had no previous criminal record\u2014was \u201cminimal.\u201d In 2002 he pled guilty to the last charge remaining against him as a result of the investigation\u2014using a telephone to distribute marijuana.410The city of Modesto and the federal government settled a lawsuit brought by the Sepulvedas for the death of their son for $3 million.411 At first, Modesto police chief Roy Wasden seemed to be moved by Sepulveda\u2019s death toward genuine reform. \u201cWhat are we gaining by serving these drug warrants?\u201d Wasden is quoted as asking in the Modesto Bee. \u201cWe ought to be saying, \u2018It\u2019s not worth the risk. We\u2019re not going to put our officers and community at risk anymore.\u2019\u201d412 Unfortunately, as part of the settlement with the Sepulvedas, while Modesto announced several reforms in the way its SWAT team would carry out drug raids, there was no mention of discontinuing the use of paramilitary units to conduct no-knock or knock-and-announce warrants on nonviolent drug offenders.413 Here are some other cases of people caught in drug-raid crossfire who weren\u2019t suspects:\n\n\u2022 Michael Meluzzi. On July 8, 2005, a Sarasota, Florida, SWAT team conducted a drug raid on a home where several children were playing in the front yard. The SWAT team descended from a van, deployed flashbang grenades in front of and inside the house, then swarmed the home. Forty-four-year-old Michael Meluzzi, who had a criminal record, fled when he saw the armed agents exit the van. Police chased Meluzzi down and fired a Taser gun at him, only partially hitting him. According to Officer Alan Devaney, Meluzzi then reached into his waistband, leading Devaney to believe Meluzzi was armed. Devaney opened fire, killing Meluzzi. Police found no weapon on or near Meluzzi\u2019s body.414\n\n\u2022 Ronnie Goodwin. On May 26, 2005, a SWAT team conducted a drug raid on the Syracuse, New York, home of Sonya Goodwin while looking for drug suspect Angelo Jenkins. Police had Ronnie Goodwin, 13, on the living room floor at gunpoint when a deputy on the SWAT team fired off several shots at the Goodwin\u2019s dog. One of those bullets ricocheted, striking the boy in the leg. Goodwin\u2019s mother later filed a lawsuit, claiming the boy suffered \u201csevere and debilitating\u201d injuries as a result of the bullet.415\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Lynn Noel. On January 21, 2005, Baltimore County, Maryland, police raided the Dundalk neighborhood home of Charles and Cheryl Noel at around 5 a.m. on a narcotics warrant. They\u2019d obtained the warrant after finding marijuana seeds and stems in the Noels\u2019 trash. They deployed a flashbang grenade, then quickly subdued the firstfloor occupants\u2014a man and two young adults. When officers entered the second-floor bedroom of Cheryl Lynn Noel, they broke open her door to find the middle-aged woman in her bed, frightened, pointing a handgun at them. One officer fired three times. Noel died at the scene.416 Friends and acquaintances described Noel as \u201ca wonderful person.\u201d One man collected 200 signatures from friends, neighbors, and coworkers vouching for her character.417 One possible reason Noel brandished a gun to defend herself: Nine years earlier, her stepdaughter had been murdered.418 Police charged Noel\u2019s husband and two children with misdemeanor possession of marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia.419 A subsequent investigation found no wrongdoing on the part of the police.420\n\n\u2022Rhiannon Kephart. In January 2005, 18-year-old Rhiannon Kephart was hospitalized in serious condition after she received severe burns during a pre-dawn paramilitary raid on a Niagara Falls apartment. Kephart\u2014who wasn\u2019t the target of the raid\u2014suffered second- and third-degree burns on her chest and stomach after the flashbang grenade tossed through a window by the raiding officers landed on the bed where she was sleeping. The grenade ignited the bed sheets, setting off a fire in the apartment.421\n\n\u2022James Hoskins. On February 6, 2004, Middletown, Pennsylvania, police stormed the home of James Hoskins on a drug warrant. They were looking for Hoskin\u2019s brother Jim, whom they eventually arrested for possessing \u201ca small amount of marijuana, a glass pipe, and about $622,\u201d according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. 422 When Hoskins heard the loud thud of police breaking into his home, he got up from his bed to investigate, naked and unarmed. As he approached the bedroom door, a Middletown detective pushed his way into Hoskins\u2019 bedroom. Hoskins and his girlfriend say the detective never identified himself. Later explaining that he mistook the T-shirt Hoskins was using to cover his genitalia for a gun, the detective fired. The bullet entered Hoskins\u2019 abdomen, then ripped through his stomach, small intestine, and colon. It eventually lodged in his leg, which later had to be amputated. It wasn\u2019t until weeks later, after he emerged from a coma, that Hoskins learned the man who shot him was a police officer, not a criminal intruder.423 Remarkably, the Middletown Township police department saw no need to conduct an internal investigation of the shooting until prodded by the district attorney.424 The district attorney\u2019s own investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the shooting officer. 425 Hoskins settled a lawsuit with the city of Middletown in 2005 for an undisclosed amount of money. He settled with the local township for $250,000.426\n\n\u2022 Desmond Ray.On December 11, 2002, police in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, were preparing for a SWAT raid on a suspected drug dealer. Just as the raid commenced, Desmond Ray\u2014who wasn\u2019t the target of the raid\u2014got out of a parked car. Cpl. Charles Ramseur says Ray reached for his waistband when exiting the car. Ray says he put his hands in the air. Ramseur fired his weapon at Ray, striking him in the spine and paralyzing him. Ray wasn\u2019t armed and was never charged with a crime. In April 2004, an \u201cExecutive Review Panel\u201d found that Ramseur had no justification for shooting Ray and recommended administrative charges against him for using excessive force. But that recommendation was overruled when the internal police review board later found no wrongdoing. Ramseur was reinstated. The county police settled a civil suit with Ray for an undisclosed sum of money.427\n\n\u2022 Meredith \u201cBuddy\u201d Sutherland. On October 4, 2002, police raided a home in Windsor, Pennsylvania, on suspicion of drug activity. According to news reports, the raid was doomed from the start\u2014the SWAT team was aware that someone inside the home had spotted them, meaning they\u2019d lost the element of surprise SWAT proponents say is the main reason for conducting paramilitary drug raids in the first place. Police raided anyway. Once inside, police went from room to room in the dark home. Trooper Gregory Broaddus entered a bedroom where Meredith \u201cBuddy\u201d Sutherland Jr. was sleeping. Sutherland didn\u2019t live in the house, but was visiting a friend. Officer Broaddus mistakenly thought Sutherland was clutching a weapon when he entered the room, and fired, striking Sutherland. Sutherland had no weapon and was never charged with a crime. Other occupants were eventually charged with drug crimes. Sutherland sued in June 2004 for compensation for his injuries. The state attorney general asked that the suit be dismissed, arguing that the officer in question had immunity and that Sutherland was ultimately responsible for his own injuries.428\n\n\u2022 Julius Powell. On August 22, 2001, police conducted a paramilitary marijuana raid on the Powell family in North Minneapolis, Minnesota. As they were approaching the house to conduct the raid, police shot and killed a pit bull a man was walking just outside the house. One of the bullets ricocheted and struck the forearm of 11-year-old Julius Powell, who at the time was taking out the family trash. Police did find some marijuana in the home. The incident\u2014the latest in a series of police shootings in the city\u2014 sparked riots and protests.429 \u2022 Tony Martinez. On December 20, 2001, police in Travis County, Texas, stormed a mobile home on a no-knock drug warrant. Nineteen-year-old Tony Martinez, nephew of the man named in the warrant, was asleep on the couch. When Martinez rose from the couch as police broke into the home, deputy Derek Hill shot him in the chest, killing him.430 Martinez was unarmed and never suspected of a crime. A grand jury later declined to indict Hill in the shooting.431 The shooting occurred less than a mile from the spot of a botched drug raid that cost Deputy Keith Ruiz his life a year earlier. Hill was also on the raid that ended with the death of Ruiz.432The same Travis County paramilitary unit would later erroneously raid a woman\u2019s home after mistaking ragweed for marijuana plants.\n\n\u2022 Lynette Gayle Jackson. On September 22, 2000, police in Riverdale, Georgia, shot and killed Lynette Gayle Jackson in an early morning, no-knock drug raid. A few weeks earlier, Jackson had been at home alone when burglars broke into her house. She escaped out a window and called the police while the intruders ransacked her home. When police arrived to answer the burglary call, they found a small amount of cocaine in the bedroom, which belonged to Jackson\u2019s boyfriend. While the quantity of cocaine wasn\u2019t sufficient to press charges, police began a subsequent investigation of Jackson\u2019s boyfriend. That investigation led to the September no-knock raid. Jackson, believing she was again being robbed, was holding a gun in her bedroom when the SWAT team entered. Her maintenance man said Jackson had been frightened by the previous burglary, telling the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, \u201cI think she was scared and she probably thought it was another break-in.\u201d433\n\n\u2022 Willie and Charles Alford.On February 27, 2002, police raided the home of 77- year-old Willie Alford on a narcotics warrant issued for his daughter and two grandchildren. Police from the federal Drug Enforcement Agency; the Cumberland County, North Carolina, Sheriff\u2019s Office; and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation broke into the home at 8 p.m. and, according to Alford, \u201ccame in shooting.\u201d Two children were also present in the home. Police shot Alford\u2019s son Charles, a truck driver visiting from out of town who wasn\u2019t a suspect, in the arm, legs, and side. Police found no weapons in the home. Two suspects named in the warrant were arrested at the site of the raid, and one was arrested the following day.434\n\n\u2022 Jose Colon. On April 19, 2002, police were preparing to conduct a heavily armed late-night drug raid (it included a helicopter) on a home in Bellport, New York. As four paramilitary unit officers rushed across the front lawn, 19-year-old Jose Colon emerged from the targeted house. According to the police account of the raid, as officers approached, one officer tripped over a tree root, then fell forward and into the lead officer, causing his gun to accidentally discharge three times.435 One of the three bullets hit Colon in the side of the head, killing him. Police say they screamed at Colon to \u201cget down\u201d as they approached, though two witnesses told a local newscast that (a) their screams were inaudible over the sound of the helicopter. The witnesses also stated that (b) the officers appeared to be frozen before the shooting\u2014no one tripped.436 Though he was visiting the house at the time, Colon was never suspected of buying or selling drugs. Police proceeded with the raid and seized eight ounces of marijuana. A subsequent investigation found no criminal wrongdoing on the part of police.437 Colon had no criminal record and was months away from becoming the first member of his family to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. His family is pursuing a lawsuit.438\n\n\u2022 Christie Green. In December 1998, police in Richmond, Virginia, conducted a paramilitary drug raid on an apartment whose occupant was suspected of drug activity. During the raid, Sgt. George Ingram fired \u201cbreaching round\u201d shotgun shells\u2014intended to blow the locks off doors\u2014into the door leading to the apartment\u2019s kitchen. Ingram fired five rounds, one of which went through the door, striking 18-year-old Christie Green in the chest. Green later died from the wound. Green didn\u2019t live at the apartment, and police concede they had no reason to believe she was involved in any drug activity or that she knew any was going on in the apartment. Green\u2019s family sued both the city of Richmond and the manufacturer of the round, which is designed to dissolve on impact. In 2002, a circuit court jury found that the manufacturer of the round wasn\u2019t liable for Green\u2019s death. Then, in 2004, a judge in Richmond found that the officer who fired the round wasn\u2019t liable either.439 In March 2005, the Virginia State Supreme Court reinstated the case against the city and the officer, ruling that a jury, not a judge, should make the determination of liability. In January 2006, a jury found Officer Ingram grossly negligent in the raid and awarded the Green family $1.5 million in damages.440\n\n\u2022 Delbert Bonar. On October 15, 1998, deputies in Washington County, Ohio, made an unannounced nighttime entry into the home of 57-year-old Delbert Bonar, a retired school janitor. Police had a search warrant to look for stolen weapons and marijuana in the possession of Albert Bonar, Delbert\u2019s son. Police claim that upon their entering the home, the elder Bonar grabbed a shotgun and ignored orders to release it. Albert Bonar\u2019s wife disputes this account of the raid. Police shot Delbert Bonar eight times, killing him. Police found a small amount of marijuana in the house. Though the Washington County sheriff insisted his men acted properly, the county paid the Bonar family a $450,000 settlement in 2003.441 The Threat to Law Enforcement Because SWAT raids escalate the violence associated with executing a search warrant, they not only increase the odds of unintended civilian casualties, but they can lead\u2014and have led\u2014to tragic consequences for police officers, too. The volatility of these raids means that the slightest of errors\u2014not just in ensuring that the information on the warrants is correct but in the actual execution of the raids\u2014can be catastrophic for everyone involved. The following is a partial list of raids in which police officers were killed or injured:\n\n\u2022 The Jillian King Raid. On January 14, 2003, Jillian D. King shot and wounded a Muncie, Indiana, police officer as a SWAT team in black masks and camouflage conducted a raid on her boyfriend\u2019s home. Officers were serving a no-knock warrant after finding cocaine inside the car of another resident of the house. King, who had been previously robbed at gunpoint, fired at what she thought were intruders.442 \u201cI saw what appeared to be a burglar jerking at the door,\u201d she told the court. \u201cI ran down and got a gun and shot out a window.\u201d King was never charged with drug possession but was charged with felony criminal recklessness. During her trial, King said if she had known the intruders were police, \u201cI would have opened the door.\u201d The prosecutor described her as having \u201can itchy trigger finger.\u201d Though individual Muncie SWAT team members testified they \u201calways\u201d announce themselves and wait before entering a residence, they also said they typically wait just five seconds between knocking and forcing entry, clearly not enough time for a suspect in another room or asleep to answer. Video of the raid in question showed officers prying open doors before knocking or announcing.443 King originally pled guilty to the charge, but a judge refused to accept her plea. The jury deadlocked in her trial.444\n\n\u2022 The Lewis Cauthorne Raid.On January 7, 2003, prosecutors in Baltimore, Maryland, announced they would not seek charges against Lewis S. Cauthorne for firing a .45-caliber handgun at police who broke down his door during a no-knock raid in November 2002. Cauthorne, at home with his mother, girlfriend, and three-year-old daughter, heard screaming when police broke open the door to his home and began searching for drugs without identifying themselves. Prosecutors determined that Cauthorne, who had no arrest record and whose father had been robbed and killed as a cab driver, had reason to believe his life was in danger when he fired and wounded four of the raiding police officers. Police fired back, but fortunately, no one in the family was hurt. Police were acting on a tip from a confidential informant and claim to have found six bags with traces of marijuana, empty vials, a razor with cocaine residue, and two scales in Cauthorne\u2019s home. But the ensuing investigation found peculiarities with the evidence that precluded Cauthorne from being charged with even a misdemeanor. There was no record of where exactly in the home the drugs had been found, for example, and police told crime lab technicians not to photograph the evidence. The officers who conducted the raid were also unavailable for interviews with investigators until days or weeks after the raid took place. Though never charged, Cauthorne served more than six weeks in jail before the charges against him were dismissed.445\n\n\u2022 Officer Ron Jones. On December 26, 2001, police in Prentiss, Mississippi, served search warrants on two apartments in a duplex. One apartment was occupied by Jamie Smith, named in the warrant as a \u201cknown drug dealer.\u201d The other was occupied by Cory Maye, who had no criminal record and wasn\u2019t named in the warrants. At the time of the raid, Maye was asleep with his 18- month-old daughter. After attempting to enter through the front door, police moved to the back and broke down the door to Maye\u2019s bedroom. Officer Ron Jones was the first police officer to enter. Maye, who says he feared for his life, fired three times, striking Jones once. Maye\u2019s bullet hit Jones in the abdomen, just below his bulletproof vest. Jones died a short time later. Police found only traces of marijuana in Maye\u2019s apartment, after first telling reporters they\u2019d found no drugs at all. Officer Jones was the only officer who conducted the investigation leading up to the raid and apparently kept no notes of his investigation. According to the district attorney and prosecutor in the Maye case, all evidence of the investigation leading to the raid on Maye\u2019s home \u201cdied with Officer Jones.\u201d446 In January 2004, Maye was convicted of capital murder for the death of Jones and sentenced to die by lethal injection.447\n\n\u2022 Deputy Keith Ruiz. On February 15, 2001, police raided the Del Valle, Texas, mobile home of Edwin Delamora, where he lived with his wife and two children. As two deputies beat down his door with a battering ram, Delamora fired, fearing he was under attack. One bullet from his gun struck and killed sheriff\u2019s deputy Keith Ruiz. Delamora had no previous criminal record and his defense attorney says the raid on his home was influenced by an anonymous informant who turned out to be the brother of two sheriff\u2019s deputies. Information about the informant\u2019s relationship with the police was suppressed at trial. Delamora was eventually convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life in prison. Police found less than an ounce of methamphetamine and one ounce of marijuana in his home. Prosecutors declined to seek the death penalty because of substantial doubt over whether Delamora knew the officers were police or whether he genuinely believed them to be intruders.448\n\n\u2022 Deputies James Moulson and Philip Anderson; George Timothy Williams. On January 3, 2001, Jerome County, Idaho, sheriff\u2019s deputies James Moulson and Phillip Anderson conducted a raid on the home of George Timothy Williams. The warrant for the raid contained information from a confidential informant asserting that Williams was one of the leading suppliers of marijuana in the county. Moulson and Anderson conducted the raid at night, wearing camouflage. It\u2019s unclear whether they announced themselves before entering. Williams fired when the deputies entered, and the deputies returned fire. All three died in the shootout. A subsequent search turned up less than four grams of marijuana. Lawsuits brought by the families of both slain deputies and by Williams\u2019s family revealed that the informant was a woman who lived with Williams. One suit alleges that the sheriff\u2019s department threatened to take away the woman\u2019s child if she didn\u2019t give them the information they needed to get the warrant. The county settled with the family of one deputy.449 A federal court dismissed the lawsuit brought by Williams\u2019s family. An Idaho state police investigation found no wrongdoing on the part of the sheriff\u2019s department or the deputies who conducted the raid.450\n\n\u2022Officer David Eales.On September 24, 1999, police in Sallisaw, Oklahoma, procured a no-knock warrant on the home of Eugene Barrett, suspected of trafficking methamphetamine. As the police vehicles descended upon his home, Barrett opened fire. One bullet struck and killed Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer David Eales. Barrett claims he was acting in self defense. After a state jury declined to give Barrett the death penalty, he was tried again in federal court, convicted, and sentenced to death.451\n\n\u2022 The Mary Lou Coonfield Raid. In August 1996, Tulsa police raided the home of 70-year-old Mary Lou Coonfield on a drug warrant. Coonfield awoke to find a man in black standing in her bedroom, holding a gun. She grabbed a .22- caliber pistol and fired, wounding Tulsa County Deputy Sheriff Newt Ellenbarger. The warrant for Coonfield was later thrown out, ruled in both 1996 and 1997 to be illegal. In 1999, a jury acquitted Coonfield of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and feloniously pointing a weapon. Coonfield was acquitted because of Oklahoma\u2019s \u201cMake My Day\u201d law, which states that \u201can occupant of a house is justified in using physical force, including deadly force, against another person who has unlawfully entered the house if the occupant reasonably believes that the other person might use any physical force, no matter how slight, against any occupant of the house.\u201d Coonfield, who\u2019s both hard of hearing and has poor eyesight, says she didn\u2019t hear police announce themselves before entering, and thought she was being robbed.452\n\n\u2022 Officer James Jensen. On March 13, 1996, the Oxnard, California, SWAT team conducted an early morning drug raid on a home that turned out to be unoccupied. In the maze of smoke and light that followed the deployment of a flashbang grenade, a fellow SWAT team member, who would later reveal that his judgment was clouded by Vicodin, mistook Officer James Jensen for a hostile occupant of the house and shot him dead. Jensen\u2019s family won a $3.5 million settlement from the city of Oxnard in 1999.453\n\n\u2022 The Andre Madison Raid.On November 7, 1995, police in North Minneapolis, Minnesota, raided the home of Andre Madison. After local media merely recounted the police version of events, Minneapolis City Pages conducted an indepth investigation. According to the paper\u2019s account, police obtained a noknock warrant on Madison\u2019s home after a confidential informant allegedly purchased some marijuana at the residence.454 At about 8 p.m., the Minneapolis paramilitary unit, called ERU, deployed flashbang grenades at the front of Madison\u2019s home. At the same time, police from the city\u2019s housing unit were entering the home from the rear. Reports at the time say police began firing when Madison fired his shotgun at them. But a forensics team later determined that Madison\u2019s gun was never fired the night of the raid. Instead, an investigation conducted by a police chief from a nearby county speculated that the housing unit officers mistook the flashbang grenades deployed by the ERU unit for gunfire from the suspect and opened fire themselves. The two police units then mistook one another for assailants and began to fire upon one another. When Officer Mark Lanasa went down, shot in the neck by a colleague, the commanding officer called for \u201csuppressive fire,\u201d giving officers carte blanche to shoot at will. Upon hearing that a fellow officer had gone down, more police soon arrived at the scene. They too joined in the shooting. Hundreds of rounds were fired into the building. There were bullet holes found in neighboring buildings, as well. Madison, the suspect, was shot in the neck and the arm. Miraculously, no one was killed.455 Police found only a small amount of marijuana in Madison\u2019s home. He was never charged with a drug crime. He was charged with four felony counts of second-degree assault with a firearm\u2014not for shooting, but for pointing his shotgun at police. He could have been sentenced to 12 years in prison. Madison insists he thought the police were intruders. Prosecutors then offered to let Madison plead to a misdemeanor count of reckless use of a firearm, which carries a sentence of just 90 days. The hitch was that a guilty plea to the lesser charge would have prevented Madison from suing the city. The subsequent investigation and report from the outside police chief concluded that Minneapolis\u2019s ERU unit \u201cexecutes too many warrants and relies too heavily on dynamic (door-ramming) raids,\u201d explaining that \u201cthere are other alternative tactics that ERU is aware of. However when so many raids are conducted using dynamic entry, other tactics may be forgotten.\u201d456 Confronting Nonviolent Offenders with Violent Tactics Drug war supporters and casual observers often find it difficult to criticize paramilitary raids ending in the death or injury of nonviolent drug users or dealers, noting that those people are, after all, breaking the law. If drugs are found at the scene, even raids ending in a suspect\u2019s death are somehow deemed less troubling than raids ending in the deaths of innocents. The case against the suspect and in favor of the decision to raid with a paramilitary unit seems to grow stronger if the suspect also possesses weapons, or worse, points them at or attempts to use them against the raiding police officers. Perhaps it\u2019s true that such scenarios shouldn\u2019t trouble us as much as raids on the homes of innocents. But they\u2019re still troubling, for two reasons. First, by some estimates, more than 96 million Americans have consumed marijuana at some point in their lives.457 The overwhelming majority of them have done so peacefully and at the expense of no one else. Legalizing marijuana is a debate for another time. But it would be absurd to suggest that the 96 million Americans who have tried or continue to smoke marijuana have effectively given up their Fourth Amendment rights. Smoking marijuana, or even selling it to someone else, isn\u2019t a violent crime and, consequently, doesn\u2019t merit a home invasion by police armed with the weaponry and mindset of soldiers. It certainly doesn\u2019t merit death. Yet a troublingly high number of these raids are aimed at marijuana offenders. Second, as discussed earlier, given the tactics associated with no-knock warrants, it isn\u2019t difficult to see why people might grab weapons to defend themselves and their families when police violently storm a home late at night or just before dawn. That a suspect pointed a weapon at police serving a noknock warrant doesn\u2019t prove that the suspect was violent or a threat to the public. It only proves that someone in the privacy of his own home was understandably threatened by the presence of armed intruders. The fact that police find weapons or marijuana at the scene of a raid, then, still doesn\u2019t mean paramilitary tactics and forced entry were justified. It\u2019s possible\u2014likely, even\u2014that millions of Americans are both harmless recreational marijuana users and legal gun owners. The presence of both doesn\u2019t make them a threat to the community. And the only legitimate use of paramilitary units like SWAT teams, indeed the reason they were originally implemented, is to deal with real, immediate, and obvious threats to the public safety. Perhaps the best example of how such violent tactics unleashed on nonviolent drug users invite tragedy is the case of Clayton Helriggle. Clayton Helriggle. Helriggle, 23, lived in a house with four roommates in West Alexandria, Ohio. In September 2002, a local SWAT team conducted a no-knock raid on the house. Local police had only recently put the SWAT team together\u2014the most experienced members of the team had less than four hours of tactical training. Others had never trained with the SWAT team before. A postraid report would later find that \u201cwrong dates were used in an affidavit, and investigators questioned why so little time was provided for surveillance of the house and why there were no controlled narcotic purchases from the house.\u201d458According to the Dayton Daily News, the search warrant was \u201clargely based on overheard conversations, a few hours of surveillance, and the word of a convicted felon who had recently lied to a court to remain free on bond.\u201d Informant Kevin Leitch insisted there were \u201cpounds and pounds\u201d of marijuana at the residence and specifically identified Helriggle as a dealer. Leitch later told investigators he was mistaken. Helriggle\u2019s family says he was a recreational marijuana smoker, though not a dealer.459 On September 27, 2002, 25\u201330 police officers emerged from nearby woods and swarmed the farmhouse. SWAT officers detonated several flashbang grenades on the first floor, then used a battering ram to force their way into the rented farmhouse. As police in shields and body armor subdued three of the house\u2019s occupants, Helriggle, asleep in an upstairs bedroom, was awakened by the commotion and descended the stairs. Police at the scene say he was carrying a handgun at the time. Helriggle\u2019s roommates insist that while Helriggle did own a licensed handgun, he\u2019d left it in the bedroom and was holding a blue cup of water. Whatever Helriggle was holding, his last words\u2014\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u2014indicate he wasn\u2019t aware that the armed intruders in his home were police. A SWAT team member interpreted the item in his hand to be a gun and put a single shotgun blast into Helriggle\u2019s chest. He died at the scene, in the arms of one of his roommates.460 Immediately after the raid, police told local reporters that they\u2019d found marijuana, pills, weapons, drug paraphernalia, and drug \u201cpackaging materials\u201d at the home. The pills proved to be a bottle of prescribed codeine. The weapons were Helriggle\u2019s legal handgun, an old shotgun, and a .22-caliber rifle, not particularly unusual for an Ohio farmhouse. The \u201cpackaging materials\u201d turned out to be a box of sandwich bags. And police found less than an ounce of marijuana. No charges were filed against any of the house\u2019s occupants.461 In addition to the tip from an unreliable informant, police raided the farmhouse on the basis of evidence they say they collected while conducting surveillance. As it turns out, that evidence too was questionable. Officer George Petitt, who both conducted the surveillance and planned the raid, told investigators he concluded the farmhouse was a \u201cdope house, just by the activity\u201d of cars pulling in and out of the driveway. But when pressed, he conceded that he had no firsthand knowledge of a single marijuana deal that took place at the farmhouse.462 The absurdity of using a highly armed, poorly trained SWAT team to carry out a violent, volatile raid on a house rented by recreational marijuana users was captured by Ian Albert, a resident of the farmhouse who also happened to have just completed Navy SEAL training. It was Albert who held Helriggle in his arms as he bled to death. According to the Dayton Daily News Albert\u2019s first thought at the time was \u201cWow, they took down a farm of unarmed hippies.\u201d \u201cIf they would have come to the door and said, \u2018Give us your dope, hippies,\u2019\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019d have gotten about a $100 ticket.\u201d463 A grand jury and internal investigation later found no criminal wrongdoing on the part of police officers but did find the SWAT team \u201cill prepared\u201d and \u201clack[ing] experience in dangerous searches.\u201d464 The grand jury report also noted that the officers who conducted the raid had refused to cooperate with investigators.465 In January 2004, Greene County, Ohio, prosecutor Bill Schenk suggested the possibility of reopening the Helriggle case, saying that he was concerned that Helriggle had been publicly portrayed as a drug dealer. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that there was no drug dealing by Mr. Helriggle,\u201d he told the Dayton Daily News. 466 Despite the fact that he was at the time awaiting sentencing for more than a dozen crimes, including forgery, theft, burglary, breaking and entering, and safecracking, informant Kevin Leitch was never charged for lying to police officers, nor was he charged for lying under oath to the grand jury investigating the raid.467 These kinds of cases are increasingly common. It\u2019s now routine for police to deploy SWAT teams to serve search warrants on nonviolent marijuana suspects for crimes that in many cases barely qualify as misdemeanors. These unnecessari-ly violent and confrontational tactics are, also, increasingly bearing tragic results. Some examples:\n\n\u2022 Leesburg, Virginia. In January 2006, police in Leesburg used flashbang grenades while raiding the home of a marijuana suspect. Police obtained the warrant after sifting through trash bags outside the house. They found one small bag of marijuana.468\n\n\u2022 Decatur, Alabama. In October 2005, police in Decatur raided a family home on a marijuana warrant. Police shot and killed two of the family\u2019s dogs and, according to the targets of the raid, made jokes about the dead pets while the suspects were in custody. Police seized eight grams of marijuana, or about enough to fill a ketchup packet.469\n\n\u2022 Shannon Hills, Arkansas. In February 2005, police in Shannon Hills stormed a home with their guns drawn during a toddler\u2019s birthday party. The target was a pregnant woman attending the party. Police arrested her on suspicion of distributing marijuana. Police Chief Richard Friend told one reporter, referencing the birthday, \u201cWe got them something they wish they could return.\u201d470\n\n\u2022 Angela King. On May 17, 2004, Perry County, Kentucky, police raided the home of Dennis Ray and Angela King on suspicion of marijuana distribution. Deputy Sheriff John Couch shot Angela King twice, once in the head, in the course of the raid. Police say King fired a weapon at them first, though the couple\u2019s 14-year-old-son\u2014also in the home at the time of the raid and who was subdued with a policeman\u2019s foot on his shoulder\u2014says he heard only two shots. The police were cleared of all wrongdoing in the shooting. Dennis Ray was arrested on charges of distributing marijuana.471\n\n\u2022 Linda Florek.On December 7, 2004, at 10 p.m., police in Mundelein, Illinois, broke down the door to the home of 48- year-old Linda Florek. They then ordered Florek and her son to the floor and handcuffed them. Shortly into the raid, Florek\u2014who has a cardiac condition\u2014told police she was having chest pains, possibly a heart attack. According to a lawsuit later filed by Florek, police refused to let her take an aspirin or to call an ambulance. Ninety minutes later, the officers finally believed her and called an ambulance. Florek was eventually admitted to a hospital, where doctors determined she\u2019d had a heart attack and needed immediate surgery. Police issued Florek a ticket and fine for the misdemeanor possession of less than 2.5 grams of marijuana.472\n\n\u2022 Shay Neace. On March 22, 2003, police in SWAT attire raided a home in Canton, Ohio, on a marijuana warrant, looking for a man with a history of marijuana distribution. There was a party at the home that night. As the raid commenced, Officer William Watson of the Perry Township Police Department made his way to the home\u2019s second floor, and pulled open the door to a bathroom. Inside, 24-year-old Shay Neace and his brother Seth were smoking marijuana. Watson pushed a gun through the door and ordered everyone in the bathroom to the floor. Neace and his brother say Watson never announced himself. They thought they were being robbed. Shay Neace grabbed Watson\u2019s gun and pushed it away. He then pushed the gunman\u2014 Watson\u2014out into the hall. At that point, Watson fired, hitting Neace in the shoulder and in the back. The second shot left Neace paralyzed. Officer Watson was cleared of all charges by a grand jury. Neace was indicted by a separate grand jury, then acquitted in a criminal trial of obstructing an investigation and resisting arrest. Neace\u2019s civil suit against Watson is still pending.473\n\n\u2022 Robert Filgo. On September 2, 2003, police in Fremont, California, forced open the door of 41-year-old marijuana patient Robert Filgo, who had both a doctor\u2019s prescription and a certificate from the city of Oakland permitting him to possess the drug. Police entered, forced Filgo to the floor at gunpoint, then shot his pet Akita nine times, killing it. The Alameda County District Attorney\u2019s Office later declined to press charges against Filgo.474\n\n\u2022 Marcella Monroe and Tam Davage.In October 2002, police in Eugene, Oregon, assembled a massive show of force\u201452 police officers from four agencies in full SWAT attire, assault weapons, shotguns, and an armored vehicle borrowed from the Oregon National Guard\u2014to conduct a raid on three homes in the Whitaker neighborhood they suspected of growing marijuana. All three homes were owned by one couple, Marcella Monroe and Tam Davage. Davage and Monroe lived in one of the homes, with two tenants. They were renovating the other two houses, which had been destroyed in a windstorm. Police officers were aware that there were likely to be only three or four people at most in the three homes, despite the force of 52 officers they brought for the raid.475 The massive SWAT team was dressed in black or in camouflage and wore ski masks. They deployed flashbang grenades, then forced entry into the home occupied by Davage, Monroe, and their tenants without announcing themselves. They pulled the two couples out of bed and wrestled them to the ground. They put assault weapons to residents\u2019 heads, tightly handcuffed them, and refused to let the two women, who were partially nude, cover themselves (they also took photos of the women before allowing them to dress).476 When Monroe asked if she could put on some clothing, one officer put a black bag over her head and tightened it around her neck. Because police at that point had still failed to identify themselves, Monroe says she believed she was about to be executed (as for the black bag tactic, the Eugene Police Department had been warned to discontinue the practice by the National Tactical Officers Association, who cautioned that \u201cthis practice is not acceptable in the law enforcement community,\u201d that it \u201chas no lawful purpose,\u201d and though it is commonly used in military operations, \u201cit has no place in civilian operations\u201d).477 Monroe also sustained a cut on her head after one officer pushed her to the ground and put a boot on the back of her neck.478 Police found no plants, no weapons, and only \u201cresidue\u201d of marijuana in a couple of plastic bags, for which the couple\u2019s tenant was issued a misdemeanor citation. Neither Monroe nor Davage had a criminal record, and none of the occupants had any history of violent crime.479 Nevertheless, police still charged Davage and Monroe with felony manufacture of a controlled substance. They cited the evidence they\u2019d found: fans, fluorescent lights, plastic sheeting, timers, potting equipment, sandwich bags, a scale, 24 electrical outlets, and a shop vacuum. Of course, none of those items is illegal, and in the case of Davage and Monroe, all were perfectly sensible to have around: Davage was a work-athome jeweler, explaining the lights and the outlets. Monroe owned a landscaping business, explaining the potting supplies and vacuum. Of course, as noted, the two were also renovating all three houses, as police could have easily ascertained, both during the raid and during the undercover visit one officer paid to the couple (posing as a potential tenant) before securing a warrant for the raid.480 Monroe had come to the attention of police when they\u2019d busted a marijuana growing operation in Portland, where they found cashier\u2019s checks made payable to her. What the officer failed to mention in the affidavit, however, was that the checks were clearly identified as payment for landscaping services and were made in the name of Monroe\u2019s business. The most recent check was dated 1997, five years before the raid.481 In a subsequent lawsuit, Monroe and Davage outlined a host of other misleading assertions and questionable omissions in the affidavit that led to the raid on their home. The officer, for example, cites unusually the high use of electricity, the presence of potting soil, an electrical cord, and a \u201chumming noise,\u201d as grounds to suspect cultivation of marijuana. The affidavit never mentioned Monroe\u2019s landscaping business, Davage\u2019s jewelry business, or the fact that the couple was repairing their home from storm damage, though the officer was aware of all three. The affidavit also makes no mention of the possibility of weapons, disposability of evidence, or violent tendencies of any of the home\u2019s occupants, all of which would have been required to justify a no-knock raid.482 Police defended the raid as entirely necessary and appropriate, given the well-known danger posed by people who grow marijuana. The spokesman for one of the task forces involved in the raid added that \u201cthe community at large\u201d approved of such tactics. The Whitaker Community Council later condemned the raid at a public neighborhood meeting, as well as in a press release.483\n\n\u2022 Jeffery Robinson. On July 30, 2002, police stormed the home of Jeffery Robinson, a 41-year-old gravedigger in South Memphis, Tennessee. Robinson lived in a small building on the site of the cemetery that employed him. Police conducted the raid on the basis of an anonymous tip that someone was selling marijuana on the cemetery grounds. Raiding officers kicked in Robinson\u2019s bedroom door and immediately shot Robinson in the neck. Robinson died three weeks later. Police say Robinson charged them with a box cutter. They also found a small amount of marijuana near a camper in Robinson\u2019s backyard and charged him with possession, even as he lay in a hospital fighting for his life. A review by the Memphis police department\u2019s internal affairs unit and the Attorney General\u2019s Office found no wrongdoing on the part of the police. For two and a half years, the officers who participated in that raid remained on the Memphis police force. But in October of 2004, the jury in a federal civil suit brought by Robinson\u2019s family made some striking findings: The jury concluded that the box cutter police say Robinson charged them with\u2014which was never fingerprinted\u2014 was planted on Robinson after the raid. During the trial, a medical examiner and blood spatter expert also testified that the shooting couldn\u2019t possibly have happened the way the officers say it did. Further, the shirt Robinson wore, as well as the shirt of the officer who shot him, vanished after the raid. Trial testimony revealed that police bought a new polo shirt, still in its wrapper, and tagged it as the shirt Robinson wore the night he was shot. The federal jury concluded that the officers shot Robinson without justification, then tampered with the evidence to cover up their mistakes. The jury also cast doubt on the ensuing investigation by the police department\u2019s internal affairs division.484 In February 2005, the eight officers involved in the raid were finally suspended, more than two years after the raid.485 Robinson\u2019s family won a $2.85 million verdict against the officers and negotiated a $1 million settlement from the city of Memphis.486\n\n\u2022 Vernard Davis.In January 2001, police in Rochester, New York, conducted a late-night drug raid at the home of Vernard Davis. During the raid, Officer David Gebhardt\u2019s shotgun accidentally discharged as he stumbled through a dark room. The blast hit Davis in the chest, killing him. Davis left behind two toddlers and one six-year-old. Police did find a significant amount of drugs in the room, but no weapons. In 2004, the city of Rochester awarded Davis\u2019s children a $300,000 settlement. The presiding judge called the shooting \u201ca tragic, unintended accident.\u201d487\n\n\u2022 Jacqueline Paasch. In early 2000, a SWAT team from the Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, sheriff\u2019s department broke into the home of Jacqueline Paasch and her two brothers on a no-knock drug warrant for suspicion of marijuana possession. Paasch says she heard footsteps rumbling up the stairs, but before she could figure out what was happening, her door was kicked in, a gun went off, and she was on the floor, bleeding. Paasch was hit in the leg, incurred $19,000 in medical expenses, endured a year of rehabilitation, and was told she\u2019ll always walk with a limp. Police found a \u201cvery small amount of marijuana and a pipe\u201d in the house, according to local news reports, though not enough to press charges against anyone in the house. In 2000, Paasch settled with the Village of West Milwaukee for $700,000. \u201cThe fact that this can happen to me and my family has made me realize that it can happen to anyone,\u201d Paasch told one media outlet. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really frightening because the police are the ones you\u2019re supposed to count on to protect you.\u201d488\n\n\u2022 Troy Davis. On December 15, 1999, police in North Richland Hills, Texas, raided the home of Troy Davis, the son of a well-known \u201ctrue crime\u201d writer. The raid was based on the word of a single, anonymous informant that Davis was growing marijuana in one of the house\u2019s closets. That informant turned out to be Davis\u2019s uncle, who had tipped off police after a long-running dispute with Davis\u2019s mother. A local municipal judge had originally denied Sgt. Andy Wallace\u2019s initial attempt to obtain the no-knock warrant, citing insufficient evidence. So Wallace merely went to a second judge in Fort Worth and got his approval. On the night of the raid one team pried open (with some difficulty) Davis\u2019s back door, while another team went around to the front. According to police, Davis came to investigate the noises outside his home while carrying a gun (his family denies he was holding a weapon). Upon seeing the gun, raiding officers shot Davis in the chest, killing him. According to officers at the scene, Davis\u2019s last words were, \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Though police did find three marijuana plants, GHB, and a few small bags of marijuana in Davis\u2019s home, ensuing investigations revealed significant problems in the way Richland Hills police executed the search warrant. In fact, further investigation found flaws in the way the same police department conducted nearly all of its drug raids. First, attorneys for the Davis family found that the police department had a policy of conducting no-knock raids for every narcotics search warrant issued, a clear violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Richards. Second, according to the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram, \u201cA year before the [Davis raid], two of the team\u2019s members told superiors they were concerned that lax standards for the unit could leave it vulnerable to lawsuits.\u201d Team leader Joe Walley later told a court that he was \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d about the Davis raid and that he felt the team was \u201cdoing a tactical operation without anything to go on.\u201d Another officer came back from sniper school and told superiors that nearly everything the North Richland Hills SWAT team was doing was wrong. Yet another later said in a deposition of the Davis raid, \u201cWe should never have been there.\u201d According to court records reviewed by the StarTelegram, Sergeant Wallace did little corroborating investigation after getting the tip from Davis\u2019s uncle. There were no controlled buys or surveillance.489 After the Davis raid, the two officers who had warned superiors about inadequacies with the SWAT team were suspended. Another officer who told the media and the Davis family attorneys about his concerns quit five months after the raid, citing harassment by superiors. Two other officers who were forthcoming with criticism of the police department also quit.490 In 2004, a state appeals court ruled the warrant for the raid that killed Davis was invalid. The court found that the warrant failed to show that the informant for the raid was reliable, and that Sgt. Wallace failed to do any independent investigation to corroborate the informant\u2019s tips.491 Even after the raid and ensuing revelations about poor training and preparation, North Richland Hills officials couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t say what changes police had implemented to be sure a similar mistake wouldn\u2019t occur again. The Forth Worth Star-Telegram reported that in 2005, during depositions for the civil suit brought by Davis\u2019s family, responses from city officials indicated that raid procedures were never examined after the raid. Attorney Mark Haney, representing the Davis family, expressed frustration that no one from the city would claim responsibility for overseeing police procedures. \u201cIs there anybody? . . . Who is it? Who can talk about this topic?\u201d he asked of North Richland Hills city attorney Greg Staples. Staples replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not my problem. That\u2019s your problem.\u201d492 The mayor of North Richland Hills testified that neither he nor the city council were responsible for oversight of the city\u2019s police department. The city manager testified that he oversaw hiring and firing but that police procedures were determined by the police chief. The police chief said he answered to the city manager. When Haney asked the city manger if he had ordered any investigation into the death of Davis, he replied, \u201cNo I did not.\u201d When asked if he had knowledge of any subsequent city investigation, he answered, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any.\u201d493\n\n\u2022Linda Elsea.Elsea smoked marijuana to treat her fibromylagia after the successful campaign for Initiative 692, a Washington State measure authorizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes. In 1999, she came out of the bathroom to find a team of SWAT soldiers armed with assault weapons barreling up her driveway. She was handcuffed, subject to a body cavity search, and taken to the police station.494\n\n\u2022 Rusty Windle.In early 1999 in Wimberly, Texas, a paid police informant and former felon befriended electrician\u2019s assistant Alexander \u201cRusty\u201d Windle after meeting him at a bar frequented by tradesmen. The informant had been working the area for more than four months, winning friends by throwing parties stocked with beer and food. The informant convinced Windle to get him two half-ounce bags of marijuana, the Texas minimum for a felony charge. When Windle delivered, police obtained an arrest warrant. One witness said of the informant, \u201cHe asked everybody to get him pot, he practically begged you for it.\u201d495 On May 17, 1999, nine police officers conducted a pre-dawn raid on Windle\u2019s home. Officer accounts differ on whether or not they announced they were police, though the other targets of raids that night (based on information gathered from the same informant) say police never announced themselves before executing the warrants. The police who raided Windle\u2019s home were dressed entirely in black. Windle awoke, and came to the door with a gun. Police say that when they heard the slide action of a rifle bolt, Officer Chase Strapp backed away from the door. As he did, he tripped over a potted plant. Seeing armed men in black approaching his house, and watching one retreat from his porch, Windle pointed his weapon at Strapp. Strapp fired four rounds, hitting Windle three times, killing him. Police found less than an ounce of marijuana in Windle\u2019s home.496\n\n\u2022Lisa Swartz and the Medical Marijuana Raids.In August 2004, 38 medical marijuana patients filed simultaneous lawsuits against state law enforcement agencies in California for seizing marijuana from their homes in violation of state law. One of them was Lisa Swartz, who described a raid on her home to the online publication AlterNet: During the conference call, she told of being raided at gunpoint in 1999. \u201cThey came with a narc SWAT team, pointing semi-automatic weapons at my grandkids\u2019 heads,\u201d she said before breaking into tears. \u201cIt was a terrible experience and totally changed my view of everything. I used to believe the police were there to protect and defend us. It is just so bizarre that they do this to people,\u201d said Swartz. \u201cEven if we get our property back, this still takes a terrible toll on our families.\u201d Swartz spent 18 months and $50,000 on her defense before authorities dropped the charges. \u201cThey never apologized and they never gave me my medicine back,\u201d she said.497\n\n\u2022 Willie Heard. On February 13, 1999, police in Osawatomie, Kansas, conducted a 1:30 a.m. raid on the home of 46- year-old Willie Heard. Police say they announced themselves, though Heard\u2019s daughter, who was home at the time, told the Topeka Capital-Journal, \u201c[A]ll I heard them say was \u2018Get Down! Freeze!\u2019\u201d Heard awoke, and met officers in his bedroom with a .22-caliber rifle. Seeing the gun, a raiding officer opened fire and shot Heard dead. Though the search warrant was for crack cocaine and related paraphernalia, police found only the burnt remnants of an herb that couldn\u2019t be tested. If it had been marijuana, it would have barely been enough for two cigarettes.498 Prosecutors declined to press charges against the police who conducted the raid.499 In 2001, Heard\u2019s family won a $3.5 million settlement from Miami County and the cities of Osawatomie and Paola. The lawsuit contended that police had targeted the wrong home. At least one member of the SWAT team later apologized to Heard\u2019s family for their mistakes.500\n\n\u2022 David Doran.In August 1998, police in Kansas City, Missouri, conducted a noknock raid on the home of David Doran on suspicion that he was dealing methamphetamine. Doran says he was asleep when police entered and that because he thought he was being robbed, he came out of his bedroom holding a gun. Police say Doran didn\u2019t comply with orders to get down. Doran says he tried to surrender. Raiding officers shot Doran, inflicting injuries that required a two-week hospital stay and the loss of his only functioning kidney. A jury subsequently awarded Doran $2 million, but in June 2005 the Eighth Circuit Federal Appeals Court overturned the award, concluding that police were justified in conducting a no-knock raid on Doran\u2019s home. Police found no methamphetamine, nor did they find any evidence that Doran had ever operated a methamphetamine lab. They did find a small amount of marijuana.501\n\n\u2022 Michael Swimmer. In the summer of 1998, police in Orange County, Florida, shot and killed 27-year-old Michael Swimmer in a 2:30 a.m. drug raid. Police shot Swimmer six times after he confronted the raiding SWAT team with a handgun. Police conducted the raid after a tip from a confidential informant that Swimmer, an amateur bodybuilder, was selling ecstasy.502\n\n\u2022 Chinue Tao Hashim. On February 21, 1998, a deputy in Greenville County, South Carolina, shot and killed unarmed drug suspect Chinue Tao Hashim during a SWAT raid. While negotiating a drug deal with Hashim, one undercover officer said over the radio that \u201ca gun is on the table,\u201d meaning that a gun was part of the bargain. When the SWAT team raided, Master Deputy John Eldridge interpreted the radio remark about the gun to mean that Hashim was armed. As the raid commenced, Eldridge thought he saw Hashim reaching for a gun and opened fire. A subsequent investigation revealed that what Eldridge thought was a gun was actually the glint from a wristwatch.503 Prosecutors declined to press charges against Eldridge.504\n\n\u2022 Barry Hodge. On August 4, 1997, police in Selmer, Tennessee, broke down the door to the home of Barry and Sheila Hodge on a no-knock drug raid. According to a $25 million lawsuit filed by Hodge\u2019s widow in 1998, police never announced themselves before entering. By the time the raid was over police had shot Barry Hodge in the arm and chest, killing him. Sheila Hodge claims she was thrown to the floor and handcuffed, and the Hodge\u2019s daughter was locked in her bedroom. Press accounts don\u2019t say if police found marijuana in the home.505\n\n\u2022 Richard Paey. In March 1997, police in Pasco County, Florida, arrested Richard Paey on charges of prescription fraud. Paey, a multiple sclerosis patient suffering from the effects of a car accident and subsequent botched back surgery, is wheelchair-bound and paraplegic. His various ailments required him to take significant quantities of painkillers to lead a normal life. Unfortunately, Florida law made it difficult for him to get the medication he needed. Prosecutors accused Paey of forging prescriptions, though they conceded that there\u2019s no evidence he was selling or distributing. Despite Paey\u2019s condition, and the fact that he obviously posed no threat to anyone, prosecutors sent a SWAT team to arrest him. Officers in ski masks and body armor, armed with assault weapons, broke down the door to Paey\u2019s home, needlessly terrorizing him, his wife, and their children.506\n\n\u2022 Doug Carpenter and Carlos LeBron. On January 11, 1996, a SWAT team in Maitland, Florida, used a 60-pound steel ram to break down the door to the apartment of Doug Carpenter and his roommate, Carlos LeBron. Police conducted the raid after a member of Maitland\u2019s police \u201cNew Resident Visitation Team\u201d came to their apartment shortly after the two had moved in and noticed \u201ca strong odor of what he believed to be cannabis.\u201d The two men were handcuffed at gunpoint for three hours while police searched their apartment. The search turned up 3.5 grams of marijuana, and earned each a $150 fine. Police didn\u2019t suspect either man of dealing marijuana, nor were there any complaints from neighbors. Maitland police chief Ed Doyle said the warrant was executed because the two men were new to the area and were renters, which together present \u201ca potential problem to be nipped in the bud.\u201d Doyle added that the raid wasn\u2019t \u201cone we\u2019re going to put on the mantle.\u201d507 Other Incidents of Paramilitary Excess Finally, there are several examples from the past decade in which SWAT teams and paramilitary tactics have been used unnecessarily and recklessly, but that defy easy categorization. Here are a few of those incidents:\n\n\u2022 The Utah Rave Raid. In August 2005, more than 90 police officers from sever-al state and local SWAT teams raided a peaceful outdoor dance party in Utah attended by 1,500 people. Police were armed with assault weapons, full-SWAT attire, police dogs, and tear gas. Many in attendance say police beat, abused, and swore at partygoers. Police deny the allegations, though amateur video audio clearly captures police issuing orders laced with profanity. Police also arrested security guards on drug possession charges, though the guards possessed the drugs because they\u2019d confiscated them from partygoers.508\n\n\u2022 The Easton, Pennsylvania, SWAT Team. The small town of Easton, Pennsylvania, chose to disband its SWAT team in 2005 after a series of incidents, including the shooting death of one SWAT team member. An editorial in the Allentown Morning Call praised the decision, noting that the SWAT team had become \u201crude, arrogant, and disrespectful,\u201d and had \u201clost the confidence of the civilians who supervise them and sign their paychecks.\u201d509\n\n\u2022 The Ahwatukee Raid.In 2004, police in Ahwatukee, Arizona, conducted a massively armed, thoroughly bumbling raid on a home they suspected contained illegal assault weapons and ammunition. In a densely populated, upscale neighborhood, a SWAT team from the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Department, complete with an armored personnel carrier, used grenade launchers to fire at least four rounds of tear gas into the windows of the home. The home then caught fire. As the owners of the home evacuated, police officers actually chased the family\u2019s dog back into the burning house with a fire extinguisher, where it perished in the flames. Andrea Baker, the dog\u2019s owner, says police laughed as she cried at their cruelty. Later, the brakes would fail on the SWAT team\u2019s armored personnel carrier, causing it to lurch down the street and smash into a parked car. The car was owned by Julie Madrigal, who had fled the car just moments earlier with her nine-year-old daughter after the two grew frightened at the sight of the SWAT team as it fired canisters of tear gas. The fire completely destroyed the home, putting homes nearby in the dense neighborhood at risk, too. For all of this, police found no assault weapons. They found only an antique shotgun and a 9-millimeter pistol, both of which were legally owned. They still arrested 26-yearold Erik Kush, on outstanding traffic violations.510 CBS News reported in 1997 that the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s SWAT team was doing an average of one callout per week. In an on-camera interview, one member of the team told reporter Jim Stewart the best part of being on the SWAT team was that, \u201cyou get to play with a lot of guns. That\u2019s what\u2019s fun. You know, everybody on this teams is\u2014 you know, loves guns.\u201d Another added, \u201cHey, the bottom line is it\u2019s friggin\u2019 fun, man. That\u2019s the deal. Nobody wants to take burglary reports.\u201d511\n\n\u2022 The Racine Rave Raid. In 2002, police in Racine, Wisconsin, conducted an early-morning raid on a rave dance party, kicking in doors, dragging young people from bathroom stalls, throwing others to the floor, and holding them all at gunpoint. Police issued more than 450 citations to partygoers for merely attending a party where some drugs were present, but made only 3 arrests. The city of Racine later dismissed nearly all of the charges but still faces a civil lawsuit from attendees who claim police violated their civil rights.512\n\n\u2022 The Farmerville Raids. In 2002, 40 police offices from more than 10 different agencies conducted a pre-dawn raid on a suspected drug hub in Farmerville, Louisiana, in what one local sheriff called \u201ca dream come true.\u201d The raid did yield ten arrests, but the violent tactics enraged the local community. Around 100 people marched through the small town the next day to protest the operation, in which police forced entry into several homes. \u201cThey could have arrested them any time and any day,\u201d protest organizer Sheila Lewis told the Associated Press. \u201cThey are not violent, they are just normal people. . . . It was like a war zone. People were scared to death.\u201d513\n\n\u2022 The Colorado\u2013Colorado State Football Game.In 1999, a SWAT team took the field when rowdy fans attempted to bring down the goalposts\u2014a tradition in college football\u2014after a Colorado State\u2013 Colorado football game. Armed with weapons and mace, police roughed up dozens of fans for 30 minutes after the game, including Colorado State student Britney Michalski, who nearly died after an allergic reaction to the mace. When one of Michalski\u2019s friends attempted to get aid for her from one of the police, she too was maced.514\n\n\u2022 \u201cOperation Jump Start.\u201d In 1997, a multitude of police officers from three separate SWAT teams conducted a massive raid on multiple low-income neighborhoods in New Britain, Connecticut. The New Haven Advocatereported: They wore navy blue camouflage fatigues over their body armor. Kevlar helmets covered their heads; black masks covered all but the noses and eyes of their faces. A state trooper flew above the scene in a small Cessna aircraft, keeping in radio contact with commanders on the ground. The state troops swept onto city streets inside \u201cPeacekeepers,\u201d trucks with battering rams in the front.515 \u201cOperation Jump Start\u201d netted 49 arrests.516\n\n\u2022 Ramon Gallardo.In 1997, a SWAT team from Dinuba, California, a town with just 12 regular police officers and 15,000 people and which hadn\u2019t a single reported homicide in its history, shot and killed 64- year-old farm worker Ramon Gallardo.517 Officers in black masks broke down Gallardo\u2019s bedroom door while he and his wife were sleeping. Carmen Gallardo told the Los Angeles Timesshe thought the police \u201cwere robbers\u201d when they entered. According to police, Gallardo reached for a folding knife to defend himself, though his family says Gallardo didn\u2019t own the knife. Gallardo was shot 12 times. Gallardo had no criminal history. Police were looking for a stolen gun they say was in the possession of Gallardo\u2019s son. The gun was never found. A subsequent investigation by the Tulare County district attorney found no improper behavior on the part of police. A federal jury later ordered the town of Dinuba to pay the Gallardo family $12.5 million in compensation. Dinuba later dissolved its SWAT team.518\n\n\u2022 The Heflin Family. In 1996, a SWAT team in La Plata County, Colorado, descended on a ranch owned by Samuel Heflin. They were looking for evidence related to a bar brawl\u2014a cowboy hat, shirt, and a pack of cigarettes. On the way in to Heflin\u2019s home, police forced two children to the ground at gunpoint. They then trained a laser-sighted assault weapon on Heflin\u2019s four-year-old daughter as she ran screaming into the house. Upon asking to see a search warrant, Heflin was told by SWAT officers to \u201cshut the fuck up.\u201d519\n\n\u2022 The Fitchburg SWAT Incidents. In 1996, the Fitchburg, Massachusetts, SWAT team burned down an apartment complex after deploying flashbang grenades in a no-knock raid. The fire left six police officers injured and 24 people homeless.520 In an article on the raid and fire, the Boston Globe noted the that the Fitchberg SWAT team was formed in 1990 with the charge, \u201cTo establish an organized response to unusual high-risk situations, barricaded suspects, hostage situations, and other similar life-threatening events where citizen safety or officer safety is at risk.\u201d521 But the 1996 raid wasn\u2019t the first time the unit had come under criticism. The team had a history of botched raids and faced at least one suit for violating the civil rights of a group of loiterers the SWAT team was called to break up.522Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

baby\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, darlin'\n\n[Verse 1]\nRiding high when I was king\nI played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything\nI walked away, you won me then\nBut easy come and easy go and it would end\n[Verse 2]\nSo, anytime I bleed, you let me go\nYah, anytime I feed, you get me know\nAnytime I seek, you let me know\nBut I planted that seed, just let me grow\nI'm on my knees when I'm beggin'\n'Cause I don't wanna lose you\nHey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you\nUh, put your loving hand out, baby\nI'm beggin', beggin' you, ah\nAnd put your loving hand out, darlin'\n\n[Verse 3]\nI need you to understand\nTried so hard to be your man\nThe kind of man you want in the end\nOnly then can I begin to live again\n\n[Verse 4]\nAn empty shell, I used to be\nThe shadow of my life was hangin' over me\nA broken man that I don't know\nWon't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul\nSee M\u00e5neskin LiveGet tickets as low as $30You might also like[Verse 5]\nWhat we doin'? What we chasin'?\nWhy the bottom? Why the basement?\nWhy we got good shit, don't embrace it?\nWhy the feel for the need to replace me?\nYou're the wrong way track from the good\nI want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at\nLike a heart in the best way should\nYou can give it away, you had it and you took the pay\nBut I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors\nKeep hopin' for, now the door is yours\nKeep also home\n'Cause I don't want to live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'\n\n[Chorus]\nMmm, yeah-yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, baby\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, darlin'\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm fighting hard to hold my own\nJust can't make it all alone\nI'm holding on, I can't fall back\nI'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black\n[Chorus]\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nPut your loving hand out, baby\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, darlin'\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, baby\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, darlin'\n\n[Outro]\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, baby\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out43Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/5104758", "artist_names": "Maxenn", "full_title": "Maxenn's Transcriptions by\u00a0Maxenn", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c996f81ab41d0152d3661d43bd19deb3.250x250x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c996f81ab41d0152d3661d43bd19deb3.250x250x1.jpg", "id": 5104758, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 5748418, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1658248020, "path": "/Maxenn-maxenns-transcriptions-annotated", "pyongs_count": 12, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Maxenn-maxenns-transcriptions-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c996f81ab41d0152d3661d43bd19deb3.250x250x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c996f81ab41d0152d3661d43bd19deb3.250x250x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Maxenn\u2019s Transcriptions", "title_with_featured": "Maxenn's Transcriptions", "updated_by_human_at": 1658248020, "url": "https://genius.com/Maxenn-maxenns-transcriptions-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/2047990", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/68d34f870d65ac3add5d3533bc2512f5.1000x192x1.png", "id": 2047990, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/694a311ef8332e87c9f4c2358ec92d36.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Maxenn", "slug": "Maxenn", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Maxenn", "iq": 446077}, "artist": "Maxenn", "lyrics": "Maxenn\u2019s Transcriptions LyricsMost Popular Scribes\n2,500,000+ views (6)\n\u2022 \"GOOBA\" - 6ix9ine | 4 million+\n\u2022 \"The Box\" - Roddy\u2005Ricch\u2005| 3,3 million+\n\u2022\u2005\"As It Was\" - Harry Styles\u2005| 3,3 million+\n\u2022 \"deja vu\" - Olivia Rodrigo | 2,6 million+\n\u2022 \"cardigan\" - Taylor Swift | 2,6 million+\n\u2022 \"good 4 u\" - Olivia Rodrigo | 2,5 million+\n2,500,000 - 1,000,000 views (22)\n\u2022 \"MONTERO (CMBYN)\" - Lil Nas X | 2,4 million+\n\u2022 \"Life Is Good\" - Future ft.

boy\n[Verse 2]\nIt hit me like a train, the first time he called me dad\nIn a three stick figure crayon picture with all of us holding hands\nHis mama said, \"I understand if it's too soon for this\"\nI didn't let her finish, I took it to the kitchen and I stuck it on the fridge, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nHe ain't my blood, ain't got my name\nBut if he did, I'd feel the same\nI wasn't there for his first steps\nBut I ain't missed a ball game yet\nAnd that ain't ever gonna change\nI could never walk away\nYeah, he's my son and that's my choice\nHe ain't my blood but he's my, he's my boy\n\n[Bridge]\nHe's Saturday morning cartoons\nHe's \"Hey, can I sleep in your room?\"\nHe's bigger than the plans I had\nHe's making me a better man\n\n[Chorus]\nHe ain't my blood, ain't got my name\nBut if he did, I'd feel the same\nI wasn't there for his first steps\nBut I ain't missed a ball game yet\nAnd that ain't ever gonna change\nI could never walk away\nYeah, he's my son and that's

do the most, oh\nHad a ratchet in my coat, got a girl doin\u2019 coke\n\n[Chorus: Future]\nWe drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most\nIt kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones\nMy chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone\nWanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions\nShe called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean\n[Verse 1: Future]\nWhen I poured it, I gave her a dose, said she was already hooked\nIf you always there for me, that's a r\u0435ally good look\nI\u2019m changin' up your salary 'cause I'm gettin' to know you\nTell m\u0435 your availability, I want all of you\nIf it's like that, then it's like that, got you lightin' up like lightning\nI stack it up, get feisty, can\u2019t sabotage it or ice it\nYou gon\u2019 tell the world they flawed, thankful for when you nosy\nYou're a good girl but you\u2019re naughty, don't you never miss out on Pilates\nI let you stunt and flex in Bugattis, they don't got me, she with a body\nMe and cheap girls stay cheap, we do numbers, stay fly\nIf it's gettin\u2019 to you, then we fast forward, yeah\nStayin' low like a stash house, yeah\nBando to bando, traphouse, yeah\nMade it with nothin', learned to swag out, yeah\nCan't be defeated, I got mad sauce, yeah\nWhy would I front like it ain't my fault?\n\n[Chorus: Future]\nDrink up and we smoke, but she always do the most\nIt kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones\nMy chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone\nWanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions\nShe called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean\n\n[Post-Chorus: Future]\nShe called me Messiah, the way I floated in her ocean\nYelled, \"Jesus Christ,\" but I wasn't causin' commotion\nHit it so right, had her soakin' in the ocean, yeah\nYou might also like[Interlude: Future]\nHit it all night, we was drinkin' and smokin' (Yeah)\nDrinkin' and smokin'\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]\nI done went from GG to BB to LV\nI done fucked with Kiki and Lili and Nini\nI text her \"So proud of you\" when I got my B from CC\nIt is no way that you can know or see the things we see (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)\nShe said that she can tell every time that I lie through my teeth\nPlus I know you had somebody else right here in my sheets\nOh, you think you know my body?\nPull up in that Coupe, don't want no shawty\nI put rubies on my Rollie, now their eyes bleed\nI don't own no ice cream truck, just know my ice freeze\nMan, I read her text, she said, \"Girl, I creamed\"\nMan, I know she duckin' off with her side me\nWho you know gon' hit it raw, baby, besides me?\n\n[Chorus: Future]\nWe drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most\nIt kinda turn me on the way she lickin' on my stones\nMy chains on antifreeze, it

middle of the night again\nYou were drinking with your friends\nYou ignored it but you got it\n\n[Chorus]\nI get so neurotic about it baby\n\u2018Cause I know you\u2019re reading your phone\nI

in case you want me\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for my love\nThen light it up\n[Verse 2]\nEvery time I unlock my screen\nI hope I see one of them red lipstick \u2018I miss you\u2019 pictures\nI\u2019m on your clock, you\u2019re in control\nYou want me now baby go figure\nMy worlds at the tips of your fingers\n\n[Chorus]\nI get so neurotic about it baby\n\u2018Cause I know you\u2019re reading your

that's a song for another time\n(Brown eyed girl sweet Caroline)\nYeah, that's a song for another time\n(Freefallin' small town Saturday night)\nThat's a song for another time2Embed"}]
