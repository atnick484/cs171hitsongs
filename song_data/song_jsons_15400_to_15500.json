Lyrics[Verse 1 - G]\nWe be 6 deep creepin'\nIn a Deville sittin' up on D's with the suspension squeakin'\nGot us some P, runnin' the D's so we gon' smoke this weekend\nI'm with my G's, if we got beef, we gon' commense to squeezin'\nBullets commense to skeetin'\nGive my whole clique one reason\nWhy we shouldn't slang crack and cocaine, nigga my pockets weak and\nSo I'mma bring in everythang, then my G's ain't eatin'\nSo the result is layin' you down with them Tec-9 bullets skeetin'\nThat's all we know so that's how we go grab the ski mask for disguisin'\nCan't let him see me cause he gon' know me and it'll be too surprisin'\nFuck this nigga cause I'm ridin'\nTryin' to come up so quickly\nNo time to stall, lickin' 'em all, got a whole team that's strictly\nReady to ball, stand up tall and they all move so swiftly\nThem niggas ain't scared, they do it for bread\nSee they gon' come go with me\nBustin' up heads and lettin' loose lead\nAnd what do yo rhyme even matter\nAfter you licked you ain't worth shit we get what we got and we scatter\nBack to the crib, divide this here, my pockets is gettin' fatter\nYours getting flatter\nWhen you heard the glass shatter\nThat means me and my niggas done gathered\nNow you bout to feel the wrath of\nSomethin' that you wished you hadn't of\nAnd all I can say is back up because I'm bout to act up\nI get the stash from the back from the move\nI got a good alibi we could use\nWe took the dead bodies off in the pool\nAnd put the gloves that we used in the stool\nShit, you gon' have to flush that too\nMake sure that you see what you do\nCause if the PIG find out then we through\nThen it's off to the County for a few\nBut that's not how the story is told\nShit, one of us gon' have to go\nCause if them PIG's find out that we stole\nWe gon' have to bust back at them hoes\nSo get yo Glock ready to reload\nHaul ass real fast not slow\nCause on the block is 3rd patrol and they'll beat ya till yo body swole\nWe need to find somewhere to hide this dough\nShit, what about behind the school\nWe can come get it later on man just wait for the spot to cool\nGot back get the money any way\nSplit it up, give them niggas about a eighth\nI hid a couple G's down by the lake\nHell yeah I got 'em but they'll be straight\n[Verse 2 - Pimp]\nWe be 6 deep creepin'\nIn a Deville sittin' up on D's with the suspension squeakin'\nGot us some P, runnin' them D's so we gon' smoke this weekend\nI'm with my G's, if we got beef, we gon' commense to squeezin'\nBullets commense to skeetin'\nGive my whole clique one reason\nWhy we shouldn't ride a car full of ki's, we got children we feedin'\nComin' from Texas through New Orleans it gets thin and I'm lickin'\nMack 'em and leave, they gotta eat, either it's grindin' or pimpin'\nNever get caught slippin'\nNeed a Cadillac to dip in\nDo you niggas wanna pitch in on a gallon of beer or hard gin\nGetting drunk before we start lickin'\nI know a nigga we can hit for 10 -10 ki's in his grandma den\nThe back door finna get kicked in\nIt's another way we can get in\nCut the roof cause it's made out of tin\n4 niggas jumpin' out the shit then\n2 niggas in the car waitin'\nPitch black so we can't see in\nGet off my hip nigga stop pushin'\nWe get caught, we goin' straight to the Pen\nOne fluke, then we all turned in\nGetting life for this Devilish sin\nMove slow nigga so we can hear 'em\nWhere the flashlight so we can see 'em\nIf they woke then we gon' have to kill 'em\nThat ain't the reason my folks came here\nThe old lady came out on the porch\nTook her in the house, sit on the flo'\nMan, what you came out here fo'\nNow I'm gon' have to tie you with rope\nWe hit the safe then we up out the do'\nWe done got what we came here fo'\nCrank up the car, move nigga, let's go\nI here (Whhooop!!) nigga there go the folks\nMove slow, cut the clutch, let's roll\nI grab the dough then I hit the back road\nI was high but now it's low man somethin' told me to kill that ho\nRunnin' through the woods, my feet got so'\nToo damn dark, don't know where to go\nSmelled barbecue by Cassy's store\nHit the train track by Smiley Co\nTryin' to get to my grandma's house\nWay on Goode Street, man that's out\nWe 6 Deep, we look suspicious, man we need to spread out\nMe and T runnin' side by side\nMe and he, both of us so tired\nFly wide open through Cedar Park tryin' to see if we can find us a ride\nAin't nobody standin' outside\nWhole damn neighborhood too quiet\nSee the police so we still tryin' to hide\nCross Mobley Highway when they ride by\nI - need somethin' I can try\nI

threads, we are ignoring all politics and focusing only on how they rap. Influence, discographies, sales, beats, etc. should be ignored. We\u2019re focusing solely on RAP PERFORMANCE\nPlease also remember that the verses posted are not the only verses being compared. All the verses in all of these verses are being compared however some verses are posted over others in order to save space, show the highlights, and other reasons. For songs you are not familiar with please look at all the lyrics which is linked in each comparison while also watching/listening to the song/video that is also posted\n\nBoth are considered to be the among the best white emcees of all time and some of the biggest lyrical heavyweights in the rap game period. Both seem to have their softer and more heartfelt moments while they can also get wild and crazy. In order to properly compare the two lets compare songs of both emcees catalogs in the following categories\n\nTechnical Lyrical Abiltiy: Generally in music lyricism is the ability to write lyrics for a song and convey a message, story, and etc.. However, in the context of hip hop discussions we will limit technical lyrical ability to mean the way an emcee rhymes. Their utilization of multiple complex rhyming techniques such as intricate rhyme schemes, multisyallble rhymes, internal rhymes, and etc\u2026 Things such as storytelling, song writing, content and other things usually associated with the word lyricism or lyricist in music generally will be analyzed in other categories. This is strictly the technical side of rhymes\n\nStorytelling: This category will strictly analyze the way the emcees convey a story, while keeping in mind the uniqness and intricacies of the story plot themselves along with the way the artist conveys the story by utilizing poetic devices such as vivid imagery, and etc\u2026\n\nSocially Conscious/Content: A lot of emcees could rap very technical, however technicality is not the only thing when it comes to rap. This category will focus on what the emcee is saying and comparing the emcees most substantive and socially conscious songs, which includes songs with a message along with commentary on social issues, history, politics, religion, and etc\u2026\nQuotables/Punchlines: This category will compare the best individual lines of the emcees. The lines will be a mixture of\n1. Punchlines, which is typiucally a line that is humorous, clever, witty, and uses wordplay or something along these lines\n2. Quotables, which is a line that is not necessarily witty but is.. quotable. For example nas saying \u201cI never sleep, because sleep is the cousin of death\u201d is an example of a hard hitting quotable. It could be some type of law of wisdom that is timeless and never get\u2019s old. Jadakiss has SOO many of these with a broad example when he said: \u201cAnd you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open\u201d\nA good mixture that oscillates between the two would be a test of their wittiness, wordplay, and even substance\n\nTechnical Lyrical Abiltiy 1\n\nRap God vs Definition of a rap flow\n\nHttp://genius.com/Eminem-rap-god-lyrics\nHttp://genius.com/Ra-the-rugged-man-definition-of-a-rap-flow-lyrics\nRap God: I will only post the longest and highlight verse of the song to save space but we are comparing all the verses in each of the songs\nHttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbGs_qK2PQA\nCause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nThe way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR\nDale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\nKneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton No Asgard, Asgard\nSo you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent\nLet off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm toting\nAnd I should not be woken\nI'm the walking dead\nBut I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating\nBut I got your mom deep throating\nI'm out my Ramen Noodle\nWe have nothing in common, poodle\nI'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil\nIt's me\nMy honesty's brutal\nBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\nFor good at least once in a while\nSo I wanna make sure somewhere\nIn this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle\nEnough rhymes to\nMaybe try to help get some people through tough times\nBut I gotta keep a few punchlines\nJust in case cause even you unsigned\nRappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime\nI know there was a time where once I, was king of the underground\nBut I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\nSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\nYou get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line\nI said on \"I'm Back\" from the Mathers LP 1\nWhen I tried to say\n\"I'll take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\"\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was but I'm\nMorphin' into an immortal\nComing through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking\nCornrows\nYou write normal? Fuck being normal\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\nCause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad\nSinging to a man while they played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, \"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!\"\nLyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)\nUh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber\nSo that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating\nCause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\n\"Oh, he's too mainstream\"\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n\"It's not hip-hop, it's pop\"\nCause I found a, hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it\n\"I don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use\"\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice\nYour songs you could sacrifice virgins too?\nUngh, school flunky, pill junkie\nBut look at the accolades, these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues\nBut it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel\nI'm asleep in the front seat\nBumping Heavy D and the Boyz\nStill \"Chunky but Funky\"\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here's what they want from me\nThey're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have\nThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic\nTo the situation and understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it\nLife's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\nDon't mistake him for Satan\nIt's a fatal mistake\nIf you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip abroad\nAnd make her fall on her face and don't be a retard\nBe a king?

nail a trailer park bitch\nI met a slut and said \"What up? It's nice to meet ya\nI'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza\nBut I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid 'til the first of next month\nBut if you would care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt\nBut I ain't got no weed, no Phillies, or no papers\nPlus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist\nSo give me all your money and don't try nothing funny\nCause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me\"\nI went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me\nWith an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry\nI fell through the glass doors, started causing a scene\nSlid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine\nJumped up with a broken back\nThank God I was smokin' crack all day and doped up on coke and smack\nAll I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse\nNow I wanna kill her but yo, I gotta catch her first\nRan through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut\nSaw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up\nKicked the door down to murder this divorced slut\nLooked around the room that's when I seen her bedroom door shut\nI know you're in there bitch, I got my gun cocked\nYou might as well come out now, she said \"Come in, it's unlocked\"\nI walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne\nAnd seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn\nShe said \"Come here big boy, let's get acquainted\"\nI turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it\nShe came at me at full speed, nothing could stop her\nI shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her\nI started to beg \"No, please let go\"\nBut she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll\nWith one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled\nI grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple\nJust tryna buy me some time then I remembered this magic trick\nDuh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick!\nWhipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it\nIt hit the ground and caused an earthquake

Satan\nI'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydrating\nHurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waiting\nShot a man twice in the back when he tried escaping\nI want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan\nMaybe I need my head inside straightened, brain contemplating\nClean out the register, dip before somebody catches ya\nOr gets your description and sketches ya\nThen connects you as the prime suspect\nBut I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet\nCause I got a daughter to feed\nAnd two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed\nThe best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell\nAnd hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring\nMoney from the safe in the back, stepped in waving the Mac\nCo-operate, and we can operate, and save an attack\nThis bitch tried escaping the jack, grabbed her by the throat\nIt's murder she wrote, you barely heard a word\nAs she choked, it wasn't nothing for her to be smoked\nThen I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke\nJust then the pigs bust in yelling: \"Freeze!\"\nBut I'm already wanted for selling ki's\nAnd bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spelling bees\nSo before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees\nI bust shots, they bust back\nHit me square in the chest, wasn't wearing a vest\n\n[Verse 2]\nLeft the house, pulling out the drive backing out\nBlew the back end out this lady's Jag,

it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up\nStole her car and made a profit, grabbed the tape from out the deck\nAnd lost it out the window like the girl in Set It Off did\nJetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal\nDrove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimming pool\nClimbed out and collapsed on the patio\nI made it out alive but I'm injured badly though\nParents screaming, \"Johnny go in and call the police\nTell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace\"\nTried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up\nRun in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff\nActing like they never seen nobody hit a lick before\nSmashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64\nWhen they sell out in stores the price triples\nI ran up the block jumping kids on tricycles\nAnd collided with an 80-year-old lady with groceries\nThere goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties\nStood up and started to see stars\nToo many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars\nBarely escaped, must'a been some dumb luck\nJumped up and climbed the back of a moving dump truck\nBut I think somebody seen me maybe\nPlus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must'a dropped a Beanie Baby\nFuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits\nCame out with a white flag hollering \"truce-truce\"\nAnd surrendered my weapon to cops\nWasn't me, it was the gangster

that you could've bet your asses\nIf I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em\nAnd although one has only met their grandma, once you pulled up\nIn our drive one night, as we were leaving to get some hamburgers\nMe, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you\nAnd as you left I had this overwhelming sadness\nCome over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths\nAnd I saw your headlights as I looked back and\nI'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad\nSo mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet, I guess\nI had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead\nThe stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing\nSo if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message\nThat I'll always love you from afar cause you're my ma\nLegends Never Die (Daddys Halo)- RA the rugged man\nHttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g6UeOOCD8o&nohtml5=False\nYo, part good samaritan, part criminal, a master with weapons\nNice with his hands, he was Rugged Man the original\nAs children we saw you losing your sanity\nEven though we watched you struggle financially\nYou kept the love in the family\nDaddy, I'm thinking about you every day though\nI can see you holding a machine gun in heaven with angel wings and a halo\nYou was always quick to pick a pocket\nYou're the only one in heaven\nProbably slick enough to pull off stealing God's wallet\nIn life the Lord ain't really deal you a fair one\nI watched you bury your baby boy, your daughter and your grandson\nYou lived one hell of a life from being highly decorated\nTo being homeless sleeping in the park with your pregnant wife\nIf I acted up in the restaurant I knew I was being brave\nCause you'd take me to the bathroom and spank me 'til I knew how to behave\nTaught me prayers at night and you'd tell me Bible stories\nTaught me history, Crazy Horse and his tribal glories\nHow many times as a kid I seen you handcuffed by the cops?\nYou taught us black music, Sam Cooke, The Drifters, The Four Tops\nTaught me about boxing, Ray Leonard and Larry Holmes\nAround the same time you left my mother for Debbie Jones\nI told the world your true story and after the record got made\nUncommon Valor, some said I dropped the verse of the decade\nEverywhere you went you would tell the world about your son Rugged Man\nYou was so proud of me, daddy, you was my number one fan\nYou was always bragging about me to no purpose\nOn your deathbed you'd play my Mayweather interview for the nurses\nLosing you, daddy, it hurt more than any physical pain\nYou was too young when the cancer went from your throat and into your brain\nYou was my teacher, my idol, I worshipped you, you was the best, daddy\nYou lived a tough life, now get some rest, daddy\nI love you daddyEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1286106", "artist_names": "The Sylvers", "full_title": "Any Way You Want Me by\u00a0The\u00a0Sylvers",

when he sang\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a long way from Memphis to that mansion in the sky\nBut he kept his faith in Jesus all along\nIt's a long way from Graceland across Jordan to the Promised Land\nBut Jesus finally came to lead him home\n[Verse 2]\nFrom the days of Love Me Tender to his mama's last farewell\nSome say he knew how long he had to stay\nHis life was two days longer than the one who gave him life\nAnd he almost knew the number of the days\n\n[Chorus] [x2]You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/917621", "artist_names": "Leo Sayer",

wonder what or maybe who you're lovin' for\nAnd girls seem to think that they're the chosen ones\nAnd women choose to let well enough alone\nAnd it's their business til you stick your nose in

border\nThe wind whips up the waves so loud\nThe ghost moon sails among the clouds\nTurns the rifles into silver on the border\n\n[Verse 1]\nOn my wall the colours of the maps are running\nFrom Africa the winds they talk of changes coming\nThe torches flare up in the night\nThe hand that sets the farms alight\nHas spread the word to those who're waiting on the border\n[Verse 2]\nIn the village where I grew up\nNothing seems the same\nStill you never see the change from day to day\nAnd no-one notices the customs slip away\n\n[Verse 3]\nLate last night the rain was knocking on my window\nI moved across the darkened room and in the lampglow\nI thought I saw down in the street\nThe spirit of the century\nTelling us that we're all standing on the border\n\n[Verse 4]\nIn the islands where I grew up\nNothing seems the same\nIt's just the patterns that remain\nAn empty shell\nBut there's a strangeness in the air you feel too well\n\n[Chorus]\nThe fishing boats go out across the evening water\nSmuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border\nThe wind whips up the waves so loud\nThe ghost moon sails among the clouds\nTurns the rifles into silver on the border\nYou might also

"Teddy Bear Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI was on the outskirts of a little southern town\nTrying to reach my destination before the sun went down\nThe old CB was blaring away on Channel 1-9\nWhen there came a little boy's voice on the radio line\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd he said, \"Breaker 1-9, is anyone there?\nCome on back truckers and talk to Teddy Bear\"\nWell I keyed the mic and I said, \"You got it, Teddy Bear\"\nAnd the little boy's voice came back on the air\n[Verse 3]\n\"Appreciate the break who we got on that end\"\nI told him my handle and then he began\n\"Though I'm not supposed to bother you fellows out there\nMom says you're busy and for me to stay off the air\"\nBut you see, I get lonely and it helps to talk\n'Cause that's about all I can do, I'm crippled and I can't walk\nI came back and told him to fire up that mic\nAnd I'd talk to him as long as he'd liked\n\n[Verse 4]\n\"This was my dad's radio\", the little boy said\nBut I guess it's mine and mom's now 'cause my daddy's dead\nDad had a wreck about a month ago\nHe was trying to get home in a blinding snow\nMom has to work now to make ends meet\nAnd I'm not much help with my two crippled feet\nShe says not to worry that we'll make it alright\nBut I hear her crying sometimes late at night\nYou know there's one thing I want more than anything else to see\nOh, I know you guys are too busy to bother with me\nBut you see, my dad used to take me for rides when he was home\nBut I guess that's all over now since my daddy's gone\n\n[Verse 5]\nNot one breaker came on the old CB\nAs that little crippled boy talked with me\nI tried hard to swallow a lump just wouldn't stay down\nAs I thought about my boy back in Greenville town\nYou might also like[Verse 6]\nDad was gonna take mom and me with him later on this year\nWhy I remember him saying someday\nThis old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear\nBut I know now I'll never get a ride an 18-wheeler again\nBut this old base'll keep me in touch with all my trucker friends\nTeddy Bear's gonna back on out now and leave you alone\n'Cause it's about time for mom to come home\nBut you give me shout when you're passing through\nAnd I'll surely be happy to come back to you\n\n[Verse 7]\nWell, I came back and I said before you go 10-10\nWhat's your home 20, little CB friend\nHe gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate\n'Cause this hot load of freight would just have to wait\nI turned that truck around on a dime\nAnd headed straight for Jackson Street, 229\nAnd as I rounded the corner, oh, I got one heck of a shock\n18-wheeler's were lined up for three city blocks\nWell I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's call\nAnd that little crippled boy was having a ball\nFor as fast as one driver would carry him in\nAnother would carry him to his truck and take off again\n\n[Verse 8]\nWell, you better believe I took my turn at riding Teddy Bear\nAnd then carried him back in and put him down in his chair\nAnd buddy, if I never live to see happiness again\nI want you to know I saw it that day in the face of that little man\n[Verse 9]\nWe took up a collection for him before his mama got home\nAnd each driver said goodbye and then they were all gone\nHe shook my hand with a mile long grin\nAnd said, \"So long trucker, I'll catch you again\"\nAh, I hit that interstate with tears in my eyes\nI turned on the radio and I got another surprise\n\"Breaker 1-9\", came the voice on the air\n\"Just one word of thanks from mama, Teddy Bear\nWe wish each and everyone a special prayer for you\n'Cause you just made my little boy's dream come true\nI'll sign off now before I start to cry\nMay God ride with you, 10-4, and goodbye\"1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/667478", "artist_names":

you ain't gettin' at home\n\nYour hair is in place dressing to kill\nYour old man has said that when he dies he will leave you his money\nAnd the pool where you swim\nAre you looking for something maybe you ain't gettin' from him\n\nSteppin' out, steppin' out, to get a little action on the side\nSteppin' out, steppin' out, the day time queen takes a midnight ride\nAnd it's plain as plain could be, you're a woman who wants to be free\nSo if you're steppin' out tonight honey, come on and step out with me\nThe party's a bore, it's bound to get worse\nLet's slip out somewhere and engage in our own celebration\nLet me pour you some wine\nAre you thinking maybe baby your needs are the same as mine\n\nLet's go for a walk, go for a ride\nOr maybe just stand here and think what we can do to eachother\nNo we don't have to dance\nIf you're thinking of stepping out, honey this is your chance\n\nSteppin' out, steppin' out, to get a little action on the side\nSteppin' out, steppin' out, the day time queen takes a midnight ride\nAnd it's plain as plain could be, you're a woman who wants to be free\nSo if you're steppin' out tonight honey, come on and step out with me\n\nSteppin' out,

The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot for taking a teapot that wasn't his. Another guy I knew really did threaten to have his personal enemies killed by hired gunmen after the war. And so on. I've changed all their names.\nI really did go to Dresden with Guggenheim money (God love it) in 1967. It looked a lot like Dayton, Ohio, more open spaces than Dayton has. There must be tons of human bone meal in the ground.\n\nI went back there with an old war buddy, Bernard V. O'Hare, and we made friends with a cab driver, who took us to the slaughterhouse where we had been locked up at night as prisoners of war. His name was Gerhard M\u00fcller. He told us that he was a prisoner of the Americans for a while. We asked him how it was to live under Communism, and he said that it was terrible at first, because everybody had to work so hard, and because there wasn't much shelter or food or clothing. But things were much better now. He had a pleasant little apartment, and his daughter was getting an excellent education. His mother was incinerated in the Dresden fire-storm. So it goes.\n\nHe sent O'Hare a postcard at Christmastime, and here is what it said:\n\n\"I wish you and your family also as to your friend a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year and I hope hat we'll meet again in a world of peace and freedom in the taxicab if the accident will.\"I like that very much: \"If the accident will.\"\nI would hate to tell you what this lousy little book cost me in money and anxiety and time. When I got home from the Second World War twenty-three years ago, I thought it would be easy for me to write about the destruction of Dresden, since all I would have to do would be to report what I had seen. And I thought, too, that it would be a masterpiece or at least make me a lot of money, since the subject was so big.\nBut not many words about Dresden came from my mind then - not enough of them to make a book, anyway. And not many words come now, either, when I have become an old fart with his memories and his Pall Malls, with his sons full grown.\n\nI think of how useless the Dresden part of my memory has been, and yet how tempting Dresden has been to write about, and I am reminded of the famous limerick:\n\nThere was a young man from Stamboul,\nWho soliloquized thus to his tool:\n\"You took all my wealth\nand you ruined my health,\nand now you won't pee, you old fool.\"\n\nAnd I'm reminded, too, of the song that goes:\n\nMy name is Yon Yonson,\nI work in Wisconsin,\nI work in a lumbermill there.\nThe people I meet when I walk down the street,\nThey say, \"What's your name?\"\nAnd I say,\n\"My name is Yon Yonson,\nI work in Wisconsin...\"\n\nAnd so on to infinity.\n\nOver the years, people I've met have often asked me what I'm working on, and I've usually replied that the main thing was a book about Dresden.\n\nI said that to Harrison Starr, the movie-maker, one time, and he raised his eyebrows and inquired, \"Is it an anti-war book?\"\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"I guess.\"\n\n\"You know what I say to people when I hear they're writing anti-war books?\"\n\n\"No. What do you say, Harrison Starr?\"\n\n\"I say, 'Why don't you write an anti-glacier book instead?'\"\n\nWhat he meant, of course, was that there would always be wars, that they were as easy to stop as glaciers. I believe that, too.\nAnd even if wars didn't keep coming like glaciers, there would still be plain old death.When I was somewhat younger, working on my famous Dresden book, I asked an old war buddy named Bernard V. O'Hare if I could come to see him. He was a\n\n\n\ndistrict attorneyin Pennsylvania. I was a writer on Cape Cod. We had been privates in the war, infantry scouts. We had never expected to make any money after the war, but we were doing quite well.\n\nI had the Bell Telephone Company find him for me. They are wonderful that way. I have this disease late at night sometimes, involving alcohol and the telephone. I get drunk, and I drive my wife away with a breath like mustard gas and roses. And then, speaking gravely and elegantly into the telephone, I ask the telephone operators to connect me with this friend or that one, from whom I have not heard in years.\n\nI got O'Hare on the line this way. He is short and I am tall. We were Mutt and Jeff in the war. We were captured together in the war. I told him who I was on the telephone. He had no trouble believing it. He was up. He was reading. Everybody else in his house was asleep.\n\n\"Listen-\" I said, \"I'm writing this book about Dresden. I'd like some help remembering stuff. I wonder if I could come down and see you, and we could drink and talk and remember.\"\n\nHe was unenthusiastic. He said he couldn't remember much. He told me, though, to come ahead.\n\n\"I think the climax of the book will be the execution of poor old Edgar Derby,\" I said. \"The irony is so great. A whole city gets burned down, and thousands and thousands of people are killed. And then this one American foot soldier is arrested in the ruins for taking a teapot. And he's given a regular trial, and then he's shot by a firing squad.\n\"Um,\" said O'Hare.\n\n\"Don't you think that's really where the climax should come?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about it,\" he said. \"That's your trade, not mine.\"As a trafficker in climaxes and thrills and characterization and wonderful dialogue and suspense confrontations, I had outlined the Dresden story many times. The best outline I ever made, or anyway the prettiest one, was on the back fo a roll of wallpaper.\n\nI used my daughter's crayons, a different color for each main character. One end of the wallpaper was the beginning of the story, and the other end was the end, and then there was all that middle part, which was the middle. And the blue line met the red line and then the yellow line, and the yellow line stopped because the character represented by the yellow line was dead. And so on. The destruction of Dresden was represented by a vertical band of orange cross-hatching, and all the lines that were still alive passed through it, came out the other side.\n\nThe end, where all the lines stopped, was a beetfield on the Elbe, outside of Halle. The rain was coming down. The war in Europe had been over for a couple of weeks. We were formed in ranks, with Russian soldiers guarding us - Englishmen, Americans, Dutchmen, Belgians, Frenchmen, Canadians, South Africans, New Zealanders, Australians, thousands of us about to stop being prisoners of war.\n\nAnd so on the other side of the field were thousands of Russians and Poles and Yugoslavians and so on guarded by American soldiers. An exchange was made there in the rain - one for one. O'Hare and I climbed into the back of an American truck with a lot of others. O'Hare didn't have any souvenirs. Almost everybody else did. I had a ceremonial Luftwaffe saber, still do. The rabid little American I call Paul Lazzaro in this book had about a quart of diamonds and emeralds and rubies and so on. He had taken these from dead people in the cellars of Dresden. So it goes.\n\nAn idiotic Englishman, who had lost all his teeth somewhere, had his souvenir in a canvas bag. The bag was resting on my insteps. He would peek into the bag every now and then, and he would roll his eyes and swivel his scrawny neck, trying to catch people looking covetously at his bag. And he would bounce the bag on my insteps.\n\nI thought this bouncing was accidental. But I was mistaken. He had to show somebody what was in the bag, and he had decided he could trust me. He caught my eye, winked, opened the bag. There was a plaster model of the Eiffel Tower in there it was painted gold. It had a clock in it.\n\n\"There's a smashin' thing,\" he said.\n\nAnd we were flown to a rest camp in France, where we were fed chocolate malted milkshakes and other rich foods until we were all covered with baby fat. Then we were sent home, and I married a pretty girl who was covered with baby fat, too.\n\nAnd we had babies.\n\nAnd they're all grown up now, and I'm an old fart with his memories and his Pall Malls. My name is Yon Yonson, I work in Wisconsin, I work in a lumbermill there.\n\nSometimes I try to call up old girl friends on the telephone late at night, after my wife has gone to bed. \"Operator, I wonder if you could give me the number of a Mrs. So-and-So. I think she lives at such-and-such.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry sir, there's no such listing.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Operator. Thanks just the same.\"\n\nAnd I let the dog out, or I let him in, and we talk some. I let him know I like him, and he lets me know he likes me. He doesn't mind the smell of mustard gas and roses.\n\n\"You're all right, Sandy,\" I'll say to the dog. \"You know that, Sandy? You're O.K.\"\n\nSometimes I'll turn on the radio and listen to a talk program from Boston or New York. I can't stand recorded music if I've been drinking a good deal.\n\nSooner or later I go to bed, and my wife asks me what time it is. She always has to know the time. Sometimes I don't know, and I say, \"Search me.\"\n\nI think about my education sometimes. I went to the\n\nUniversity\n\nof Chicago for a while after the Second World War. I was a student in the Department of Anthropology. At that time, they were teaching that there was absolutely no difference between anybody. They may be teaching that still.\n\nAnother thing they taught was that nobody was ridiculous or bad or disgusting. Shortly before my father died, he said to me, \"You know - you never wrote a story with a villain in it.\"\n\nI told him that was one of the things I learned in college after the war.\n\nWhile I was studying to be an anthropologist, I was also working as a police reporter for the famous Chicago City News Bureau for twenty-eight dollars a week. One time they switched me from the night shift to the day shift., so I worked sixteen hours straight. We\nwere supported by all the newspapers in town, and the AP and the UP and all that. And we would cover the courts and the police stations and the Fire Department and the Coast Guard out on Lake Michigan and all that. We were connected to the institutions that\nsupported us by means of pneumatic tubes which ran under the streets of Chicago.\n\nReporters would telephone in stories to writers wearing headphones, and the writers would stencil the stories on mimeograph sheets. The stories were mimeographed and stuffed into the brass and velvet cartridges which the pneumatic tubes ate. The very toughest reporters and writers were women who had taken over the jobs of men who\u2019d gone to war.\n\nAnd the first story I covered I had to dictate over the telephone to one of those beastly girls. It was about a young veteran who had taken a job running an old-fashioned elevator in an office building. The elevator door on the first floor was ornamental iron lace. Iron\nivy snaked in and out of the holes. There was an iron twig with two iron lovebirds perched upon it.\n\nThis veteran decided to take his car into the basement, and he closed the door and started down, but his wedding ring Was caught in all the ornaments. So he was hoisted into the air and the floor of the car went down, dropped out from under him, and the top of the car squashed him. So it goes.\n\nSo I phoned this in, and the woman who was going to cut the stencil asked me. \u2019What did his wife say?\u2019\n\n\u2019She doesn\u2019t know yet,\u2019 I said. \u2019It just happened.\u2019\n\n\u2019Call her up and get a statement.\u2019\n\n\u2019What?\u2019\n\n\u2019Tell her you're Captain Finn of the Police Department. Say you have some sad news. Give her the news, and see what she says.'\n\nSo I did. She said about what you would expect her to say. There was a baby. And so on.\n\nWhen I got back to the office, the woman writer asked me, just for her own information, what the squashed guy had looked Eke when he was squashed.\n\n\n\nI told her.\n\n'Did it bother you?' she said. She was eating a Three Musketeers Candy Bar.\n\n'Heck no, Nancy,' I said. 'I\u2019ve seen lots worse than that in the war.'\n\nEven then I was supposedly writing a book about Dresden. It wasn\u2019t a famous air raid back then in America. Not many Americans knew how much worse it had been than Hiroshima, for instance. I didn\u2019t know that, either. There hadn\u2019t been much publicity.\n\nI happened to tell a University of Chicago professor at a cocktail party about the raid as I had seen it, about the book I would write. He was a member of a thing called The Committee on Social Thought. And he told me about the concentration camps, and about how the Germans had made soap and candles out of the fat of dead Jews and so on.\n\nAll could say was, 'I know, I know. I know.\u2019\n\nThe Second World War had certainly made everybody very tough. And I became a public relations man for General Electric in Schenectady, New York, and a volunteer fireman in the Village of Alplaus, where I bought my first home. My boss there was one of the toughest guys I ever hope to meet. He had been a lieutenant colonel in public relations in Baltimore. While I was in Schenectady he joined the Dutch Refonned Church, which is a very tough church, indeed.\n\nHe used to ask me sneeringly sometimes why I hadn\u2019t been an officer, as though I'd done something wrong.\n\nMy wife and I had lost our baby fat. Those were our scrawny years. We had a lot of scrawny veterans and their scrawny wives for friends. The nicest veterans in Schenectady, I thought, the kindest and funniest ones, the ones who hated war the most,\nwere the ones who\u2019d really fought.\n\nI wrote the Air Force back then, asking for details about the raid on Dresden, who ordered it, how many planes did it, why they did it, what desirable results there had been and so on. I was answered by a man who, like myself, was in public relations. He said that he was sorry, but that the infonnation was top secret still.\n\nI read the letter out loud to my wife, and I said, 'Secret? My God-from whom?'\n\nWe were United World Federalists back then. I don\u2019t know what we are now. Telephoners, I guess. We telephone a lot-or /do, anyway, late at night.\n\nA couple of weeks after I telephoned my old war buddy, Bernard V. O'Hare, I really did go to see him. That must have been in 1964 or so-whatever the last year was for the New York World's Fair. Eheu, fugaces labuntur anni. My name is Yon Yonson. There\nwas a young man from Stamboul.\n\nI took two little girls with me, my daughter, Nanny, and her best friend, Allison Mitchell. They had never been off Cape Cod before. When we saw a river, we had to stop so they could stand by it and think about it for a while. They had never seen water in that\nlong and narrow, unsalted form before. The river was the Hudson. There were carp in there and we saw them. They were as big as atomic submarines.\n\nWe saw waterfalls, too, streams jumping off cliffs into the valley of the Delaware. There were lots of things to stop and see-and then it was time to go, always time to go.\n\nThe little girls were wearing white party dresses and black party shoes, so strangers would know at once how nice they were. \u2019Time to go, girls,\u2019 I\u2019d say. And we would go.\n\nAnd the sun went down, and we had supper in an Italian place, and then I knocked on the front door of the beautiful stone house of Bernard V. O'Hare. I was carrying a bottle of Irish whiskey like a dinner bell.\n\nI met his nice wife, Mary, to whom I dedicate this book. I dedicate it to Gerhard Muller, the Dresden taxi driver, too. Mary O'Hare is a trained nurse, which is a lovely thing for a woman to be.\n\nMary admired the two little girls I\u2019d brought, mixed them in with her own children, sent them all upstairs to play games and watch television. It was only after the children were gone that I sensed that Mary didn\u2019t like me or didn\u2019t like something about the night.\nShe was polite but chilly.\n\n\u2019It's a nice cozy house you have here,' I said, and it really was.\n\n'I've fixed up a place where you can talk and not be bothered,' she said.\n\n'Good,' I said, and I imagined two leather chairs near a fire in a paneled room, where two old soldiers could drink and talk. But she took us into the kitchen. She had put two straight-backed chairs at a kitchen table with a white porcelain top. That table top was screaming with reflected light from a two-hundred-watt bulb overhead. Mary had prepared an operating room. She put only one glass on it, which was for me. She explained that O'Hare couldn\u2019t drink the hard stuff since the war.\n\nSo we sat down. O'Hare was embarrassed, but he wouldn't tell me what was wrong. I couldn\u2019t imagine what it was about me that could bum up Mary so. I was a family man. I\u2019d been married only once. I wasn\u2019t a drunk. I hadn\u2019t done her husband any dirt in the\nwar.\n\nShe fixed herself a Coca-Cola, made a lot of noise banging the ice-cube tray in the stainless steel sink. Then she went into another part of the house. But she wouldn\u2019t sit still. She was moving all over the house, opening and shutting doors, even moving\nfurniture around to work off anger.\n\nI asked O\u2019Hare what I\u2019d said or done to make her act that way.\n\n'It's all right,' he said. \"Don\u2019t worry about it. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you.\u2019 That was kind of him. He was lying. It had everything to do with me.\n\nSo we tried to ignore Mary and remember the war. I took a couple of belts of the booze I'd brought. We would chuckle or grin sometimes, as though war stories were coming back, but neither one of us could remember anything good. O'Hare remembered\none guy who got into a lot of wine in Dresden, before it was bombed, and we had to take him home in a wheelbarrow.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t much to write a book about. I remembered two Russian soldiers who had looted a clock factory. They had a horse-drawn wagon full of clocks. They were happy and drunk. They were smoking huge cigarettes they had rolled in newspaper.\n\nThat was about it for memories, and Mary was still making noise. She finally came out in the kitchen again for another Coke. She took another tray of ice cubes from the refrigerator, banged it in the sink, even though there was already plenty of ice out.\n\nThen she turned to me, let me see how angry she was, and that the anger was for me. She had been talking to herself, so what she said was a fragment of a much larger conversation. \"You were just babies then!' she said.\n\n\u2019What?\" I said.\n\n'You were just babies in the war-like the ones upstairs! '\n\nI nodded that this was true. We had been foolish virgins in the war, right at the end of childhood.\n\n'But you're not going to write it that way, are you.\u2019 This wasn't a question. It was an accusation.\n\n'I-I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I said.\n\n'Well, / know,' she said. 'You'll pretend you were men instead of babies, and you'll be played in the movies by Frank Sinatra and John Wayne or some of those other glamorous, war-loving, dirty old men. And war will look just wonderful, so we'll have a\nlot more of them. And they'll be fought by babies like the babies upstairs.\u2019\n\nSo then I understood. It was war that made her so angry. She didn't want her babies or anybody else's babies killed in wars. And she thought wars were partly encouraged by books and movies.\n\nSo I held up my right hand and I made her a promise 'Mary,' I said, 'I don\u2019t think this book is ever going to be finished. I must have written five thousand pages by now, and thrown them all away. If I ever do finish it, though, I give you my word of honor: there\nwon\u2019t be a part for Fra nk Sinatra or John Wayne.\n\n'I tell you what,' I said, 'I'll call it The Children's Crusade.'\n\nShe was my friend after that.\n\nO'Hare and I gave up on remembering, went into the living room, talked about other things. We became curious about the real Children's Crusade, so O'Hare looked it up in a book he had, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, by Charles Mackay, LL.D. It was first published in London in 1841.\n\nMackay had a low opinion of all Crusades. The Children's Crusade struck him as only slightly more sordid than the ten Crusades for grown-ups. O'Hare read this handsome passage out loud:\n\nHistory in her solemn page informs us that the Crusaders were but ignorant and savage men, that their motives were those of bigotry unmitigated, and that their pathway was one of blood and wars. Romance, on the other hand, dilates upon their piety and heroism, and portrays, in her most glowing and impassioned hues, their virtue and magnanimity, the imperishable honor they acquired for themselves, and the great services they rendered to Christianity.\n\nAnd then O'Hare read this: Now what was the grand result of all these struggles? Europe expended millions of her treasures, and the blood of two million of her people; and a handful of quarrelsome knights retained possession of Palestine for about one hundred years!\n\nMackay told us that the Children's Crusade started in 1213, when two monks got the idea of raising armies of children in Germany and France, and selling them in North Africa as slaves. Thirty thousand children volunteered, thinking they were going to\nPalestine. They were no doubt idle and deserted children who generally swarm in great cities, nurtured on vice and daring, said Mackay, and ready for anything.\n\nPope Innocent the Third thought they were going to Palestine, too, and he was thrilled. 'These children are awake while we are asleep!\u2019 he said.\n\n\n\nMost of the children were shipped out of Marseilles, and about half of them drowned in shipwrecks. The other half got to North Africa where they were sold.\n\nThrough a misunderstanding, some children reported for duty at Genoa, where no slave ships were waiting. They were fed and sheltered and questioned kindly by good people there---then given a little money and a lot of advice and sent back home.\n\n'Hooray for the good people of Genoa,' said Mary O'Hare.\n\nI slept that night in one of the children's bedrooms. O\u2019Hare had put a book for me on the bedside table. It was Dresden, History, Stage and Gallery, by Mary Ended. It was published in 1908, and its introduction began\n\nIt is hoped that this little book will make itself useful It attempts to give to an English- reading public a bird's-eye view of how Dresden came to look as it does, architecturally; of how it expanded musically, through the genius of a few men, to its present bloom; and it calls attention to certain permanent landmarks in art that make its Gallery the resort of those seeking lasting impressions.\n\nI read some history further on\n\nNow, in 1760, Dresden underwent siege by the Prussians. On the fifteenth of July began the cannonade. The Picture-Gallery took fire. Many of the paintings had been transported to-the Konigstein, but some were seriously injured by splinters of\nbombshells-notably Francia's 'Baptism of Christ.\u2019 Furthermore, the stately Kreuzkirche tower, from which the enemy's movements had been watched day and night, stood in flames. It later succumbed. In sturdy contrast with the pitiful fate of the Kreuzkirche, stood the Frauenkirche, from the curves of whose stone dome the Prussian bombs - rebounded like rain. Friederich was obliged finally to give up the siege, because he learned of the fall of Glatz, the critical point of his new conquests. 'We must be off to Silesia, so that we do not lose everything. '\n\nThe devastation of Dresden was boundless. When Goethe as a young student visited the city, he still found sad ruins 'Von der Kuppel der Frauenkirche sah ich these leidigen Triimmer zwischen die schone stddtische Ordnung hineingesat; da riihmte mir der Kiister die Kunst des Baumeisters, welcher Kirche und Kuppel auf einen so uneriiinschten Fall schon eingeyichtet und bombenfest erbaut hatte. Der gute Sakristan deutete mir alsdann aufRuinen nach alien Seiten und sagte bedenklich lakonisch: Das hat her Feind Gethan!'\n\nThe two little girls and I crossed the Delaware River where George Washington had crossed it, the next morning. We went to the New York World's Fair, saw what the past had been like, according to the Ford Motor Car Company and Walt Disney, saw what the\nfuture would be like, according to General Motors.\n\nAnd I asked myself about the present: how wide it was, how deep it was, how much was mine to keep.\n\nI taught creative writing in the famous Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa for a couple of years after that. I got into some perfectly beautiful trouble, got out of it again.\n\nI taught in the afternoons. In the mornings I wrote. I was not to be disturbed. I was working on my famous book about Dresden.\n\nAnd somewhere in there a nice man named Seymour Lawrence gave me a three-book contract, and I said, 'O.K., the first of the three will be my famous book about Dresden.\u2019\n\nThe friends of Seymour Lawrence call him \u2019Sam.' And I say to Sam now: 'Sam-here's the book.\u2019\n\nIt is so short and jumbled and jangled, Sam, because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre. Everybody is supposed to be dead, to never say anything or want anything ever again. Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre, and it always is, except for the birds.\n\nAnd what do the birds say? All there is to say about a massacre, things like Poo-tee-weet? '\n\nI have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres, and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee.\n\nI have also told them not to work for companies which make massacre machinery, and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that.\n\nAs I've said I recently went back to Dresden with my friend O'Hare. We had a million laughs in Hamburg and West Berlin and East Berlin and Vienna and Salzburg and Helsinki, and in Leningrad, too. It was very good for me, because I saw a lot of authentic backgrounds for made-up stories which I will write later on. One of them will be Russian Baroque and another will be No Kissing and another will be Dollar Bar and another will be If the Accident Will, and so on.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThere was a Lufthansa plane that was supposed to fly from Philadelphia to Boston to Frankfurt. O'Hare was supposed to get on in Philadelphia and I was supposed to get on in Boston, and off we\u2019d go. But Boston was socked in, so the plane flew straight to\nFra nk furt from Philadelphia. And I became a non-person in the Boston Fog, and Lufthansa put me in a limousine with some other non-persons and sent us to a motel for a non-night.\n\nThe time would not pass. Somebody was playing with the clocks, and not only with the electric clocks, but the wind-up kind, too. The second hand on my watch would twitch once, and a year would pass, and then it would twitch again.\n\nThere was nothing I could do about it. As an Earthling., I had to believe whatever clocks said-and calendars.\n\nI had two books with me, which I\u2019d meant to read on the plane. One was Words for the Wind, by Theodore Roethke, and this is what I found in there:\n\nI wake to steep, and take my waking slow.\n\nI feet my late in what I cannot fear.\n\nI learn by going where I have to go.\n\nMy other book was Erika Ostrovsky's Celine and His Vision. Celine was a brave French soldier in the First World War-until his skull was cracked. After that he couldn\u2019t sleep, and there were noises in his head. He became a doctor, and he treated poor people in the daytime, and he wrote grotesque novels all night. No art is possible without a dance with death, he wrote.\n\nThe truth is death, he wrote. I've fought nicely against it as long as I could ... danced with it, festooned it, waltzed it around ... decorated it with streamers, titillated it...\n\nTime obsessed him. Miss Ostrovsky reminded me of the amazing scene in Death on the Installment Plan where Celine wants to stop the bustling of a street crowd. He screams on paper, Make them stop ... don't let them move anymore at all ... There, make them freeze... once and for all! ...So that they won't disappear anymore!\n\nI looked through the Gideon Bible in my motel room for tales of great destruction. The sun was risen upon the Earth when Lot entered into Zo-ar, I read. Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of Heaven; and He overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.\n\nSo it goes.\n\nThose were vile people in both those cities, as is well known. The world was better off without them.\n\nAnd Lot's wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human.\n\nShe was turned to a pillar of salt. So it goes.\n\nPeople aren't supposed to look back. I'm certainly not going to do it anymore.\n\nI\u2019ve finished my war book now. The next one I write is going to be fun.\n\nThis one is a failure, and had to be, since it was written by a pillar of salt. It begins like this:\n\nListen:\n\nBilly Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.\n\nIt ends like this:\n\nPoo-tee-weet?6Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/810553",

is really a hurting thing\n(Hey man, what's happenin'?)\nHey brother, what's going on? Alright\nHe's got his woman with him\n(How's he doing? Is he okay?)\nBut mine's at home\nWhat time is it...? Damn, almost 12:45\nI think Im'ma walk up here and see what's going on, in this discotheque\nThere's always something going on in there\nWhat becomes of a broken hearted...\nAlbeit... mm, this looks like the place\nEverybody's going in, lemme step on up here, heh\nOne ticket please\nLord have mercy, everybody's here\nHey, what's going on, man?\nYeah, she's at home\nYeah, she's at home... yeah, she's at home\n\n[Chorus]\nLet the music play\nI just wanna dance the night away\nYeah right here, right here, where I'm gonna stay\nAll night long\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh-wee!\nLet the music play on\nJust until I feel this misery is gone\nMovin', kickin', groovin'\nKeep the music strong\nOn and on and on, and on and on and on\nAnd on and on and on and on, and on and on and on...\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm out here dancing, and still - huh!\nI can't erase the things I feel\nThe tender love we used to share\nSeems it like it's no longer there\nI, I've got to hide what's killing me inside\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nLet the music play\nI just want to dance the night away\nYeah right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay\nAll night long\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh!\nLet the music play on\nJust

on...\n\n[Verse 2]\nI think I'm gonna be alright - ha ha ha\nIf I can make it through the night, oh Lord\nI'll just pretend she's here with me\nI'll close my eyes, her face I'll see\n(Won't somebody help me?)\nI know it's make believe, but it's the only hope for me\n\n[Chorus]\nLet the music play\nOh, I just wanna dance the night away\nHere, right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay\nAll night long\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh-wee!\nLet the music play on\nJust until I feel this misery is gone\nOh, movin', kickin', groovin'\nKeep the music strong\nOh, let it play...\n[Bridge, spoken]\nBaby, you want to see me laugh\nAnd then you know, that it's only you that I love\nI'm not out here looking for a one-night affair\nIt is just that I'm\u2013 that I'm so hurt inside\nThat all I wanna do is just dance, dance, dance...\n\n[Chorus]\nLet the music play\nI just wanna dance the night away\nOh, here, right here is where I'm gonna stay\nAll night long\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh-wee!\nLet the music play

Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?\n\n\u2014Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?\n\n\u2014Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.\n\n\u2014What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane\u2014old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him\u2014lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.\n\u2014Circumcised? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.\n\n\u2014That the lay you're on now? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?\n\nFor nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.\n\u2014Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Not taking anything between drinks, says I.\n\n\u2014What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.\n\n\u2014Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.\n\n\u2014Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.\n\n\u2014Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?\n\u2014Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.\n\n\u2014-What was that, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.\n\nSo we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.\n\nIn Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.\n\nAnd there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.\n\nI dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!\n\nAnd by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.\n\nSo we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.\n\n\u2014There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.\n\nThe bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.\n\n\u2014Stand and deliver, says he.\n\n\u2014That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.\n\u2014Pass, friends, says he.\n\nThen he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:\n\n\u2014What's your opinion of the times?\n\nDoing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.\n\n\u2014I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.\n\nSo begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:\n\n\u2014Foreign wars is the cause of it.\n\nAnd says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:\n\n\u2014It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.\n\n\u2014Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.\n\n\u2014Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Wine of the country, says he.\n\n\u2014What's yours? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.\n\n\u2014Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.\n\n\u2014Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?\n\nAnd with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.\n\nThe figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.\n\nHe wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S. Fursa, S. Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn't, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L. Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W. Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O'Sullivan Beare. A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.\n\nSo anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.\n\n\u2014And there's more where that came from, says he.\n\n\u2014Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.\n\n\u2014I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.\n\nWho comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.\n\n\u2014For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.\n\nAnd he starts reading them out:\n\n\u2014Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...\n\n\u2014I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.\n\n\u2014Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, honourable person.\n\n\u2014Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.\n\nAh! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.\n\nAnd lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.\n\nLittle Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.\n\n\u2014Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...\n\nAnd he doubled up.\n\n\u2014Take a what? says I.\n\n\u2014Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.\n\n\u2014O hell! says I.\n\nThe bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.\n\n\u2014Bi i dho husht, says he.\n\n\u2014Who? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.\n\n\u2014When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...\n\nAnd he started laughing.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?\n\n\u2014Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.\n\nTerence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.\n\nThen did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.\n\nBut he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.\n\n\u2014What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.\n\nSo he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.\n\n\u2014Are you codding? says I.\n\n\u2014Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.\n\nSo Joe took up the letters.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.\n\nSo I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:\n\n\u2014How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?\n\n\u2014I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...\n\n\u2014You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?\n\n\u2014With Dignam, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is it Paddy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Why?\n\n\u2014Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.\n\n\u2014Who's dead? says Bob Doran.\n\n\u2014You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?\n\n\u2014What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?\n\n\u2014Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.\n\n\u2014Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\n\n\u2014Paddy? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says Alf.\n\nBegob he was what you might call flabbergasted.\n\nIn the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.\n\nAssurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.\n\nHe is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.\n\n\u2014There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.\n\nAnd, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.\n\nLittle Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.\n\nAnd says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:\n\n\u2014Who said Christ is good?\n\n\u2014I beg your parsnips, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.\n\nBut Bob Doran shouts out of him.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.\n\nTerry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.\n\n\u2014The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.\n\nThe tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.\n\n\u2014The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.\n\nAnd mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.\n\nOld Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.\n\n\u2014Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.\n\nSo Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.\n\n\u2014O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?\n\nAnd he starts reading out one.\n\n7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.\n\nHonoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...\n\n\u2014Show us, Joe, says I.\n\n\u2014... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...\n\n\u2014Jesus, says I.\n\n\u2014... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...\n\nThe citizen made a grab at the letter.\n\n\u2014Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.\nH. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.\n\n\u2014And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?\n\nSo they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.\n\n\u2014Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.\n\nAnd Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.\n\n\u2014They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.\n\nAnd he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.\n\nIn the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.\n\nSo they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.\n\n\u2014There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.\n\n\u2014That so? says Joe.\n\n\u2014God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in\n\nKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.\n\n\u2014Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.\n\n\u2014That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...\n\nAnd then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.\n\nThe distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.\n\nSo of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:\n\n\u2014Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!\n\nArrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.\n\nAnd the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b\u00e9zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!\n\n\u2014The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...\n\n\u2014Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.\n\nThe last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petit\u00e9patant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Vir\u00e1ga Kis\u00e1szony Putr\u00e1pesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.\n\nQuietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate\u2014short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fianc\u00e9e an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:\n\n\u2014God blimey if she ain't a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.\n\nSo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.\n\nSo howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.\n\n\u2014Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.\n\n\u2014No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.\n\nSo he calls the old dog over.\n\n\u2014What's on you, Garry? says he.\n\nThen he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.\n\nAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.\n\nThe curse of my curses\nSeven days every day\nAnd seven dry Thursdays\nOn you, Barney Kiernan,\nHas no sup of water\nTo cool my courage,\nAnd my guts red roaring\nAfter Lowry's lights.\n\nSo he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling.\n\nGob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:\n\n\u2014Could you make a hole in another pint?\n\n\u2014Could a swim duck? says I.\n\n\u2014Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.\n\n\u2014Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.\n\n\u2014Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?\n\n\u2014Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.\n\n\u2014Whose admirers? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.\n\nThen he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.\n\nSo Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.\n\n\u2014Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.\n\n\u2014No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.\n\n\u2014Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.\n\nAnd off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.\n\nSo Terry brought the three pints.\n\n\u2014Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.\n\n\u2014Slan leat, says he.\n\n\u2014Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.\n\nGob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.\n\n\u2014Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Friend of yours, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?\n\n\u2014I won't mention any names, says Alf.\n\n\u2014I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.\n\n\u2014Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.\n\nSo Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.\n\nGa Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.\n\n\u2014Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.\n\n\u2014Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.\n\n\u2014Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.\n\n\u2014That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?\n\n\u2014Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?\n\nMr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.\n\nMr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?\n\nMr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)\n\nMr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.\n\nMr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.\n\n(Ironical opposition cheers.)\n\nThe speaker: Order! Order!\n\n(The house rises. Cheers.)\n\n\u2014There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?\n\n\u2014Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.\n\n\u2014Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.\n\n\u2014Is that really a fact? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?\n\nSo off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.\n\nA most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.\n\nAmongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.\n\n\u2014Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?\n\n\u2014No, says Joe.\n\n\u2014I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Who? Blazes? says Joe.\n\nAnd says Bloom:\n\n\u2014What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.\n\n\u2014Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.\n\n\u2014We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.\n\n\u2014-True for you, says Joe.\n\nAnd Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:\n\n\u2014Now, don't you think, Bergan?\n\n\u2014Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.\n\nIt was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.\n\n\u2014He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north.\n\n\u2014He is, says Joe. Isn't he?\n\n\u2014Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.\n\n\u2014Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.\n\n\u2014My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.\n\nHe's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.\n\nHoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.\n\nPride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.\n\nAnd lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.\n\n\u2014Hello, Ned.\n\n\u2014Hello, Alf.\n\n\u2014Hello, Jack.\n\n\u2014Hello, Joe.\n\n\u2014God save you, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?\n\n\u2014Half one, says Ned.\n\nSo J. J. ordered the drinks.\n\n\u2014Were you round at the court? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.\n\n\u2014Hope so, says Ned.\n\nNow what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.\n\n\u2014Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.\n\n\u2014Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.\n\n\u2014Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.\n\n\u2014Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.\n\n\u2014Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.\n\n\u2014Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.\n\n\u2014Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.\n\n\u2014Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.\n\n\u2014How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...\n\n\u2014Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh.\n\n\u2014Nor good red herring, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.\n\nBegob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.\n\n\u2014And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.\n\nSix and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.\n\n\u2014Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Good health, Ned, says J. J.\n\n\u2014-There he is again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Where? says Alf.\n\nAnd begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.\n\n\u2014How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Remanded, says J. J.\n\nOne of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.\n\n\u2014Who tried the case? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Recorder, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.\n\n\u2014Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.\n\nAnd he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:\n\n\u2014A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?\n\n\u2014Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.\n\n\u2014And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.\n\nAnd whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.\n\n\u2014Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.\n\nSo Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.\n\n\u2014Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret.\n\n\u2014Rely on me, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.\n\n\u2014O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see.\n\n\u2014Consider that done, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Very kind of you, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.\n\n\u2014Decree nisi, says J. J.\n\nAnd Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.\n\n\u2014A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.\n\n\u2014And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.\n\n\u2014Give us a squint at her, says I.\n\nAnd what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.\n\n\u2014O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!\n\n\u2014There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?\n\nSo anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.\n\n\u2014Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?\n\nO'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.\n\n\u2014It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.\n\nSo J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.\n\n\u2014Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.\n\n\u2014The European family, says J. J....\n\n\u2014They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d'aisance.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\n\nAnd says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!\n\nHe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.\n\n\u2014What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.\n\n\u2014Gold cup, says he.\n\n\u2014Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.\n\n\u2014And Bass's mare? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.\n\n\u2014I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.\n\n\u2014Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.\n\nSo he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.\n\n\u2014Not there, my child, says he.\n\n\u2014Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog.\n\nAnd J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.\n\n\u2014Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.\n\n\u2014Raimeis, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?\n\n\u2014As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's...\n\n\u2014Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.\n\n\u2014Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.\n\nThe fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.\n\n\u2014And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.\n\n\u2014And will again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.\n\nAnd he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.\n\n\u2014Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?\n\n\u2014An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.\n\n\u2014Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.\n\nHanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.\n\n\u2014But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?\n\n\u2014I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.\n\nSo he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.\n\n\u2014A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the breech.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\n\nThen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.\n\n\u2014That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.\n\nThe fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.\n\n\u2014On which the sun never rises, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it.\n\nThey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.\n\n\u2014But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?\n\nDidn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.\n\n\u2014We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.\n\n\u2014Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...\n\n\u2014We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.\n\n\u2014Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?\n\n\u2014The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Fran\u00e7ais, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.\n\n\u2014And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?\n\nJesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.\n\n\u2014Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!\n\n\u2014And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.\n\n\u2014They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.\n\nAnd says J. J.:\n\n\u2014Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.\n\n\u2014Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says he. I will.\n\n\u2014You? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.\n\n\u2014Repeat that dose, says Joe.\n\nBloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.\n\n\u2014Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.\n\n\u2014But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014What is it? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.\n\n\u2014By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm living in the same place for the past five years.\n\nSo of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:\n\n\u2014Or also living in different places.\n\n\u2014That covers my case, says Joe.\n\n\u2014What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.\n\nThe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\n\n\u2014After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.\n\n\u2014Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.\n\nThe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's Cave\u2014all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.\n\n\u2014Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?\n\n\u2014That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.\n\n\u2014And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.\n\nGob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.\n\n\u2014Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.\n\n\u2014Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.\n\nThat's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.\n\n\u2014But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.\n\nWho's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.\n\n\u2014A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.\n\n\u2014Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.\n\n\u2014That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.\n\nLove loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.\n\n\u2014Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.\n\n\u2014Hurrah, there, says Joe.\n\n\u2014The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.\n\nAnd he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.\n\n\u2014We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\nSo the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:\n\n\u2014A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.\n\n\u2014Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.\n\n\u2014Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.\n\n\u2014Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P.\n\n\u2014And a very good initial too, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's this his name is?\n\n\u2014Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.\n\n\u2014Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.\n\n\u2014I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels.\n\n\u2014Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?\n\n\u2014That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.\n\n\u2014There you are, says Terry.\n\nGoodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.\n\nSo anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one.\n\n\u2014Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.\n\nSure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense.\n\nOur travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.\n\n\u2014Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!\n\nSo saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.\n\nMine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.\n\n\u2014Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.\n\n\u2014Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.\n\n\u2014Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.\n\n\u2014How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?\n\nAn instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.\n\n\u2014Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.\n\n\u2014Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?\n\nMine host bowed again as he made answer:\n\n\u2014What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?\n\n\u2014Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!\n\n\u2014Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.\n\nSo in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.\n\n\u2014Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.\n\n\u2014Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?\n\n\u2014That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.\n\n\u2014Who made those allegations? says Alf.\n\n\u2014I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.\n\n\u2014And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow?\n\n\u2014Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.\n\n\u2014Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.\n\n\u2014Who is Junius? says J. J.\n\n\u2014We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.\n\n\u2014He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.\n\n\u2014Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.\n\n\u2014That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!\n\n\u2014Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he's a father or a mother.\n\n\u2014Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.\n\n\u2014O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.\n\n\u2014En ventre sa m\u00e8re, says J. J.\n\n\u2014Do you call that a man? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014And who does he suspect? says the citizen.\n\nGob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.\n\n\u2014Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.\n\n\u2014A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.\n\n\u2014Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.\n\n\u2014Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.\n\n\u2014You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.\n\n\u2014Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.\n\n\u2014Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.\n\n\u2014Amen, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And I'm sure He will, says Joe.\n\nAnd at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S. Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S. Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge, illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.\n\n\u2014Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.\n\n\u2014Qui fecit coelum et terram.\n\n\u2014Dominus vobiscum.\n\n\u2014Et cum spiritu tuo.\n\nAnd he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:\n\n\u2014Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum.\n\n\u2014And so say all of us, says Jack.\n\n\u2014Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.\n\n\u2014Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.\n\nI was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.\n\n\u2014I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I'm not...\n\n\u2014No, says Martin, we're ready.\n\nCourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,\n\n\u2014Beg your pardon, says he.\n\n\u2014Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a secret.\n\nAnd the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.\n\n\u2014Bye bye all, says Martin.\n\nAnd he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.\n\n\u2014-Off with you, says\n\nMartin to the jarvey.\n\nThe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.\n\nBut begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.\n\n\u2014Let me alone, says he.\n\nAnd begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:\n\n\u2014Three cheers for Israel!\n\nArrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.\n\nAnd all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:\n\n\u2014Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!\n\nAnd says he:\n\n\u2014Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.\n\n\u2014He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.\n\n\u2014Whose God? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.\n\nGob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.\n\n\u2014By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.\n\nBy Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.\n\n\u2014Stop! Stop! says Joe.\n\nA large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great \u00e9clat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakoczsy's March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra, kedves bar\u00e1ton! Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra! Gone but not forgotten.\n\nGob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre:\n\n\u2014Where is he till I murder him?\n\nAnd Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.\n\n\u2014Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.\n\nBut as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other way and off with him.\n\n\u2014Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!\n\nBegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.\n\nThe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of d\u00e9bris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F. R. C. S. I.\n\nYou never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him.\n\n\u2014Did I kill him, says he, or what?\n\nAnd he shouting to the bloody dog:\n\n\u2014After him, Garry! After him, boy!\n\nAnd the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.\n\nWhen, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai! And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/915082", "artist_names": "Jim Gilstrap", "full_title": "Swing Your Daddy by\u00a0Jim\u00a0Gilstrap",

lazy\nNot much meat on my bones and a whole lot alone\nAnd more than a little bit crazy\nThe old six string was all I had\nTo keep my belly still\nAnd for each full hour lesson I gave\nI got a crisp ten dollar bill\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe was married for seven years\nTo a concrete castle king\nShe said she wanted to learn to play the guitar\nAnd to hear her children sing\nSo I'd show up about once a week\nIn my faded tight-legged jeans\nWith a backlog full of hobo stories\nAnd dilapidated dreams\n[Chorus]\nShe said, \"I wanna learn a love song\nFull of happy things\"\nShe said, \"I wanna learn a love song\nWon't you let me hear you sing?\"\nShe said, \"I wanna learn a love song\nI wanna hear you play\"\nShe said, \"I wanna learn a love song\nBefore you go away\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo I tried to teach her a couple of chords\nAnd an easy melody\nBut it always turned out she'd rather listen\nTo my guitar and me\nI could hear her old man laughing in the den\nPlaying stud poker with the boys\nWhile I sang so soft in the living room\nToo scared to make much noise\n\n[Verse 4]\nI came one week, the den was dark\nAnd she met me at the door\nAnd we sat on the couch and we sang and talked\n'Til I could not sing no more\nThe silence kept on building\nHer eyes grew much too wide\nAnd I could hear both of our heartbeats\nBut there was no place to hide\nYou might also

Hollywood movie\nOr living out a good bad dream\nAnd all them pin-up girls in that tinsel world\nNever touched me like she can\nIt took another man's wife in the real world life\nTo make this boy a man\n\n[Chorus]\nShe said, \"I wanna learn a love song\nFull of happy things\"\nShe said, \"I wanna learn a love song\nWon't you let me hear you sing?\"\nShe said, \"I wanna learn a love song\nI wanna

circus\nAll of the ups and downs of a carousel\nThat I know so well\nLife is a three ring circus\nJust one little ride on a merry-go-round\nGoin' round and round and round and round and round\n\nHe does the best like the minstrels did\nJust to please the kids and keep the people laughing\nBut no one knows that beneath the clothes\nAnd his turned up nose lives a lonely beggar\n\nHe needs the love he spreads around\nBut in life he's just a clown\nTill they bring the curtain down\n\nLife is a three ring circus\nAll of the ups and downs of a carousel\nThat I know so well\n\nLife is a three ring circus\nJust one little ride on a merry-go-round\nGoin' round and round and round and round and round\n\nHe needs the love that can't be found\nBut you're just too blind to see\nThat the clown is really needy\n\nLife is a three ring circus\nAll of the ups and downs of a carousel\nThat I know so well\nYou might also likeLife is a three ring circus\nJust one little ride on a
