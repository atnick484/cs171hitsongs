thought I was tough\nShe's strong, pushes on, can't slow her down\nShe can take anything life dishes out\nThere was a time\nBack before she was mine\nWhen I thought I was tough\n\nWe sat there five years ago\nThe doctors let us know, the test showed\nShe'd have to fight to live, I broke down and cried\n\nShe held me and said it's gonna be alright\nShe wore that wig to church\nPink ribbon pinned there on her shirt\nNo room for fear, full of faith\nHands held high singing Amazing Grace\nNever once complained, refusing to give up\nAnd I thought I was tough\n\nShe's strong, pushes on, can't slow her down\nShe can take anything life dishes out\nThere was a time\nBack before she was mine\nWhen I thought I was tough\n\nShe's a gentle word, the sweetest kiss\nA velvet touch against my skin\nI've

picked to play the game\nBut when your name was called, you found a place to hide\nWhen you knew that I was always on your side\n\n[Verse 2: Sting]\nEverything was easy then, so sweet and innocent\nBut my demons and my angels reappeared\nLeavin' only traces of the man you thought I'd be\nToo afraid to hear the words I'd always feared\nLeavin' you with only questions all these years\n[Chorus: Sheryl Crow & Sting, Sheryl Crow]\nBut is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear?\nEasy to start over with the ones you hold so dear\nOr are you left to wonder, all alone eternally?\nThis isn't how it's really meant to be\nNo, it isn't how it's really meant to be\n\n[Verse 3: Sheryl Crow, (Sting), Sheryl Crow & Sting]\nWell, they say that love is in the air (Love is in the air), never is it clear\nHow to pull it close and make it stay\nWell, butterflies are free to fly, and so they fly away\nAnd I'm left to carry on and wonder why\nEven through it all, I'm always on your side\n\n[Chorus: Sheryl Crow & Sting, Sting]\nBut is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear?\nEasy to start over with the ones you hold so dear\nOr are you left to wonder, all alone, eternally?\nThis isn't how it's really meant to be\nNo, it isn't how it's really meant to be\n\n[Verse 4: Sting, Sheryl Crow, Sheryl Crow & Sting]\nWell, they say that love is in the air, never is it clear\nHow to pull it close and make it stay\nIf butterflies are free to fly, why do they fly away?\nLeavin' me to carry on and wonder why\nWas it you that kept me wandering

watch him when she had to work late\nAnd we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed\nSince I don't know when\n\"Hey Jude\" was his favorite song\nAt dinner he'd ask to pray\nAnd then he'd pray for everybody

jail 'cause them years'll cost me\nDon't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me\nI'd rather just sit back and roll a Dutch\nThink about how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch\nThink about how I'ma get the 'caine over customs\nNever underestimate niggas or over-trust them, uh\nYeah, them Ms is right in my face\nI just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace\nIf it don't jam, the TEC will spray\nWhen I spit, everybody gotta split like pepper spray\n'Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle\nAnd I'm a man of the Lord, but I still can't shake the devil\nMoved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what?\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\nThe time to talk is up, so bring the heat, playtime is over\nWhile you're runnin' your mouth, I'm creepin' up over your shoulder\nA gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on\nCall my bluff, start acting up and I'll leave you underground\n\n[Verse 2: Jadakiss]\nI know how to get my peers off me\nMake 'em cry and die from high blood pressure 'cause tears are salty\nIt's a symptom if you bobbing your head, you know that he's sick\nYou know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip\nWhen I get it, you already know I'm throwing them bricks\nPutting purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwing them nicks\nThat's right, homie, you can't move me\nI ain't going nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies\nAll you shooting is the breeze, a bootleg Uzi\nI'm just waiting on a Q like Suzie, don't lose me\nThese penitentiary chances that I take\nShould be able to get the mansion by the lake\nBut I invest my bread into something else\nInto something else that'll make something melt\nYou just got to feel the kid\nIf not rap, for the fact of how real he is, what up?\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\nThe time to talk is up, so bring the heat, playtime is over\nWhile you're runnin' your mouth, I'm creepin' up over your shoulder\nA gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on\nCall my bluff, start acting up and I'll leave you

chase the book with the documentary\nIf you can't do nothing other than flow\nLife's a bitch like the mother from Blow, let's go\nDon't make me put your heart in your lap\nFuck riding the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track\nHop out looking crispy, fresh and new\nIn the six, but it's a BM and it's Pepsi blue\nAnd, I don't know you\nBut I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through\nY'all ain't fuckin' with Jason\nAfter I cash in, there's really no justification\nOf how I'm gon' change the game, so don't get out of line\n'Cause this little nine will change your frame,

to be a girl\nI tried to be a mess\nI tried to be the best\nI guess I did it wrong\nIt's why I wrote this song\nThis type of modern life, is it for me?\nThis type of modern life, is it for free?\n[Verse 2]\nSo, I went into a bar\nLooking for sympathy\nA little company\nI tried to find a friend\nIt's more easily said\nIt's always been the same\nThis type of modern life, is not for me\nThis type of modern life, is not for free\n\n[Chorus]\nAmerican life (American life)\nI live the American Dream (American Dream)\nYou are the best thing I've seen\nYou are not just a dream (American life)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI tried to stay ahead\nI tried to stay on top\nI tried to play the part\nBut somehow I forgot\nJust what I did it for\nAnd why I wanted more\nThis type of modern life, is it for me?\nThis type of modern life, is it for free?\nYou might also like[Refrain]\nDo I have to change my name?\nWill it get me far?\nShould I lose some weight?\nAm I gonna be a

boy\nTried to be a girl\nTried to be a mess\nTried to be the best\nTried to find a friend\nTried to stay ahead\nI tried to stay on top\nFuck it\n\n[Refrain]\nDo I have to change my name?\nWill it get me far?\nShould I lose some weight?\nAm I gonna be a star?\n[Break]\nAh, fuck it\nAh, fuck it\nA- fuck it\nA- fuck it\n\n[Verse 5]\nI'm drinking a soy latte, I get a double shot\u00e9\nIt goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied\nI drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-duper\nYo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied\nI do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties\nSo I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied\nI'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysics shit is dope\nAnd if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied\nI got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef\nThree nannies, an assistant, and a driver and a jet\nA trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard or five\nA gardener and a stylist, do you think I'm satisfied?\nI'd like to express my extreme point of view\nI'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew\nI'm just living out the American dream\nAnd I just realized that nothing is what it seems\n\n[Outro]\nDo I have to change my name?

won't stare)\nCuz all I need is you (All I need, all I need baby)\n[Talking: Fat Joe]\nTo all the ladies in our lives, you heard\nStrong independent women, come on\nYea, huh\n\n[Verse 1: Fat Joe]\nWhat you think gangstas don't cry get hurt by lies\nTimes you embarrassed me I swallowed my pride\nI'm tired of telling you I got nothing to hide\nI'm in the studio at night you think I'm out with the guys\nEvery time I speak to you you got something to say\nAccording to you I'mma speed crushing all day\nAll I'm askin you for is to be more trusting\nI'm outta town all the time and don't accuse you of nothing\nPicture me creepin with a chick on tour\nWhen you love my son as if it was yours\nI know at times you feel alone cuz I'm not at home\nThat's why every few hours I pick up the phone\nTo reassure you my love is more then a scene\nI adore you my wife my Colombian queen\nI promise to never stray I'm on it everyday\nTo have a woman like you in the life of Jose (Hey)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Armageddon]\nYea how I'm supposed to start this\nFirst and first you my queen goddess\nMy moon my earth the wisdom to a nigga's knowledge\nI swear to god it amazes me how you stay in college\nAnd still manage to raise my baby boy when I'm gone and\nTouring making dollars assuming that I love you or regardless\nI feel its time I showed you bless you with this ring, now that's\nSomething to hold you down till a nigga come back\nMe and my lady got history this worth she deserves\nMore then this cold world is giving me to share with her word\nAnd I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl)\nNot myself no one else just my girl (my girl)\nYou bring life to my world you give me strength to go on\nAnd face life even when it seems all holes gone\nLabeled my wife but you truly exceed the title\nYou my future my happiness my heart my idol\nI promise girl, that\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Talking: Fat Joe]\nHaha\nThis is going out to you, you and you and you\n\n[Verse 3: Fat Joe]\nTo all the ladies out there if you love your man\nYou need to hold your man embrace your man\nAnd just grab his hand repeat after me\nI promise to stay true and give you all of me\nWhether he's locked down or on the grind\nOr whether is out of work or at work on time\nYou need to trust that man and respect that man\nAnd you get what you feel you deserve from that man, and\n\n[Tony Sunshine]\nCuz I need somebody who will stand by me\nThrough the good times and bad times who will always...\nAlways be my girl\n\n[Hook] - repeat 2X1Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

again, I find myself with my friends\nDancin' the night away, it's like the party never ends\nThen again we don't want it to stop\n'Cause tonight's the night\nIt goes sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights\nWild cards, men from Mars, dressed in stars and stripes\n(Eclectic electric, ladies of the evenin', drinkin' booze and minglin')\nMashin' to the music, I can do anything\nFreaky dicky star speckles and pink butterflies\nAnd life is nice, so nice\nI walk into a club and I've found paradise\nI'm seein' stars, I can't believe my eyes (I'm seein' stars)\n[Chorus]\nOh my, starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise\nDance all night, we gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ\nAh sugar, dance all night to this DJ\nOh my, starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise\nDance all night, we gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ\nAh sugar, dance all night to this DJ\nDance all night to this DJ, ya luvva dance all night to this DJ\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow the record always spins on the trails we blaze\nThe walls are closin' in, but that's okay\n'Cause I've been waitin' all week to feel this way\nAnd it feels so good, so good, I'm on top of the world\nThe coolest kid in the neighborhood\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo let me be your star for one night that's right\nSweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights\nYou've got to feel the rush, feel the spice of life\nLove-life, Shifty rolls the dice, snake eyes surprise\nIcein', mesmerizin' the minds are sick ones\n'Cause what we are, is victims of fun\nCome on, come on, the fun is just begun\nCome on the fun is just begun\nYou might

Much like the evolution of the video game console, your life also evolves and expands and adds new dimensions as time passes and technology progresses. Consider high school to be, say, Sega Genesis: the world is two dimensional and linear, the scenery is, by and large, pleasant enough to lull you into wanting to go through the levels and have as much fun as possible. The controls are simple enough to make you feel like you\u2019re actually going somewhere (even if it\u2019s just a total of four directions). Finally, after fighting the final boss, you have beaten the game at last.\nCongratulations. Enjoy the ending credits.\nTime passes. More games come out, more systems come out, and technology evolves alongside society. You watch yourself change, as you watch the people around you and the rest of the world change too. Your life now is Playstation 3. The world has become mind-bogglingly detail-orientated, the scenery is vast and seemingly infinite, and the controls are bigger and have way more buttons. Some controllers aren\u2019t even traditional controllers; they\u2019re designed to operate like light guns, steering wheels and toy guitars. In half of these new games, these new adaptations are really the only way to play.\n\n\u201cAfter working so hard to master four basic directions, I can now control the entire world I\u2019ve been living in up to until now\u2026 with a guitar?\u201d\nAbsolutely.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the multiplayer aspect\u2026 on crack. Specifically, you\u2019re no longer playing by yourself or with one other person. You\u2019re online with everyone else, and even if you\u2019re not, the globe is still turning. What was once a nerd\u2019s individual fantasy is now a multi-billion dollar industry. The dimensions have been expanded and now your awareness must evolve in order to compensate. Millions of other people are constantly beginning and ending new quests (some of them dying along the way), and there really isn\u2019t any way to pause\u2026 unless you find a quiet spot and isolate yourself from townsfolk and aggressive mobs alike.\n\nSimply put, the world is full of opportunities.\n\nBut the thing is, in this game, the evil boss has already won and the few superheroes left aren\u2019t the most powerful people on Earth. The game of life here is about business first and enjoying the fruits of your labor last, if at all. The long-time wealthy have most of the money and all of the political power, which is a stage show featuring revolving characters designed to act out ever-shifting balances of power and progression on various issues. It\u2019s really just a distraction from the real problem: The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. That will never change, as long as there are people in the world willing to be mercenaries for hire to protect the ruling elite from a violent uprising (police, army, judges, etc.). So with revolution not currently an option, we must make the best of a shitty situation. In this country, however, the best of a shitty situation can still be pretty sweet. In order to get there, you need to know what you\u2019re up against. There are billions of people in developing countries who grew up starving and living in houses with dirt floors, who now have the ability to go to college to study math, science, medicine, electronics, computer technology, and a variety of different kinds of engineering. America isn\u2019t even graduating enough engineers to fill the job openings they soon will have available, with so many baby boomers about to retire. If you expect an easy life to be handed to you the way your parents or older cousins had it, you may be gravely disappointed. You\u2019re going to have to work hard to build a life for yourself. But if you\u2019re going to work hard, you might as well work hard at something that gets you where you want to be in life. So, let\u2019s figure out how to get there.\n\nMost young people have influences in their lives pushing them in some direction, to be a certain way. For example, Dad wants you to join him in the family business, Grandma wants you to go to college, and your brother is having fun in the army\u2026 But the world is enormous and there is so much out there to do that most of us haven\u2019t even imagined yet, let alone gotten to experience. Let\u2019s pretend that your parents always shopped at a grocery store that sold only Coke. You would be comfortable and used to a lifestyle of drinking only Coke. In this example, Coke can represent any established routine reaction or attitude that was taught to you. Coke represents tradition. But as you know, there are more flavors than just Coke. There\u2019s more to drink than even just soda. Other aspects of life are just as dynamic. Don\u2019t be afraid to question anything\u2014whether it\u2019s your beliefs, your religion, your priorities, what you value, or anything else that you might follow, simply because someone once told you it was right. How do you know if Coke is really what you want out of life, if that\u2019s all you know?\nEven the wisest and most well-read teenagers are still very sheltered (for better or worse) from what else is out there. For a lot of people, that\u2019s just fine. Who cares about knowing everything? Well, you should. This is the age of information. Knowledge is the weapon of choice and will be what separates the greats from the struggling. For a lot of you, there may be backlash within your family or social network for being curious, for looking outside your culture\u2019s traditions. Fuck tradition. It\u2019s not easy to go against the wishes of those you love, but if the right choice wasn\u2019t worth it in the end, it wouldn\u2019t be called the right choice. You may feel alone but many people are going through this. Seek them out so you can support one another.\nOpen-Mindedness\n\n\u201cWhy should I? Everything is just fine as it is.\u201d\n\nThink of politics and religions as the popular kids in high school. One year they\u2019re wearing the new Air Jordan shoes and telling everyone how dope that one song by The Black Eyed Peas is. Everyone else copies them and thinks The Black Eyed Peas is the greatest band on earth. Time goes by and people get really tired of The Black Eyed Peas, and now everyone is wearing Converse. If that popular kid is still bumping that same Black Eyed Peas song and wearing his old kicks, he\u2019s going to look like a loser and people won\u2019t follow him. To keep things fresh (so people stay interested), he ditches the Black Eyed Peas first, before anyone else, and starts promoting Lady Gaga. Now he\u2019s sporting Skechers and people are still listening and watching him. By adapting, he\u2019s maintained his popularity and influence over people. What about you? What if you refuse to adapt, and since middle school all you\u2019ve been listening to is LL Cool J and you\u2019re still wearing high-tops with lights in them? How well will you survive in the world that can no longer relate to you? Would you perhaps feel abandoned or even betrayed by what originally got you to support these things so much? This is why solid belief systems fail. To thrive is to survive. Religions, governments, and all other dictators of morality have to adapt and keep current in order to thrive. So do you.\n\nThe real world is changing too, with or without your participation. The entire world is now the big melting pot, not just the United States anymore. If a living organism cannot or refuses to adapt to its environment, it will die out. Look up the Red Queen hypothesis. That applies not just biologically to living beings, but it\u2019s even more apparent and rapid in the social forum. It must\u2019ve been a big culture shock for a man in the early 1900s to grow up around wives being beaten with sticks and then suddenly voting alongside them. As his golden years settled in, he got to witness his grandchildren doing drugs and sharing \u201cfree love\u201d during the 60s. You can bet that didn\u2019t go over well with a lot of older Americans, who were deeply rooted in Christian tradition. An unwillingness for people to adapt to  their surroundings often brings about a greater misery than one would experience if they just decided to see what\u2019s around them as acceptable, whether they participate actively or not.\n\nOf course, the line must be drawn somewhere, but it\u2019s curious how the line keeps getting pushed further and further forward as time goes on.\n\nThere are so many things going on in the world. Each country and culture faces its own unique set of problems and struggles for power. It can all be very confusing and frustrating, so it\u2019s often easier to look to leadership to make decisions for us, instead of trying to weigh each issue ourselves. The easy way is rarely if ever the best way, but after working a 50 hour week to just barely survive, who has the time and energy to think (let alone think clearly)? Not many of us can do both\u2026 which is why hard work is part of the design. Now, what happens when the leadership we look to changes their minds, like the popular kid in school moving onto the next big thing? Science, government, and religion all make attempts to adapt to the ever-changing world (except for the extremists). Adaptations in government and religion are based on public opinion, so they can always remain popular and in control. Examples include governments extending rights to women, immigrants, and laborers, changing attitudes towards other countries, and amending controversial laws (abortion, gay marriage, drugs, etc.). They sure didn\u2019t want to do any of it, and certainly didn\u2019t agree ideologically with it, but many labor strikes, demonstrations and movements pressured the politicians to give the people what they wanted. Slavery wasn\u2019t ended because it was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d; it was ended because more soldiers were needed to fight in the Civil War. The Catholic Church has amended its stances on contraception and consequences for queer behavior, to remain aligned with the growing sympathetic feelings towards these issues by the public.  You used to get burned alive for such things, remember? Governments and religions never admit to being wrong, cruel, or shortsighted. They don\u2019t change because they discover a better idea. There have always been better ideas out there. They only change when their survival requires it. Why do they wait so long?\n\nIf you believe in political or religious institutions dictating to you what is right and wrong, important and useless, proper and obscene, how do you react when they change their minds? Why do they change their minds, if the whole time they said they knew what was best? Suddenly something else becomes best, and NOW they know what\u2019s best, once and for all? Doubtful. It\u2019s just a way to control your mind so you don\u2019t realize how badly you\u2019re being fucked over.\nReligion and government are mentioned separately, but they are two sides of the same coin, which forever has been a partnership, recognized on some legal levels and completely elusive on others. The truth is, Church and State are not at all separate. They work together, which is why religious institutions do not have to pay any taxes. There are many examples of this easily seen, but it\u2019s so normal, many people do not even realize what is happening. For example, a preacher is required to marry people, even atheists. You must swear on a Bible when under oath in a courtroom, as if that still means something. Politicians utter, \u201cGod bless America\u201d as if we\u2019re totally fucked beyond repair without some sort of divine intervention. If God is handing out blessings, it seems like America already got more than its fair share, being the top economy and having one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, no? But when politicians are speaking about foreign policy, they never seem to mention, \u201cGod bless Iceland\u201d or \u201cGod bless the Northwest Territories through another harsh winter blizzard.\u201d No, he\u2019s always our God, and apparently has only a limited amount of blessings and we need them all. If God gave his blessings out to everyone, they wouldn\u2019t be blessings anymore. They\u2019d lose their value. But really, if God was so easily controlled, like a claw machine at a cheap diner, and all it took was a public figure to make a request for a blessing in order to actually get one, how much value or impact could that blessing possibly have in our lives? Probably nothing more than what you could actually get out of one of those claw machines. The truth is, several conflicts of opinion are created intentionally to keep people arguing and fighting over insignificant things so they can\u2019t stay focused on what really matters (i.e. not just free health care, but actual cures instead of medications that only mask symptoms).\n\n\u201cOk fine, I sort of get it, but what is being open-minded then and how do I do it?\u201d\n\nTo become open-minded, you must first be aware of what the difference is. Essentially, it is a structure for world views and beliefs. A person who is open-minded constantly seeks and considers new information, scientific developments, and alternative perspectives\u2013 such as how you think of your role as a human being on planet Earth, how you view the world as both a home for humans and as a living being itself, and what, if any, superstitions, myths, or religious teachings hold any value in following. To a degree, the popular kid in high school was the open-minded one, who wasn\u2019t afraid to take a chance on something new. Open-mindedness is often found in people who are interested in philosophy, sociology, and music (though there are people in every area of life who act like they know it all). An open-minded person understands that his or her beliefs are just ideas, and that there\u2019s no real way to prove most of them. Open-minded people are willing to accept others\u2019 differences of opinion and preference. Above all, they seek to learn as much as possible and continue to grow. People who are not open-minded believe they have all the answers, that their way is the right way (and the only right way), and that their way of life is under constant threat from those who are different. People who follow this sort of short-sightedness are the religious, traditional, and simple-minded individuals who make up the mass population.\n\nThere is a conflict between members of both ideologies. A close-minded individual has been taught from a young age what to believe, what is important, what is justice, and the consequences for having a different opinion (which are usually severe). It is an entire culture that follows the idea, \u201cChange is scary; if everything stays the same, we\u2019ll all be okay.\u201d The downfall is that if everything stays the same, we all decay. It is an emotional wish for simplicity, but the reality is that energy is always transforming and that in itself is what life is\u2026 the adapting, the changing, the transforming. Without it, in a way you are already dead. It might be possible to socially stay still, if every single person in the planet wanted the same things out of life, but that\u2019s impossible. Even if you conquer a country\u2019s control and currency, you can never stamp out the imaginations of the entire human population. You might as well begin to learn acceptance.\n\nTo be open-minded is to consider things from other perspectives before making a judgment. For instance, we look at homosexuality and most people still find it somewhat disgusting on a personal level, but there is a growing understanding that people who practice it are not crazy, cross-dressing freaks, or sexual perverts, or rapists. While a small number of those kinds of people just mentioned also may have certain homosexual tendencies or similarities, more exposure and education is making the rest of the world realize that the majority of homosexuals function with the same basic values, habits, and desires the rest of us have, and should not be discriminated against, let alone murdered, set on fire, or subjected to \u201ccorrective rape\u201d (forcefully exposing gays to heterosexual sex through gang rape, currently happening in South Africa). If it makes them happy, and it doesn\u2019t hurt you, why can\u2019t you let them do what they want to do? It bothers you? There\u2019s no right to not be offended. There\u2019s no right to not be bothered. The perspective, \u201conly one way is the right way\u201d is what makes what they do bother you in the first place.\n\nOpen-mindedness is more than tree-hugging hippie shit. It\u2019s the process of determining which tree-hugging hippie shit is a good idea and what is just an overblown attempt to act important when we\u2019re really insignificant. It\u2019s sitting down and thinking, \u201cIs Afghanistan/Iran/Iraq really a threat to national security and democracy? How\u2026?\u201d Upon further debate, an open-minded person could come to the conclusion that, yes, certain individuals located there may pose a threat, but not a suppressible threat, like fighting against an invading army. Any country certainly has individuals capable of mailing an explosive or trying to hijack a ship or plane. We can\u2019t invade them all. Is spending billions of dollars a year over there more important than using that money to either lower our taxes or send every kid to college, to keep our country from losing the rest of its tech industry to Asia? Some people might prefer to risk the security of a couple thousand lives once a decade or so, to save millions of good-paying jobs. Besides, what\u2019s the guarantee that one terrorist won\u2019t get through and kill a couple thousand people anyway, once a decade or so? Before you go running off reasons you heard on CNN for going over there, remember that we\u2019re friends with Russia, China, and Cuba, all of whom your parents felt the same way you do about Iraq and Afghanistan, back when the government was demonizing those countries and cultures instead. George Orwell\u2019s 1984 is the perfect depiction of how the government always seems to have an enemy to fight against so you\u2019re always in support of it, never realizing that for centuries, government itself was the enemy of the people, until it found a way to deflect attention. You can discover the real history of things by going to your local bookstore and checking out many of the books written on American history that you\u2019ve never heard or seen before. Much of it is very mind-blowing.\n\nDon\u2019t take all of that on the previous paragraph to heart; it\u2019s just an example. You\u2019re more than welcome to conclude that killing all \u201cragheads\u201d is the best formula for a better world and only 1/4th of the world\u2019s population would disagree. Getting emotionally involved in politics, one way or another, is a losing battle because there are much more important things in life than arguing. The brain is like a muscle; the more you use it, the stronger it gets. Having it process information seems like a lot of work, just like building a house, but once you do it a couple times it doesn\u2019t seem so hard after that. You don\u2019t even necessarily have to get rid of your beliefs and opinions to get started. Just don\u2019t react with hostility when any of them get brought into question. Consider other points of view; experiences other people share with you that you\u2019ve never had.  Ask yourself this: \u201cIs what I believe to be proper really what I want to have in my life?\u201d Besides, all religions tell you to love one another. The world could use more two-way streets, regardless of what language or color the street signs are in.\n\nBreaking The Mold\n\nOnce you have opened your mind, the fuse is lit for the critical stage of transition. Make note of the diction here. This is not a change, for change is an instantaneous occurrence. This is a transition. It takes time to fully happen. This transition consists of many changes. Your habits will change. Your goals will change. Your opinions and beliefs will change. With these changes, inevitably you\u2019re bound to start drifting towards whatever other like-minded individuals you meet. For you, and all the others you will meet, this is your first real chance at finding out who you are. Throw everything you think you know out the window, it no longer applies.\n\nDuring this time period, reflective thinking will be absolutely necessary. You need to take time to stop, look back, analyze your new experiences, and find what lessons there are to learn in each of them.  Your resolve will be tested. It will be broken and strengthened at different times. Bad things will happen to even the most careful person. What matters is not how well you can hide, but how well you can heal. Healing is a process of remembering truth and your own self amidst the thick cloud of pain that speaks only in extremes (i.e. \u201cNothing matters, everything sucks\u2026  I can\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d). If you\u2019re unable to predict your own reaction to things before they happen, at least take the time to examine your reaction to things after they happen.  The most well-rounded, developed people are the ones who look within themselves, using objective analysis (what are you doing and why) instead of condemnation or denial of responsibility. After living it up, you\u2019ll need to schedule some time for sleep. Don\u2019t pace your life so quickly that you\u2019re always busy. This is important, in order to notice the small changes happening and to stay aware of your transition.\n\nGrowing up, it is likely you were sheltered, lied to, and simply left out of a lot that goes on in the world. It\u2019s an insane process, parenting is: Control your kid his whole life, make all the decisions for him, and then send him out on his own and expect him to know what to do\u2026 and be his own person. Fifty years ago, it was fine, because the kids just mimicked their parents\u2019 logic and were happy to  grow up as a spitting image of their predecessors. That doesn\u2019t work anymore. In order to become independent and establish your own identity, you must begin sifting out what was taught to you as truth, right, wrong, fair, unfair, necessary, and possible.\n\nThe bulk of what we\u2019re taught as children is outdated information, because the recent generations before us have grown up and created an entirely new world to learn how to deal with. The wars of the 1960s and 1970s led to the inflation of the 1980s and 1990s, free trade and a global economy (blah blah blah), which has made it nearly impossible to afford to move out on your own at 18 now. However, a lot of parents still expect to be rid of their kids when they turn that age. Good luck.\n\nYou must identify obsolete ideas and disregard them and their instructions. Analyze life by what you see, not by what you hear from other people. Identify someone as trustworthy by how they perceive and analyze things, not by how their intentions seem. Intentions are the most wonderful next-to-worthless things when it comes to learning and growing. A lot of people mean well, but have a much different (and again, obsolete) idea of what they think will be good for you.\nLet\u2019s touch on what you believe for a second. Remember who you were four years ago? Compare what that person knew then to what you know now. Is there a big difference? Now, imagine your future self in another four years of learning, looking back on what you think is the truth now\u2026 Right, so don\u2019t take your thoughts so seriously, as they\u2019re obviously going to evolve. When you learn something wonderful and amazing, don\u2019t get comfortable and settle on it. Stay open. Sometimes we\u2019re given a puzzle piece in order to get to the next level. We mistake this as the big picture, but it\u2019s really just a part of a much larger picture. With how vast and complex the physics of the universe are, it is short-sighted to be completely certain that there is a simple answer to it all.\n\nThere is too much going on to ever really have it all within a total grasp or understanding, but the zest of life comes in the chase. One of the best memories you will probably enjoy in this life will just be sitting around some sort of object or shape (like a bonfire, the ocean, or a freshly-packed bong) and having a conversation with a small group of close friends. There is something undeniably fulfilling about being connected to others. It\u2019s hard to operate solely on our own battery packs all of the time.\n\nA lot of people have a mental block of being willing to change, versus staying true to themselves. This is a misunderstanding of what change is. In this case, change refers to a refinement process of what your \u201cself\u201d is, while in turn taking bits and pieces of new things and making them your own. Would you refuse to be potty-trained or taught how to read? These weren\u2019t part of your original self. A lot of people have a misunderstanding of change, afraid that they will lose who they are or \u201csell out\u201d if they try to grow. Kids these days have lost so much; the last thing they can afford to lose is their identities, so they hold on for dear pathetic life. Kids read about this wonderful America full of opportunity and freedom, but the reality around them just doesn\u2019t match up. Fewer and fewer kids have established a connection with their parents as guides worthy of being trusted. This generation feels alone, and in a way, cheated, for not being able to automatically have the quality of life they expect. Growing up has gotten a really bad connotation to it because of the dumbfuck adults who have ruined the general world, as well as so many individual worlds. The things they do and decisions they make seem so obviously horrible, yet they do them anyway, leaving us youth to wonder why. Unable to yet discern a rhyme or reason for this outcome, we blame the first notable difference between us and them; they\u2019re grown-ups. What happens is that many failures and broken dreams corrupt a person over time, until growing desperateness and selfishness take over, into sort of a survival mode. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Don\u2019t drink too much Coke (or beer for that matter). Stay away from rednecks and anyone else who views change as a negative thing. You might find a few Cherry Cokes on the shelves, but while they have a better taste, remember they\u2019re still Cokes and are going through the same things all the other Cokes are. In this context, you yourself are still some variant of soda, in search of what other flavors you want to mix into you.\n\nConsider your actions similar to a social science experiment. No matter how many times it takes to get it right, a science experiment is declared a success once the desired result is eventually obtained, or the hypothesis in question is verified. Sometimes something completely new and unexpected will occur. So keep trying new and different things until you have found what you really enjoy. Just try things out. Sometimes you\u2019ll even become good friends with people you didn\u2019t like very much at first. Also, you\u2019ll discover new things about life you never paid much attention to before, until you gave them a chance (especially in the worlds of sex, philosophy, and music). When you don\u2019t know what you want, a good way to find out is to do all sorts of things to figure out what you don\u2019t want, and just begin scratching things off the list. You\u2019ll narrow your choices down and picking a path will be a lot easier this way.\n\nThere are life stages with new rules and roles that you have yet to go through. Even if you have mastered this environment now, there are new ones coming, so don\u2019t be surprised when you wake up one day, feeling completely lost in the world and wondering what the hell just happened. The life stage of an early teen is just figuring yourself out and hoping someone loves you. As a late teen, the life stage is finding out how you fit in with the world and how to make some money to buy things. Your twenties are spent amassing experiences and material belongings. The early thirties are spent maintaining the relationships and property you\u2019ve acquired along the way, until the \u201cmid-life crisis\u201d hits in your mid-thirties, when you get bored with the lack of spontaneity and excitement you experienced in their teens and twenties. That\u2019s when people have kids, in an attempt to vicariously relive their own youth through their children.\n\nYou also have different levels to complete, or achievements to earn. In no strict order, they go: knowing yourself, loving yourself, being loved, loving someone else, having sex, graduating high school, buying a car, getting your first job, graduating college, moving out, living alone, buying a house, achieving financial security (a funny way of saying you make enough money to go shopping and eat out without having to budget meticulously), getting married, having children, and death.\n\nNarrowing Down Choices\n\nAs you pinball from class to class and relationship to relationship, your attitude will fluctuate constantly. Eventually, you will gravitate to and orbit around an altitude and latitude you find most comfortable and true. (One definition for latitude is freedom from normal restraints, limitations, or regulations.) This will become the foundation for your world view. Your world view is an important factor because it single-handedly determines how you view your role in it. Some people see the world as a playground for learning. Others see it as a wonderland of nature to be explored. Others yet, see it as an infestation of greed and human filth that needs to be exterminated. You can view the world as a political entity, a biological entity, a psychological entity, or even just a tiny mote of dust in a great big universe. The choice is up to you.\n\nOnce you have settled on a world view, you can then discover how you fit into it. Are you meant to be part of the work force to produce a product? Are you just another animal who will follow instinct to reproduce and survive? Are you better suited for research and development of the human consciousness? Is your life about the pursuit of happiness, or is it maintaining balance between positive and negative to achieve inner and outer harmony? Or, is it, you know, just fussing like piglets trying to get as much from their mother\u2019s nipple as possible? Decisions like these are important. The relief comes in knowing that they\u2019re not decisions you can only make once. College is an excellent forum for aiding in these decisions because you can explore several avenues a few blocks at a time and see what really interests you, as you get more in-depth information instead of just imagination. When you finally get it right, you will undoubtedly achieve a great level of maturity because you will finally start to live up to your true potential. Once this has occurred, one generally feels an intense sense of peace, purpose, and inner happiness; some call it being enlightened, some refer to it as finding one\u2019s destiny, others might think it has something to do with being one with God or the universe. It\u2019s all the same stuff coming from different perspectives, really. Your pitiful Intro to Psychology book refers to it as self-actualization.\n\nThe biggest change, which you are well aware of by now, is the difference in lifestyle. Your life, while still structured, has a lot more flexibility (that is, you have the freedom to script your structure as you see fit). However, there is also a lot more to do now. You have to work now. It\u2019s not just homework. You have to meet people. Chat rooms, forums, and online games aren\u2019t acceptable mediums anymore. For passing the time, maybe, but nothing replaces face-to-face experience with a real person.\n\nAnd in addition to the myriad of new people out there, you also have to be by yourself for a while and handle your responsibilities. Of course, it can be extremely overwhelming to have so much to do and so much to balance. If this is relevant, you should try having an hourly calendar. You\u2019ll actually get to see the blocks of free time you have during the day and can make yourself most productive. It might seem confining at first, but here\u2019s what\u2019s really going on: all your time is really free time. What you\u2019re doing by planning your activities is filling portions of that free time with important stuff to do, to achieve the end that you actually get stuff done. So it\u2019s a lot like setting a few different alarms, with both a start and an end time. That\u2019s really all there is to it. The end result of this will be valuing your time a lot more than you ever imagined you could.\n\nHow to Make Good Decisions\n\nThe game of chess is an incredibly accurate representation of how real life works. Like a good chess player, you should always remember your ultimate goal, when deciding your moves (i.e. don't get into stupid bar fights, especially when you have a wife and kids to take care of). The real trick is knowing how to think logically.\n\nLogic is a system designed to ensure an individual\u2019s well-being, except in unforeseen events. Logic is a social math that allows you to presume what will happen next, based upon what has already happened (prediction). Logic also allows you to analyze what just happened in an attempt to better understand it (reflection). The more thought-out your logic is, the fewer unforeseen events there are. Plenty of bad shit still happens, but you get better at preparing for it. Other people use their intuition instead of logic, but with intuition, you either have it working well for you or you don\u2019t. Logic however, can be learned.\n\nIn chess, basic strategy is to string together a series of moves to influence your opponent to react in a way that will allow you to reach your goal. It is complicated, and you must always be aware of what is going on. Your thoughts must always revolve around your goal(s), and each of your moves should be planned out. For example:\n\nGoal: To find just an ol' somebody to be your partner.\n\nMove 1: Learn to love one's own self\u2026 you know, as practice. Jack your heart off so you don't bust too soon when it matters. Nothing is worse than appearing desperate.\nMove 2: Learn what attracts the opposite sex, in order to open up more options.\nMove 3: Earn good income, be in good shape physically and mentally.\nMove 4: Ask out anyone and everyone to dinner and conversation. You never know what lies beneath their public persona.\nMove 5: Learn from everything that goes wrong, whether it\u2019s your mistake or someone else\u2019s. There is always something noteworthy.\nMove 6: Begin filtering out results through a series of personal observations and tests, until you find the right blend of character (most important), personality (real close second), and compatible life goals. (Life goals change a lot, so tell people who think this should be #1 to enjoy being lonely when they're old.)\nMove 7: Love Mr./Mrs. Filtered Result with every ounce of your soul. Pay attention to his or her specific needs and learn how to show him or her love in the ways he or she best receives it, NOT the way you're most comfortable showing it.\nMove 8: Don't suck in bed (rather, you need to know what and how to suck).\n\nThis is the move chart you sit down with. A logical thinker plans many steps ahead of their current position, with probable outcomes charted ahead, with pre-determined steps and reactions. Just daydream awhile\u2026 picture what your life would be like the way you want it. Then ask yourself what is needed to get there and work backwards to figure it out. For instance, you want a big house in the mountains and three children. Cool, you better have an income near triple figures. So you have to either start your own business or get a college degree in a trade or field that has a lot of cash flowing through it, like auto parts or real estate. In order to initially fund either of those, you have to work all the time and save your money. Of course, life can change course at any time, and that's where character and personality have their time to shine (or supernova your entire life away, if you suck). Logical thinking is critical to making good decisions. Logic is the crazy straw that allows your lips to connect to the liquid inside the cup of life from which you drink. Without logic, you will head-butt the cup, and fuck your own face. For those drinking out of bowls, you will drown.\n\nNow it's time to take a look at particular flaws in logic that will throw glitches into the system.\n\nA common mistake is to use what is referred to as \u201cjudgment\u201d instead of analysis. A judgment is \u201cthis is bad/good.\u201d Analysis is \u201cthis action causes this effect, because\u201d or \u201cthis is, because.\u201d A fundamental flaw of thinking today is the belief that everything must either be bad or good. Some things are neutral, and their application can make them one or the other. For example, you can use a chair to sit on or as a weapon to beat someone up with. The chair itself is still neutral. You will experience a lot of situations that can be examined under this chair theory. The \u201cbecause\u201d is your quest to discover. Everything has a reason. However, the reason is not always good, logical, or sensible. Sometimes reasons may stay unknown for a long period of time or even eternity. You can say to yourself, \u201cThis is the way it is because of reasons unknown,\u201d as opposed to \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cthere is no reason for this at all and life must be total chaos.\u201d You end up feeling a lot less confused and helpless if you learn to construct your thoughts better. Now that that\u2019s out of the way, here\u2019s a side note: Do not draw conclusions on what you do not understand. For instance, don't decide that all Muslims are any crazier than other religious people just because they're Muslim. Unless you've been a part of the religion yourself, or are some sort of religious scholar, you probably don't really know what goes on\u2014just what other ignorant people tell you. It's not a harmless assumption; major wars have been waged over condemning other people for doing things that weren't understood at the time. Another even more common mistake is to only view the immediate or short-term effects of a decision, and to ignore or not even realize the long-term repercussions. Examples of this can be found everywhere, from new laws or bills being signed, to drug abuse, one-night stands and the decision to cheat on your significant other. A temporary solution is not really a solution. More often than not, it just creates other problems.\n\nAfter considering your own long-term goals, there are other things to contemplate before taking action. You must understand the repercussions of your decision for all people involved, as well as society as a whole. For example, if your long-term goal is wealth, you may decide robbery is the path to take (just for the sake of argument). It\u2019s easier than working hard day after day. The only investment is a few hundred dollars in a gun. However, the negative consequences far outweigh the positive. It\u2019s guaranteed that you\u2019ll be caught eventually, or someone else will have a gun too. Aside from the obvious risks to your own safety and possible imprisonment, other people may be hurt or killed in your attempt at reaching your goal through this means. Do you truly find that to be an acceptable working environment?\n\nA good benchmark for an idea is to ask yourself how society would function if lots of people suddenly decided to do what you wanted to do at any given instant. If everyone were to start robbing each other at once, you would not have your wealth. It would be taken from you, or someone else would have attacked your target first. Other good benchmarks to check with are: \u201cWill my action cause anyone considerable physical or emotional harm that will leave lasting damage? Would I proudly include the story of my action in a TV biography about myself? What has happened to others who did what I'm about to do?\u201d\n\nHow To Think Logically\n\nLogical thinking is your elephant gun in this crazy jungle. Clutch it for dear life and never let go.\n\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 logic, how does it work?\u201d\n\nWell, in order to think logically, you must also have a sense of morality (whatever you consider your morality to be). A morality acts like an organism that produces right and wrong, in reference to one's own world view. For example, let's say you believe the world to be a good place that values happiness. When faced with decisions, you will analyze what your choices are and select the one that most closely goes along with your world view. In this case, the right decision is whatever makes people the happiest. It is a logical decision for your world view. However, someone else's world view might be that life should always be as fair as possible. The choice that makes people closest to happy might feel wrong to this person, because certain people may not get enough of what they deserve, while others may get more than what they deserve. What this all really means is, logic is relative to the morality, which dictates its priorities. Does this make all decisions logical in some way?\n\nHell no.\n\nToo many decisions are made based on emotion\u2026 often, a negative emotion; fear or anger. Because an emotion is more of a chemical occurrence than anything, it cannot be trusted as a source of sense or truth. It is not thought-out or examined, and has no real references to support it. It is simply just there. No decisions should be made when under the influence of intense emotion. A good outcome has the same chance of happening as just making a random guess. This doesn\u2019t just apply to pre-maturely burning bridges in anger. A positive emotion also creates senseless action, such as happily spending a lot of money on a party because you won a little bit at the blackjack table.\n\nHistory also cannot always be trusted, when looking back upon it as a reference for possible outcomes in a situation. While it's valuable to contemplate whether history could repeat itself, it must also be factored-in that most scenarios are rarely, if ever, exactly the same. The situation could be the same, but the individuals involved and their needs are usually different. Differing present factors prevent history from being a source of answers that can be followed. It can only be used as a reference for what didn't work and why. The why is important to know, so don't leave it out.\n\nThe system of logic seems very clear-cut and simple once it\u2019s understood, but apparently getting there is quite a journey. There are several commonly used logical fallacies\u2014 broken logic, that appear in every day discussion. They largely go unnoticed. It is important to research these fallacies on your own, to understand what they are. Once you understand them, you will be able to infer the dangers of relying on these arguments.\n\nFor a wide range of fallacies with examples, visit http://logicalfallacies.info or for even more, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies.\n\n(You have reached a save point! Now go to that website and study. Do it.)\n\nWow, that\u2019s a lot of confusion, isn\u2019t it? These are wild and rampant in political arguments, debates, newspaper articles, and plenty of other places where important decisions are made by people with power. How can people who don\u2019t think logically make proper decisions based on priority assessment without ruining the world around them? Hmm\u2026 looks like they can\u2019t.\n\nSince logic is a tough system for the uninitiated to pick up, it requires extensive explanation that is too much to fit into one chapter. If you can\u2019t think logically, the best you can do is make your decisions using common sense.\n\nCommon Sense\n\nWhen someone refers to using \u2018common sense\u2019, it usually means to take a step back and analyze the situation as simple as possible. Now and then, we try to bend our interpretation of reality to make what we want seem more possible or more favorable than it really is. We do this in order to \u2018make the best of the situation\u2019, \u2018think positive\u2019, or just to plain old bullshit ourselves and others into a certain way of perceiving things. Common sense is the removal of this bullshit to see things for what they are, and what their exact intended purpose is. For instance, even though hand sanitizer contains alcohol, you would be exercising common sense not to try to drink it to get drunk as if it was Everclear. If multiple groups of people are asking you to hang out with them, use common sense to make your decision. Common sense would suggest that if there is some reason everyone can\u2019t all hang out together, spend some time with each group that day (or if you have a lot of time, see one group some other day).  Sometimes there are situations that seem like no option will end up well. In this case, common sense suggests going with whatever option causes the least damage to your self and your relationships. Once you start going, \u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201dand running off a list of details that make the situation complicated, common sense becomes harder and harder to apply. If you\u2019re not adept at logical analysis to understand these complexities, don\u2019t stress out so badly that you can\u2019t make a decision at all. Just keep it simple and let common sense guide you.\n\nBefore making a decision, put your options through a series of benchmark tests that will help you determine the wisest course of action. First, apply the garden theory (see the chapter on Perspective Tweaks) and analyze which option fits into what part of your garden. Single-out which option will do the most good to all parts of your garden, or remove options that will cause significant trouble to its harmony. Another good benchmark is asking, \u201cIn five years, will I be still be doing this?\u201d The visualization of you in five years from now is supposed to project yourself in a more serious, wise, mature state. There should be some merit of honor in everything you do. While it\u2019s a rarity these days, it is the rule that really separates the best people from the rest.\n\nDon\u2019t let other people force you into making a decision you don\u2019t really want to make. This is (probably) your only life. Don\u2019t have a child, if it was a mistake.   Don\u2019t stay in a relationship with someone who you don\u2019t want anymore. It doesn\u2019t matter if they threaten suicide, revenge, or just whine endlessly. It\u2019s not going to work anyway, it\u2019ll have to end some day, and there will be all that more time wasted and a partially-built life to just toss in the trash when it finally all collapses. In a world where some children are forced to rape and murder one another for the amusement of others, your unwillingness to stand up for yourself under much less crazy circumstances is the kind of weakness that must be mended.\n\nBonus Level !!\n\nAnswer these questions to gain extra life, or rather, quality of life. Like any good video game, there are always extra challenges and rewards out there for those who search carefully (or are just damn lucky). Do you have what it takes?\n\nHow do you react to challenges? For example, do you rise to the occasion or shy away from confrontation? Get in touch with your own method and see how well it gets you to where you want to be. If this is too difficult at first, think of  close friends or relatives. Do their problem-solving methods effectively resolve their issues? If not, how wise is it to stick with their methods that don\u2019t work?\n\nWhich speaks louder, your thoughts or your feelings? Which stream of information do you believe more?\n\nDo you believe your intuition (your gut feeling) is always right? How would you go about testing this?\n\nHow often do you question the way things are? Do you ever question yourself? At first it might seem a bit unnecessary, but the more you learn to question, the more you learn about yourself and what is really important to you.\n\nWhy is it that so many older and middle-aged people are often cold and selfish? Is it a mass personality defect, or is it some specific experiences in life that have beaten them into that mindset? What are some of these experiences? How do you plan to avoid ending up this way?4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1098676", "artist_names": "Public Announcement", "full_title": "Mamacita

(To All the Girls) LyricsWyclef:\nChickenheads, gobble, gobble\nThugs in the dance, no shootin', shootin', shootin'\n\nHook:\nI cheated on you, you cheated on me\n(to all the girls I cheated on before)\nAnd this is not the way it's supposed to be\n(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)\nSo tell me girl, are you for real are you still down\nI'm telling you, I have no time to fool around\n(to all the girls I cheated on before)\nWyclef:\nHey yo, dear queen, by the the time you get this letter\nIt's 4 pages but my name ain't Aaliyah, what?\nI don't know much about biology or chemistry\nFailed the SAT's, study Brooklyn Zoo-ology\nRemember me, Wyclef, the memory\nEctasy with no theory of manoghany\n\"To be or not to be\", last words from Shakespeare\nBut a package says I wanna get rich with no fear\nA few good men in the new millineam\nWomen got a new law, if you cheat you're a dead man\nSo I been dead like 100 times\nAsk Cyndi Lauper, she'll tell you time after time\nLike a virgin when I hit it for the very first time\nShe became a nymphomaniac and wanted it all the time\nA thin line between love and lust\nShe mistake me for the rapper when I said \"Can-I-Bus?\"\n\nHook:\nI cheated on you, you cheated on me\n(to all the girls I cheated on before)\nAnd this is not the way it's supposed to be\n(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)\nSo tell me girl, are you for real are you still down\nI'm telling you, I have no time to fool around\n(to all the guys I cheated on before)\nYou might also likeQueen Pen:\nYo, I checked for you since I was straight up strugglin'\nBefore your cousin Jerry put you on, when you was nothin'\nSo why you play me like I don't know jack ish\n('Cause like K-Solo, your mom's in my business)\nNow who you wanna play loco to mine\nFeelin' kinda twisted, heard through the grapevine\nThat I'm doin' my thing, more more waiting\n(I swear) Many a years and many a tears\nI use chose remix to make it quite clear\nThat he came in when you didn't want to be there\nAnd I fell victim to this one night affair\nBy the time weeks came you was already there\nAnd still I come home just looking at you\nSee I'm feeling kinda guilty but revengeful too\nAll the dirt you done done, you don't know a clue\nWhy I don't sex you no more, and that's not coo'\n\nHook:\nI cheated on you, you cheated on me\n(to all the guys I cheated on before)\nAnd this is not the way it's supposed to be\n(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)\nSo tell me girl, are you for real are you still down\nI'm telling you, I have no time to fool around\n(let me sum this all up)\nWyclef:\nYo, yo, yo, and yo from the college dorm and til the dusk is dawn\nI never felt cold until I lost one\nDon't let go like EnVogue chocked on\nClash of the titans, now I'm on my unicorn\nI left New Jerus, I'm on my way to Brook-lawn\nSomeone hit my bumper, I turned around and saw Sharon\nGot surprised because I saw little Shawn\nIn the passenger seat with a bottle of Dom\nRemain calm, called Cocren on the horn\nSalaam, call up the chief 'cause a murder 'bout to go on\nWhat the bomb, bomb, but this ain't a reggea song\nIt's like a old flick \"Godzilla Versus King Kong\"\nIf you saw the movie than you know what's gonna happen\nWest coat, down south, back to Manhattan\nLike Vanessa from \"Soul Food\" when she came at night, B\nThank God it was a dream 'cause I woke up with my wifey\n\nHook:\nI cheated on you, you cheated on me\n(to all the girls I cheated on before)\nAnd this is not the way it's supposed to be\n(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)\nSo tell me girl, are you for real are you still down\nI'm telling you, I have no time to fool around\n(to all the girls I cheated on before)\n\nSalaam Remi collabo, Wyclef Jean, Product, yeah, Queen Pen\n9-8 'til infinitee, for all you girls out there I cheated on beforeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 58, "api_path":

smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees\nYou want some cheese\nHoes don't stay at the suave house\nHoes around my nuts like knats\nReal dogs don't pay for cats, dats\nFor real

pressure even in studying the professor\nNo effort shown in the momentums growth\nShould've known better then to show them what they'll know never\nEver so clever, Denver! Twist the knob and rotate it\nBook it, your bones aging just waiting for occasion\nYou see your souls shaping, I'd put it in bold letters\nBut you've seen the cold weather, envisioned the gat\u0435s gaping\nDon't expect them to compr\u0435hend\nThey on different wavelengths still telling you common sense\nWith relish and confidence expressed with incompetence\nAnd checkless, and prominent, reflected but not with cents\nStart talking but profitless, start reppin' the oculus\nOr suffer the consequence, remember the pompousness\nI'm letting it all commence, expressing my thoughts and all\nRemember I've dropped the ball, so ready or not at all, tell me\n(Chorus)\nOne more word and my head'll spin\nLike my name was Emily, tell it to the Exorcist\nRead the book of Genesis, answer what my question is\nWill I move on or am I just gonna be dead again?\nSo tell me one more word and my head'll spin\nJust what the possession did, more than give the neck a twist\nWill I see the end of this? Will I see beyond the veil?\nQuestioning my Exodus, tell it to the Exorcist\n\n(Verse 2)\nEyes of mine imitating optical illusions?\nI decline, this just may be possible confusion\nI can see through all them caf\u00e9 walls\nWith the rabbits and the ducks, on a path they call\nCall my name, the elderly soul, left to tell a fable\nFrom the life I saw at different angles, still the Shepard's table\nIn progressivity, I've come to the conclusion\nThat time is relativity, the ultimate illusion\nFeel Like Running just as real life toughens\nTo my Stairway to Heaven as a Pure Soul\nRep it 'till I Live In The Sky, let the rhythm apply\nWhat do we do? Digging, I'll be Flippin' In time\nI go travel dimensions, I lead a call\nWith my eyes closed, astral projection, I see it all\nFind telepathic intention when I be flying\nWanna see the color through my eyes? Find the iris\nYou might also like(Chorus)\nOne more word and my head'll spin\nLike my name was Emily, tell it to the Exorcist\nRead the book of Genesis, answer what my question is\nWill I move on, am I just gonna be dead again?1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 22, "api_path": "/songs/22453", "artist_names": "The Fab 5 (Ft.
