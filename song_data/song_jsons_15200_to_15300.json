sidewalk\nThe breakfast club is underground and an\nAmbulance is making rounds through\nHollywood\n\nYou can take a vow of silence and wake up an\nAppliance with tubes and neadles and antennas\nIn case you don't feel embarrassed\n\nHear the smattering of applause while they're gathering some gauze\nThey say whether you've got cash to burn or not\nA little crash will earn you a spot in the weekly reader\n\nAnd intention is important if you want a shot at\nRedemption but don't tell them you feel nothing\nIf you want a shot of morphine\n\nScar tissue is repugnant but it doesn't turn\nTeenager's stomachs It just makes you seem a\nLittle wiser They think you need a broader\nShoulder to cry on\nYou might also likeSo the stars fall into the street as they leave the\nHospital with no blood left in their cheeks only\nJunk in their mail\n\nHollywood, what are you good for?\nA funeralEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/3521335",

know you love me, but it just ain't right\nI'm sick and tired of fighting with you every night\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou say you don't wanna hurt me\nBut you're doing things I can't explain\nOh baby, why don't you leave me?\n'Cause you know I'll never change\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's only another heartache\nAin't nothing to worry about\nSomething I'm getting used to\nDragging my heart around\nBut one day soon and it won't be long\nGonna find me an angel to carry me home\nIt's only another heartache\nAin't nothing to worry about\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'll find a honey to take a chance\nAnd roll that dice into my past\nShe'll cover me for a little while\nAnd show me love ain't out of style\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't care how long it takes\nMy heart's in the hands of fate\nOh God I ain't asking much\nJust a woman

feed the needy\nWe didn't come here to look for trouble\nWe just came here to do\nThe Super Bowl Shuffle\n[Verse 2: Willie Gault]\nThis is Speedy Willie, and I'm world class\nI like runnin' but I love

game\nOh, to play the game\n\nAll night long I tried to remember\nWas it something that you said\nDid you say that to me, baby\n[Verse 2]\nJust one touch from you (One touch from you)\nLittle girl, I come unglued\nI lose all trace of time\nAnd everything seems to slip my mind\n\nGot to find the right solution (The right solution)\nGot to find a way to end all this confusion\nIn mind, oh, in my

blind\nThey say that love can make you lose your mind (Lose your mind)\nNo matter what they say, sweet darling\nI know our love will shine\nYou might also likeAll night long, I'll lay beside

galaxies and each sparrow alive\nAnd the love that heals the wound after the war is through\nIs the knight in armour bright, faithful and true to you\n\nDarling, after all\nI will be the one to hold you in my arms\nAfter all, I will be the one to hold you\nI will be the one to hold you in my arms\nIn my arms\n\nDon't you know that, after all\nI will be the one to hold you in my arms. I'm telling you\nAfter all, I will be the one to hold you\nI will be the one to hold you in my arms\nIn my arms\n\nAfter all, baby\nI will be the one to hold you in my arms. Honey no\nAfter all, I will be the one to hold you\nI will be the one to hold you in my arms\nIn my armsYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/7648913", "artist_names": "DigBarGayRaps (Ft.

"DigBar\u2019s Mega Collab Lyrics[Verse 1: Fat Bub]\nWill you tell him that this motherfucking ass fat\nCute ass boy, I'ma ask em for his Snapchat\nPull up to his house and I'm asking where his dad at\nAnd if you are straight you know you're getting laughed at, laughed\nI'm playing with his balls, I'm ripping off his draws\nI'm sitting on his lap, I think that boy is Santa Claus\nI slob up on the crew and yeah I'm touching on their privates\nAnd that penis is my eye-drops, semen going in my eyelids\nAnd I'm eating all his meat, I think I'm on a protein diet\nThat boy is so cute I don't care what his size is\nHe push me on the floor, open booty like a door\nHold the world record of booty, think I just won an award\nAnd I'm playing with these balls, you would think it was a sport\nSad that me and my husband just got a divorce\nCheeks g\u0435t to clapping, booty itch I gotta scratch it\nI'm bouncing on his lap like a motherfucking rabbit\nAnd his booty is fat you know I gotta grab it\nHIS BOOTY IS FAT YOU KNOW I GOTTA SMACK IT\nMe and Matth\u0435w we are dating, holding hands while we are naked\nIn the bed and we are mating, hairy pube hairs we are shaving\nSlap his booty now it's shaking, study nuts an education\nDick and balls a better breakfast duo than some eggs and bacon\n[Interlude: Nigpro]\nYeah Nigpro Records in this bitch man shoutout the homie DigBarGayRaps\n10k, 15k, shoot for the motherfucking moon nigga\nI\u2019M GAY\nAYO WHERE MY DILDO AT\n\n[Verse 2: Nigpro]\nYo it's Nigpro coming in with that erratic flow\nI'm gonna be taking that microphone shoving it deep inside all of my faggots slow\nI ain't capping bro\nYou ever seen a nigga's ass explode\nWith shit and cum his dick and bum both got me feeling so irrational\nTried to hold back but it's hella hard to resist\nI prolapsed his ass as I left a mark with my fist\nI punched his stomach so damn hard that he let out piss\nHis bladder just shattered, damn he's as scarred as it gets\nArsenic spit, letting out bars lethal like poison\nCum milkshakes in my yard bringing all the boys in\nAnd then they bring the toys in\nAnd we get to dicking quick, we exploit it\nAnd the loopholes of our poopholes meatus goop throw, let the boys in\nIn layman's terms\nAll my niggas know how to make an anus churn\nStep up to my place if you want it but be patient, wait your turn\nOr I'ma have to rape it, I take it, gape it and make it burn\nLiterally, I melt it down and turn you into an anus urn\nDamn I swear to COCK\nI'm fed up with all straight ass heterosexual niggas\nWhen will these niggas just motherfucking learn?\nShove the remains up my ass and clench my cheeks to shatter it\nFaggotry to a tragedy, AIDS ain't all that I'm addled with\nCut the head off the neck of a straggot nigga and batter it\nThen eat it whole take some laxatives, with feces I splatter it\nI'm baking it up and raping the rump\nAnd spraying my nut, I'm making them slump\nI'm killing and fucking and eating these niggas\nI'm gayer than ever, I take what I want\nAnd I wanna just cum deep inside of a nigga\nAnd fill him with all of my vitamins nigga\nThis nigga is crying and fighting my dick\nBut I'm feeling enlightened, as high as can get\nI keep striking\nMy nigga penis keep sliding in while he keep crying\nHe might need a vicodin\nRectum is ripping from friction of gliding skin\nI don't need lubricant, blood is alright for it\nOnce he was tight but now no nigga wider than\nGape it with spite ain't no nigga this violent\nLooking him deep in his eyes he know he bout to die\nFrom my gay mutilation creampie\nIn which way should I kill this nigga dead?\nOr should I get to chopping off his lil motherfucking head?\nMan I'm sorry my guy, I apologize\nMy dick in his ass with my knife in his thigh\nI pull out a Glock from my asshole, it's time\nTo just kill this nigga with a shitty surprise\nI'm sorry my nigga but when all the bodies keep dropping\nIt's causing my cock to arise\nI'm so gay that I wanna be fucking and sucking on a hundred seventy motherfucking guys\nNever medicated, I inseminate the deadest niggas\nLike a mental patient I celebrate it\nMake a record gayer than a sex vacation\nWith a hundred niggas hard and flexing naked\nOther words, if I see an ass I'm gonna fucking take it\nGoatse his anus open, and THEN I FUCKING RAPE IT\nThis nigga claimed he was a hardened criminal\nHis dick was flaccid, his cock was minimal\nMy skin is darker than permanent marker\nAnd also I'm gay just to let all you niggas know\nNigpro Records out this bitch\nI'M A FAGGOT NIGGA\nYou might also like[Verse 3: KolossalKocks]\nGaping gays, see a booty gotta have it\nGot a plethora of toys like my name Inspector Gadget\nI'ma wave around a dildo and seduce him like it's magic\nI'm a poopy, sploogy Potter\nSave the nut in niggas asses\nThey hold me on a pedestal like I just won a Booty Pageant\nNiggas waved at me with swords while I be spitting like a dragon\nThey be screaming \"Jesus Christ\" 'cause I be stroking them with passion\nSo much nut it's like a sea, the booty oceans with Sebastian\nWatch me take this nigga booty he gon' give it without asking\nSee a sexy stud named Nagi, I'ma nut right on his glasses\nBootyhole University, I'm teaching all the classes\nWhen I enter in the room, I scan for booties that's the fattest\nHomewrecking straight marriages, don't care about the sadness\nYou would think my name was Dylan, how I'm shooting niggas asses\nTake that D\nGot blood and shit on sheets\nLick them cheeks\nBefore I drink his skeet\nBBC NIGGA\n\n[Verse 4: NotXxXayne]\nI spy with my little eye\nA big black nigga, I'ma hit it from behind\nAnd I won't be gentle, I'ma rearrange his spine\nAnd I nutted in his eyes so I think this nigga blind\nI'ma spray him with my slime\nIf you end up on my premise then that bootyhole is mine\nI don't need to say it twice\nLittle nigga toot it up and make some room for this pipe\nWe don't need to fight\nYou can make this raping easy if you let me nut inside\n3 black balls I'ma put it in my face\nTearing up his walls and his body start to shake\nI'ma make a crib for all the babies Ima make\nAnd his bootymeat look juicy so I ate it like a steak\nYeah I don't give a fuck that nigga gon' fuck me like a motherfucking slut\nBitch don't you dare stop till you motherfucking nut\nYeah I might just twerk on that bitch till I shit\nAnd I know that you love it\nI'm from Alabama so I'm fucking on my cousin\nMake him scream \"Yeehaw\" while I'm in that butt\nHe gon' tear my colon out while he calling me a slut\nI think I gave him STD's because his booty swollen shut\nHis shit burning like some sanitizer inside of a cut\nNigga you is out of luck, bend over so I can fuck\nI don't like the fucking straggots\nI don't like the fucking straggots\nMaybe you should call me up so we can go out on a date\nSend me to the bathroom so you can nut up on my face\nAnd we fucking after poop so there is poop up on my taint\nHeh it's funny because I don't think that he's gay\nAnd he fell asleep so I think I'ma catch a chare for rape\nBut I don't think he was cause he was screaming\nFUCK ME HARDER XAYNE\nIt's a shame cause he don't know how to say my fucking name\nBITCH I TURN TO A DEMON ON A NIGGA\nMAKE A NIGGA NUT LIKE HE PULLED A FUCKING TRIGGER, LIL NIGGER\nMake a nigga crawl cause I'm all up in his draws\nAnd that penis really big but I don't ignore the balls\nAnd I get up in that nigga and I'm ripping up his walls\nAnd he call and he say he wanted more like my nigga just come on\nShamone Michael Jackson\nI'ma fuck the little nigga while I'm calling him a faggot\nAnd he woke up in an alleyway asking bitch what happened\nAnd I say you got raped by the gayest nigga in Clutch Mafia\nAnd I walked away laughing\n[Verse 5: DigBarGayRaps]\nIt's DigBar and I'm joining the show\nI got niggas round the globe tryna fuck me in my throat\nJust like Bill Cosby I'ma slip a pill up in his double cup\nWait till he asleep then get to fucking on his bubblebutt\nGay niggas always seem to find their way to DigBar\nShot a nigga in his head because he couldn't get his dick hard\nRiding that nigga's dick just like I'm racing in a racecar\nName my dick Mike Tyson cause that shit always hits hard\nI'm the greatest sus rapper to ever walk the Earth\nI like to twerk, I like to jerk on a nigga when we in church\nEat his dick for the meal, eat his booty for dessert\nHis dick is 13, when he slipped it in it didn't hurt\nLike a maniac I hop up on that dick and go berserk\nNut flying and it landed on my Louis V shirt\nGimme the dick, gimme the balls\nI'ma pull his dick out of his draws\nHis nut turn my beard white just like I'm Santa Claus\nMan I need some new thongs so I ran up in the mall\nAnd I bought every g strap I motherfucking saw\nWhen it comes to booty I'm like Nike I just do it\nI just named my dick screwdriver cause when he see a butt, he screws it\nHe like black niggas with big nuts, God dammit I knew it\nI'm a BBC Crip cause when I saw that dick I blew it\nGave him my number, told him nigga I'm gon' see him in a bit\nAnd if he late then I'ma pull up and just shoot him in his shit\nMy name is DigBar and I'm the leader of this sus shit\nI cut him off quickly if that lil nigga bust quick\nFuck this, I'm the greatest nigga you can fuck with\nBig big big balls and a nigga butt big\nPut his hand on my pipe then I whispered to him \"touch this\"\nGay rap only, I ain't doing nothing but this\nIf you a jigaboo let me get with you\nI'm tryna drink his booty just like it's a mountain dew\nStick a straw in his butt and I'm drinking it like soup\nWhat's that smell? oh that shit smell like badoop\nAnd I been gay for seven years, I guess y'all been out the loop\nGot niggas spazzing at my house just like they military troops\nThey wanna pipe, they wanna fuck me right\nWanna fuck me to the left, they wanna fuck me to the right\nMy booty so tight, my nigga I'm the gayest on the planet\nI be throwing all them balls like I'm fucking Peyton Manning\n\n[Verse 6: Vuugi P]\nBig dick, small dick, I don't give a fuck\nCome here little nigga put that dick in my gut\nI'm a freaky, gay, nasty, little slut\nYeah that's right I been taking nigga's dick in my gut\nYSM, Birkin Bag, Bussy ain't free, you gon' have to drop a band\nBooty juice wet man I turned out your dad\nThen his baby momma had got mad\nI told her \"baby girl don't you even get mad, I just want your man for that motherfucking bag\"\nI'm a freak bitch, I be riding on that dick\nNot talking sloppy Joe but I get sloppy on the dick\nI call that nigga TV cause he got turned on\nWhen he seen me in my purple thong\nHe didn't clean his mouth when I turned him out\nThen he ran home and kissed his bitch in the mouth\nAnd if that bitch come for me the paramedics for her\nCause on my momma she gon' get beat the fuck up\nAnd if her brother want some tell him \"knuckle up\"\nBut I ain't tripping cause I know he really want to fuck\nBooty so tight nigga it will have you stuck\nI'ma ride that BBC till I see that white stuff\nPut my legs up\nBefore you stick it in you gon' have to drop a buck\nI charge extra if that little nigga tryna cuff\nCome here little nigga, come and get your dick sucked\nDark skin, light skin\nI'ma cut your penis if it come with foreskin\nSuck that BBC in a fucking Benz\nThen I walk out with ten grand\nCame across a nigga, he was light skin\nHe told me that his name was Austin\nHalloween night sucked that dick in a Satanic temple\nTold that nigga he can come lick on my nipples\nHe was beating on my dick, I bust in his dimples\nRipping out his pubic hairs, now his penis got a pimple\n\n[Outro]\n[noxious flatulence]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

bright\nOoh the sheets feel cold and lonely\nWho wants to brave the pouring rain\nFor a glass of French champagne?\nWell grab a cab, grab a cap and baby, come right by\n[Chorus]\nAnd she was hot - as she kissed my mouth\nShe was hot - as I wiped her brow\nShe was hot - she pinned me to the ground\nShe was quick - she knew her way around\nShe was hot - as she tore my clothes\nShe was hot - she had no place to go\nShe was hot - on a cold and rainy night\n\n[Verse 2]\nDetroit was smoky gray\nNothing like the good old days\nWell I got a fever that I'm fighting\nI don't need your company\nLeave me in my misery\nI can take the rebound just like lightning\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd she was hot - in a 50's dress\nShe was hot - her lips were flashing red\nI was lost - in her burning flesh\nI was hot - I was dripping sweat\nShe was hot - in the Detroit snow\nShe was hot - she had no place to go\nShe was hot - on a cold and rainy night\nYou might also like[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd she was hot - and I had the blues\nShe was hot - honey, where were you?\nIf you were in my shoes you would be excused\nShe was hot - you can never wait\nShe was hot - never hesitate\nShe was hot - on a cold and rainy night\n\n[Verse 3]\nI think I'm going off the rails\nRiding down the pleasure trails\nI was taking passion where you find it\nHoney when you were young and fresh\nAnd you need the touch of flesh\nGo take the treasure where you find it\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd she was hot - in the melted snow\nShe was hot - in the molten glow\nShe was hot - she got it in the blood\nShe was hot - like a dam that's burst\nShe was strong - she was strong and true\nShe was black - and her eyes were blue\nShe was lost - and she took a chance\nShe's just a brief romance\nDown the avenue\nInto the lost bayou\nInto the tall bamboo\nBack to the human zoo\nI wish you all the best\nI hope we meet again\nIn a cold Chicago night\n[Outro]\nShe was hot\nShe was hot\nShe was hot hot hot\nShe was hot hot hot\nShe was hot hot hot\nShe was hot hot hot\nShe was hot hot hot\nShe was hot hot hot\nShe was hot hot hot\nShe was hot hot hotEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/866469",

escape living the lives of the lonely\n\n[Bridge]\nFor a friend of mine\nFrom the neighborhood\nMoving down the line\nAfter tonight he'll be gone for good\n\n[Verse 3]\nHere comes Ricky, Danny and Doerge\nThey got Petie's number, looking at me\nRussell and Bobby setting up the drums\nGonna pound on 'til the landlord comes\nSee Jackson Browne LiveGet tickets as low as $94You might also like[Chorus]\nDon't want to argue, I don't wanna fight\nBut there will definitely be a party tonight\nFor a rocker\nFor a rocker\nFor a rocker\nFor a rocker\n\n[Bridge]\n'Til the morning comes\n'Til the car arrives\n'Til we kill the drums\n'Til we lose our lives\n\n[Chorus]\nHey Jenny\u2014tell Peggy Sue\nWe're gonna do the only thing you can do\nFor a rocker\nFor a rocker\nFor a rocker\nFor a rocker\n\n[Outro]\nThere's a party tonight\nThere's a party tonight\nThere's a party tonight\nThere's a party tonightEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1414243",

like this?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know, I once knew a woman who looked like you\nShe wanted a whole man, not just a half\nShe used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child\nYou kind of remind me of her when you laugh\nIn order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear\nIt\u2019s done with a flick of the wrist\nWhat\u2019s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?\n[Verse 3]\nYou know, a woman like you should be at home\nThat\u2019s where you belong\nWatching out for someone who loves you true\nWho would never do you wrong\nJust how much abuse will you be able to take?\nWell, there\u2019s no way to tell by that first kiss\nWhat\u2019s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou know you can make a name for yourself\nYou can hear them tires squeal\nYou can be known as the most beautiful woman\nWho ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal\n\n[Verse 5]\nYou know, news of you has come down the line\nEven before you came in the door\nThey say in your father\u2019s house, there\u2019s many mansions\nEach one of them got a fireproof floor\nSnap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you\nThey smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss\nWhat\u2019s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?\n\n[Verse 6]\nGot to be an important person to be in here, honey\nGot to have done some evil deed\nGot to have your own harem when you come in the door\nGot to play your harp until your lips bleed\nYou might also like[Verse 7]\nThey say that patriotism is the last refuge\nTo which a scoundrel clings\nSteal a little and they throw you in jail\nSteal a lot and they make you king\nThere\u2019s only one step down from here, baby\nIt\u2019s called the land of permanent bliss\nWhat\u2019s a sweetheart like you doing

Gumbel was talking 'bout the fighting in Lebanon\nSome Senator was squawking 'bout the bad economy\nIt's gonna get worse you see\nWe need a change in policy\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere's a local paper rolled up in a rubber band\nOne more sad stories\nOne more than I can stand\nJust once how I'd like to see the headline say\nNot much to print today\nCan't find nothing bad to say because\n[Chorus]\nNobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town\nNobody OD'd\nNobody burned a single building down\nNobody fired a shot in anger\nNobody had to die in vain\nWe sure could use a little good news today\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'll come home this evening\nI'll bet that the news will be the same\nSomebody takes a hostage\nSomebody steals a plane\nHow I wanna hear the anchorman talk about a county fair\nAnd how we cleaned up the air\nHow everybody learned to care\nWhoa, tell me\n\n[Bridge]\nNobody was assassinated in the whole Third World today\nAnd in the streets of Ireland\nAll the children had to do was play\nAnd everybody loves everybody in the good old USA\nWe sure could use a little good news today\n\n[Chorus]\nNobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town\nNobody OD'd\nNobody burned a single building down\nNobody fired a shot in anger\nNobody had to die in vain\nWe sure could use a little good news todayYou might also like2Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

it together\nIf I can't have you I don't want no one at all\nJust because I'm so quiet\nJust because I don't cry\nThe hardest lesson to learn girl\nIs how to take it inside\n\nThere's leather and jewels to soothe me\nBut it really isn't what I need\nThere's an aching hurt inside of me\nAnd it's the kind of thing you don't see\n\nIf I give you my heart would you love me forever\nWould you pick up the pieces if I stumble and fall\nIf my world falls apart could you keep it together\nIf I can't have you I don't want no one at all\n\nNow the years are unwinding\nBut I still feel the hurt\nI've been fighting my whole life\nFor the privilege to work\n\nNow I've stopped and looked around me\nThere's nobody left to blame\nIf I don't have you to hold me girl\nAll of my work's in vain\n\nIf I

My nigga, one time. Thank everybody involved, everybody involved. My team, my team is my fam. Everybody who put they fingerprints on this shit, 'preciate everybody\nSo the definition of Dedication has changed for me since the first one, since the second one, since the third one, whatever. It's because, umm, whenever I put it out, umm, it's life. And since I don't write none of my shit, I'm coming from the head. And what happens is, when you rap so long or when you do it so long, all the things in your head, you done used up. So what happens is you gotta start using something else and coming from somewhere else, and that somewhere else is ten times out of ten your heart. And, umm, that's what this Dedication 6 project is\nBut, uh, yeah, the definition is always different because I'm always going through something at that time of my life, you know what I mean. I prolly was fucking your bitch on Dedication 4, and the whole fucking shit was dedicated to her, you know what I mean. I dunno. Whichever one that wasn't, that didn't do as well as all of the rest of them, that was definitely the one that was dedicated to her4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path":

favorite wild cherry\nYou know me just waiting on Mary\n\nShe weren\u2019t like the other kids hanging in the neighborhood\nShe wanted to see the world and so she said we should\nSneak off down Hampton Drive with all the candy we could carry\nYou know me chasing after Mary\n\nChorus\nMy first taste of life before I learned to live it\nMy first taste of love before I learned to give it\nI\u2019ll still be dreaming about that girl when I\u2019m dead and buried\nYou know me just waiting on Mary\nI had a swing in my backyard but Mary wouldn\u2019t swing with me\nShe\u2019d run up the hill with her dogs wanting me to play family\nI was a man and it was my job bringing home blackberries\nYou know me taking care of Mary\n\nWe couldn\u2019t grow up fast enough and Mary got herself a car\nFriday nights in the backseat taking things a little too far\nTest-driving her kisses on me a little thrilling, a little scary\nYou know me cruising with Mary\n\nMy first taste of life before I learned to live it\nMy first taste of love before I learned to give it\nI\u2019ll still be dreaming about that girl when I\u2019m dead and buried\nYou know me waiting on Mary\n\nBlew that town to turn into the somebody she said I\u2019d be\nBut I\u2019m still looking for that girl in every face I see\nSomething\u2019s missing simple and true sweet as wild cherry\nYou know me just waiting on

LyricsRosanna's daddy had a car she loved to drive\nStole the keys one night and took me for a ride\nTurned up the music just as loud as it could go\nBlew out the speakers in her daddy's radio\n\nShe was shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)\nSnappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)\nShe was movin' round and round (oh oh ooo oh)\nThat girl was shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)\n\nWe started drinkin' wasn't thinkin' too straight\nShe was doin' 80 and she slammed on the brakes\nGot so high we had to pull to the side\nHer tits were shakin' 'til the middle of the night\nShakin' (oh oh ooo oh)\nSnappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)\nShe was up and down and round and round\nShakin' (oh oh ooo oh)\nShakin' (oh oh ooo oh) (oh oh ooo oh)\n(oh oh ooo oh) (oh oh ooo oh)\n\nI got a little nervous\nWhen she took her coat off\nShe looked so pretty\nAhh yeah\n\nI'm always talkin' baby talkin' too much\nI love that little girl and I just can't get enough\nIt takes a lonely night with nowhere to go\nJust call Rosanna, it's a hell of a show\n\nAnd she's shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)\nSnappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)\nShe'll be movin' round and round (oh oh ooo oh)\nOh she's shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)\n\nShakin' (oh oh ooo

no telling what you'll find\nThe words you say don't mean a thing, they fly right by my eyes\nLook in the mirror, don't look at me, maybe then you'll realize\n\n[Chorus]\nSo get up and go\nIf you're so tired of moving slow\nGo, if you're so tired of moving slow\nGo, get up and go\n[Verse 2]\nI was on the inside just looking out for you\nBut you're the one to make a change, there's nothing I can do\nNow's the time for you to move, actions shout out loud\nSo cut the talk and move your feet 'cause words get lost in crowds\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nQuit talking\nStart walking now\nQuit talking\nStart walking now\n\n[Chorus]\nSo get up and go\nIf you're so tired of moving slow\nGo, if you're so tired of moving slow\nGo, get up and go\n\n[Outro]\nGo, get up and go\nGo, get up and go\nGo, get up and go\nGo, get up and go\nSo get up and go\nIf you're so tired of moving slow\nGo, if you're so tired of moving slow\nGo, if you're so tired of moving slow\nGo, if you're so tired of moving slow\nGo, get up and go\nGo!You might also likeEmbed"}]
