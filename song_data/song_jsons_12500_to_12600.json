you ain't seen nothing yet\nTill you walk a while, a country mile\nIn my hillbilly shoes\nIn my hillbilly shoes\nYou work all day in the muck and the mire\nDance a little jig and a stomp by the fire\nAin't too much these boots can't do\nMight even kick a little sense into you\n\nWell I'm going up cripple creek going in a run\nGoing up cripple creek to have a little fun\nLaw man said they found some tracks\nPeople saw them leavin but they never come back\n\nOh, you don't know me, you don't know, you don't know you don't know\nTill you walk a while, a country mile\nIn my hillbilly

let you meet harm\nAlthough questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough\nAgainst wrong, choose right and be standing up?\nFrom the hospital that first night\nTook a hour just ta get the car seat in right\nPeople driving all fast, got me kinda upset\nGot you home safe, placed you in your bassinet\nThat night I don't think one wink I slept\nAs I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept\nTouched your head gently, felt my heart melt\nCause I knew I loved you more than life itself\nThen to my knees, and I begged the Lord please\nLet me be a good daddy, all he needs\nLove, knowledge, discipline too\nI pledge my life to you\n[Chorus]\nJust the two of us, we can make it if we try\nJust the two of us, (Just the two of us)\nJust the two of us, building castles in the sky\nJust the two of us, you and I\n\n[Verse 2: Will Smith]\nFive years old, bringin' comedy\nEvery time I look at you I think man, a little me\nJust like me, wait and see, gonna be tall\nMakes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all\nSometimes I wonder, what you gonna be\nA general, a doctor, maybe a MC\nHaha, I wanna kiss you all the time\nBut I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that\nUh-uh-uh why you do that?\nI try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh\nCrazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy\nI pledge to you, I will always do\nEverything I can, show you how to be a man\nDignity, integrity, honor an'\nI don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it\nAn you can cry, ain't no shame in it\nIt didn't work out with me an your mom\nBut yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love\nSo if the world attacks, and you slide off track\nRemember one fact, I got your back\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nJust the two of us, we can make it if we try\nJust the two of us, (Just the two

keep with the changin' times\n101 Dalmatians on your CD-ROM\nSee me, I'm tyin' to pretend I know\nOn my PC where that CD go\nBut yo, ain't nothin promised, one day I'll be gone\nFeel the strife, but trust life does go on\nBut just in case, it's my place to impart\nOne day some girl's gonna break your heart\nAnd ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex\nGonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son\nThroughout life people will make you mad\nDisrespect you and treat you bad\nLet God deal with the things they do\nCause hate in your heart will consume you too\nAlways tell the truth, say your prayers\nHold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears\nYou're living proof that dreams come true\nI love you and I'm here for you\n[Chorus]\nJust the two of us, we can make it if we

pesky pork choppers in the sky\nNo worries, we'll fix them too\nWith one of our Dr. Greenthumb 'Sizzlean' screens\nTo block the nosy pig's vision\nDon't believe me?\nJust ask one of my many satisfied clients here Jed Sanders\nHow well it works\nHyuh, hyuh, hello mah name is Jaid\nAnd ahm a farmer and I've been growin\nMary-jah-wana fer about twenty years and uhh\nUhh, with Dr. Greenthumb's 'Sizzlean' screen\nI don't have to point my shotgun\nAt them pesky porkers no more\nThanks, Dr. Green, you're the shit\nYes, Dr. Greenthumb's got it all, I guarantee it\nTry my book and you'll have

just where I'm from\nIn the hills where the trees grow wild with weed fields\nThe fuckin' pigs with shields holding the blue steels\nGreenhouse effect with the weed connect\n(Doctor) DEA can't keep Greenthumb in check (Doctor!)\nHPS, God Bless the whole crop\nPlease God, don't let me see no cops\nTrunkload, ready to hit the highway\nDon't let the eye in the sky fly my way\nOr we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit\nCan't be growin without no permit\nBut fuck that, I study the 215 trip\nThat way when they come they can suck my dick\nWeed can't grow without attention\nHello my name is Dr.

kush plant brush in a tangerine dream\nTasty, blowin a fuckin smokescreen\nCycles of weed are constantly grown\nSomebody give me the razor to cut clones\nI'd like to stop, but it feels so good\nHorny plants stinkin up my whole neighborhood\nDEA, never wanna leave me alone\nBut never ever ever gotta warrant for my home\nWhat that funny sound knockin at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)\nSorry

closet the weed is dried out\nLike Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out\nI don't wanna buy no weed from no cop\nGet locked up and they close up my shop\nThat's why I buy no weed from no one\nThat's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb\nThe scientifical, mystical one\nGrowin my crops with the rays of the sun\nCome one come all and see how it's done\nIf you see the pigs there's no need to run\nCause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb\nBut you never know what be the outcome\nYou see the photo in the album\nThe weed is growin like my erection\nLook I never told you where I was from\nSome call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb\n[Chorus: B-Real & SenDog]\nHello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb\nHello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb\nI'd like to tell you just where I'm from\nHello, my name is Dr.

me?\nCause of the pain I feel\nWhen the phone rings and it ain't for me?\nMost of the time\nI read myself to sleep 7 days a week\nAnd I can go on and on and on, you see\nBut this time could mean I'm running outta love\n\n[Verse 2:]\nLate at night\nWhen there's no one around\nI can feel the tingle in my hand\nFelt so good\nHad me saying uh\nYou know it ain't always money\nBut don't it sound funny\nEveryday is my day when I'm loving no one\n\n[Chorus 2:]\nIs it reality to think true love was made for me?\n(Was it made for me)\nCause of the pain I feel when the phone rings\nAnd it ain't

got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\n\n[Verse 1]\nI was raised, a little young nigga doin' bad shit\nTalk much shit, \u2018cause I never had shit\nI could remember being whupped in class\nAnd if I didn't pass, Mama whupped my ass\nWas it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?\nBroke out, left me to be the man of the house\nI couldn't take it, had to make a profit\nFound a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips\nMakin' G's was my mission\nMovin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen\nAnd why must I sock a fella\nJust to live large like Rockefeller?\nFirst you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now\nIf you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down\nGoddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot\nBlack people on a rage, police, so don't try it\nIf you're not from the town then don't pass through\n\u2018Cause some O.G. fools might blast you\nIt ain't right, but it's long overdue\nWe can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too\nI want G's so you label me a criminal\nAnd if I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\n[Chorus]\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\n\n[Verse 2]\nHere on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?\nA bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts\nAnd even when you take the shit\nMove counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit\nAsk Rodney, Latasha, and many more\nIt's been going on for years, there's plenty more\nWhen they ask me, \"When will the violence cease?\"\nWhen your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street\nNiggas had enough, time to make a difference\nBear witness, own our own business\nFuck the guard, \u2018cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet\nFirst we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free\nSo we loot, please don't shoot when you see\nI'm takin' from them \u2018cause for years they would take from me\nNow the tables have turned around\nYou didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down, huh\nAnd now Bush can't stop the hit\nI predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse\nAnd for once I was down with niggas\nFelt good in the hood being around the niggas\nYeah, and for the first time everybody let go\nAnd the streets is death row, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nYeah, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\n\n[Verse 3]\nI see no changes, all I see is racist faces\nMisplaced hate makes disgrace to races\nWe under, I wonder what it take to make this\nOne better place, let's erase the wasted\nTake the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right\n\u2018Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight\nAnd the only time we deal is when we kill each other\nIt takes skill to be real, time to heal each other\nAnd though it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready to have a black President\nHuh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact\nThe penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks\nI wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself:\nIs life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?\nI'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black\nMy stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch\nCops give a damn about a negro\nPull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero\nMo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas\nRather be a dead than a po' nigga\nLet the Lord judge the criminals\nIf I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\n[Chorus]\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nAnd I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nJust think if niggas decide to retaliate\n(Soulja in the house)\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nYeah, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nJust think if niggas decide to retaliate14Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 281, "api_path": "/songs/4103416", "artist_names": "Genius", "full_title": "Ranking Page: 50 Best Albums & 50 Best Songs of 2018 by\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/eb834304eecbb96bdcd4ed410a6da5dc.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/eb834304eecbb96bdcd4ed410a6da5dc.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 4103416, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 271096, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1663650017, "path": "/Genius-ranking-page-50-best-albums-and-50-best-songs-of-2018-annotated", "pyongs_count": 21, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Genius-ranking-page-50-best-albums-and-50-best-songs-of-2018-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "January 1, 2019", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 1, 2019", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/eb834304eecbb96bdcd4ed410a6da5dc.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/eb834304eecbb96bdcd4ed410a6da5dc.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 6, "hot": false, "pageviews": 9589}, "title": "Ranking Page: 50 Best Albums & 50 Best Songs of 2018", "title_with_featured": "Ranking Page: 50 Best Albums & 50 Best Songs of 2018", "updated_by_human_at": 1663650017, "url": "https://genius.com/Genius-ranking-page-50-best-albums-and-50-best-songs-of-2018-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/204611", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/822a5f872a1fcfe377695dc0046c6bc6.900x176x1.jpg", "id": 204611, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0ca83e3130e1303a7f78ba351e3091cd.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Genius", "slug": "Genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Genius", "iq": 77868}, "artist": "Genius", "lyrics": "Ranking Page: 50 Best Albums & 50 Best Songs of 2018 LyricsThis is the ranking page for the 2018 Year End Lists.

your reputation\nYes, I'm down with that GLP love\nWe was rippin' and kickin' it way before the \"Playa's Club\"\nCan't none of you haters keep no talented players like us apart\nThe Bay's on the map, I knew it from the fuckin' start\nThey talk down on us, but now they wanna be around us\nHatin' to the fullest extent but guess what\nEverybody can't be a GLP member\nMy niggas are sick as fuck, we're lacing this agenda\nLike a relay, so parlay, with a fifth of Marnier\nI thought you knew, I'll be around, it's Rappin' 4-Tay\nWe deliver so game it's getting lethal\nSo separate yours from mine, busta, trust a, root of all evil\n[Chorus: San Quinn]\nThe root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings\nPeople's purposes are shifted\nDollar signs on all our minds\nAt the core of what's in store for

Bigga Figga]\nRenewing my vessels, causing thresholds on a daily\nNiggas faulty but ain't no thang because these suckas can't fade me\nI want your undivided attention, the seasons of a winner\nThe top notch percenters to hop skotch beginners\nBegin this apparatus, got the baddest conversation for those\nManipulated, you're froze, so close the doors\nOpen up your mind for the rattle, niggas shackled like cattle\nDisrespected like snitches and rounded up for the battle\nNow ask yourself: who's the baddest and the boldest from the shoulders?\nThe Low be rollin' thickest from the youngsters to the oldest\nLegendary in my town when I was packin' my 9\nBut now I'm packin' my rhyme, it's time to climb\nRepenting for my old way of life so now I prosper and it's proper\nThanks to the Most High, no need for my chopper\nBack up out my face, there is no equal\nPrepare for the sequel, you know what I'm sayin'\nThe root of all evil\nYou might also like[Chorus: San Quinn]\nThe root of all evil, legal

'fore you end up tore up naturally\nThe ice cold cizash, the reason why we lose you\nDo the dirty job, rob and mob or pop\nIf everybody had a mil ticket, house and a Lex\nRub off our good game, there'll be no need to bless\nSmoke dank for stress, but some fortune, don't have it\nDo not grab automatic, and man, if you do not have it\n'Cause them homies with the same tats, same scratch broke flat\nGot the game confused, don't even know where home at\nFor the love of money, the earth should make it rain\nFor the petty pocket change, niggas bring the pain\nThe root of all evil\n[Chorus: San Quinn]\nThe root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings\nPeople's purposes are shifted\nDollar signs on all our minds\nAt the core of what's in store for me and my kind\nThe root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings\nPeople's purposes are shifted\nDollar signs on all our minds\nAt the core of what's in store for me and my kind\n\n[Verse 4: Playa P]\nFive Times Nut, that's my crew\nAnd if you niggas in the field, never ever show no fear, make it clear\nFor your ear, I spin like a hemisphere\nOn a reel to reel, some call it a track\nBe on the mack, that's a fact, could not lack like that\nKnick knack, even a stack for me rap\nSnap back, we relax, ready to puff a twamp sack\nHe probably don't even know the facts\nStill packin' a gat on the ump that's wack\nPut yourself in a trap 'cause your mind went flat\nPut the evil with the devil and you still don't care less\nAddicted to the game to try to earn a quick stack\nDon't ever think twice, you'd rather take their life\nAin't forgiven by Christ, first of all, down to brawl night\nEven against the law, yes y'all, do not take down far\nNever to borrow nothin', always hid face, frontin'\nAnd for nothin', bruh bruh\nWord to the humbug, play a bee, stung ya with the\nRoot of all evil\n(Legal or illegal gettings, people's purposes are shifted)\n\n[Chorus: San Quinn]\nThe root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings\nPeople's purposes are shifted\nDollar signs on all our minds\nAt the core of what's in store for me and my kind\nThe root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings\nPeople's purposes are

I'm KRS and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on The Breaks\nGoin' out to the hardcore hip hop\nGoin' out to the hardcore hip hop\nOf course we don't flip flop\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me\nI never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony\nBut I'm not the only MC keepin' it real\nWhen I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, \"Ill\"\nCheck the time as I rhyme, it's 1995\nWhenever I arrive the party gets liver\nFlow with the master rhymer, as I leave behind\nThe video rapper, you know, the chart climber\nClapper, down goes another rapper\nOnto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster\nKnowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody\nCall up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party\nFlat top, braids, bald heads or knotty dreads\nThere once was a story about a man named Jed\nBut now Jed is dead, all his kids instead\nWant to kick rhymes off the top of they head\nWord, what go around come around I figure\nNow we got white kids callin' themselves niggas\nThe tables turned as the crosses burned\nRemember You Must Learn\nAbout the styles I flip and how wild I get\nI go on like a space age rocket ship\nYou could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player\nBut make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer\n[Chorus]\nMCs act like they don't know\nMCs act like they don't know\nMCs act like they don't know\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis is what you waited all year for\nThe hardcore, that's what KRS is here for\nBig up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill\nIf you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill\nMC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines\nLet's battle to see who headlines\nInstead of flow for flow let's go show for show\nToe for toe, yo, you better act like you know\nToo many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly\nThey can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly\nIt might be the fact that they express wackness\nLet me show ya whose ass is the blackest\nI flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit\nToo sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit\nNow tone it down a bit\nMy title you will never get, I'm too intelligent\nI'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic\nWhen I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it\nIt split quick from the lyric\nDirect hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it\nSee KRS-One LiveGet tickets as low as $82You might also like[Chorus]\nMCs act like they don't know\nMCs act like they don't know\nMCs act like they don't know\n\n[Verse 3]\nSome MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him\nCos they know this kid gets all up in they rectum\nSlappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em\nJust deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em\nWho in their right mind can mimic a style like mine\nI design rhyme and get mine all the time\nMC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'\nWhen I roll up and rush their crew, they start bitchin'\nI don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's\nBelieve they could tango with the likes of these\nCross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive\nWide, magnified, live like the ocean tide\nYou dope, you lied, I reside like Artifacts\nOn the Wrong Side of Da Tracks, electrified\nComin' around the mountain, you run and hide\nHopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism\nAs I spark mad izm\nThe 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em\n\n[Chorus]\nMCs act like they don't know\nMCs act like they don't know\nMCs act like they don't know\nMCs act like they don't know\nMCs act like they don't know22Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

if he say no\nI'mma have to say bitch get out the car slow and leave ya fuckin' dough\nCause a nigga gotta eat fuck the world\nLet the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl\n\n[Chorus]\nFoe life, foe

to Philip Arthur Harrison\nWord up\nCause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man\nSo as far as I'm concerned, he is my father cause my biological didn't bother\n\n[Verse 1]\nBiological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old\nAa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not\nYou brought me into the world but you're not my dad\nMess around with those drugs makes my moms mad\nSo we left you with no remorsal pity\nTook the first bus from Newark to Jersey City\nWoman and child alone, now that's pressure\nMoms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa\nMomma, Aunt DeDe, whoever\nAunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together\nA year went by and I could walk y'all\nMoms got that good ol job at city hall\nShe probably didn't trust men anymore\nUntil Philip Harrison walk though the door\nWent out a few times but what about Shaquille\nMoms offered him a million dollar package deal\nShe said you want me you gotta take my son\nOr else its like a hot dog but without the bun\nGuess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it\nHe kept it, he kept it\nHe took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father\nCause my biological didn't bother\n[Hook]\nTook me from a boy to a man\nSo I always had a father\nWhen my biological didn't bother (4x)\n\n[Verse 2]\nJanuary 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)\nHe joined the army we moved to fort Monmouth\nHe disciplined me right from the get go\nAge 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go\nActin spoiled, rotten, trippin\nGot a butt whippin because I didn't listen\nBack then you see privates made no bucks\nHad to get another job driven trucks\nWorkin hard as hell didn't satisfy him\nHad to another job working at the gym\nHe wasn't \"Gone with the Wind\" like Clark Gable\nWork all them jobs to put food on the table\nPhil's my father, daddy and thats the scoop\nCan I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops\nCome on he put me under his wing\nWas the ball boy for his little Arthur team\nSometimes he even made me mad\nBut it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad\nBut a little bit better\nEncouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters\nI wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard\nGot to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card\nAll types, all sorts\nDisobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports\nI learned to dribble from right to left\nI couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's\nAge 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin\nBut father and son trials and tribulation\nBack then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it\nCause now I'm a man\nHe took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father\nCause my biological didn't bother\nYou might also like(chorus)\n\n[Verse 3]\nLook at me now successful for sure\nPhil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur\nAnd if you're making big dope be materialistic\nCause you'll end up another statistic\nEverything's going well following my dreams\nI dunked on Patrick Ewing\nI want the ring like Hakeem\nUh oh what do you know\nBiological ones on the Ricky Lake show\nWhat does he want, does he want money\nWhat people do for money!!!\nIt's kinda funny to me\nHe ain't gettin no check from me (check it)\nHe can go on all the talk shows he want\nPhil is my dad so don't even front\nHe took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father\nCause my biological didn't bother\n\n(Chorus)Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

"Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThe skies were pure and the fields were green\nAnd the sun was brighter than it's ever been\nWhen I grew up with my best friend, Kenny\nWe were close as any brothers that you ever knew\n\nIt was always summer and the future called\nWe were ready for adventures and we wanted them all\nAnd there was so much left to dream\nAnd so much time to make it real\nBut I can still recall the sting of all the tears when he was gone\nThey say he crashed and burned, I know I'll never learn\nWhy any boy should die so young\n\nWe were racing, we were soldiers of fortune\nWe got in trouble but we sure got around\nThere are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark\nI think he's right behind me now, and he's gaining ground\n\nBut it was long ago, and it was far away\nOh God, it seems so very far\nAnd if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car\n\n[Hook]\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\n(They are, they are)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd when the sun descended and the night arose\nI heard my father cursing everyone he knows\nHe was dangerous and drunk and defeated\nAnd corroded by failure and envy and hate\nYou might also likeThere were endless winters and the dreams would freeze\nNowhere to hide and no leaves on the trees\nAnd my father's eyes were blank\nAs he hit me again and again and again\n\nI know I still believe he'd never let me leave\nI had to run away alone\nSo many threats and fears, so many wasted years\nBefore my life became my own\n\nAnd though the nightmares should be over\nSome of the terrors are still intact\nI'll hear that ugly, coarse, and violent voice\nAnd then he grabs me from behind, and then he pulls me back\n\nBut it was long ago, and it was far away\nOh God, it seems so very far\nAnd if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car\n\n[Hook]\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\n(They are, they are)\n[Instrumental solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere was a beauty living on the edge of town\nShe always put the top up and the hammer down\nAnd she taught me everything I'll ever know\nAbout the mystery and the muscle of love\n\nThe stars would glimmer and the moon would glow\nI'm in the back seat with my Julie like Romeo\nAnd the signs along the highway all said\n\"Caution! Kids at play!\"\n\nThose were the rites of spring and we did everything\nThere was salvation every night\nWe got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn\nBut everything we tried was right\n\nShe used her body just like a bandage\nShe used my body just like a wound\nI'll probably never know where she disappeared\nBut I can see rising up out of the back seat now\nJust like an angel rising up from a tomb\n\nBut it was long ago, and it was far away\nOh God, it seems so very far\nAnd if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car\n\n[Hook]\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\n\n[Outro]\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nAnd objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nObjects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nObjects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\nObjects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are\n\nShe used her body just like a bandage\nShe used my body just like a wound\nI'll never know where she disappeared\nBut I can see her rising up out of the back seat now5Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1186426", "artist_names": "Jocelyn Enriquez", "full_title": "I've Been Thinking About You

free\nWithout a doubt\nYeah, I frown 'cause something don't look right\nIt's the twinkly twinkle star that's in your eyes\nHate to put your two feet on the ground\nSo go on and step aside\nAnd release

beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day in the neighborhood\nCan't go wrong, I feel strong and the flavor's good\nI'm with whatever comes my way, hip-hop hooray\nLatifah's on vacation, I'm just plain old Dana today\nI strap out, step out in every direction\nGlock, TECs, jimmy hats, in case I need protection\nSo I Land Cruise, pump sounds, play out wanna be\u2019s\nA kid in a M3's getting jacked right in front of me\nSo I play the TEC close, my finger's on the trigger\nDon't wanna get wet, so they steps 'cause mine's is slightly bigger\nBut better yet I'm a threat, so you better walk\nOr get sketched out in chalk, 'cause I don't wanna talk\nI stay true blue, I'm hoping it's you too\nI got the fever for the flavor of a Woo Woo\nSo it's back to the block, time to play\nIt's just another day around the way, hey\n\n[Chorus]\nJust another day, living in the hood\nJust another day around the way\nFeelin good today, feelin lovely-yay\nJust another day, living in

some pool, act a fool, 'cause it's on tonight\nI'm doing the knowledge, it's not easy, easy\nWatching a cop cuff a kid for selling a clip to a DT\nBut it's home, so I flex, get pressures off my chest\nSlip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next?\nStomach ache, head to Steak-N-Take for a bean pie\nGet a Final Call from the brother in the bow tie\nI'm where little kids dream and fiend for fun\nLots of laughter moms, no pops playing with her son\nI passed by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven\nHit by a stray, but I pray that there's a hood in heaven\nFake brothers claim there's no shame in their game\nYou know my name, show me a real nigga with a brain\nSo it's back to the block, time to play\nIt's just another day around the way, hey\n\n[Chorus]\nJust another day, living in the hood\nJust another day around the way\nFeelin good today, feelin lovely-yay\nJust another day, living in the hood\nJust another day around the way\nFeelin good today\nI hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay\n[Verse 3]\nYou know I gotta give props, I can't stop, without y'all, I'll be nothin\nNo wreckin', no checks, and no rhymin', no cuttin'\nNo stages, front pages, no phones, no beepers\nNo reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah\nI come with the real life perspective and rule\n'Cause me and my peoples from around the way remain cool\nSo it's back to the block, time to

Lyrics[Produced by DJ Premier & Guru]\n\n[Hook]\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nNo way, you'll never make it\nCome with the weak shit, I'll break it\nStep into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya\nLines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass\nA lot of rappers be like one-time wonders\nCouldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under their noses\nI hate those motherfuckin' posers\nBut I'm so real to them it's scary\nAnd with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me\nAnd no, we don't make wack tracks\nAnd all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts\nI represent, set up shit like a tent, boy\nYou're paranoid 'cause you're a son like Elroy\nAnd you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal\nMaybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal\n[Hook]\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh yes, I'm greater than all MC's when I breeze\nGive me room, please\nI be like fascinatin' when I be updatin'\nCuttin' off wack kids, pullin' their trump cards\nI thump hard, and make 'em say that I'm God\nNiggas be pretendin' they're hardcore\nNever know the meanin' of (raw)\nBut I get props like a slogan\nAnd no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam\nLyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'\nNo double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons\nBut if I have to, I go all out with no mic\nYeah, that's right, 'cause I survived mad fights\nAnd for my peeps I truly care\n'Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here\nAnd they all know how I feel\n'Cause suckers be like playin' themselves to have mass appeal\n\n[Hook]\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI know I'm dope, but don't wet that\nI've suffered setbacks, but now I'm makin' greenbacks\nJust like baggy slacks, I'm crazy hip-hop\nCheck one two and you don't stop\nYour head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb\nJust like the seashore, I'm calm but wild\nWith my monotone style\nBecause I don't need gimmicks\nGimme a fly beat and I'm all in it\nWord is bond, I go on and on\nFor you it's tragic, I got magic like wands\nSo I'ma end this lecture and I bet ya\nThose who kick dirt, in due time I'm gonna get ya\n'Cause I be kickin' the real\nWhile they be losin' the race tryin' to chase mass appeal\n\n[Hook]\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"\n\"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal\"26Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 14, "api_path":

it's on a Wednesday\nHail to the moon, just like Kunta Kinte\nThat means I'm gifted from the get-go, Mom's you never let go\nMad thanks for raising me right, bro\nYou gave me confidence to stop the nonsense\nDidn't live in Bel Air like the Fresh Prince\nTimes are hard, times are rough\nDidn't have Toys 'R' Us toys, but I had enough love\nPlus the guidance from above\nTo go to the park, sweatin', push and shove\nMaybe then for a dunk like you told me\nThen there were a few times when Dad had to scold me\nPrayed for my safety, I know how you was feeling\nDidn't want me wheeling and get to drug-dealing\nRemember when you asked me this one day\nWho I wanna be like, I said Dr. J\nThen you said, \"Good, now you gotta go\nTake the damn ball and slam it through the hole\"\nMom cracked a smile, Daddy gave a frown\nI said to myself, \"I can't let them down\"\nSo make way, I'm coming in for a landing\nAnd nothing's gonna' stop me, from being outstanding\n[Interlude]\nI'm outstanding\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow let's skip to the time when I was fifteen\nShaq is in the house, no, Shaq is on the scene\nNow my name's in papers, girls caught the vapors\nKids look up to me like a skyscraper\nNow, a role model, I mean a role figure\nThen I ask myself, can I get any bigger?\nMy dream is coming true, but coming true slowly\nThen I remember what Mom and Dad told me\n\"Remember this, son, you are the one\nShoot your gift like a gun and never forget where you come from\nYou're young, gifted, and Black\nIf they can't say Shaquille O'Neal then make 'em scream, Shaq!'\"\nLike the fam do, in the stands too\nWhen I freak the funk on a dunk they, \"Ah! Ooh!\"\nFrom high school to college, they gave me enough knowledge\nMake that gift and now it's time for me to fulfill my dream\nTo be in the [leaders' game?] like Hakeem\nI'll make the backboards shatter\nFans chit-chatter\nEven make the other centers get madder\nThat's me, who can it be?\nThe master of disaster, seven foot three\nBrother, ain't no other in the nation\nI'm born from my mother but I'm God's creation\nI'm outstanding\nYou might also like[Interlude]\nI'm outstanding\n\n[Verse 3]\nCause now I'm outstanding\nWave your hands and pump your fist\nWhen I'm on the court you know it's strictly, \"Swish!\"\nCause there's some things that I gotta do:\nTape up the ankle, pump up my Shaq shoe\nAnd now it's time to take care of business\nTo run up and down the court with Nick and Dennis\nScott, but I won't stop\nGotta keep striving until I reach the top\nGonna take a peek over the mountain\nI flow like a fountain\nPeace, I gotta go! And I'm out and\u2026\nBut before I go, wave your hands\nPeace to all my family, friends and fam\nI'm outstanding\n\n[Outro]\nI'm outstanding1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0,

night\nHe wrote \"Billy Bob loves Charlene\" in letters three-foot-high\nAnd the whole town said that he should've used red\nBut it looked good to Charlene in John Deere green\n[Verse 2]\nThey settled down on eighty acres\nRaising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes\nThey went together like a hand and a glove\nOn a clear day, from their front yard\nIf you look and know what to look for\nOff to the east, you can still read his words of love\n\n[Chorus]\nIn John Deere green, on a hot summer night\nHe wrote \"Billy Bob loves Charlene\" in letters three-foot-high\nAnd the whole town said that the boy should've used red\nBut it looked good to Charlene in John Deere green\n\n[Bridge]\nNow more than once the town has discovered\nPainting over it ain't no use\nThere ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it\nThe heart keeps showing through\n\n[Chorus]\nIn John Deere green on a hot summer night\nHe wrote \"Billy Bob loves Charlene\" in letters three-foot-high\nAnd the whole town said that the

of Gray LyricsWhen the night lies so still\nBefore I go to sleep\nI come by, I come by\nJust to look at you\nIn the dim light I say\nThat in my own small way\nI will try, I will try\nTo help you through\n\nThere'll be blue skies falling\nThere'll be sad scenes and bad dreams\nIn a world so uncertain\nThrough the clouds it's hard to see\nI will grab you and lift you\nAs you hold on tight and sway\nWe'll go walking\nAcross the fields of gray\nThere's a place I can go\nWhen the world gets me down\nWhen nothing, when nothing\nGoes quite right it seems\nAs I look there I know\nFortune smiles on me so\nBut who knows, no one knows\nAbout tomorrow\n\nThere'll be blue skies falling\nThere'll be sad scenes and bad dreams\nIn a world so uncertain\nThrough the clouds it's hard to see\nI will grab you and lift you\nAs you hold on tight and sway\nWe'll go walking\nAcross the fields of gray\n\nWhen I was younger I saw things in black and white\nNow all I see is a sad, hazy gray\nSometimes I see a narrow flash of light\nSometimes I look and you show me the way\n\nNo matter what else happens\nWhat the future will be\nIn a world so uncertain\nThrough the clouds it's hard to see\nI will grab you and carry you\nCalm your fears if you're afraid\nWe'll go walking\nAcross the fields of graySee Bruce Hornsby LiveGet tickets as low as $71You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

Driblette again, she decided instead to drive up to Berkeley. She wanted to find out where Richard Wharfinger had got his information about Trystero. Possibly also take a look at how the inventor John Nefastis picked up his mail.\n\nAs with Mucho when she'd left Kinneret, Metzger did not seem desperate at her going. She debated, driving north, whether to stop off at home on the way to Berkeley or coming back. As it turned out she missed the exit for Kinneret and that solved it. She purred along up the east side of the bay, presently climbed into the Berkeley hills and arrived close to midnight at a sprawling, many-leveled, German-baroque hotel, carpeted in deep green, going in for curved corridors and ornamental chandeliers. A sign in the lobby said WELCOME CALIFORNIA CHAPTER AMERICAN DEAF-MUTE ASSEMBLY. Every light in the place burned, alarmingly bright; a truly ponderable silence occupied the building. A clerk popped up from behind the desk where he'd been sleeping and began making sign language at her. Oedipa considered giving him the finger to see what would happen. But she'd driven straight through, and all at once the fatigue of it had caught up with her. The clerk took her to a room with a reproduction of a Remedios Varo in it, through corridors gently curving as the streets of San Francisco, utterly silent. She fell asleep almost at once, but kept waking from a nightmare about something in the mirror, across from her bed.\n\nNothing specific, only a possibility, nothing she could see. When she finally did settle into sleep, she dreamed that Mucho, her husband, was making love to her on a soft white beach that was not part of any California she knew. When she woke in the morning, she was sitting bolt upright, staring into the mirror at her own exhausted face. She found the Lectern Press in a small office building on Shattuck Avenue. They didn't have Plays of Ford, Webster, Tourneur and Wharfinger on the premises, but did take her check for $12.50, gave her the address of their warehouse in Oakland and a receipt to show the people there. By the time she'd collected the book, it was afternoon. She skimmed through to find the line that had brought her all the way up here. And in the leaf-fractured sunlight, froze.\n\nNo hallowed skein of stars can ward, I trow, ran the couplet, Who once has crossed the lusts of Angela. \"No,\" she protested aloud. \" 'Who's once been set his tryst with Trystero.'\" The pencilled note in the paperback had mentioned a variant. But the paperback was supposed to be a straight reprint of the book she now held. Puzzled, she saw that this edition also had a footnote: According only to the Quarto edition (1687). The earlier Folio has a lead inserted where the closing line should have been. D'Amico has suggested that Wharfinger may have made a libellous comparison involving someone at court, and that the later 'restoration' was actually the work of the printer, Inigo Barfstable. The doubtful 'Whitechapel' version (c. 1670) has This tryst or odious awry, O Niccolo,' which besides bringing in a quite graceless Alexandrine, is difficult to make sense of syntactically, unless we accept the rather unorthodox though persuasive argument of J.-K. Sale that the line is really a pun on 'This trystero dies irae . . . .' This, however, it must be pointed out, leaves the line nearly as corrupt as before, owing to no clear meaning for the word trystero, unless it be a pseudo-Italianate variant on triste (= wretched, depraved). But the 'White-chapel' edition, besides being a fragment, abounds in such corrupt and probably spurious lines, as we have mentioned elsewhere, and is hardly to be trusted.\n\nThen where, Oedipa wondered, does the paperback I bought at Zapf's get off with its \"Trystero\" line? Was there yet another edition, besides the Quarto, Folio, and \"Whitechapel\" fragment? The editor's preface, signed this time, by one Emory Bortz, professor of English at Cal, mentioned none. She spent nearly an hour more, searching through all the footnotes, finding nothing.\n\"Dammit,\" she yelled, started the car and headed for the Berkeley campus, to find Professor Bortz. She should have remembered the date on the book 1957. Another world. The girl in the English office informed Oedipa that Professor Bortz was no longer with the faculty. He was teaching at San Francisco College, San Francisco, California.\nOf course, Odeipa thought, wry, where else? She copied the address and walked away trying to remember who'd put out the paperback. She couldn't. It was summer, a weekday, and midafternoon; no time for any campus Oedipa knew of to be jumping, yet this one was. She came downslope from Wheeler Hall, through Sather Gate into a plaza teeming with corduroy, denim, bare legs, blonde hair, horn rims, bicycle spokes in the sun, book bags, swaying card tables, long paper petitions dangling to earth, posters for undecipherable FSM's, YAF's, VDC's, suds in the fountain, students in nose-to-nose dialogue. She moved through it carrying her fat book, attracted, unsure, a stranger, wanting to feel relevant but knowing how much of a search among alternate universes it would take. For she had undergone her own educating at a time of nerves, blandness and retreat among not only her fellow students but also most of the visible structure around and ahead of them, this having been a national reflex to certain pathologies in high places only death had had the power to cure, and this Berkeley was like no somnolent Siwash out of her own past at all, but more akin to those Far Eastern or Latin American universities you read about, those autonomous culture media where the most beloved of folklores may be brought into doubt, cataclysmic of dissents voiced, suicidal of commitments chosen the sort that bring governments down.\n\nBut it was English she was hearing as she crossed Bancroft Way among the blonde children and the muttering Hondas and Su-zukis; American English. Where were Secretaries James and Foster and Senator Joseph, those dear daft numina who'd mothered over Oedipa's so temperate youth? In another world. Along another pattern of track, another string of decisions taken, switches closed, the faceless points men who'd thrown them now all transferred, deserted, in stir, fleeing the skip-tracers, out of their skull, on horse, alcoholic, fanatic, under aliases, dead, impossible to find ever again. Among them they had managed to turn the young Oedipa into a rare creature indeed, unfit perhaps for marches and sit-ins, but just a whiz at pursuing strange words in Jacobean texts.\nShe pulled the Impala into a gas station somewhere along a gray stretch of Telegraph Avenue and found in a phone book the address of John Nefastis. She then drove to a pseudo-Mexican apartment house, looked for his name among the U. S. mailboxes, ascended outside steps and walked down a row of draped windows till she found his door. He had a crew-cut and the same underage look as Koteks, but wore a shirt on various Polynesian themes and dating from the Truman administration.\n\nIntroducing herself, she invoked the name of Stanley Koteks. \"He said you could tell me whether or not I'm a 'sensitive'.\"Nefastis had been watching on his TV set a bunch of kids dancing some kind of a Watusi. \"I like to watch young stuff,\" he explained. \"There's something about a little chick that age.\"\n\"So does my husband,\" she said. \"I understand.\"John Nefastis beamed at her, simpatico, and brought out his Machine from a workroom in back. It looked about the way the patent had described it. \"You know how this works?\" \"Stanley gave me a kind of rundown.\" He began then, bewilderingly, to talk about something called entropy. The word bothered him as much as \"Trystero\" bothered Oedipa. But it was too technical for her. She did gather that there were two distinct kinds of this entropy. One having to do with heat-engines, the other to do with communication. The equation for one, back in the '3o's, had looked very like the equation for the other. It was a coincidence. The two fields were entirely unconnected, except at one point: Maxwell's Demon. As the Demon sat and sorted his molecules into hot and cold, the system was said to lose entropy. But somehow the loss was offset by the information the Demon gained about what molecules were where.\n\n\"Communication is the key,\" cried Nefastis. \"The Demon passes his data on to the sensitive, and the sensitive must reply in kind. There are untold billions of molecules in that box. The Demon collects data on each and every one. At some deep psychic level he must get through. The sensitive must receive that staggering set of energies, and feedback something like the same quantity of information. To keep it all cycling. On the secular level all we can see is one piston, hopefully moving. One little movement, against all that massive complex of information, destroyed over and over with each power stroke.\"\n\"Help,\" said Oedipa, \"you're not reaching me.\"\n\n\"Entropy is a figure of speech, then,\" sighed Nefastis, \"a metaphor. It connects the world of thermo-dynamics to the world of information flow. The Machine uses both. The Demon makes the metaphor not only verbally graceful, but also objectively true.\"\n\n\"But what,\" she felt like some kind of a heretic, \"if the Demon exists only because the two equations look alike? Because of the metaphor?\"\nNefastis smiled; impenetrable, calm, a believer. \"He existed for Clerk Maxwell long before the days of the metaphor.\"\n\nBut had Clerk Maxwell been such a fanatic about his Demon's reality? She looked at the picture on the outside of the box. Clerk Maxwell was in profile and would not meet her eyes. The forehead was round and smooth, and there was a curious bump at the back of his head, covered by curling hair. His visible eye seemed mild and noncommittal, but Oedipa wondered what hangups, crises, spookings in the middle of the night might be developed from the shadowed subtleties of his mouth, hidden under a full beard.\n\n\"Watch the picture,\" said Nefastis, \"and concentrate on a cylinder. Don't worry. If you're a sensitive you'll know which one. Leave your mind open, receptive to the Demon's message. I'll be back.\" He returned to his TV set, which was now showing cartoons. Oedipa sat through two Yogi Bears, one Magilla Gorilla and a Peter Potamus, staring at Clerk Maxwell's enigmatic profile, waiting for the Demon to communicate.\n\nAre you there, little fellow, Oedipa asked the Demon, or is Nefastis putting me on. Unless a piston moved, she'd never know. Clerk Maxwell's hands were cropped out of the photograph. He might have been holding a book. He gazed away, into some vista of Victorian England whose light had been lost forever. Oedipa's anxiety grew. It seemed, behind the beard, he'd begun, ever so faintly, to smile. Something in his eyes, certainly, had changed.\n\nAnd there. At the top edge of what she could see: hadn't the right-hand piston moved, a fraction? She couldn't look directly, the instructions were to keep her eyes on Clerk Maxwell. Minutes passed, pistons remained frozen in place. High-pitched, comic voices issued from the TV set. She had seen only a retinal twitch, a misfired nerve cell. Did the true sensitive see more? In her colon now she was afraid, growing more so, that nothing would happen. Why worry, she worried; Nefastis is a nut, forget it, a sincere nut. The true sensitive is the one that can share in the man's hallucinations, that's all.\n\nHow wonderful they might be to share. For fifteen minutes more she tried; repeating, if you are there, whatever you are, show yourself to me, I need you, show yourself. But nothing happened.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she called in, surprisingly about to cry with frustration, her voice breaking, \"It's no use.\" Nefastis came to her and put an arm around her shoulders. \"It's OK,\" he said. \"Please don't cry. Come on in on the couch. The news will be on any minute. We can do it there.\"\"It?\" said Oedipa. \"Do it? What?\"\"Have sexual intercourse,\" replied Nefastis. \"Maybe there'll be something about China tonight. I like to do it while they talk about Viet Nam, but China is best of all. You think about all those Chinese. Teeming. That profusion of life. It makes it sexier, right?\"\"Gah,\" Oedipa screamed, and fled, Nefastis snapping his fingers through the dark rooms behind her in a hippy-dippy, oh-go-ahead-then-chick fashion he had doubtless learned from watching the TV also.\n\"Say hello to old Stanley,\" he called as she pattered down the steps into the street, flung a babushka over her license plate and screeched away down Telegraph. She drove more or less automatically until a swift boy in a Mustang, perhaps unable to contain the new sense of virility his auto gave him, nearly killed her and she realized that she was on the freeway, heading irreversibly for the Bay Bridge. It was the middle of rush hour. Oedipa was appalled at the spectacle, having thought such traffic only possible in Los Angeles, places like that. Looking down at San Francisco a few minutes later from the high point of the bridge's arc, she saw smog.\n\nHaze, she corrected herself, is what it is, haze. How can they have smog in San Francisco? Smog, according to the folklore, did not begin till farther south. It had to be the angle of the sun. Amid the exhaust, sweat, glare and ill-humor of a summer evening on an American freeway, Oedipa Maas pondered her Trystero problem. All the silence of San Francisco,the calm surface of the motel pool, the contemplative contours of residential streets like rakings in the sand of a Japanese garden had not allowed her to think as leisurely as this freeway madness. For John Nefastis (to take a recent example) two kinds of entropy, thermodynamic and informational, happened, say by coincidence, to look alike, when you wrote them down as equations. Yet he had made his mere coincidence respectable, with the help of Maxwell's Demon. Now here was Oedipa, faced with a metaphor of God knew how many parts; more than two, anyway.\n\nWith coincidences blossoming these days wherever she looked, she had nothing but a sound, a word, Trystero, a to hold them together. She knew a few things about it: it had opposed the Thurn and Taxis postal system in Europe; its symbol was a muted post horn; sometime before 1853 it had appeared in America and fought the Pony Express and Wells, Fargo, either as outlaws in black, or disguised as Indians; and it survived today, in California, serving as a channel of communication for those of unorthodox sexual persuasion, inventors who believed in the reality of Maxwell's Demon, possibly her own husband, Mucho Maas (but she'd thrown Mucho's letter long away, there was no way for Genghis Cohen to check the stamp, so if she wanted to find out for sure she'd have to ask Mucho himself).\n\nEither Trystero did exist, in its own right, or it was being presumed, perhaps fantasied by Oedipa, so hung up on and interpenetrated with the dead man's estate. Here in San Francisco, away from all tangible assets of that estate, there might still be a chance of getting the whole thing to go away and disintegrate quietly. She had only to drift tonight, at random, and watch nothing happen, to be convinced it was purely nervous, a little something for her shrink to fix. She got off the freeway at North Beach, drove around, parked finally in a steep side-street among warehouses. Then walked along Broadway, into the first crowds of evening.\n\nBut it took her no more than an hour to catch sight of a muted post horn. She was moseying along a street full of aging boys in Roos Atkins suits when she collided with a gang of guided tourists come rowdy-dowing out of a Volkswagen bus, on route to take in a few San Francisco nite spots. \"Let me lay this on you,\" a voice spoke into her ear, \"because I just left,\" and she found being deftly pinned outboard of one breast this big cerise ID badge, reading Hi! MY NAME Is Arnold Snarb! AND I'M LOOKIN' FOR A GOOD TIME! Oedipa glanced around and saw a cherubic face vanishing with a wink in among natural shoulders and striped shirts, and away went Arnold Snarb, looking for a better time.\nSomebody blew on an athletic whistle and Oedipa found herself being herded, along with other badged citizens, toward a bar called The Greek Way. Oh, no, Oedipa thought, not a fag joint, no; and for a minute tried to fight out of the human surge, before recalling how she had decided to drift tonight.\n\"Now in here,\" their guide, sweating dark tentacles into his tab collar, briefed them, \"you are going to see the members of the third sex, the lavender crowd this city by the Bay is so justly famous for. To some of you the experience may seem a little queer, but remember, try not to act like a bunch of tourists. If you get propositioned it'll all be in fun, just part of the gay night life to be found here in famous North Beach. Two drinks and when you hear the whistle it means out, on the double, regroup right here. If you're well behaved we'll hit Finocchio's next.\"\n\nHe blew the whistle twice and the tourists, breaking into a yell, swept Oedipa inside, in a frenzied assault on the bar. When things had calmed she was near the door with an unidentifiable drink in her fist, jammed against somebody tall in a suede sport coat. In the lapel of which she spied, wrought exquisitely in some pale, glimmering alloy, not another cerise badge, but a pin in the shape of the Trystero post horn. Mute and everything.\n\nAll right, she told herself. You lose. A game try, all one hour's worth. She should have left then and gone back to Berkeley, to the hotel. But couldn't.\n\"What if I told you,\" she addressed the owner of the pin, \"that I was an agent of Thurn and Taxis?\"\n\n\"What,\" he answered, \"some theatrical agency?\" He had large ears, hair cropped nearly to his scalp, acne on his face, and curiously empty eyes, which now swiveled briefly to Oedipa's breasts. \"How'd you get a name like Arnold Snarb?\"\n\"If you tell me where you got your lapel pin,\" said Oedipa.\"Sorry.\"\n\nShe sought to bug him: \"If it's a homosexual sign or something, that doesn't bother me.\"Eyes showing nothing: \"I don't swing that way,\" he said. \"Yours either.\" Turned his back on her and ordered a drink. Oedipa took off her badge, put it in an ashtray and said, quietly, trying not to suggest hysteria, \"Look, you have to help me. Because I really think I am going out of my head.\"\n\"You have the wrong outfit, Arnold. Talk to your clergyman.\"\n\n\"I use the U. S. Mail because I was never taught any different,\" she pleaded. \"But I'm not your enemy. I don't want to be.\" \"What about my friend?\" He came spinning around on the stool to face her again. \"You want to be that, Arnold?\" \"I don't know,\" she thought she'd better say. He looked at her, blank. \"What do you know?\" She told him everything. Why not? Held nothing back. At the end of it the tourists had been whistled away and he'd bought two rounds to Oedipa's three. \"I'd heard about 'Kirby,'\" he said, \"it's a code name, nobody real. But none of the rest, your Sinophile across the bay, or that sick play. I never thought there was a history to it.\"\"I think of nothing but,\" she said, and a little plaintive.\"And,\" scratching the stubble on his head, \"you have nobody else to tell this to. Only somebody in a bar whose name you don't know?\"\nShe wouldn't look at him. \"I guess not.\" \"No husband, no shrink?\" \"Both,\" Oedipa said, \"but they don't know.\"\"You can't tell them?\" She met his eyes' void for a second after all, and shrugged. \"I'll tell you what I know, then,\" he decided. \"The pin I'm wearing means I'm a member of the IA. That's Inamorati Anonymous. An inamorato is somebody in love. That's the worst addiction of all.\"\n\"Somebody is about to fall in love,\" Oedipa said, \"you go sit with them, or something?\" \"Right. The whole idea is to get to where you don't need it. I was lucky. I kicked it young. But there aresixty-year-old men, believe it or not, and women even older, who wake up in the night screaming.\" \"You hold meetings, then, like the AA?\" \"No, of course not. You get a phone number, an answering service you can call. Nobody knows anybody else's name; just the number in case it gets so bad you can't handle it alone. We're isolates, Arnold. Meetings would destroy the whole point of it.\" \"What about the person who comes to sit with you? Suppose you fall in love with them?\"\n\n\"They go away,\" he said. \"You never see them twice. The answering service dispatches them, and they're careful not to have any repeats.\"How did the post horn come in? That went back to their founding. In the early '6o's a Yoyodyne executive living near L.A. and located someplace in the corporate root-system above supervisor but below vice-president, found himself, at age 39, automated out of a job. Having been since age 7 rigidly instructed in an eschatology that pointed nowhere but to a presidency and death, trained to do absolutely nothing but sign his name to specialized memoranda he could not begin to understand and to take blame for the running-amok of specialized programs that failed for specialized reasons he had to have explained to him, the executive's first thoughts were naturally of suicide. But previous training got the better of him: he could not make the decision without first hearing the ideas of a committee. He placed an ad in the personal column of the L.A.\n\nTimes, asking whether anyone who'd been in the same fix had ever found any good reasons for not committing suicide. His shrewd assumption being that no suicides would reply, leaving him automatically with only valid inputs. The assumption was false. After a week of anxiously watching the mailbox through little Japanese binoculars his wife had given him for a going-away present (she'd left him the day after he was pink-slipped) and getting nothing but sucker-list stuff through the regular deliveries that came each noon, he was jolted out of a boozy, black-and-white dream of jumping off The Stack into rush-hour traffic, by an insistent banging at the door. It was late on a Sunday afternoon. He opened his door and found an aged bum with a knitted watch cap on his head and a hook for a hand, who presented him with a bundle of letters and loped away without a word. Most of the letters were from suicides who had failed, either through clumsiness or last-minute cowardice. None of them, however, could offer any compelling reasons for staying alive.\n\nStill the executive dithered: spent another week with pieces of paper on which he would list, in columns headed \"pro\" and \"con,\" reasons for and against taking his Brody. He found it impossible, in the absence of some trigger, to come to any clear decision. Finally one day he noticed a front page story in the Times, complete with AP wire photo, about a Buddhist monk in Viet Nam who had set himself on fire to protest government policies. \"Groovy!\" cried the executive. He went to the garage, siphoned all the gasoline from his Buick's tank, put on his green Zachary All suit with the vest, stuffed all his letters from unsuccessful suicides into a coat pocket, went in the kitchen, sat on the floor, proceeded to douse himself good with the gasoline. He was about to make the farewell flick of the wheel on his faithful Zippo, which had seen him through the Norman hedgerows, the Ardennes, Germany, and postwar America, when he heard a key in the front door, and voices. It was his wife and some man, whom he soon recognized as the very efficiency expert at Yoyodyne who had caused him to be replaced by an IBM 7094.\n\nIntrigued by the irony of it, he sat in the kitchen and listened, leaving his necktie dipped in the gasoline as a sort of wick. From what he could gather, the efficiency expert wished to have sexual intercourse with the wife on the Moroccan rug in the living room. The wife was not unwilling. The executive heard lewd laughter, zippers, the thump of shoes, heavy breathing, moans. He took his tie out of the gasoline and started to snigger. He closed the top on his Zippo. \"I hear laughing,\" his wife said presently. \"I smell gasoline,\" said the efficiency expert. Hand in hand, naked, the two proceeded to the kitchen. \"I was about to do the Buddhist monk thing,\" explained the executive. \"Nearly three weeks it takes him,\" marvelled the efficiency expert, \"to decide. You know how long it would've taken the IBM 7094? Twelve microseconds. No wonder you were replaced.\" The executive threw back his head and laughed for a solid ten minutes, along toward the middle of which his wife and her friend, alarmed, retired, got dressed and went out looking for the police.\n\nThe executive undressed, showered and hung his suit out on the line to dry. Then he noticed a curious thing. The stamps on some of the letters in his suit pocket had turned almost white. He realized that the gasoline must have dissolved the printing ink. Idly, he peeled off a stamp and saw suddenly the image of the muted post horn, the skin of his hand showing clearly through the watermark. \"A sign,\" he whispered, \"is what it is.\" If he'd been a religious man he would have fallen to his knees. As it was, he only declared, with great solemnity: \"My big mistake was love. From this day I swear to stay off of love: hetero, homo, bi, dog or cat, car, every kind there is. I will found a society of isolates, dedicated to this purpose, and this sign, revealed by the same gasoline that almost destroyed me, will be its emblem.\" And he did.Oedipa, by now rather drunk, said, \"Where is he now?\"\n\n\"He's anonymous,\" said the anonymous inamorato. \"Why not write to him through your WASTE system? Say 'Founder, IA.'\" \"But I don't know how to use it,\" she said. \"Think of it,\" he went on, also drunk. \"A whole underworld of suicides who failed. All keeping in touch through that secret delivery system. What do they tell each other?\" He shook his head, smiling, stumbled off his stool and headed off to take a leak, disappearing into the dense crowd. He didn't come back.\n\nOedipa sat, feeling as alone as she ever had, now the only woman, she saw, in a room full of drunken male homosexuals. Story of my life, she thought, Mucho won't talk to me, Hilarius won't listen, Clerk Maxwell didn't even look at me, and this group, God knows. Despair came over her, as it will when nobody around has any sexual relevance to you. She gauged the spectrum of feeling out there as running from really violent hate (an Indian-looking kid hardly out of his teens, with frosted shoulder-length hair tucked behind his ears and pointed cowboy boots) to dry speculation (a horn-rimmed SS type who stared at her legs, trying to figure out if she was in drag), none of which could do her any good. So she got up after a while and left The Greek Way, and entered the city again, the infected city.\n\nAnd spent the rest of the night finding the image of the Trystero post horn. In Chinatown, in the dark window of a herbalist, she thought she saw it on a sign among ideographs. But the streetlight was dim. Later, on a sidewalk, she saw two of them in chalk, 20 feet apart. Between them a complicated array of boxes, some with letters, some with numbers. A kids' game? Places on a. map, dates from a secret history? She copied the diagram in her memo book. When she looked up, a man, perhaps a man, in a black suit, was standing in a doorway half a block away, watching her. She thought she saw a turned-around collar but took no chances; headed back the way she'd come, pulse thundering. A bus stopped at the next corner, and she ran to catch it.\n\nShe stayed with buses after that, getting off only now and then to walk so she'd keep awake. What fragments of dreams came had to do with the post horn. Later, possibly, she would have trouble sorting the night into real and dreamed.At some indefinite passage in night's sonorous score, it also came to her that she would be safe, that something, perhaps only her linearly fading drunkenness, would protect her. The city was hers, as, made up and sleeked so with the customary words and images (cosmopolitan, culture, cable cars) it had not been before: she had safe-passage tonight to its far blood's branching\u2019s, be they capillaries too small for more than peering into, or vessels mashed together in shameless municipal hickeys, out on the skin for all but tourists to see. Nothing of the nights could touch her; nothing did. The repetition of symbols was to be enough, without trauma as well perhaps to attenuate it or even jar it altogether loose from her memory.\n\nShe was meant to remember. She faced that possibility as she might the toy street from a high balcony, roller-coaster ride, feeding-time among the beasts in a zoo any death-wish that can be consummated by some minimum gesture. She touched the edge of its voluptuous field, knowing it would be lovely beyond dreams simply to submit to it; that not gravity's pull, laws of ballistics, feral ravening, promised more delight. She tested it, shivering: I am meant to remember. Each clue that comes is supposed to have its own clarity, its fine chances for permanence. But then she wondered if the gem-like \"clues\" were only some kind of compensation. To make up for her having lost the direct, epileptic Word, the cry that might abolish the night.\n\nIn Golden Gate Park she came on a circle of children in their nightclothes, who told her they were dreaming the gathering. But that the dream was really no different from being awake, because in the mornings when they got up they felt tired, as if they'd been up most of the night. When their mothers thought they were out playing they were really curled in cupboards of neighbors' houses, in platforms up in trees, in secretly-hollowed nests inside hedges, sleeping, making up for these hours. The night was empty of all terror for them, they had inside their circle an imaginary fire, and needed nothing but their own unpenetrated sense of community. They knew about the post horn, but nothing of the chalked game Oedipa had seen on the sidewalk. You used only one image and it was a jump-rope game, a little girl explained: you stepped alternately in the loop, the bell, and the mute, while your girlfriend sang:\n\nTristoe, Tristoe, one, two, three, Turning taxi from across the sea ... \"Thurn and Taxis, you mean?\" They'd never heard it that way. Went on warming their hands at an invisible fire. Oedipa, to retaliate, stopped believing in them.\nIn an all-night Mexican greasy spoon off 24th, she found a piece of her past, in the form of one Jesus Arrabal, who was sitting in a corner under the TV set, idly stirring his bowl of opaque soup with the foot of a chicken. \"Hey,\" he greeted Oedipa, \"you were the lady in Mazatlan.\" He beckoned her to sit.\n\"You remember everything,\" Oedipa said, \"Jesus; even tourists. How is your CIA?\" Standing not for the agency you think, but for a clandestine Mexican outfit known as the Conjuration de los Insurgentes Anarquis-tas, traceable back to the time of the Flores Mag6n brothers and later briefly allied with Zapata.\n\"You see. In exile,\" waving his arm around at the place. He was part-owner here with a yucateco who still believed in the Revolution. Their Revolution. \"And you. Are you still with that gringo who spent too much money on you? The oligarchist, the miracle?\" \"He died.\"\n\n\"Ah, pobrecito.\" They had met Jesus Arrabal on the beach, where he had previously announced an anti-government rally. Nobody had showed up. So he fell to talking to Inverarity, the enemy he must, to be true to his faith, learn. Pierce, because of his neutral manners when in the presence of ill-will, had nothing to tell Arrabal; he played the rich, obnoxious gringo so perfectly that Oedipa had seen gooseflesh come up along the anarchist's forearms, due to no Pacific sea-breeze. Soon as Pierce went off to sport in the surf, Arrabal asked her if he was real, or a spy, or making fun of him. Oedipa didn't understand.\n\"You know what a miracle is. Not what Bakunin said. But another world's intrusion into this one. Most of the time we coexist peacefully, but when we do touch there's cataclysm. Like the church we hate, anarchists also believe in another world. Where revolutions break out spontaneous and leaderless, and the soul's talent for consensus allows the masses to work together without effort, automatic as the body itself. And yet, sena, if any of it should ever really happen that perfectly, I would also have to cry miracle. An anarchist miracle. Like your friend. He is too exactly and without flaw the thing we fight. In Mexico the privilegiado is always, to a finite percentage, redeemed one of the people. Unmiraculous. But your friend, unless he's joking, is as terrifying to me as a Virgin appearing to an Indian.\"\n\nIn the years intervening Oedipa had remembered Jesus because he'd seen that about Pierce and she hadn't. As if he were, in some unsexual way, competition. Now, drinking thick lukewarm coffee from a clay pot on the back burner of the yucateco's stove and listening to Jesus talk conspiracy, she wondered if, without the miracle of Pierce to reassure him, Jesus might not have quit his CIA eventually and gone over like everybody else to the majority priistas, and so never had to go into exile.\n\nThe dead man, like Maxwell's Demon, was the linking feature in a coincidence. Without him neither she nor Jesus would be exactly here, exactly now. It was enough, a coded warning. What, tonight, was chance? So her eyes did fall presently onto an ancient rolled copy of the anarcho-syndicalist paper Regeneration. The date was 1904 and there was no stamp next to the cancellation, only the hands truck image of the post horn.\n\n\"They arrive,\" said Arrabal. \"Have they been in the mails that long? Has my name been substituted for that of a member who's died? Has it really taken sixty years? Is it a reprint? Idle questions, I am a foot soldier. The\nhigher levels have their reasons.\" She carried this thought back out into the night with her. Down at the city beach, long after the pizza stands and rides had closed, she walked unmolested through a drifting, dreamy cloud of delinquents in summer-weight gang jackets with the post horn stitched on in thread that looked pure silver in what moonlight there was. They had all been smoking, snuffing or injecting something, and perhaps did not see her at all.\nRiding among an exhausted bashful of Negroes going on to graveyard shifts all over the city, she saw scratched on the back of a seat, shining for her in the brilliant smoky interior, the post horn with the legend DEATH. But unlike WASTE, somebody had troubled to write in, in pencil: DON'T EVER ANTAGONIZE THE\nHORN.\n\nSomewhere near Fillmore she found the symbol tacked to the bulletin board of a Laundromat, among other scraps of paper offering cheap ironing and baby sitters. If you know what this means, the note said, you know where to find out more. Around her the odor of chlorine bleach rose heavenward, like an incense. Machines chugged and sloshed fiercely. Except for Oedipa the place was deserted, and the fluorescent bulbs seemed to shriek whiteness, to which everything their light touched was dedicated. It was a Negro neighborhood. Was The Horn so dedicated? Would it Antagonize The Horn to ask? Who could she ask?\nIn the buses all night she listened to transistor radios playing songs in the lower stretches of the Top 200, that would never become popular, whose melodies and lyrics would perish as if they had never been sung. A Mexican girl, trying to hear one of these through snarling static from the bus's motor, hummed along as if she would remember it always, tracing post horns and hearts with a fingernail, in the haze of her breath on the window.\n\nOut at the airport Oedipa, feeling invisible, eavesdropped on a poker game whose steady loser entered each loss neat and conscientious in a little balance-book decorated inside with scrawled post horns. \"I'm averaging a 99.375 percent return, fellas,\" she heard him say. The others, strangers, looked at him, some blank, some annoyed. \"That's averaging it out, over 23 years,\" he went on, trying a smile. \"Always just that little percent on the wrong side of breaking even. Twenty-three years. I'll never get ahead of it. Why don't I quit?\" Nobody answering.\n\nIn one of the latrines was an advertisement by AC-DC, standing for Alameda County Death Cult, along with a box number and post horn. Once a month they were to choose some victim from among the innocent, the virtuous, the socially integrated and well-adjusted, using him sexually, then sacrificing him. Oedipa did not copy the number. Catching a TWA flight to Miami was an uncoordinated boy who planned to slip at night into aquariums and open negotiations with the dolphins, who would succeed man. He was kissing his mother passionately goodbye, using his tongue. \"I'll write, ma,\" he kept saying. \"Write by WASTE,\" she said, \"remember. The government will open it if you use the other. The dolphins will be mad.\" \"I love you, ma,\" he said. \"Love the dolphins,\" she advised him. \"Write by WASTE.\"\n\nSo it went. Oedipa played the voyeur and listener. Among her other encounters were a facially-deformed welder, who cherished his ugliness; a child roaming the night who missed the death before birth as certain outcasts do the dear lulling blankness of the community; a Negro woman with an intricately-marbled scar along the baby-fat of one cheek who kept going through rituals of miscarriage each for a different reason, deliberately as others might the ritual of birth, dedicated not to continuity but to some kind of interregnum; an aging night-watchman, nibbling at a bar of Ivory Soap, who had trained his virtuoso stomach to accept also lotions, air-fresheners, fabrics, tobaccos and waxes in a hopeless attempt to assimilate it all, all the promise, productivity, betrayal, ulcers, before it was too late; and even another voyeur, who hung outside one of the city's still-lighted windows, searching for who knew what specific image. Decorating each alienation, each species of withdrawal, as cufflink, decal, aimless doodling, there was somehow always the post horn. She grew so to expect it that perhaps she did not see it quite as often as she later was to remember seeing it. A couple-three times would really have been enough. Or too much.\n\nShe busrode and walked on into the lightening morning, giving herself up to a fatalism rare for her. Where was the Oedipa who'd driven so bravely up here from San Francisco? That optimistic baby had come on so like the private eye in any long-ago radio drama, believing all you needed was grit, resourcefulness, exemption from hidebound cops' rules, to solve any great mystery.\nBut the private eye sooner or later has to get beat up on. This night's profusion of post horns, this malignant, deliberate replication, was their way of beating up. They knew her pressure points, and the ganglia of her optimism, and one by one, pinch by precision pinch, they were immobilizing her.\nLast night, she might have wondered what undergrounds apart from the couple she knew of communicated by WASTE system. By sunrise she could legitimately ask what undergrounds didn't. If miracles were, as Jesus Arrabal had postulated years ago on the beach at Mazatlan, intrusions into this world from another, a kiss of cosmic pool balls, then so must be each of the night's post horns.\n\nFor here were God knew how many citizens, deliberately choosing not to communicate by U. S. Mail. It was not an act of treason, nor possibly even of defiance. But it was a calculated withdrawal, from the life of the Republic, from its machinery. Whatever else was being denied them out of hate, indifference to the power of their vote, loopholes, simple ignorance, this withdrawal was their own, un-publicized, private. Since they could not have withdrawn into a vacuum (could they?), there had to exist the separate, silent, unsuspected world.\n\nJust before the morning rush hour, she got out of a jitney whose ancient driver ended each day in the red, downtown on Howard Street, began to walk toward the Embarcadero. She knew she looked terrible knuckles black with eye-liner and mascara from where she'd rubbed, mouth tasting of old booze and coffee. Through an open doorway, on the stair leading up into the disinfectant-smelling twilight of a rooming house she saw an old man huddled, shaking with grief she couldn't hear. Both hands, smoke-white, covered his face. On the back of the left hand she made out the post horn, tattooed in old ink now beginning to blur and spread. Fascinated, she came into the shadows and ascended creaking steps, hesitating on each one. When she was three steps from him the hands flew apart and his wrecked face, and the terror of eyes gloried in burst veins, stopped her.\n\n\"Can I help?\" She was shaking, tired. \"My wife's in Fresno,\" he said. He wore an old double-breasted suit, frayed gray shirt, wide tie, no hat. \"I left her. So long ago, I don't remember. Now this is for her.\" He gave Oedipa a letter that looked like he'd been carrying it around for years. \"Drop it in the,\" and he held up the tattoo and stared into her eyes, \"you know. I can't go out there. It's too far now, I had a bad night.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said. \"But I'm new in town. I don't know where it is.\"\"Under the freeway.\" He waved her on in the direction she'd been going. \"Always one. You'll see it.\" The eyes closed. Cammed each night out of that safe furrow the bulk of this city's waking each sunrise again set virtuously to plowing, what rich soils had he turned, what concentric planets uncovered? What voices overheard, flinders of luminescent gods glimpsed among the wallpaper's stained foliage, candlestubs lit to rotate in the air over him, prefiguring the cigarette he or a friend must fall asleep someday smoking, thus to end among the flaming, secret salts held all those years by the insatiable stuffing of a mattress that could keep vestiges of every nightmare sweat, helpless overflowing bladder, viciously, tearfully consummated wet dream, like the memory bank to a computer of the lost? She was overcome all at once by a need to touch him, as if she could not believe in him, or would not remember him, without it.\n\nExhausted, hardly knowing what she was doing, she came the last three steps and sat, took the man in her arms, actually held him, gazing out of her smudged eyes down the stairs, back into the morning. She felt wetness against her breast and saw that he was crying again. He hardly breathed but tears came as if being pumped. \"I can't help,\" she whispered, rocking him, \"I can't help.\" It was already too many miles to Fresno. \"Is that him?\" a voice asked behind her, up the stairs. \"The sailor?\" \"He has a tattoo on his hand.\" \"Can you bring him up OK? That's him.\" She turned and saw an even older man, shorter, wearing a tall Homburg hat and smiling at them. \"I'd help you but I got a little arthritis.\" \"Does he have to come up?\" she said. \"Up there?\" \"Where else, lady?\" She didn't know. She let go of him for a moment, reluctant as if he were her own child, and he looked up at her. \"Come on,\" she said. He reached out the tattooed hand and she took that, and that was how they went the rest of the way up that flight, and then the two more: hand in hand, very slowly for the man with arthritis.\n\n\"He disappeared last night,\" he told her. \"Said he was going looking for his old lady. It's a thing he does, off and on.\" They entered a warren of rooms and corridors, lit by lo-watt bulbs, separated by beaverboard partitions. The old man followed them stiffly. At last he said, \"Here.\" In the little room were another suit, a couple of religious tracts, a rug, a chair. A picture of a saint, changing well-water to oil for Jerusalem's Easter lamps. Another bulb, dead. The bed. The mattress, waiting. She ran through then a scene she might play. She might find the landlord of this place, and bring him to court, and buy the sailor a new suit at Roos/Atkins, and shirt, and shoes, and give him the bus fare to Fresno after all. But with a sigh he had released her hand, while she was so lost in the fantasy that she hadn't felt it go away, as if he'd known the best moment to let go.\"Just mail the letter,\" he said, \"the stamp is on it.\" She looked and saw the familiar carmine 8^ airmail, with a jet flying by the Capitol dome. But at the top of the dome stood a tiny figure in deep black, with its arms outstretched. Oedipa wasn't sure what exactly was supposed to be on top of the Capitol, but knew it wasn't anything like that.\n\"Please,\" the sailor said. \"Go on now. You don't want to stay here.\" She looked in her purse, found a ten and a single, gave him the ten. \"I'll spend it on booze,\" he said.\n\n\"Remember your friends,\" said the arthritic, watching the ten.\"Bitch,\" said the sailor. \"Why didn't you wait till he was gone?\" Oedipa watched him make adjustments so he'd fit easier against the mattress. That stuffed memory. Regis-tera \"Give me a cigarette, Ramirez,\" the sailor said. \"I know you got one.\" Would it be today? \"Ramirez,\" she cried. The arthritic looked around on his rusty neck. \"He's going to die,\" she said.\"Who isn't?\" said Ramirez.\nShe remembered John Nefastis, talking about his Machine, and massive destruction of information. So when this mattress flared up around the sailor, in his Viking's funeral: the stored, coded years of uselessness, early death, self-harrowing, the sure decay of hope, the set of all men who had slept on it, whatever their lives had been, would truly cease to be, forever, when the mattress burned. She stared at it in wonder. It was as if she had just discovered the irreversible process. It astonished her to think that so much could be lost, even the quantity of hallucination belonging just to the sailor that the world would bear no further trace of. She knew, because she had held him, that he suffered DT's.\n\nBehind the initials was a metaphor, a delirium tremens, a trembling unfurrowing of the mind's plowshare. The saint whose water can light lamps, the clairvoyant whose lapse in recall is the breath of God, the true paranoid for whom all is organized in spheres joyful or threatening about the central pulse of himself, the dreamer whose puns probe ancient fetid shafts and tunnels of truth all act in the same special relevance to the word, or whatever it is the word is there, buffering, to protect us from. The act of metaphor then was a 7 thrust at truth and a lie, depending where you were: inside, safe, or outside, lost. Oedipa did not know where she was. Trembling, unfurrowed, she slipped sidewise, screeching back across grooves of years, to hear again the earnest, high voice of her second or third collegiate love Ray Glozing bitching among \"uhs\" and the syncopated tonguing of a cavity, about his freshman calculus; \"dt,\" God help this old tattooed man, meant also a time differential, a vanishingly small instant in which change had to be confronted at last for what it was, where it could no longer disguise itself as something innocuous like an average rate; where velocity dwelled in the projectile though the projectile be frozen in midflight, where death dwelled in the cell though the cell be looked in on at its most quick.\n\nShe knew that the sailor had seen worlds no other man had seen if only because there was that high magic to low puns, because DT's must give access to dt's of spectra beyond the known sun, music made purely of Antarctic loneliness and fright. But nothing she knew of would preserve them, or him. She gave him goodbye, walked downstairs and then on, in the direction he'd told her. For an hour she prowled among the sunless, concrete underpinnings of the freeway, finding drunks, bums, pedestrians, pederasts, hookers, walking psychotic, no secret mailbox. But at last in the shadows she did come on a can with a swinging trapezoidal top, the kind you throw trash in: old and green, nearly four feet high. On the swinging part were hand-painted the initials W.A.S.T.E. She had to look closely to see the periods between the letters.\nOedipa settled back in the shadow of a column. She may have dozed off. She woke to see a kid dropping a bundle of letters into- the can. She went over and dropped in the sailor's letter to Fresno; then hid again and waited. Toward midday a rangy young wino showed up with a sack; unlocked a panel at the side of the box and took out all the letters. Oedipa gave him half a block's start, then began to tail him. Congratulating herself on having thought to wear flats, at least. The carrier led her across Market then over toward City Hall. In a street close enough to the drab, stone openness of the Civic Center to be infected by its gray, he rendezvoused with another carrier, and they exchanged sacks. Oedipa decided to stick with the one she'd been following. She tailed him all the way back down the littered, shifty, loud length of Market and over on First Street to the trans-bay bus terminal, where he bought a ticket for Oakland. So did Oedipa.\n\nThey rode over the bridge and into the great, empty glare of the Oakland afternoon. The landscape lost all variety. The carrier got off in a neighborhood Oedipa couldn't identify. She followed him for hours along streets whose names she never knew, across arterials that even with the afternoon's lull nearly murdered her, into slums and out, up long hillsides jammed solid with two- or three-bedroom houses, all their windows giving blankly back only the sun. One by one his sack of letters emptied. At length he climbed on a Berkeley bus. Oedipa followed. Halfway up Telegraph the carrier got off and led her down the street to a pseudo-Mexican apartment house. Not once had he looked behind him. John Nefastis lived here. She was back where she'd started, and could not believe 24 hours had passed. Should it have been more or less?\nBack in the hotel she found the lobby full of deaf-mute delegates in party hats, copied in crepe paper after the fur Chinese communist jobs made popular during the Korean conflict. They were every one of them drunk, and a few of the men grabbed her, thinking to bring her along to a party in the grand ballroom. She tried to struggle out of the silent, gesturing swarm, but was too weak. Her legs ached, her mouth tasted horrible. They swept her on into the ballroom, where she was seized about the waist by a handsome young man in a Harris tweed coat and waltzed round and round, through the rustling, shuffling hush, under a great unlit chandelier. Each couple on the floor danced whatever was in the fellow's head: tango, two-step, bossa nova, slop.\n\nBut how long, Oedipa thought, could it go on before collisions became a serious hindrance? There would have to be collisions. The only alternative was some unthinkable order of music, many rhythms, all keys at once, a choreography in which each couple meshed easy, predestined. Something they all heard with an extra sense atrophied in herself. She followed her partner's lead, limp in the young mute's clasp, waiting for the collisions to begin. But none came. She was danced for half an hour before, by mysterious consensus, everybody took a break, without having felt any touch but the touch of her partner. Jesus Arrabal would have called it an anarchist miracle. Oedipa, withno name for it, was only demoralized. She curtsied and fled.\n\nNext day, after twelve hours of sleep and no dreams to speak of, Oedipa checked out of the hotel and drove down the peninsula to Kinneret. She had decided on route, with time to think about the day preceding, to go see Dr Hilarius her shrink, and tell him all. She might well be in the cold and sweatless meathooks of a psychosis. With her own eyes she had verified a WASTE system: seen two WASTE postmen, a WASTE mailbox, WASTE stamps, WASTE cancellations. And the image of the muted post horn all but saturating the Bay Area. Yet she wanted it all to be fantasy some clear result of her several wounds, needs, dark doubles. She wanted Hilarius to tell her she was some kind of a nut and needed a rest, and that there was no Trystero. She also wanted to know why the chance of its being real should menace her so.\n\nShe pulled into the drive at Hilarius's clinic a little after sunset. The light in his office didn't seem to be on. Eucalyptus branches blew in a great stream of air that flowed downhill, sucked to the evening sea. Halfway along the flagstone path, she was startled by an insect whirring loudly past her ear, followed at once by the sound of a gunshot. That was no insect, thought Oedipa, at which point, hearing another shot, she made the connection. In the fading light she was a clear target; the only way to go was toward the clinic. She dashed up to the glass doors, found them locked, the lobby inside dark. Oedipa picked up a rock next to a flower bed and heaved it at one of the doors. It bounced off. She was looking around for another rock when a white shape appeared inside, fluttering up to the door and unlocking it for her. It was Helga Blamm, Hilarius's sometime assistant.\n\n\"Hurry,\" she chattered, as Oedipa slipped inside. The woman was close to hysterical.\"What's happening?\" Oedipa said.\"He's gone crazy. I tried to call the police, but he took a chair and smashed the switchboard with it.\" \"Dr Hilarius?\" \"He thinks someone's after him.\" Tear streaks had meandered down over the nurse's cheekbones. \"He's locked himself in the office with that rifle.\" A Gewehr 43, from the war, Oedipa recalled, that he kept as a souvenir. \"He shot at me. Do you think anybody will report it?\" \"Well he's shot at half a dozen people,\" replied Nurse Blamm, leading Oedipa down a corridor to her office. \"Somebody better report it.\" Oedipa noticed that the window opened on a safe line of retreat.\"You could've run,\" she said. Blamm, running hot water from a washbasin tap into cups and stirring in instant coffee, looked up, quizzical. \"He might need somebody.\"\"Who's supposed to be after him?\"\n\"Three men with submachine guns, he said. Terrorists, fanatics, that was all I got. He started breaking up the PBX.\" She gave Oedipa a hostile look. \"Too many nutty broads, that's what did it. Kinneret is full of nothing but. He couldn't cope.\"\n\n\"I've been away for a while,\" Oedipa said. \"Maybe I could find out what it is. Maybe I'd be less of a threat for him.\" Blamm burned her mouth on the coffee. \"Start telling him your troubles and he'll probably shoot you.\" In front of his door, which she could never remember having seen closed, Oedipa stood hipshot awhile, questioning her own sanity. Why hadn't she split out through Blamm's window and read about the rest of it in the paper? \"Who is it?\" Hilarius screamed, having picked up her breathing, or something. \"Mrs. Maas.\"\n\"May Speer and his ministry of cretins rot eternally in hell. Do you realize that half these rounds are duds?\" \"May I come in? Could we talk?\" \"I'm sure you'd all like that,\" Hilarius said. \"I'm unarmed. You can frisk me.\"\n\"While you karate-chop me in the spine, no thank you.\"\"Why are you resisting every suggestion I make?\"\"Listen,\" Hilarius said after a while, \"have I seemed to you a good enough Freudian? Have I ever deviated seriously?\"\"You made faces now and then,\" said Oedipa, \"but that's minor.\"His response was a long, bitter laugh. Oedipa waited. \"I tried,\" the shrink behind the door said, \"to submit myself to that man, to the ghost of that cantankerous Jew. Tried to cultivate a faith in the literal truth of everything he wrote, even the idiocies and contradictions. It was the least I could have done, nicht wahr? A kind of penance.\n\n\"And part of me must have really wanted to believe like a child hearing, in perfect safety, a tale of horror that the unconscious would be like any other room, once the light was let in. That the dark shapes would resolve only into toy horses and Biedermeyer furniture. That therapy could tame it after all, bring it into society with no fear of its someday reverting. I wanted to believe, despite everything my life had been. Can you imagine?\"She could not, having no idea what Hilarius had done before showing up in Kinneret. Far away she now heard sirens, the electronic kind the local cops used, that sounded like a slide-whistle being played over a PA. system. With linear obstinacy they grew louder.\n\n\"Yes, I hear them,\" Hilarius said. \"Do you think anyone can protect me from these fanatics? They walk through walls. They replicate: you flee them, turn a corner, and there they are, coming for you again.\" \"Do me a favor?\" Oedipa said. \"Don't shoot at the cops, they're on your side.\"\"Your Israeli has access to every uniform known,\" Hilarius said. \"I can't guarantee the safety of the 'police.' You couldn't guarantee where they'd take me if I surrendered, could you.\" She heard him pacing around his office. Unearthly siren-sounds converged on them from all over the night. \"There is a face,\" Hilarius said, \"that I can make. One you haven't seen; no one in this country has. I have only made it once in my life, and perhaps today in central Europe there still lives, in whatever vegetable ruin, the young man who saw it. He would be, now, about your age. Hopelessly insane. His name was Zvi. Will you tell the 'police,' or whatever they are calling themselves tonight, that I can make that face again? That it has an effective radius of a hundred yards and drives anyone unlucky enough to see it down forever into the darkened oubliette, among the terrible shapes, and secures the hatch irrevocably above them? Thank you.\"\nThe sirens had reached the front of the clinic. She heard car doors slamming, cops yelling, suddenly a great smash as they broke in. The office door opened then. Hilarius grabbed her by the wrist, pulled her inside, locked the door again.\n\n\"So now I'm a hostage,\" Oedipa said.\"Oh,\" said Hilarius, \"it's you.\"\n\"Well who did you think you'd been\" \"Discussing my case with? Another. There is me, there are the others. You know, with the LSD, we're finding, the distinction begins to vanish. Egos lose their sharp edges. But I never took the drug, I chose to remain in relative paranoia, where at least I know who I am and who the others are. Perhaps that is why you also refused to participate, Mrs Maas?\" He held the rifle at sling arms and beamed at her. \"Well, then. You were supposed to deliver a message to me, I assume. From them. What were you supposed to say?\"Oedipa shrugged. \"Face up to your social responsibilities,\" she suggested. \"Accept the reality principle. You're outnumbered and they have superior firepower.\"\"Ah, outnumbered. We were outnumbered there too.\" He watched her with a coy look.\"Where?\"\"Where I made that face. Where I did my internship.\"She knew then approximately what he was talking about, but to narrow it said, \"Where,\" again.\"Buchenwald,\" replied Hilarius. Cops began hammering on the office door.\"He has a gun,\" Oedipa called, \"and I'm in here.\"\n\"Who are you, lady?\" She told him. \"How do you spell that first name?\" He also took down her address, age, phone number, next of kin, husband's occupation, for the news media. Hilarius all the while was rummaging in his desk for more ammo. \"Can you talk him out of it?\" the cop wanted to know. \"TV folks would like to get some footage through the window. Could you keep him occupied?\"\n\"Hang tough,\" Oedipa advised, \"we'll see.\" \"Nice act you all have there,\" nodded Hilarius. \"You think,\" said Oedipa, \"then, that they're trying to bring you back to Israel, to stand trial, like they did Eichinann?\" The shrink kept nodding. \"Why? What did you do at Buchenwald?\"\n\n\"I worked,\" Hilarius told her, \"on experimentally-induced insanity. A catatonic Jew was as good as a dead one. Liberal SS circles felt it would be more humane.\" So they had gone at their subjects with metronomes, serpents, Brechtian vignettes at midnight, surgical removal of certain glands, magic-lantern hallucinations, new drugs, threats recited over hidden loudspeakers, hypnotism, clocks that ran backward, and faces. Hilarius had been put in charge of faces. \"The Allied liberators,\" he reminisced, \"arrived, unfortunately, before we could gather enough data. Apart from the spectacular successes, like Zvi, there wasn't much we could point to in a statistical way.\" He smiled at the expression on her face. \"Yes, you hate me. But didn't I try to atone? If I'd been a real Nazi I'd have chosen Jung, nicht wahr? But I chose Freud instead, the Jew. Freud's vision of the world had no Buchenwalds in it. Buchenwald, according to Freud, once the light was let in, would become a soccer field, fat children would learn flower-arranging and solfeggio in the strangling rooms. At Auschwitz the ovens would be converted over to petit fours and wedding cakes, and the V-2 missiles to public housing for the elves. I tried to believe it all. I slept three hours a night trying not to dream, and spent the other 21 at the forcible acquisition of faith. And yet my penance hasn't been enough. They've come like angels of death to get me, despite all I tried to do.\"\n\n\"How's it going?\" the cop inquired. \"Just marv,\" said Oedipa. \"I'll let you know if it's hopeless.\" Then she saw that Hilarius had left the Gewehr on his desk and was across the room ostensibly trying to open a file cabinet. She picked the rifle up, pointed it at him, and said, \"I ought to kill you.\" She knew he had wanted her to get the weapon. \"Isn't that what you've been sent to do?\" He crossed and uncrossed his eyes at her; stuck out his tongue tentatively.\"I came,\" she said, \"hoping you could talk me out of a fantasy.\"\n\"Cherish it!\" cried Hilarius, fiercely. \"What else do any of you have? Hold it tightly by its little tentacle, don't let the Freudians coax it away or the pharmacists poison it out of you. Whatever it is, hold it dear, for when you lose it you go over by that much to the others. You begin to cease to be.\"\n\"Come on in,\" Oedipa yelled.\n\nTears sprang to Hilarius's eyes. \"You aren't going to shoot?\"The cop tried the door. \"It's locked, hey,\" he said.\"Bust it down,\" roared Oedipa, \"and Hitler Hilarius here will foot the bill.\"Outside, as a number of nervous patrolmen approached Hilarius, holding up strait jackets and billy clubs they would not need, and as three rival ambulances backed snarling up onto the lawn, jockeying for position, causing Helga Blamm between sobs to call the drivers filthy names, Oedipa spotted among searchlights and staring crowds a KCUF mobile unit, with her husband Mucho inside it, spieling into a microphone. She moseyed over past snapping flashbulbs and stuck her head in the window. \"Hi.\" Mucho pressed his cough button a moment, but only smiled. It seemed odd. How could they hear a smile? Oedipa got in, trying not to make noise. Mucho thrust the mike in front of her, mumbling, \"You're on, just be yourself.\" Then in his earnest broadcasting voice, \"How do you feel about this terrible thing?\" \"Terrible,\" said Oedipa.\n\n\"Wonderful,\" said Mucho. He had her go on to give listeners a summary of what'd happened in the office. \"Thank you, Mrs Edna Mosh,\" he wrapped up, \"for your eyewitness account of this dramatic siege at the Hilarius Psychiatric Clinic. This is KCUF Mobile Two, sending it back now to 'Rabbit' Warren, at the studio.\" He cut his power. Something was not quite right. \"Edna Mosh?\" Oedipa said. \"It'll come out the right way,\" Mucho said. \"I was allowing for the distortion on these rigs, and then when they put it on tape.\"\"Where are they taking him?\" \"Community hospital, I guess,\" Mucho said, \"for observation. I wonder what they can observe.\"\"Israelis,\" Oedipa said, \"coming in the windows. If there aren't any, he's crazy.\" Cops came over and they chatted awhile. They told her to stay around Kinneret in case there was legal action. At length she returned to her rented car and followed Mucho back to the studio. Tonight he had the one-to-six shift on the air.\n\nIn the hallway outside the loud ratcheting teletype room, Mucho upstairs in the office typing out his story, Qedipa encountered the program director, Caesar Punch. \"Sure glad you're back,\" he greeted her, clearly at a loss for her first name.\"Oh?\" said Oedipa, \"and why is that.\"\"Frankly,\" confided Punch, \"since you left, Wen-dell hasn't been himself.\"\"And who,\" said Oedipa, working herself into a rage because Punch was right, \"pray, has he been, Ringo Starr?\" Punch cowered. \"Chubby Checker?\" she pursued him toward the lobby, \"the Righteous Brothers? And why tell me?\"\"All of the above,\" said Punch, seeking to hide his head, \"Mrs Maas.\"\"Oh, call me Edna. What do you mean?\" \"Behind his back,\" Punch was whining, \"they're calling him the Brothers N. He's losing his identity, Edna, how else can I put it? Day by day, Wendell is less himself and more generic. He enters a staff meeting and the room is suddenly full of people, you know? He's a walking assembly of man.\"\"It's your imagination,\" Oedipa said. \"You've been smoking those cigarettes without the printing on them again.\"\n\"You'll see. Don't mock me. We have to stick together. Who else worries about him?\"\n\nShe sat alone then on a bench outside Studio A, listening to Mucho's colleague Rabbit Warren spin records. Mucho came downstairs carrying his copy, a serenity about him she'd never seen. He used to hunch his shoulders and have a rapid eye blink rate, and both now were gone, \"Wait,\" he smiled, and dwindled down the hall. She scrutinized him from behind, trying to see iridescences, auras.\nThey had some time before he was on. They drove downtown to a pizzeria and bar, and faced each other through the fluted gold lens of a beer pitcher.\n\"How are you getting on with Metzger?\" he said. \"There's nothing,\" she said. \"Not any more, at least,\" said Mucho. \"I could tell that when you were talking into the mike.\"\n\n\"That's pretty good,\" Oedipa said. She couldn't figure the expression on his face. \"It's extraordinary,\" said Mucho, \"everything's been wait. Listen.\" She heard nothing unusual. \"There are seventeen violins on that cut,\" Mucho said, \"and one of them I can't tell where he was because it's monaural here, damn.\" It dawned on her that he was talking about the Muzak. It has been seeping in, in its subliminal, unidentifiable way since they'd entered the place, all strings, reeds, muted brass. \"What is it,\" she said, feeling anxious. \"His E string,\" Mucho said, \"it's a few cycles sharp. - He can't be a studio musician. Do you think somebody could do the dinosaur bone bit with that one string, Oed? With just his set of notes on that cut. Figure out what his ear is like, and then the musculature of his hands and arms, and eventually the entire man. God, wouldn't that be wonderful.\" \"Why should you want to?\" \"He was real. That wasn't synthetic. They could dispense with live musicians if they wanted. Put together all the right overtones at the right power levels so it'd come out like a violin. Like I ...\" he hesitated before breaking into a radiant smile, \"you'll think I'm crazy, Oed. But I can do the same thing in reverse. Listen to anything and take it apart again. Spectrum analysis, in my head. I can break down chords, and timbres, and words too into all the basic frequencies and harmonics, with all their different loudness\u2019s, and listen to them, each pure tone, but all at once.\" \"How can you do that?\"\n\n\"It's like I have a separate channel for each one,\" Mucho said, excited, \"and if I need more I just expand. Add on what I need. I don't know how it works, but lately I can do it with people talking too. Say 'rich, chocolaty goodness.'\" \"Rich, chocolaty, goodness,\" said Oedipa. \"Yes,\" said Mucho, and fell silent. \"Well, what?\" Oedipa asked after a couple minutes, with an edge to her voice. \"I noticed it the other night hearing Rabbit do a commercial. No matter who's talking, the different power spectra are the same, give or take a small percentage. So you and Rabbit have something in common now. More than that. Everybody who says the same words is the same person if the spectra are the same only they happen differently in time, you dig? But the time is arbitrary. You pick your zero point anywhere you want, that way you can shuffle each person's time line sideways till they all coincide. Then you'd have this big, God, maybe a couple hundred million chorus saying 'rich, chocolaty goodness' together, and it would all be the same voice.\"\n\n\"Mucho,\" she said, impatient but also flirting with a wild suspicion. \"Is this what Punch means when he says you're coming on like a whole roomful of people?\" \"That's what I am,\" said Mucho, \"right. Everybody is.\" He gazed at her, perhaps having had his vision of consensus as others do orgasms, face now smooth, amiable, at peace. She didn't know him. Panic started to climb out of a dark region in her head. \"Whenever I put the headset on now,\" he'd continued, \"I really do understand what I find there. When those kids sing about 'She loves you,' yeah well, you know, she does, she's any number of people, all over the world, back through time, different colors, sizes, ages, shapes, distances from death, but she loves. And the 'you' is everybody. And herself. Oedipa, the human voice, you know, it's a flipping miracle.\" His eyes brimming, reflecting the color of beer.\n\n\"Baby,\" she said, helpless, knowing of nothing she could do for this, and afraid for him. He put a little clear plastic bottle on the table between them. She stared at the pills in it, and then understood. \"That's LSD?\" she said. Mucho smiled back. \"Where'd you get it?\" Knowing.\"Hilarius. He broadened his program to include husbands.\"\"Look then,\" Oedipa said, trying to be businesslike, \"how long has it been, that you've been on this?\" He honestly couldn't remember.\"But there may be a chance you're not addicted yet.\"\n\"Oed,\" looking at her puzzled, \"you don't get addicted. It's not like you're some hophead. You take it because it's good. Because you hear and see things, even smell them, taste like you never could. Because the world is so abundant. No end to it, baby. You're an antenna, sending your pattern out across a million lives a night, and they're your lives too.\" He had this patient, motherly look now. Oedipa wanted to hit him in the mouth. \"The songs, it's not just that they say something, they are something, in the pure sound. Something new. And my dreams have changed.\"\n\n\"Oh, goodo.\" Flipping her hair a couple times, furious, \"No nightmares anymore? Fine. So your latest little friend, whoever she is, she really made out. At that age, you know, they need all the sleep they can get.\" \"There's no girl, Oed. Let me tell you. The bad dream that I used to have all the time, about the car lot, remember that? I could never even tell you about it. But I can now. It doesn't bother me anymore. It was only that sign in the lot, that's what scared me. In the dream I'd be going about a normal day's business and suddenly, with no warning, there'd be the sign. We were a member of the National Automobile Dealers' Association. N.A.D.A. Just this creaking metal sign that said nada, nada, against the blue sky. I used to wake up hollering.\" She remembered. Now he would never be spooked again, not as long as he had the pills. She could not quite get it into her head that the day she'd left him for San Francisco was the day she'd seen Mucho for the last time. So much of him already had dissipated.\n\n\"Oh, listen,\" he was saying, \"Oed, dig.\" But she couldn't even tell what the tune was. When it was time for him to go back to the station, he nodded toward the pills. \"You could have those.\"She shook her head no.\"You're going back to San Francisco?\"\"Tonight, yes.\" \"But the cops.\"\"I'll be a fugitive.\" Later she couldn't remember if they'd said anything else. At the station they kissed goodbye, all of them. As Mucho walked away he was whistling something complicated, twelve-tone. Oedipa sat with her forehead resting on the steering wheel and remembered that she hadn't asked him about the Trys-tero cancellation on his letter. But by then it was too late to make any difference.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/8176969", "artist_names": "SiriusXM", "full_title": "Top 1000 Country Songs of All Time (2022) by\u00a0SiriusXM", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.512x512x1.jpg", "id": 8176969, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 16851497, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1658536633, "path": "/Siriusxm-top-1000-country-songs-of-all-time-2022-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Siriusxm-top-1000-country-songs-of-all-time-2022-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2022, "month": 7, "day": 8}, "release_date_for_display": "July 8, 2022", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jul. 8, 2022", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.512x512x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 6841}, "title": "Top 1000 Country Songs of All Time (2022)", "title_with_featured": "Top 1000 Country Songs of All Time (2022)", "updated_by_human_at": 1658687357, "url": "https://genius.com/Siriusxm-top-1000-country-songs-of-all-time-2022-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/200944", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.512x512x1.jpg", "id": 200944, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.512x512x1.jpg", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "SiriusXM", "slug": "Siriusxm", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Siriusxm"}, "artist": "SiriusXM", "lyrics": "Top 1000 Country Songs of All Time (2022) Lyrics1000.

Ooh, watch me dig it\nI'm taking no shorts unless it's coming from a midget\nI tax the peace more than chicken packs grease\nI'm nearly knockin' boots, but if not, I'll knock teeth\nWahh! Ga ga, ooh, cries the baby\nSmacked on the ass, now the DoItAll's crazy\nNo rattles, or playpens, or crowds when I'm rappin'\nAnd yes, I do reruns, as if this was What's Happening\nNow January 14 has birthed the funk one\nThe B-Day for Dupree, and yes, I'm funky\nI got you bobbin' to the funky style\nK-Def, let 'em know here comes the funky child\n[Interlude: K-Def]\nYeah... (laughs) born in the underground of Newark\nNow witness the birth of Mr. Funke\n\n[Verse 2: Mr. Funke]\nThe fifth of the terror, it's the return of Funke Kreuger\nA.K. Anger, we told 'em Mr. Funke Wallbanger\nConceived in the fire by a war through disasters\nThe funky child was taught to the ways of the masters\nMr. Funke, yes, girl, the black mack is back\nHere to kick my funky style, funky this and funky that\nYou can work day and night, you could practice all your life\nBut I still take the show, then I go home with the wife\nOh my God, funky with the style, Lord have mercy\nI hurdle over rappers just like Jackie Joyner-Kersee\nWatch me flip the script, let me show you what the funk do\nMake you call me uncle (What?) Uncle (What?!) Uncle (Who?!)\nWhen I was young I used to sing with my sister\n(Heyy)\nNow I kick the ill styles, you have to call me mister\nCooling in the House of Hits, time to buckwild\nRaised in the ways of the funky child\n\n[Verse 3: DoItAll]\nBack up baby, here comes the stroller\nWe're hit when we dry crawl and hit rock 'n' rolla\nI'm caught in the swinging hypnotized by the Pendulum\nDistributed by Elektra, so this is how I'm killing them\nK is on the M.P., Jazz is on the Technic\nMarley's on the mix, and now the Lords have a hit like Pow! Now it's time to get buckwild\nAnd watch my funky brothers freak the underground\nIn a second, or minute, in no times flat...\nBring it back!\nAnd go grab the album to bring the Lords money\nTake it home to mom to say, \"Ain't they funky?\"\nYou might also like[Verse 4: Mr. Funke]\nWe gone psycho and everybody thought we was DAS\nIt didn\u2019t affect me, I said, \"So what?\" I kept on writing rhymes\nI keep my funky style perfected so no one can stop my flow\nI fear no man, 'cause if it's on fool, then it's on\n(And it's on!)\nDon't worry not for other crews selling out\nAs long as Lords of the Underground stay underground\nThe brothers of LOTUG will keep the lyrical fitness\nDon't worry about me selling out, mind your business\nYou might say, \"Damn, Mr. Funke's going out!\"\nBut if you listen to the words then you'll know what I'm about\nAny props you receive are the props that you earn\nI'm off 'til the funky child returns2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2,

face\n\n[Verse]\nIt was those good ol' days when you In yo' Niggas would be running on the streets and be shooting innocent people who haven't done anything to humanity, Remembering when you would be writing some rhymes In yo' paper sheet with just a beat, Yet back In those days while you where doing that shit, Thugs would be Robbing stores n' they got \"JAIL\" As there receipt, Thugs killed people down until they suffocated enough and finally hit the mark when they bleed, All these Young Niggas enjoy those days when you would just sit back on a tree and some 90's book you would read\n\n[Chorus]\nRemembering those ol' days?\nYeah you remember, When those days amazed you right before September?\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn those days damn Thugs would put there legs on the table and grab a grain of cocaine and they would snort that shit up to their nostrils until It hit there brain, Yeah those people who lived In our Generation back In those days had alot to Say and yet those blind brainless people didn't know which way? President or Human rights? They wouldn't pick the light they would just pick the riots and never ending bloody fights, Missing those days when the cinema brought black and white movies, Good ol' days when they where just minimum Man Jamaica the place I'm from,Yeah In those movies you would enjoy the old fashion beauty, Well In the 1 hour mark some man got shot by a jit with a uzi, Mental people where just moody\n[Chorus]\nRemember those days when life was just simple and plain?\nThe days that would never end, When those 90's movie criminals didn't surrender? And yet those old jury episodes, The criminals couldn't defend\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll these people know that those ol' days where just about fashion, All these music genre's with some passion, It was those days when Hip-Hop got some compassion, And those people enjoying comedy and laughing, Remember those white n' Black screen models when they had attraction, Yet you never thought of those murderers slashing and making peoples skulls bashing, It was those time we formed a Michael Jackson,Kids enjoying those tv-shows with Someone doing Magic, Yet right at those happy moments People die tragic, None would enjoy criminals Robbing shit and jewels none couldn't forget their actions\n\n[Chorus]\nThe days you can't never forget It flicks on to your brain like some magic switching lever\n\n[Bridge]\nSad Funerals going on people In a casket, All of those people getting news quickly on their ol' tv with antlers on top of them, They where saying \"WHAT HAPPENDED\" Someone was dying they where passing and a Maniac was laughing, Those days you can't forget they plug In your brain like a inlet, Yet now those old days are gone now It's just kids just playing games with their headset\n\n[Chorus]\nNever Forget\n(Echo)You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/875322", "artist_names": "Go West", "full_title": "What You Won't Do

DE CHARLUS. \u2014 HIS SHAM DUEL. \u2014 THE STATIONS ON THE \u2018TRANSATLANTIC.\u2019\u2014 WEARY OF ALBERTINE I DECIDE TO BREAK WITH HER\n\nI was dropping with sleep. I was taken up to my floor not by the liftboy, but by the squinting page, who to make conversation informed me that his sister was still with the gentleman who was so rich, and that, on one occasion, when she had made up her mind to return home instead of sticking to her business, her gentleman friend had paid a visit to the mother of the squinting page and of the other more fortunate children, who had very soon made the silly creature return to her protector. \u201cYou know, Sir, she\u2019s a fine lady, my sister is. She plays the piano, she talks Spanish. And you would never take her for the sister of the humble employee who brings you up in the lift, she denies herself nothing; Madame has a maid to herself, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised if one day she keeps her carriage. She is very pretty, if you could see her, a little too high and mighty, but, good lord, you can understand that. She\u2019s full of fun. She never leaves a hotel without doing something first in a wardrobe or a drawer, just to leave a little keepsake with the chambermaid who will have to wipe it up. Sometimes she does it in a cab, and after she\u2019s paid her fare, she\u2019ll hide behind a tree, and she doesn\u2019t half laugh when the cabby finds he\u2019s got to clean his cab after her. My father had another stroke of luck when he found my young brother that Indian Prince he used to know long ago. It\u2019s not the same style of thing, of course. But it\u2019s a superb position. The travelling by itself would be a dream. I\u2019m the only one still on the shelf. But you never know. We\u2019re a lucky family; perhaps one day I shall be President of the Republic. But I\u2019m keeping you talking\u201d (I had not uttered a single word and was beginning to fall asleep as I listened to the flow of his). \u201cGood-night, Sir. Oh! Thank you, Sir. If everybody had as kind a heart as you, there wouldn\u2019t be any poor people left. But, as my sister says, \u2018there will always have to be the poor so that now I\u2019m rich I can s \u2014 t on them.\u2019 You\u2019ll pardon the expression. Goodnight, Sir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps every night we accept the risk of facing, while we are asleep, sufferings which we regard as unreal and unimportant because they will be felt in the course of a sleep which we suppose to be unconscious. And indeed on these evenings when I came back late from la Raspeli\u00e8re I was very sleepy. But after the weather turned cold I could not get to sleep at once, for the fire lighted up the room as though there were a lamp burning in it. Only it was nothing more than a blazing log, and \u2014 like a lamp too, for that matter, like the day when night gathers \u2014 its too bright light was not long in fading; and I entered a state of slumber which is like a second room that we take, into which, leaving our own room, we go when we want to sleep. It has noises of its own and we are sometimes violently awakened by the sound of a bell, perfectly heard by our ears, although nobody has rung. It has its servants, its special visitors who call to take us out so that we are ready to get up when we are compelled to realise, by our almost immediate transmigration into the other room, the room of overnight, that it is empty, that nobody has called\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The race that inhabits it is, like that of our first human ancestors, androgynous. A man in it appears a moment later in the form of a woman. Things in it shew a tendency to turn into men, men into friends and enemies. The time that elapses for the sleeper, during these spells of slumber, is absolutely different from the time in which the life of the waking man is passed. Sometimes its course is far more rapid, a quarter of an hour seems a day, at other times far longer, we think we have taken only a short nap, when we have slept through the day. Then, in the chariot of sleep, we descend into depths in which memory can no longer overtake it, and on the brink of which the mind has been obliged to retrace its steps. The horses of sleep, like those of the sun, move at so steady a pace, in an atmosphere in which there is no longer any resistance, that it requires some little aerolith extraneous to ourselves (hurled from the azure by some Unknown) to strike our regular sleep (which otherwise Would have no reason to stop, and would continue with a similar motion world without end) and to make it swing sharply round, return towards reality, travel without pause, traverse the regions bordering on life in which presently the sleeper will hear the sounds that come from life, quite vague still, but already perceptible, albeit corrupted \u2014 and come to earth suddenly and awake. Then from those profound slumbers we awake in a dawn, not knowing who we are, being nobody, newly born, ready for anything, our brain being emptied of that past which was previously our life. And perhaps it is more pleasant still when our landing at the waking-point is abrupt and the thoughts of our sleep, hidden by a cloak of oblivion, have not time to return to us in order, before sleep ceases. Then, from the black tempest through which we seem to have passed (but we do not even saywe), we emerge prostrate, without a thought, a we that is void of content. What hammer-blow has the person or thing that is lying there received to make it unconscious of anything, stupefied until the moment when memory, flooding back, restores to it consciousness or personality? Moreover, for both these kinds of awakening, we must avoid falling asleep, even into deep slumber, under the law of habit. For everything that habit ensnares in her nets, she watches closely, we must escape her, take our sleep at a moment when we thought we were doing anything else than sleeping, take, in a word, a sleep that does not dwell under the tutelage of foresight, in the company, albeit latent, of reflexion. At least, in these awakenings which I have just described, and which I experienced as a rule when I had been dining overnight at la Raspeli\u00e8re, everything occurred as though by this process, and I can testify to it, I the strange human being who, while he waits for death to release him, lives behind closed shutters, knows nothing of the world, sits motionless as an owl, and like that bird begins to see things a little plainly only when darkness falls. Everything occurs as though by this process, but perhaps only a layer of wadding has prevented the sleeper from taking in the internal dialogue of memories and the incessant verbiage of sleep. For (and this may be equally manifest in the other system, vaster, more mysterious, more astral) at the moment of his entering the waking state, the sleeper hears a voice inside him saying: \u201cWill you come to this dinner to-night, my dear friend, it would be such fun?\u201d and thinks: \u201cYes, what fun it will be, I shall go\u201d; then, growing wider awake, he suddenly remembers: \u201cMy grandmother has only a few weeks to live, the Doctor assures us.\u201d He rings, he weeps at the thought that it will not be, as in the past, his grandmother, his dying grandmother, but an indifferent waiter that will come in answer to his summons. Moreover, when sleep bore him so far away from the world inhabited by memory and thought, through an ether in which he was alone, more than alone; not having that companion in whom we perceive things, ourself, he was outside the range of time and its measures. But now the footman is in the room, and he dares not ask him the time, for he does not know whether he has slept, for how many hours he has slept (he asks himself whether it should not be how many days, returning thus with weary body and mind refreshed, his heart sick for home, as from a journey too distant not to have taken a long time). We may of course insist that there is but one time, for the futile reason that it is by looking at the clock that we have discovered to have been merely a quarter of an hour what we had supposed a day. But at the moment when we make this discovery we are a man awake, plunged in the time of waking men, we have deserted the other time. Perhaps indeed more than another time: another life. The pleasures that we enjoy in sleep, we do not include them in the list of the pleasures that we have felt in the course of our existence. To allude only to the most grossly sensual of them all, which of us, on waking, has not felt a certain irritation at having experienced in his sleep a pleasure which, if he is anxious not to tire himself, he is not, once he is awake, at liberty to repeat indefinitely during the day. It seems a positive waste. We have had pleasure, in another life, which is not ours. Sufferings and pleasures of the dream-world (which generally vanish soon enough after our waking), if we make them figure in a budget, it is not in the current account of our life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two times, I have said; perhaps there is only one after all, not that the time of the waking man has any validity for the sleeper, but perhaps because the other life, the life in which he sleeps, is not \u2014 in its profounder part \u2014 included in the category of time. I came to this conclusion when on the mornings after dinners at la Raspeli\u00e8re I used to lie so completely asleep. For this reason. I was beginning to despair, on waking, when I found that, after I had rung the bell ten times, the waiter did not appear. At the eleventh ring he came. It was only the first after all. The other ten had been mere suggestions in my sleep which still hung about me, of the peal that I had been meaning to sound. My numbed hands had never even moved. Well, on those mornings (and this is what makes me say that sleep is perhaps unconscious of the law of time) my effort to awaken consisted chiefly in an effort to make the obscure, undefined mass of the sleep in which I had just been living enter into the scale of time. It is no easy task; sleep, which does not know whether we have slept for two hours or two days, cannot provide any indication. And if we do not find one outside, not being able to re-enter time, we fall asleep again, for five minutes which seem to us three hours\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have always said \u2014 and have proved by experiment \u2014 that the most powerful soporific is sleep itself. After having slept profoundly for two hours, having fought against so many giants, and formed so many lifelong friendships, it is far more difficult to awake than after taking several grammes of veronal. And so, reasoning from one thing to the other, I was surprised to hear from the Norwegian philosopher, who had it from M. Boutroux, \u201cmy eminent colleague \u2014 pardon me, my brother,\u201d what M. Bergson thought of the peculiar effects upon the memory of soporific drugs. \u201cNaturally,\u201d M. Bergson had said to M. Boutroux, if one was to believe the Norwegian philosopher, \u201csoporifics, taken from time to time in moderate doses, have no effect upon that solid memory of our everyday life which is so firmly established within us. But there are other forms of memory, loftier, but also more unstable. One of my colleagues lectures upon ancient history. He tells me that if, overnight, he has taken a tablet to make him sleep, he has great difficulty, during his lecture, in recalling the Greek quotations that he requires. The doctor who recommended these tablets assured him that they had no effect upon the memory. \u2018That is perhaos because you do not have to quote Greek,\u2019 the historian answered, not without a note of derisive pride.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I cannot say whether this conversation between M. Bergson and M. Boutroux is accurately reported. The Norwegian philosopher, albeit so profound and so lucid, so passionately attentive, may have misunderstood. Personally, in my own experience I have found the opposite result. The moments of oblivion that come to us in the morning after we have taken certain narcotics have a resemblance that is only partial, though disturbing, to the oblivion that reigns during a night of natural and profound sleep. Now what I find myself forgetting in either case is not some line of Baudelaire, which on the other hand keeps sounding in my ear, it is not some concept of one of the philosophers above-named, it is the actual reality of the ordinary things that surround me \u2014 if I am asleep \u2014 my non-perception of which makes me an idiot; it is, if I am awakened and proceed to emerge from an artificial slumber, not the system of Porphyry or Plotinus, which I can discuss as fluently as at any other time, but the answer that I have promised to give to an invitation, the memory of which is replaced by a universal blank. The lofty thought remains in its place; what the soporific has put out of action is the power to act in little things, in everything that demands activity in order to-seize at the right moment, to grasp some memory of everyday life. In spite of all that may be said about survival after the destruction of the brain, I observe that each alteration of the brain is a partial death. We possess all our memories, but not the faculty of recalling them, said, echoing M. Bergson, the eminent Norwegian philosopher whose language I have made no attempt to imitate in order not to prolong my story unduly. But not the faculty of recalling them. But what, then, is a memory which we do not recall? Or, indeed, let us go farther. We do not recall our memories of the last thirty years; but we are wholly steeped in them; why then stop short at thirty years, why not prolong back to before out birth this anterior life? The moment that I do not know a whole section of the memories that are behind me, the moment that they are invisible to me, that I have not the faculty of calling them to me, who can assure me that in that mass unknown to me there are not some that extend back much farther than my human life. If I can have in me and round me so many memories which I do not remember, this oblivion (a de facto oblivion, at least, since I have not the faculty of seeing anything) may extend over a life which I have lived in the body of another man, even upon another planet. A common oblivion effaces all. But what, in that case, signifies that immortality of the soul the reality of which the Norwegian philosopher affirmed? The person that I shall be after death has no more reason to remember the man whom I have been since my birth than the latter to remember what I was before it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The waiter came in. I did not mention to him that I had rung several times, for I was beginning to realise that hitherto I had only dreamed that I was ringing. I was alarmed nevertheless by the thought that this dream had had the clear precision of experience. Experience would, reciprocally, have the irreality of a dream\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead I asked him who it was that had been ringing so often during the night. He told me: \u201cNobody,\u201d and could prove his statement, for the bell-board would have registered any ring. And yet I could hear the repeated, almost furious peals which were still echoing in my ears and were to remain perceptible for several days. It is however seldom that sleep thus projects into our waking life memories that do not perish with it. We can count these aeroliths. If it is an idea that sleep has forged, it soon breaks up into slender, irrecoverable fragments. But, in this instance, sleep had fashioned sounds. More material and simpler, they lasted longer. I was astonished by the relative earliness of the hour, as told me by the waiter. I was none the less refreshed. It is the light sleeps that have a long duration, because, being an intermediate state between waking and sleeping, preserving a somewhat faded but permanent impression of the former, they require infinitely more time to refresh us than a profound sleep, which may be short. I felt quite comfortable for another reason. If remembering that we are tired is enough to make us feel our tiredness, saying to oneself: \u201cI am refreshed,\u201d is enough to create refreshment. Now I had been dreaming that M. de Charlus was a hundred and ten years old, and had just boxed the ears of his own mother, Madame Verdurin, because she had paid five thousand millions for a bunch of violets; I was therefore assured that I had slept profoundly, had dreamed the reverse of what had been in my thoughts overnight and of all the possibilities of life at the moment; this was enough to make me feel entirely refreshed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should greatly have astonished my mother, who could not understand M. de Charlus\u2019s assiduity in visiting the Verdurins, had I told her whom (on the very day on which Albertine\u2019s toque had been ordered, without a word about it to her, in order that it might come as a surprise) M. de Charlus had brought to dine in a private room at the Grand Hotel, Balbec. His guest was none other than the footman of a lady who was a cousin of the Cambremers. This footman was very smartly dressed, and, as he crossed the hall, with the Baron, \u2018did the man of fashion\u2019 as Saint-Loup would have said in the eyes of the visitors. Indeed, the young page-boys, the L\u00e9vites who were swarming down the temple steps at that moment because it was the time when they came on duty, paid no attention to the two strangers, one of whom, M. de Charlus, kept his eyes lowered to shew that he was paying little if any to them. He appeared to be trying to carve his way through their midst. \u201cProsper, dear hope of a sacred nation,\u201d he said, recalling a passage from Racine, and applying to it a wholly different meaning. \u201cPardon?\u201d asked the footman, who was not well up in the classics. M. de Charlus made no reply, for he took a certain pride in never answering questions and in marching straight ahead as though there were no other visitors in the hotel, or no one existed in the world except himself, Baron de Charlus. But, having continued to quote the speech of Josabeth: \u201cCome, come, my children,\u201d he felt a revulsion and did not, like her, add: \u201cBid them approach,\u201d for these young people had not yet reached the age at which sex is completely developed, and which appealed to M. de Charlus. Moreover, if he had written to Madame de Chevregny\u2019s footman, because he had had no doubt of his docility, he had hoped to meet some one more virile. On seeing him, he found him more effeminate than he would have liked. He told him that he had been expecting some one else, for he knew by sight another of Madame de Chevregny\u2019s footmen, whom he had noticed upon the box of her carriage. This was an extremely rustic type of peasant, the very opposite of him who had come, who, on the other hand, regarding his own effeminate ways as adding to his attractiveness, and never doubting that it was this man-of-the-world air that had captivated M. de Charlus, could not even guess whom the Baron meant. \u201cBut there is no one else in the house, except one that you can\u2019t have given the eye to, he is hideous, just like a great peasant.\u201d And at the thought that it was perhaps this rustic whom the Baron had seen, he felt his self-esteem wounded. The Baron guessed this, and, widening his quest: \u201cBut I have not taken a vow that I will know only Mme. de Chevregny\u2019s men,\u201d he said. \u201cSurely there are plenty of fellows in one house or another here or in Paris, since you are leaving soon, that you could introduce to me?\u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d replied the footman, \u201cI never go with anyone of my own class. I only speak to them on duty. But there is one very nice person I can make you know.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d asked the Baron. \u201cThe Prince de Guermantes.\u201d M. de Guermantes was vexed at being offered only a man so advanced in years, one, moreover, to whom he had no need to apply to a footman for an introduction. And so he declined the offer in a dry tone and, not letting himself be discouraged by the menial\u2019s social pretensions, began to explain to him again what he wanted, the style, the type, a jockey, for instance, and so on. . . . Fearing lest the solicitor, who went past at that moment, might have heard them, he thought it cunning to shew that he was speaking of anything in the world rather than what his hearer might suspect, and said with emphasis and in ringing tones, but as though he were simply continuing his conversation: \u201cYes, in spite of my age, I still keep up a passion for collecting, a passion for pretty things, I will do anything to secure an old bronze, an early lustre. I adore the Beautiful.\u201d But to make the footman understand the change of subject he had so rapidly executed, M. de Charlus laid such stress upon each word, and what was more, to be heard by the solicitor, he shouted his words so loud that this charade should in itself have been enough to reveal what it concealed from ears more alert than those of the officer of the court. He suspected nothing, any more than any of the other residents in the hotel, all of whom saw a fashionable foreigner in the footman so smartly attired. On the other hand, if the gentlemen were deceived and took him for a distinguished American, no sooner did he appear before the servants than he was spotted by them, as one convict recognises another, indeed scented afar off, as certain animals scent one another. The head waiters raised their eyebrows. Aim\u00e9 cast a suspicious glance. The wine waiter, shrugging his shoulders, uttered behind his hand (because he thought it polite) an offensive expression which everybody heard. And even our old Fran\u00e7oise, whose sight was failing and who went past at that moment at the foot of the staircase to dine with the courriers, raised her head, recognised a servant where the hotel guests never suspected one \u2014 as the old nurse Euryclea recognises Ulysses long before the suitors seated at the banquet \u2014 and seeing, arm in arm with him, M. de Charlus, assumed an appalled expression, as though all of a sudden slanders which she had heard repeated and had not believed had acquired a heartrending probability in her eyes. She never spoke to me, nor to anyone else, of this incident, but it must have caused a considerable commotion in her brain, for afterwards, whenever in Paris she happened to see \u2018Julien,\u2019 to whom until then she had been so greatly attached, she still treated him with politeness, but with a politeness that had cooled and was always tempered with a strong dose of reserve. This same incident led some one else to confide in me: this was Aim\u00e9. When I encountered M. de Charlus, he, not having expected to meet me, raised his hand and called out \u201cGood evening\u201d with the indifference \u2014 outwardly, at least \u2014 of a great nobleman who believes that everything is allowed him and thinks it better not to appear to be hiding anything. Aim\u00e9, who at that moment was watching him with a suspicious eye and saw that I greeted the companion of the person in whom he was certain that he detected a. servant, asked me that same evening who he was. For, for some time past, Aim\u00e9 had shewn a fondness for talking, or rather, as he himself put it, doubtless in order to emphasise the character \u2014 philosophical, according to him \u2014 of these talks, \u2018discussing\u2019 with me. And as I often said to him that it distressed me that he should have to stand beside the table while I ate instead of being able to sit down and share my meal, he declared that he had never seen a guest shew such \u2018sound reasoning.\u2019 He was talking at that moment to two waiters. They had bowed to me, I did not know why their faces were unfamiliar, albeit their conversation sounded a note which seemed to me not to be novel. Aim\u00e9 was scolding them both because of their matrimonial engagements, of which he disapproved. He appealed to me, I said that I could not have any opinion on the matter since I did not know them. They told me their names, reminded me that they had often waited upon me at Rivebelle. But one had let his moustache grow, the other had shaved his off and had had his head cropped; and for this reason, albeit it was the same head as before that rested upon the shoulders of each of them (and not a different head as in the faulty restorations of Notre-Dame), it had remained almost as invisible to me as those objects which escape the most minute search and are actually staring everybody in the face where nobody notices them, on the mantelpiece. As soon as I knew their names, I recognised exactly the uncertain music of their voices because I saw once more the old face which made it clear. \u201cThey want to get married and they haven\u2019t even learned English!\u201d Aim\u00e9 said to me, without reflecting that I was little versed in the ways of hotel service, and could not be aware that a person who does not know foreign languages cannot be certain of getting a situation. I, who supposed that he would have no difficulty in finding out that the newcomer was M. de Charlus, and indeed imagined that he must remember him, having waited upon him in the dining-room when the Baron came, during my former visit to Balbec, to see Mme. de Villeparisis, I told him his name. Not only did Aim\u00e9 not remember the Baron de Charlus, but the name appeared to make a profound impression upon him. He told me that he would look for a letter next day in his room which I might perhaps be able to explain to him. I was all the more astonished in that M. de Charlus, when he had wished to give me one of Bergotte\u2019s books, at Balbec, the other year, had specially asked for Aim\u00e9, whom he must have recognised later on in that Paris restaurant where I had taken luncheon with Saint-Loup and his mistress and where M. de Charlus had come to spy upon us. It is true that Aim\u00e9 had not been able to execute these commissions in person, being on the former occasion in bed, and on the latter engaged in waiting. I had nevertheless grave doubts as to his sincerity, when he pretended not to know M. de Charlus. For one thing, he must have appealed to the Baron. Like all the upstairs waiters of the Balbec Hotel, like several of the Prince de Guermantes\u2019s footmen, Aim\u00e9 belonged to a race more ancient than that of the Prince, therefore more noble. When you asked for a sitting-room, you thought at first that you were alone. But presently, in the service-room you caught sight of a sculptural waiter, of that ruddy Etruscan kind of which Aim\u00e9 was typical, slightly aged by excessive consumption of champagne and seeing the inevitable hour approach for Contrex\u00e9ville water. Not all the visitors asked them merely to wait upon them. The underlings who were young, conscientious, busy, who had mistresses waiting for them outside, made off. Whereupon Aim\u00e9 reproached them with not being serious. He had every right to do so. He himself was serious. He had a wife and children, and was ambitious on their behalf. And so the advances made to him by a strange lady or gentleman he never repulsed, though it meant his staying all night. For business must come before everything. He was so much of the type that attracted M. de Charlus that I suspected him of falsehood when he told me that he did not know him. I was wrong. The page had been perfectly truthful when he told the Baron that Aim\u00e9 (who had given him a dressing-down for it next day) had gone to bed (or gone out), and on the other occasion was busy waiting. But imagination outreaches reality. And the page-boy\u2019s embarrassment had probably aroused in M. de Charlus doubts as to the sincerity of his excuses that had wounded sentiments of which Aim\u00e9 had no suspicion. We have seen moreover that Saint-Loup had prevented Aim\u00e9 from going out to the carriage in which M. de Charlus, who had managed somehow or other to discover the waiter\u2019s new address, received a further disappointment. Aim\u00e9, who had not noticed him, felt an astonishment that may be imagined when, on the evening of that very day on which I had taken luncheon with Saint-Loup and his mistress, he received a letter sealed with the Guermantes arms, from which I shall quote a few passages here as an example of unilateral insanity in an intelligent man addressing an imbecile endowed with sense. \u201cSir, I have been unsuccessful, notwithstanding efforts that would astonish many people who have sought in vain to be greeted and welcomed by myself, in persuading you to listen to certain explanations which you have not asked of me but which I have felt it to be incumbent upon my dignity and your own to offer you. I am going therefore to write down here what it would have been more easy to say to you in person. I shall not conceal from you that, the first time that I set eyes upon you at Balbec, I found your face frankly antipathetic.\u201d Here followed reflexions upon the resemblance \u2014 remarked only on the following day \u2014 to a deceased friend to whom M. de Charlus had been deeply attached. \u201cThe thought then suddenly occurred to me that you might, without in any way encroaching upon the demands of your profession, come to see me and, by joining me in the card games with which his mirth used to dispel my gloom, give me the illusion that he was not dead. Whatever the nature of the more or less fatuous suppositions which you probably formed, suppositions more within the mental range of a servant (who does not even deserve the name of servant since he has declined to serve) than the comprehension of so lofty a sentiment, you probably thought that you were giving yourself importance, knowing not who I was nor what I was, by sending word to me, when I asked you to fetch me a book, that you were in bed; but it is a mistake to imagine that impolite behaviour ever adds to charm, in which you moreover are entirely lacking. I should have ended matters there had I not, by chance, the following morning, found an opportunity of speaking to you. Your resemblance to my poor friend was so accentuated, banishing even the Intolerable protuberance of your too prominent chin, that I realised that it was the deceased who at that moment was lending you his own kindly expression so as to permit you to regain your hold over me and to prevent you from missing the unique opportunity that was being offered you. Indeed, although I have no wish, since there is no longer any object and it is unlikely that I shall meet you again in this life, to introduce coarse questions of material interest, I should have been only too glad to obey the prayer of my dead friend (for I believe in the Communion of Saints and in their deliberate intervention in the destiny of the living), that I should treat you as I used to treat him, who had his carriage, his servants, and to whom it was quite natural that I should consecrate the greater part of my fortune since I loved him as a father loves his son. You have decided otherwise. To my request that you should fetch me a book you sent the reply that you were obliged to go out. And this morning when I sent to ask you to come to my carriage, you then, if I may so speak without blasphemy, denied me for the third time. You will excuse my not enclosing in this envelope the lavish gratuity which I intended to give you at Balbec and to which it would be too painful to me to restrict myself in dealing with a person with whom I had thought for a moment of sharing all that I possess. At least you might spare me the trouble of making a fourth vain attempt to find you at your restaurant, to which my patience will not extend.\u201d (Here M. de Charlus gave his address, stated the hours at which he would be at home, etc.) \u201cFarewell, Sir. Since I assume that, resembling so strongly the friend whom I have lost, you cannot be entirely stupid, otherwise physiognomy would be a false science, I am convinced that if, one day, you think of this incident again, it will not be without feeling some regret and some remorse. For my part, believe that I am quite sincere in saying that I retain no bitterness. I should have preferred that we should part with a less unpleasant memory than this third futile endeavour. It will soon be forgotten. We are like those vessels which you must often have seen at Balbec, which have crossed one another\u2019s course for a moment; it might have been to the advantage of each of them to stop; but one of them has decided otherwise; presently they will no longer even see one another on the horizon and their meeting is a thing out of mind; but, before this final parting, each of them salutes the other, and so at this point, Sir, wishing you all good fortune, does\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE BARON DE CHARLUS.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aim\u00e9 had not even read this letter through, being able to make nothing of it and suspecting a hoax. When I had explained to him who the Baron was, he appeared to be lost in thought and to be feeling the regret that M. de Charlus had anticipated. I would not be prepared to swear that he would not at that moment have written a letter of apology to a man who gave carriages to his friends. But in the interval M. de Charlus had made Morel\u2019s acquaintance. It was true that, his relations with Morel being possibly Platonic, M. de Charlus occasionally sought to spend an evening in company such as that in which I had just met him in the hall. But he was no longer able to divert from Morel the violent sentiment which, at liberty a few years earlier, had asked nothing better than to fasten itself upon Aim\u00e9 and had dictated the letter which had distressed me, for its writer\u2019s sake, when the head waiter shewed me it. It was, in view of the anti-social nature of M. de Charlus\u2019s love, a more striking example of the insensible, sweeping force of these currents of passion by which the lover, like a swimmer, is very soon carried out of sight of land. No doubt the love of a normal man may also, when the lover, by the successive invention of his desires, regrets, disappointments, plans, constructs a whole romance about a woman whom he does not know, allow the two legs of the compass to gape at a quite remarkably wide angle. All the same, such an angle was singularly enlarged by the character of a passion which is not generally shared and by the difference in social position between M. de Charlus and Aime\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every day I went out with Albertine. She had decided to take up painting again and had chosen as the subject of her first attempts the church of Saint-Jean de la Haise which nobody ever visited and very few had even heard of, a spot difficult to describe, impossible to discover without a guide, slow of access in its isolation, more than half an hour from the Epreville station, after one had long left behind one the last houses of the village of Quetteholme. As to the name Epreville I found that the cur\u00e9\u2018s book and Brichot\u2019s information were at variance. According to one, Epreville was the ancient Sprevilla; the other derived the name from Aprivilla. On our first visit we took a little train in the opposite direction from F\u00e9terne, that is to say towards Grattevast. But we were in the dog days and it had been a terrible strain simply to go out of doors immediately after luncheon. I should have preferred not to start so soon; the luminous and burning air provoked thoughts of indolence and cool retreats. It filled my mother\u2019s room and mine, according to their exposure, at varying temperatures, like rooms in a Turkish bath. Mamma\u2019s dressing-room, festooned by the sun with a dazzling, Moorish whiteness, appeared to be sunk at the bottom of a well, because of the four plastered walls on which it looked out, while far above, in the empty space, the sky, whose fleecy white waves one saw slip past, one behind another, seemed (because of the longing that one felt), whether built upon a terrace or seen reversed in a mirror hung above the window, a tank filled with blue water, reserved for bathers. Notwithstanding this scorching temperature, we had taken the one o\u2019clock train. But Albertine had been very hot in the carriage, hotter still in the long walk across country, and I was afraid of her catching cold when she proceeded to sit still in that damp hollow where the sun\u2019s rays did not penetrate. Having, on the other hand, as long ago as our first visits to Elstir, made up my mind that she would appreciate not merely luxury but even a certain degree of comfort of which her want of money deprived her, I had made arrangements with a Balbec jobmaster that a carriage was to be sent every day to take us out. To escape from the heat we took the road through the forest of Chantepie. The invisibility of the innumerable birds, some of them almost sea-birds, that conversed with one another from the trees on either side of us, gave the same impression of repose that one has when one shuts one\u2019s eyes. By Albertine\u2019s side, enchained by her arms within the carriage, I listened to these Oceanides. And when by chance I caught sight of one of these musicians as he flitted from one leaf to the shelter of another, there was so little apparent connexion between him and his songs that I could not believe that I beheld their cause in the little body, fluttering, humble, startled and unseeing. The carriage could not take us all the way to the church. I stopped it when we had passed through Quetteholme and bade Albertine good-bye. For she had alarmed me by saying to me of this church as of other buildings, of certain pictures: \u201cWhat a pleasure it would be to see that with you!\u201d This pleasure was one that I did not feel myself capable of giving her. I felt it myself in front of beautiful things only if I was alone or pretended to be alone and did not speak. But since she supposed that she might, thanks to me, feel sensations of art which are not communicated thus \u2014 I thought it more prudent to say that I must leave her, would come back to fetch her at the end of the day, but that in the meantime I must go back with the carriage to pay a call on Mme. Verdurin or on the Cambremers, or even spend an hour with Mamma at Balbec, but never farther afield. To begin with, that is to say. For, Albertine having once said to me petulantly: \u201cIt\u2019s a bore that Nature has arranged things so badly and put Saint-Jean de la Haise in one direction, la Raspeli\u00e8re in another, so that you\u2019re imprisoned for the whole day in the part of the country you\u2019ve chosen;\u201d as soon as the toque and veil had come I ordered, to my eventual undoing, a motor-car from Saint-Fargeau (Sanctus Ferreolus, according to the cur\u00e9\u2018s book). Albertine, whom I had kept in ignorance and who had come to call for me, was surprised when she heard in front of the hotel the purr of the engine, delighted when she learned that this motor was for ourselves. I made her come upstairs for a moment to my room. She jumped for joy. \u201cWe are going to pay a call on the Verdurins.\u201d \u201cYes, but you\u2019d better not go dressed like that since you are going to have your motor. There, you will look better in these.\u201d And I brought out the toque and veil which I had hidden. \u201cThey\u2019re for me? Oh! You are an angel,\u201d she cried, throwing her arms round my neck. Aim\u00e9 who met us on the stairs, proud of Albertine\u2019s smart attire and of our means of transport, for these vehicles were still comparatively rare at Balbec, gave himself the pleasure of coming downstairs behind us. Albertine, anxious to display herself in her new garments, asked me to have the car opened, as we could shut it later on when we wished to be more private. \u201cNow then,\u201d said Aim\u00e9 to the driver, with whom he was not acquainted and who had not stirred, \u201cdon\u2019t you (tu) hear, you\u2019re to open your roof?\u201d For Aim\u00e9, sophisticated by hotel life, in which moreover he had won his way to exalted rank, was not as shy as the cab driver to whom Fran\u00e7oise was a \u2018lady\u2019; notwithstanding the want of any formal introduction, plebeians whom he had never seen before he addressed as tu, though it was hard to say whether this was aristocratic disdain on his part or democratic fraternity. \u201cI am engaged,\u201d replied the chauffeur, who did not know me by sight. \u201cI am ordered for Mlle. Simonet. I can\u2019t take this gentleman.\u201d Aim\u00e9 burst out laughing: \u201cWhy, you great pumpkin,\u201d he said to the driver, whom he at once convinced, \u201cthis is Mademoiselle Simonet, and Monsieur, who tells you to open the roof of your car, is the person who has engaged you.\u201d And as Aim\u00e9, although personally he had no feeling for Albertine, was for my sake proud of the garments she was wearing, he whispered to the chauffeur: \u201cDon\u2019t get the chance of driving a Princess like that every day, do you?\u201d On this first occasion it was not I alone that was able to go to la Raspeli\u00e8re as I did on other days, while Albertine painted; she decided to go there with me. She did indeed think that we might stop here and there on our way, but supposed it to be impossible to start by going to Saint-Jean de la Haise. That is to say in another direction, and to make an excursion which seemed to be reserved for a different day. She learned on the contrary from the driver that nothing could be easier than to go to Saint-Jean, which he could do in twenty minutes, and that we might stay there if we chose for hours, or go on much farther, for from Quetteholme to la Raspeli\u00e8re would not take more than thirty-five minutes. We realised this as soon as the vehicle, starting off, covered in one bound twenty paces of an excellent horse. Distances are only the relation of space to time and vary with that relation. We express the difficulty that we have in getting to a place in a system of miles or kilometres which becomes false as soon as that difficulty decreases. Art is modified by it also, when a village which seemed to be in a different world from some other village becomes its neighbour in a landscape whose dimensions are altered. In any case the information that there may perhaps exist a universe in which two and two make five and the straight line is not the shortest way between two points would have astonished Albertine far less than to hear the driver say that it was easy to go in a single afternoon to Saint-Jean and la Raspeli\u00e8re, Douville and Quetteholme, Saint-Mars le Vieux and Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu, Gourville and Old Balbec, Tourville and F\u00e9terne, prisoners hitherto as hermetically confined in the cells of distinct days as long ago were M\u00e9s\u00e9glise and Guermantes, upon which the same eyes could not gaze in the course of one afternoon, delivered now by the giant with the seven-league boots, came and clustered about our tea-time their towers and steeples, their old gardens which the encroaching wood sprang back to reveal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Coming to the foot of the cliff road, the car took it in its stride, with a continuous sound like that of a knife being ground, while the sea falling away grew broader beneath us. The old rustic houses of Montsurvent ran towards us, clasping to their bosoms vine or rose-bush; the firs of la Raspeli\u00e8re, more agitated than when the evening breeze was rising, ran in every direction to escape from us and a new servant whom I had never seen before came to open the door for us on the terrace, while the gardener\u2019s son, betraying a precocious bent, devoured the machine with his gaze. As it was not a Monday we did not know whether we should find Mme. Verdurin, for except upon that day, when ^he was at home, it was unsafe to call upon her without warning. No doubt she was \u2018principally\u2019 at home, but this expression, which Mme. Swann employed at the time when she too was seeking to form her little clan, and to draw visitors to herself without moving towards them, an expression which she interpreted as meaning \u2018on principle,\u2019 meant no more than \u2018as a general rule,\u2019 that is to say with frequent exceptions. For not only did Mme. Verdurin like going out, but she carried her duties as a hostess to extreme lengths, and when she had had people to luncheon, immediately after the coffee, liqueurs and cigarettes (notwithstanding the first somnolent effects of the heat and of digestion in which they would have preferred to watch through the leafy boughs of the terrace the Jersey packet passing over the enamelled sea), the programme included a series of excursions in the course of which her guests, installed by force in carriages, were conveyed, willy-nilly, to look at one or other of the views that abound in the neighbourhood of Douville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This second part of the entertainment was, as it happened (once the effort to rise and enter the carriage had been made), no less satisfactory than the other to the guests, already prepared by the succulent dishes, the vintage wines or sparkling cider to let themselves be easily intoxicated by the purity of the breeze and the magnificence of the views. Mme. Verdurin used to make strangers visit these rather as though they were portions (more or less detached) of her property, which you could not help going to see the moment you came to luncheon with her and which conversely you would never have known had you not been entertained by the Mistress. This claim to arrogate to herself the exclusive right over walks and drives, as over Morel\u2019s and formerly Dechambre\u2019s playing, and to compel the landscapes to form part of the little clan, was not for that matter so absurd as it appears at first sight. Mme. Verdurin deplored the want of taste which, according to her, the Cambremers shewed in the furnishing of la Raspeli\u00e8re and the arrangement of the garden, but still more their want of initiative in the excursions that they took or made their guests take in the surrounding country. Just as, according to her, la Raspeli\u00e8re was only beginning to become what it should always have been now that it was the asylum of the little clan, so she insisted that the Cambremers, perpetually exploring in their barouche, along the railway line, by the shore, the one ugly road that there was in the district, had been living in the place all their lives but did not know it. There was a grain of truth in this assertion. From force of habit, lack of imagination, want of interest in a country which seemed hackneyed because it was so near, the Cambremers when they left their home went always to the same places and by the same roads. To be sure they laughed heartily at the Verdurins\u2019 offer to shew them their native country. But when it came to that, they and even their coachman would have been incapable of taking us to the splendid, more or less secret places, to which M. Verdurin brought us, now forcing the barrier of a private but deserted property upon which other people would not have thought it possible to venture, now leaving the carriage to follow a path which was not wide enough for wheeled traffic, but in either case with the certain recompense of a marvellous view. Let us say in passing that the garden at la Raspeli\u00e8re was in a sense a compendium of all the excursions to be made in a radius of many miles. For one thing because of its commanding position, overlooking on one side the valley, on the other the sea, and also because, on one and the same side, the seaward side for instance, clearings had been made through the trees in such a way that from one point you embraced one horizon, from another another. There was at each of these points of view a bench; you went and sat down in turn upon the bench from which there was the view of Balbec, or Parville, or Douville. Even to command a single view one bench would have been placed more or less on the edge of the cliff, another farther back. From the latter you had a foreground of verdure and a horizon which seemed already the vastest imaginable, but which became infinitely larger if, continuing along a little path, you went to the next bench from which you scanned the whole amphitheatre of the sea. There you could make out exactly the sound of the waves which did not penetrate to the more secluded parts of the garden, where the sea was still visible but no longer audible. These resting-places bore at la Raspeli\u00e8re among the occupants of the house the name of \u2018views.\u2019 And indeed they assembled round the mansion the finest views of the neighbouring places, coastline or forest, seen greatly diminished by distance, as Hadrian collected in his villa reduced models of the most famous monuments of different countries. The name that followed the word \u2018view\u2019 was not necessarily that of a place on the coast, but often that of the opposite shore of the bay which you could make out, standing out in a certain relief notwithstanding the extent of the panorama. Just as you took a book from M. Verdurin\u2019s library to go and read for an hour at the \u2018view of Balbec,\u2019 so if the sky was clear the liqueurs would be served at the \u2018view of Rivebelle,\u2019 on condition however that the wind was not too strong, for, in spite of the trees planted on either side, the air up there was keen. To come back to the carriage parties that Mme. Verdurin used to organise for the afternoons, the Mistress, if on her return she found the cards of some social butterfly \u2018on a flying visit to the coast,\u2019 would pretend to be overjoyed, but was actually broken-hearted at having missed his visit and (albeit people at this date came only to \u2018see the house\u2019 or to make the acquaintance for a day of a woman whose artistic salon was famous, but outside the pale in Paris) would at once make M. Verdurin invite him to dine on the following Wednesday. As the tourist was often obliged to leave before that day, or was afraid to be out late, Mme. Verdurin had arranged that on Mondays she was always to be found at teatime. These tea-parties were not at all large, and I had known more brilliant gatherings of the sort in Paris, at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s, at Mme. de Gallifet\u2019s or Mme. d\u2019Arpajon\u2019s. But this was not Paris, and the charm of the setting enhanced, in my eyes, not merely the pleasantness of the party but the merits of the visitors. A meeting with some social celebrity, which in Paris would have given me no pleasure, but which at la Raspeli\u00e8re, whither he had come from a distance by F\u00e9terne or the forest of Chantepie, changed in character, in importance, became an agreeable incident. Sometimes it was a person whom I knew quite well and would not have gone a yard to meet at the Swanns\u2019. But his name sounded differently upon this cliff, like the name of an actor whom one has constantly heard in a theatre, printed upon the announcement, in a different colour, of an extraordinary gala performance, where his notoriety is suddenly multiplied by the unexpectedness of the rest. As in the country people behave without ceremony, the social celebrity often took it upon him to bring the friends with whom he was staying, murmuring the excuse in Mme. Verdurin\u2019s ear that he could not leave them behind as he was living in their house; to his hosts on the other hand he pretended to offer, as a sort of courtesy, the distraction, in a monotonous seaside life, of being taken to a centre of wit and intellect, of visiting a magnificent mansion and of making an excellent tea. This composed at once an assembly of several persons of semi-distinction; and if a little slice of garden with a few trees, which would seem shabby in the country, acquires an extraordinary charm in the Avenue Gabriel or let us say the Rue de Monceau, where only multi-millionaires can afford such a luxury, inversely gentlemen who are of secondary importance at a Parisian party stood out at their full value on a Monday afternoon at la Raspeli\u00e8re. No sooner did they sit down at the table covered with a cloth embroidered in red, beneath the painted panels, to partake of the rock cakes, Norman puff pastry, tartlets shaped like boats filled with cherries like beads of coral, \u2018diplomatic\u2019 cakes, than these guests were subjected, by the proximity of the great bowl of azure upon which the window opened, and which you could not help seeing when you looked at them, to a profound alteration, a transmutation which changed them into something more precious than before. What was more, even before you set eyes on them, when you came on a Monday to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, people who in Paris would scarcely turn their heads to look, so familiar was the sight of a string of smart carriages waiting outside a great house, felt their hearts throb at the sight of the two or three broken-down dog-carts drawn up in front of la Raspeli\u00e8re, beneath the tall firs. No doubt this was because the rustic setting was different, and social impressions thanks to this transposition regained a kind of novelty. It was also because the broken-down carriage that one hired to pay a call upon Mme. Verdurin called to mind a pleasant drive and a costly bargain struck with a coachman who had demanded \u2018so much\u2019 for the whole day. But the slight stir of curiosity with regard to fresh arrivals, whom it was still impossible to distinguish, made everybody ask himself: \u201cWho can this be?\u201d a question which it was difficult to answer, when one did not know who might have come down to spend a week with the Cambremers or elsewhere, but which people always enjoy putting to themselves in rustic, solitary lives where a meeting with a human creature whom one has not seen for a long time ceases to be the tiresome affair that it is in the life of Paris, and forms a delicious break in the empty monotony of lives that are too lonely, in which even the postman\u2019s knock becomes a pleasure. And on the day on which we arrived in a motor-car at la Raspeli\u00e8re, as it was not Monday, M. and Mme. Verdurin must have been devoured by that craving to see people which attacks men and women and inspires a longing to throw himself out of the window in the patient who has been shut up away from his family and friends, for a cure of strict isolation. For the new and more swift-footed servant, who had already made himself familiar with these expressions, having replied that \u201cif Madame has not gone out she must be at the view of Douville,\u201d and that he would go and look for her, came back immediately to tell us that she was coming to welcome us. We found her slightly dishevelled, for she came from the flower beds, farmyard and kitchen garden, where she had gone to feed her peacocks and poultry, to hunt for eggs, to gather fruit and flowers to \u2018make her table-centre,\u2019 which would suggest her park in miniature; but on the table it conferred the distinction of making it support the burden of only such things as were useful and good to eat; for round those other presents from the garden which were the pears, the whipped eggs, rose the tall stems of bugloss, carnations, roses and coreopsis, between which one saw, as between blossoming boundary posts, move from one to another beyond the glazed windows, the ships at sea. From the astonishment which M. and Mme. Verdurin, interrupted while arranging their flowers to receive the visitors that had been announced, shewed upon finding that these visitors were merely Albertine and myself, it was easy to see that the new servant, full of zeal but not yet familiar with my name, had repeated it wrongly and that Mme. Verdurin, hearing the names of guests whom she did not know, had nevertheless bidden him let them in, in her need of seeing somebody, no matter whom. And the new servant stood contemplating this spectacle from the door in order to learn what part we played in the household. Then he made off at a run, taking long strides, for he had entered upon his duties only the day before. When Albertine had quite finished displaying her toque and veil to the Verdurins, she gave me a warning look to remind me that we had not too much time left for what we meant to do. Mme. Verdurin begged us to stay to tea, but we refused, when all of a sudden a suggestion was mooted which would have made an end of all the pleasures that I promised myself from my drive with Albertine: the Mistress, unable to face the thought of tearing herself from us, or perhaps of allowing a novel distraction to escape, decided to accompany us. Accustomed for years past to the experience that similar offers on her part were not well received, and being probably dubious whether this offer would find favour with us, she concealed beneath an excessive assurance the timidity that she felt when addressing us and, without even appearing to suppose that there could be any doubt as to our answer, asked us no question, but said to her husband, speaking of Albertine and myself, as though she were conferring a favour on us: \u201cI shall see them home, myself.\u201d At the same time there hovered over her lips a smile that did not belong to them, a smile which I had already seen on the faces of certain people when they said to Bergotte with a knowledgeable air: \u201cI have bought your book, it\u2019s not bad,\u201d one of those collective, universal smiles which, when they feel the need of them \u2014 as we make use of railways and removal vans \u2014 individuals borrow, except a few who are extremely refined, like Swann or M. de Charlus on whose lips I have never seen that smile settle. From that moment my visit was poisoned. I pretended not to have understood. A moment later it became evident that M. Verdurin was to be one of the party. \u201cBut it will be too far for M. Verdurin,\u201d I objected. \u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin with a condescending, cheerful air, \u201che says it will amuse him immensely to go with you young people over a road he has travelled so many times; if necessary, he will sit beside the engineer, that doesn\u2019t frighten him, and we shall come back quietly by the train like a good married couple. Look at him, he\u2019s quite delighted.\u201d She seemed to be speaking of an aged and famous painter full of friendliness, who, younger than the youngest, takes a delight in scribbling figures on paper to make his grandchildren laugh. What added to my sorrow was that Albertine seemed not to share it and to find some amusement in the thought of dashing all over the countryside like this with the Verdurins. As for myself, the pleasure that I had vowed that I would take with her was so imperious that I refused to allow the Mistress to spoil it; I invented falsehoods which the irritating threats of Mme. Verdurin made excusable, but which Albertine, alas, contradicted. \u201cBut we have a call to pay,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat call?\u201d asked Albertine. \u201cYou shall hear about it later, there\u2019s no getting out of it.\u201d \u201cVery well, we can wait outside,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, resigned to anything. At the last minute my anguish at seeing wrested from me a happiness for which I had so longed gave me the courage to be impolite. I refused point blank, alleging in Mme. Verdurin\u2019s ear that because of some trouble which had befallen Albertine and about which she wished to consult me, it was absolutely necessary that I should be alone with her. The Mistress appeared vexed: \u201cAll right, we shan\u2019t come,\u201d she said to me in a voice tremulous with rage. I felt her to be so angry that, so as to appear to be giving way a little: \u201cBut we might perhaps . . . \u201d I began. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied, more furious than ever, \u201cwhen I say no, I mean no.\u201d I supposed that I was out of favour with her, but she called us back at the door to urge us not to \u2018fail\u2019 on the following Wednesday, and not to come with that contraption, which was dangerous at night, but by the train with the little group, and she made me stop the car, which was moving down hill across the park, because the footman had forgotten to put in the hood the slice of tart and the shortbread which she had had made into a parcel for us. We started off, escorted for a moment by the little houses that came running to meet us with their flowers. The face of the countryside seemed to us entirely changed, so far, in the topographical image that we form in our minds of separate places, is the notion of space from being the most important factor. We have said that the notion of time segregates them even farther. It is not the only factor either. Certain places which we see always in isolation seem to us to have no common measure with the rest, to be almost outside the world, like those people whom we have known in exceptional periods of our life, during our military service, in our childhood, and whom we associate with nothing. In my first year at Balbec there was a piece of high ground to which Mme. de Villeparisis liked to take us because from it you saw only the water and the woods, and which was called Beaumont. As the road that she took to approach it, and preferred to other routes because of its old trees, went up hill all the way, her carriage was obliged to go at a crawling pace and took a very long time. When we reached the top we used to alight, stroll about for a little, get into the carriage again, return by the same road, without seeing a single village, a single country house. I knew that Beaumont was something very special, very remote, very high, I had no idea of the direction in which it was to be found, having never taken the Beaumont road to go anywhere else; besides, it took a very long time to get there in a carriage. It was obviously in the same Department (or in the same Province) as Balbec, but was situated for me on another plane, enjoyed a special privilege of extra-territoriality. But the motor-car respects no mystery, and, having passed beyond Incarville, whose houses still danced before my eyes, as we were going down the cross road that leads to Parville (Paterni villa), catching sight of the sea from a natural terrace over which we were passing, I asked the name of the place, and before the chauffeur had time to reply recognised Beaumont, close by which I passed thus unconsciously whenever I took the little train, for it was within two minutes of Parville. Like an officer of my regiment who might have seemed to me a creature apart, too kindly and simple to be of a great family, too remote already and mysterious to be simply of a great family, and of whom I was afterwards to learn that he was the brother-in-law, the cousin of people with whom I was dining, so Beaumont, suddenly brought in contact with places from which I supposed it to be so distinct, lost its mystery and took its place in the district, making me think with terror that Madame Bovary and the Sanseverina might perhaps have seemed to me to be like ordinary people, had I met them elsewhere than in the close atmosphere of a novel. It may be thought that my love of magic journeys by train ought to have prevented me from sharing Albertine\u2019s wonder at the motor-car which takes even the invalid wherever he wishes to go and destroys our conception \u2014 which I had held hitherto \u2014 of position in space as the individual mark, the irreplaceable essence of irremovable beauties. And no doubt this position in space was not to the motor-car, as it had been to the railway train, when I came from Paris to Balbec, a goal exempt from the contingencies of ordinary life, almost ideal at the moment of departure, and, as it remains so at that of arrival, at our arrival in that great dwelling where no one dwells and which bears only the name of the town, the station, seeming to promise at last the accessibility of the town, as though the station were its materialisation. No, the motor-car did not convey us thus by magic into a town which we saw at first in the whole that is summarised by ite name, and with the illusions of a spectator in a theatre. It made us enter that theatre by the wings which were the streets, stopped to ask the way of an inhabitant. But, as a compensation for so familiar a progress one has the gropings of the chauffeur uncertain of his way and retracing his course, the \u2018general post\u2019 of perspective which sets a castle dancing about with a hill, a church and the sea, while one draws nearer to it, in spite of its vain efforts to hide beneath its primeval foliage; those ever narrowing circles which the motor-car describes round a spellbound town which darts off in every direction to escape it and upon which finally it drops down, straight, into the heart of the valley where it lies palpitating on the ground; so that this position in space, this unique point, which the motor-car seems to have stripped of the mystery of express trains, it gives us on the contrary the impression of discovering, of determining for ourselves as with a compass, of helping us to feel with a more fondly exploring hand, with a finer precision, the true geometry, the fair measure of the earth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What unfortunately I did not know at that moment and did not learn until more than two years later was that one of the chauffeur\u2019s patrons was M. de Charlus, and that Morel, instructed to pay him and keeping part of the money for himself (making the chauffeur triple and quintuple the mileage), had become very friendly with him (while pretending not to know him before other people) and made use of his car for long journeys. If I had known this at the time, and that the confidence which the Verdurins were presently to feel in this chauffeur came, unknown to them, from that source, perhaps many of the sorrows of my life in Paris, in the year that followed, much of my trouble over Albertine would have been avoided, but I had not the slightest suspicion of it. In themselves M. de Charlus\u2019s excursions by motor-car with Morel were of no direct interest to me. They were moreover confined as a rule to a luncheon or dinner in some restaurant along the coast where M. de Charlus was regarded as an old and penniless servant and Morel, whose duty it was to pay the bill, as a too kind-hearted gentleman. I report the conversation at one of these meals, which may give an idea of the others. It was in a restaurant of elongated shape at Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu. \u201cCan\u2019t you get them to remove this thing?\u201d M. de Charlus asked Morel, as though appealing to an intermediary without having to address the staff directly. \u2018This thing\u2019 was a vase containing three withered roses with which a well-meaning head waiter had seen fit to decorate the table. \u201cYes . . . \u201d said Morel in embarrassment. \u201cYou don\u2019t like roses?\u201d \u201cMy request ought on the contrary to prove that I do like them, since there are no roses here\u201d (Morel appeared surprised) \u201cbut as a matter of fact I do not care much for them. I am rather sensitive to names; and whenever a rose is at all beautiful, one learns that it is called Baronne de Rothschild or Mar\u00e9chale Niel, which casts a chill. Do you like names? Have you found beautiful titles for your little concert numbers?\u201d \u201cThere is one that is called Po\u00e8me triste.\u201d \u201cThat is horrible,\u201d replied M. de Charlus in a shrill voice that rang out like a blow. \u201cBut I ordered champagne?\u201d he said to the head waiter who had supposed he was obeying the order by placing by the diners two glasses of foaming liquid. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d \u201cTake away that filth, which has no connexion with the worst champagne in the world. It is the emetic known as cup, which consists, as a rule, of three rotten strawberries swimming in a mixture of vinegar and soda-water. Yes,\u201d he went on, turning again to Morel, \u201cyou don\u2019t seem to know what a title is. And even in the interpretation of the things you play best, you seem not to be aware of the mediumistic side.\u201d \u201cYou mean to say?\u201d asked Morel, who, not having understood one word of what the Baron had said, was afraid that he might be missing something of importance, such as an invitation to luncheon. M. de Charlus having failed to regard \u201cYou mean to say?\u201d as a question, Morel, having in Consequence received no answer, thought it best to change the conversation and to give it a sensual turn: \u201cThere, look at the fair girl selling the flowers you don\u2019t like; I\u2019m certain she\u2019s got a little mistress. And the old woman dining at the table at the end, too.\u201d \u201cBut how do you know all that?\u201d asked M. de Charlus, amazed at Morel\u2019s intuition. \u201cOh! I can spot them in an instant. If we went out together in a crowd, you would see that I never make a mistake.\u201d And anyone looking at Morel at that moment, with his girlish air enshrined in his masculine beauty, would have understood the obscure divination which made him no less obvious to certain women than them to him. He was anxious to supplant Jupien, vaguely desirous of adding to his regular income the profits which, he supposed, the tailor derived from the Baron. \u201cAnd with boys I am surer still, I could save you from making any mistake. We shall be having the fair soon at Balbec, we shall find lots of things there. And in Paris too, you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll have a fine time.\u201d But the inherited caution of a servant made him give a different turn to the sentence on which he had already embarked. So that M. de Charlus supposed that he was still referring to girls. \u201cListen,\u201d said Morel, anxious to excite in a fashion which he considered less compromising for himself (albeit it was actually more immoral) the Baron\u2019s senses, \u201cwhat I should like would be to find a girl who was quite pure, make her fall in love with me, and take her virginity.\u201d M. de Charlus could not refrain from pinching Morel\u2019s ear affectionately, but added innocently: \u201cWhat good would that be to you? If you took her maidenhead, you would be obliged to marry her.\u201d \u201cMarry her?\u201d cried Morel, guessing that the Baron was fuddled, or else giving no thought to the man, more scrupulous in reality than he supposed, to whom he was speaking. \u201cMarry her? Balls! I should promise, but once the little operation was performed, I should clear out and leave her.\u201d M. de Charlus was in the habit, when a fiction was capable of causing him a momentary sensual pleasure, of believing in its truth, while keeping himself free to withdraw his credulity altogether a minute later, when his pleasure was at an end. \u201cYou would really do that?\u201d he said to Morel with a laugh, squeezing him more tightly still. \u201cAnd why not?\u201d said Morel, seeing that he was not shocking the Baron by continuing to expound to him what was indeed one of his desires. \u201cIt is dangerous,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cI should have my kit packed and ready, and buzz off and leave no address.\u201d \u201cAnd what about me?\u201d asked M. de Charlus. \u201cI should take you with me, of course,\u201d Morel made haste to add, never having thought of what would become of the Baron who was the least of his responsibilities. \u201cI say, there\u2019s a kid I should love to try that game on, she\u2019s a little seamstress who keeps a shop in M. le Due\u2019s h\u00f4tel.\u201d \u201cJupien\u2019s girl,\u201d the Baron exclaimed, as the wine-waiter entered the room. \u201cOh! Never,\u201d he added, whether because the presence of a third person had cooled his ardour, or because even in this sort of black mass in which he took a delight in defiling the most sacred things, he could not bring himself to allow the mention of people to whom he was bound by ties of friendship. \u201cJupien is a good man, the child is charming, it would be a shame to make them unhappy.\u201d Morel felt that he had gone too far and was silent, but his gaze continued to fix itself in imagination upon the girl for whose benefit he had once begged me to address him as \u2018dear great master\u2019 and from whom he had ordered a waistcoat. An industrious worker, the child had not taken any holiday, but I learned afterwards that while the violinist was in the neighbourhood of Balbec she never ceased to think of his handsome face, ennobled by the accident that having seen Morel in my company she had taken him for a \u2018gentleman.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI never heard Chopin play,\u201d said the Baron, \u201cand yet I might have done so, I took lessons from Stamati, but he forbade me to go and hear the Master of the Nocturnes at my aunt Chimay\u2019s.\u201d \u201cThat was damned silly of him,\u201d exclaimed Morel. \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d M. de Charlus retorted warmly, in a shrill voice. \u201cHe shewed his intelligence. He had realised that I had a \u2018nature\u2019 and that I would succumb to Chopin\u2019s influence. It made no difference, because when I was quite young I gave up music, and everything else, for that matter. Besides one can more or less imagine him,\u201d he added in a slow, nasal, drawling tone, \u201cthere are still people who did hear him, who can give you an idea. However, Chopin was only an excuse to come back to the mediumistic aspect which you are neglecting.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reader will observe that, after an interpolation of common parlance, M. de Charlus had suddenly become as precious and haughty in his speech as ever. The idea of Morel\u2019s \u2018dropping\u2019 without compunction a girl whom he had outraged had given him a sudden and entire pleasure. From that moment his sensual appetites were satisfied for a time and the sadist (a true medium, he, if you like) who had for a few moments taken the place of M. de Charlus had fled, leaving a clear field for the real M. de Charlus, full of artistic refinement, sensibility, goodness. \u201cYou were playing the other day the transposition for the piano of the Fifteenth Quartet, which is absurd in itself because nothing could be less pianistic. It is meant for people whose ears are hurt by the too highly strained chords of the glorious Deaf One. Whereas it is precisely that almost bitter mysticism that is divine. In any case you played it very badly and altered all the movements. You ought to play it as though you were composing it: the young Morel, afflicted with a momentary deafness and with a non-existent genius stands for an instant motionless. Then, seized by the divine frenzy, he plays, he composes the opening bars. After which, exhausted by this initial effort, he gives way, letting droop his charming forelock to please Mme. Verdur\u00een, and, what is more, gives himself time to recreate the prodigious quantity of grey matter which he has commandeered for the Pythian objectivation. Then, having regained his strength, seized by a fresh and overmastering inspiration, he flings himself upon the sublime, imperishable phrase which the virtuoso of Berlin\u201d (we suppose M. de Charlus to have meant by this expression Mendelssohn) \u201cwas to imitate without ceasing. It is in this, the only really transcendent and animating fashion, that I shall make you play in Paris.\u201d When M. de Charlus gave him advice of this sort, Morel was far more alarmed than when he saw the head waiter remove his scorned roses and \u2018cup,\u2019 for he asked himself with anxiety what effect it would create among his \u2018class.\u2019 But he was unable to dwell upon these reflexions, for M. de Charlus said to him imperiously: \u201cAsk the head waiter if he has a Bon Chr\u00e9tien.\u201d \u201cA good Christian, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t you see we\u2019ve reached the dessert, it\u2019s a pear. You may be sure, Mme. de Cambremer has them in her garden, for the Comtesse d\u2019Escarbagnas whose double she is had them. M. Thibaudier sends her them, saying: \u2018Here is a Bon Chr\u00e9tien which is worth tasting.\u2019\u201d \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cI can see that you know nothing. If you have never even read Moli\u00e8re. . . . Oh, well, since you are no more capable of ordering food than of anything else, ask simply for a pear which is grown in this neighbourhood, the Louise-Bonne d\u2019Avranches.\u201d \u201cThe?\u201d \u201cWait a minute, since you are so stupid, I shall ask him myself for others, which I prefer. Waiter, have you any Doyenn\u00e9e des Cornices? Charlie, you must read the exquisite passage about that pear by the Duchesse Emilie de Clermont-Tonnerre.\u201d \u201cNo, Sir, there aren\u2019t any.\u201d \u201cHave you Triomphe de Jodoigne?\u201d \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d \u201cAny Virginie-Dallet? Or Passe-Colmar? No? Very well, since you\u2019ve nothing, we may as well go. The Duchesse d\u2019Angoul\u00eame is not in season yet, come along, Charlie.\u201d Unfortunately for M. de Charlus, his want of common sense, perhaps too the chastity of what were probably his relations with Morel, made him go out of his way at this period to shower upon the violinist strange bounties which the other was incapable of understanding, and to which his nature, impulsive in its own way, but mean and ungrateful, could respond only by a harshness or a violence that were steadily intensified and plunged M. de Charlus \u2014 formerly so proud, now quite timid \u2014 in fits of genuine despair. We shall see how, in the smallest matters, Morel, who fancied himself a M. de Charlus a thousand times more important, completely misunderstood, by taking it literally, the Baron\u2019s arrogant information with regard to the aristocracy. Let us for the moment say simply this, while Albertine waits for me at Saint-Jean de la Haise, that if there was one thing which Morel set above nobility (and this was in itself distinctly noble, especially in a person whose pleasure was to pursue little girls \u2014 on the sly \u2014 with the chauffeur), it was his artistic reputation and what the others might think of him in the violin class. No doubt it was an ugly trait in his character that because he felt M. de Charlus to be entirely devoted to him he appeared to disown him, to make fun of him, in the same way as, when I had promised not to reveal the secret of his father\u2019s position with my great-uncle, he treated me with contempt. But on the other hand his name, as that of a recognised artist, Morel, appeared to him superior to a \u2018name.\u2019 And when M. de Charlus, in his dreams of Platonic affection, tried to make him adopt one of his family titles, Morel stoutly refused\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Albertine thought it better to remain at Saint-Jean de la Haise and paint, I would take the car, and it was not merely to Gourville and F\u00e9terne, but to Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu and as far as Criquetot that I was able to penetrate before returning to fetch her. While pretending to be occupied with anything rather than herself, and to be obliged to forsake her for other pleasures, I thought only of her. As often as not I went no farther than the great plain which overlooks Gourville, and as it resembles slightly the plain that begins above Combray, in the direction of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, even at a considerable distance from Albertine, I had the joy of thinking that if my gaze could not reach her, still, travelling farther than in my vision, that strong and gentle sea breeze which was sweeping past me must be flowing down, without anything to arrest it as far as Quetteholme, until it stirred the branches of the trees that bury Saint-Jean de la Haise in their foliage, caressing the face of my mistress, and must thus be extending a double tie between her and myself in this retreat indefinitely enlarged, but without danger, as in those games in which two children find themselves momentarily out of sight and earshot of one another, and yet, while far apart, remain together. I returned by those roads from which there is a view of the sea, and on which in the past, before it appeared among the branches, I used to shut my eyes to reflect that what I was going to see was indeed the plaintive ancestress of the earth, pursuing as in the days when no living creature yet existed its lunatic, immemorial agitation. Now, these roads were no longer, simply the means of rejoining Albertine; when I recognised each of them in their uniformity, knowing how far they would run in a straight line, where they would turn, I remembered that I had followed them while I thought of Mlle, de Stermaria, and also that this same eagerness to find Albertine I had felt in Paris as I walked the streets along which Mme. de Guermantes might pass; they assumed for me the profound monotony, the moral significance of a sort of ruled line that my character must follow. It was natural, and yet it was not without importance; they reminded me that it was my fate to pursue only phantoms, creatures whose reality existed to a great extent in my imagination; there are people indeed \u2014 and this had been my case from my childhood \u2014 for whom all the things that have a fixed value, assessable by others, fortune, success, high positions, do not count; what they must have, is phantoms. They sacrifice all the rest, leave no stone unturned, make everything else subservient to the capture of some phantom. But this soon fades away; then they run after another, prepared to return later on to the first. It was not the first time that I had gone in quest of Albertine, the girl I had seen that first year outlined against the sea. Other women, it is true, had been interposed between the Albertine whom I had first loved and her from whom I was scarcely separated at this moment; other women, notably the Duchesse de Guermantes. But, the reader will say, why give yourself so much anxiety with regard to Gilberte, take so much trouble over Madame de Guermantes, if, when you have become the friend of the latter, it is with the sole result of thinking no more of her, but only of Albertine? Swann, before his own death, might have answered the question, he who had been a lover of phantoms. Of phantoms pursued, forgotten, sought afresh sometimes for a single meeting and in order to establish contact with an unreal life which at once escaped, these Balbec roads were full. When I thought that their trees, pear trees, apple trees, tamarisks, would outlive me, I seemed to receive from them the warning to set myself to work at last, before the hour should strike of rest everlasting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I left the carriage at Quetteholme, ran down the sunken path, crossed the brook by a plank and found Albertine painting in front of the church all spires and crockets, thorny and red, blossoming like a rose bush. The lantern alone shewed an unbroken front; and the smiling surface of the stone was abloom with angels who continued, before the twentieth century couple that we were, to celebrate, taper in hand, the ceremonies of the thirteenth. It was they that Albertine was endeavouring to portray on her prepared canvas, and, imitating Elstir, she was laying on the paint in sweeping strokes, trying to obey the noble rhythm set, the great master had told her, by those angels so different from any that he knew. Then she collected her things. Leaning upon one another we walked back up the sunken path, leaving the little church, as quiet as though it had never seen us, to listen to the perpetual sound of the brook. Presently the car started, taking us home by a different way. We passed Marcouville l\u2019Orgueilleuse. Over its church, half new, half restored, the setting sun spread its patina as fine as that of centuries. Through it the great has-reliefs seemed to be visible only through a floating layer, half liquid, half luminous; the Blessed Virgin, Saint Elizabeth, Saint Joachim swam in the impalpable tide, almost on dry land, on the water\u2019s or the sunlight\u2019s surface. Rising in a warm dust, the many modern statues reached, on their pillars, halfway up the golden webs of sunset. In front of the church a tall cypress seemed to be in a sort of consecrated enclosure. We left the car for a moment to look at it and strolled for a little. No less than of her limbs, Albertine was directly conscious of her toque of Leghorn straw and of the silken veil (which were for her the source of no less satisfaction), and derived from them, as we strolled round the church, a different sort of impetus, revealed by a contentment which was inert but in which I found a certain charm; veil and toque which were but a recent, adventitious part of my friend, but a part that was already dear to me, as I followed its trail with my eyes, past the cypress in the evening air. She herself could not see it, but guessed that the effect was pleasing, for she smiled at me, harmonising the poise of her head with the headgear that completed it. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s restored,\u201d she said to me, pointing to the church and remembering what Elstir had said to her about the priceless, inimitable beauty of old stone. Albertine could tell a restoration at a glance. One could not help feeling surprised at the sureness of the taste she had already acquired in architecture, as contrasted with the deplorable taste she still retained in music. I cared no more than Elstir for this church, it was with no pleasure to myself that its sunlit front had come and posed before my eyes, and I had got out of the car to examine it only out of politeness to Albertine. I found, however, that the great impressionist had contradicted himself; why exalt this fetish of its objective architectural value, and not take into account the transfiguration of the church by the sunset? \u201cNo, certainly not,\u201d said Albertine, \u201cI don\u2019t like it; I like its name orgueilleuse. But what I must remember to ask Brichot is why Saint-Mars is called le V\u00eatu. We shall be going there next, shan\u2019t we?\u201d she said, gazing at me out of her black eyes over which her toque was pulled down, like her little polo cap long ago. Her veil floated behind her. I got back into the car with her, happy in the thought that we should be going next day to Saint-Mars, where, in this blazing weather when one could think only of the delights of a bath, the two ancient steeples, salmon-pink, with their lozenge-shaped tiles, gaping slightly as though for air, looked like a pair of old, sharp-snouted fish, coated in scales, moss-grown and red, which without seeming to move were rising in a blue, transparent water. On leaving Marcouville, to shorten the road, we turned aside at a crossroads where there is a farm. Sometimes Albertine made the car stop there and asked me to go alone to fetch, so that she might drink it in the car, a bottle of calvados or cider, which the people assured me was not effervescent, and which proceeded to drench us from head to foot. We sat pressed close together. The people of the farm could scarcely see Albertine in the closed car, I handed them back their bottles; we moved on again, as though to continue that private life by ourselves, that lovers\u2019 existence which they might suppose us to lead, and of which this halt for refreshment had been only an insignificant moment; a supposition that would have appeared even less far-fetched if they had seen us after Albertine had drunk her bottle of cider; she seemed then positively unable to endure the existence of an interval between herself and me which as a rule did not trouble her; beneath her linen skirt her legs were pressed against mine, she brought close against my cheeks her own cheeks which had turned pale, warm and red over the cheekbones, with something ardent and faded about them such as one sees in girls from the slums. At such moments, almost as quickly as her personality, her voice changed also, she forsook her own voice to adopt another, raucous, bold, almost dissolute. Night began to fall. What a pleasure to feel her leaning against me, with her toque and her veil, reminding me that it is always thus, seated side by side, that we meet couples who are in love. I was perhaps in love with Albertine, but as I did not venture to let her see my love, although it existed in me, it could only be like an abstract truth, of no value until one has succeeded in checking it by experiment; as it was, it seemed to me unrealisable and outside the plane of life. As for my jealousy, it urged me to leave Albertine as little as possible, although I knew that it would not be completely cured until I had parted from her for ever. I could even feel it in her presence, but would then take care that the circumstances should not be repeated which had aroused it. Once, for example, on a fine morning, we went to luncheon at Rivebelle. The great glazed doors of the dining-room and of that hall in the form of a corridor in which tea was served stood open revealing the sunlit lawns beyond, of which the huge restaurant seemed to form a part. The waiter with the flushed face and black hair that writhed like flames was flying from end to end of that vast expanse less rapidly than in the past, for he was no longer an assistant but was now in charge of a row of tables; nevertheless, owing to his natural activity, sometimes far off, in the dining-room, at other times nearer, but out of doors, serving visitors who had preferred to feed in the garden, one caught sight of him, now here, now there, like successive statues of a young god running, some in the interior, which for that matter was well lighted, of a mansion bounded by a vista of green grass, others beneath the trees, in the bright radiance of an open air life. For a moment he was close to ourselves. Albertine replied absent mindedly to what I had just said to her. She was gazing at him with rounded eyes. For a minute or two I felt that one may be close to the person whom one loves and yet not have her with one. They had the appearance of being engaged in a mysterious conversation, rendered mute by my presence, and the sequel possibly of meetings in the past of which I knew nothing, or merely of a glance that he had given her \u2014 at which I was the terzo incomodo, from whom the others try to hide things. Even when, forcibly recalled by his employer, he had withdrawn from us, Albertine while continuing her meal seemed to be regarding the restaurant and its gardens merely as a lighted running-track, on which there appeared here and there amid the varied scenery the swift-foot god with the black tresses. At one moment I asked myself whether she was not going to rise up and follow him, leaving me alone at my table. But in the days that followed I began to forget for ever this painful impression, for I had decided never to return to Rivebelle, I had extracted a promise from Albertine, who assured me that she had never been there before and would never return there. And I denied that the nimble-footed waiter had had eyes only for her, so that she should not believe that my company had deprived her of a pleasure. It happened now and again that I would revisit Rivebelle, but alone, and drink too much, as I had done there in the past. As I drained a final glass I gazed at a round pattern painted on the white wall, concentrated upon it the pleasure that I felt. It alone in the world had any existence for me; I pursued it, touched it and lost it by turns with my wavering glance, and felt indifferent to the future, contenting myself with my painted pattern like a butterfly circling about a poised butterfly with which it is going to end its life in an act of supreme consummation. The moment was perhaps particularly well chosen for giving up a woman whom no very recent or very keen suffering obliged me to ask for this balm for a malady which they possess who have caused it. I was calmed by these very drives, which, even if I did not think of them at the moment save as a foretaste of a morrow which itself, notwithstanding the longing with which it filled me, was not to be different from to-day, had the charm of having been torn from the places which Albertine had frequented hitherto and where I had not been with her, her aunt\u2019s house, those of her girl friends. The charm not of a positive joy, but only of the calming of an anxiety, and quite strong nevertheless. For at an interval of a few days, when my thoughts turned to the farm outside which we had sat drinking cider, or simply to the stroll we had taken round Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu, remembering that Albertine had been walking by my side in her toque, the sense of her presence added of a sudden so strong a virtue to the trivial image of the modern church that at the moment when the sunlit front came thus of its own accord to pose before me in memory, it was like a great soothing compress laid upon my heart. I dropped Albertine at Parville, but only to join her again in the evening and lie stretched out by her side, in the darkness, upon the beach. No doubt I did not see her every day, still I could say to myself: \u201cIf she were to give an account of how she spent her time, of her life, it would still be myself that played the largest part in it;\u201d and we spent together long hours on end which brought into my days so sweet an intoxication that even when, at Parville, she jumped from the car which I was to send to fetch her an hour later, I no more felt myself to be alone in it than if before leaving me she had strewn it with flowers. I might have dispensed with seeing her every day; I was going to be happy when I left her, and I knew that the calming effect of that happiness might be prolonged over many days. But at that moment I heard Albertine as she left me say to her aunt or to a girl friend: \u201cThen to-morrow at eight-thirty. We mustn\u2019t be late, the others will be ready at a quarter past.\u201d The conversation of a woman one loves is like the soil that covers a subterranean and dangerous water; one feels at every moment beneath the words the presence, the penetrating chill of an invisible pool; one perceives here and there its treacherous percolation, but the water itself remains hidden. The moment I heard these words of Albertine, my calm was destroyed. I wanted to ask her to let me see her the following morning, so as to prevent her from going to this mysterious rendezvous at half-past eight which had been mentioned in my presence only in covert terms. She would no doubt have begun by obeying me, while regretting that she had to give up her plans; in time she would have discovered my permanent need to upset them; I should have become the person from whom one hides everything. Besides, it is probable that these gatherings from which I was excluded amounted to very little, and that it was perhaps from the fear that I might find one of the other girls there vulgar or boring that I was not invited to them. Unfortunately this life so closely involved with Albertine\u2019s had a reaction not only upon myself; to me it brought calm; to my mother it caused an anxiety, her confession of which destroyed my calm. As I entered the hotel happy in my own mind, determined to terminate, one day soon, an existence the end of which I imagined to depend upon my own volition, my mother said to me, hearing me send a message to the chauffeur to go and fetch Albertine: \u201cHow you do waste your money.\u201d (Fran\u00e7oise in her simple and expressive language said with greater force: \u201cThat\u2019s the way the money goes.\u201d) \u201cTry,\u201d Mamma went on, \u201cnot to become like Charles de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, of whom his mother said: \u2018His hand is a crucible in which money melts.\u2019 Besides, I do really think you have gone about quite enough with Albertine. I assure you, you\u2019re overdoing it, even to her it may seem ridiculous. I was delighted to think that you found her a distraction, I am not asking you never to see her again, but simply that it may not be impossible to meet one of you without the other.\u201d My life with Albertine, a life devoid of keen pleasures \u2014 that is to say of keen pleasures that I could feel \u2014 that life which I intended to change at any moment, choosing a calm interval, became once again suddenly and for a time necessary to me when, by these words of Mamma\u2019s, it found itself threatened. I told my mother that what she had just said would delay for perhaps two months the decision for which she asked, which otherwise I would have reached before the end of that week. Mamma began to laugh (so as not to depress me) at this instantaneous effect of her advice, and promised not to speak of the matter to me again so as not to prevent the rebirth of my good intentions. But since my grandmother\u2019s death, whenever Mamma allowed herself to laugh, the incipient laugh would be cut short and would end in an almost heartbroken expression of sorrow, whether from remorse at having been able for an instant to forget, or else from the recrudescence which this brief moment of oblivion had given to her cruel obsession. But to the thoughts aroused in her by the memory of my grandmother, which was rooted in my mother\u2019s mind, I felt that on this occasion there were added others, relative to myself, to what my mother dreaded as the sequel of my intimacy with Albertine; an intimacy to which she dared not, however, put a stop, in view of what I had just told her. But she did not appear convinced that I was not mistaken. She remembered all the years in which my grandmother and she had refrained from speaking to me of my work, and of a more wholesome rule of life which, I said, the agitation into which their exhortations threw me alone prevented me from beginning, and which, notwithstanding their obedient silence, I had failed to pursue. After dinner the car brought Albertine back; there was still a glimmer of daylight; the air was not so warm, but after a scorching day we both dreamed of strange and delicious coolness; then to our fevered eyes the narrow slip of moon appeared at first (as on the evening when I had gone to the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s and Albertine had telephoned to me) like the slight, fine rind, then like the cool section of a fruit which an invisible knife was beginning to peel in the sky. Sometimes too, it was I that went in search of my mistress, a little later in that case; she would be waiting for me before the arcade of the market at Maineville. At first I could not make her out; I would begin to fear that she might not be coming, that she had misunderstood me. Then I saw her in her white blouse with blue spots spring into the car by my side with the light bound of a young animal rather than a girl. And it was like a dog too that she began to caress me interminably. When night had fallen and, as the manager of the hotel remarked to me, the sky was all \u2018studied\u2019 with stars, if we did not go for a drive in the forest with a bottle of champagne, then, without heeding the strangers who were still strolling upon the faintly lighted front, but who could not have seen anything a yard away on the dark sand, we would lie down in the shelter of the dunes; that same body in whose suppleness abode all the feminine, marine and sportive grace of the girls whom I had seen for the first time pass before a horizon of waves, I held pressed against my own, beneath the same rug, by the edge of the motionless sea divided by a tremulous path of light; and we listened to the sea without tiring and with the same pleasure, both when it held its breath, suspended for so long that one thought the reflux would never come, and when at last it gasped out at our feet the long awaited murmur. Finally I took Albertine back to Parville. When we reached her house, we were obliged to break off our kisses for fear lest some one should see us; not wishing to go to bed she returned with me to Balbec, from where I took her back for the last time to Parville; the chauffeurs of those early days of the motor-car were people who went to bed at all hours. And as a matter of fact I returned to Balbec only with the first dews of morning, alone this time, but still surrounded with the presence of my mistress, gorged with an inexhaustible provision of kisses. On my table I would find a telegram or a postcard. Albertine again! She had written them at Quetteholme when I had gone off by myself in the car, to tell me that she was thinking of me. I got into bed as I read them over. Then I caught sight, over the curtains, of the bright streak of daylight and said to myself that we must be in love with one another after all, since we had spent the night in one another\u2019s arms. When next morning I caught sight of Albertine on the front, I was so afraid of her telling me that she was not free that day, and could not accede to my request that we should go out together, that I delayed as long as possible making the request. I was all the more uneasy since she wore a cold, preoccupied air; people were passing whom she knew; doubtless she had made plans for the afternoon from which I was excluded. I looked at her, I looked at that charming body, that blushing head of Albertine, rearing in front of me the enigma of her intentions, the unknown decision which was to create the happiness or misery of my afternoon. It was a whole state of the soul, a whole future existence that had assumed before my eyes the allegorical and fatal form of a girl. And when at last I made up my mind, when with the most indifferent air that I could muster, I asked: \u201cAre we to go out together now, and again this evening?\u201d and she replied: \u201cWith the greatest pleasure,\u201d then the sudden replacement, in the rosy face, of my long uneasiness by a-delicious sense of ease made even more precious to me those outlines to which I was perpetually indebted for the comfort, the relief that we feel after a storm has broken. I repeated to myself: \u201cHow sweet she is, what an adorable creature!\u201d in an excitement less fertile than that caused by intoxication, scarcely more profound than that of friendship, but far superior to the excitement of social life. We cancelled our order for the car only on the days when there was a dinner-party at the Verdurins\u2019 and on those when, Albertine not being free to go out with me, I took the opportunity to inform anybody who wished to see me that I should be remaining at Balbec. I gave Saint-Loup permission to come on these days, but on these days only. For on one occasion when he had arrived unexpectedly, I had preferred to forego the pleasure of seeing Albertine rather than run the risk of his meeting her, than endanger the state of happy calm in which I had been dwelling for some time and see my jealousy revive. And I had been at my ease only after Saint-Loup had gone. And so he pledged himself, with regret, but with scrupulous observance, never to come to Balbec unless summoned there by myself. In the past, when I thought with longing of the hours that Mme. de Guermantes passed in his company, how I valued the privilege of seeing him! Other people never cease to change places in relation to ourselves. In the imperceptible but eternal march of the world, we regard them as motionless in a moment of vision, too short for us to perceive the motion that is sweeping them on. But we have only to select in our memory two pictures taken of them at different moments, close enough together however for them not to have altered in themselves \u2014 perceptibly, that is to say \u2014 and the difference between the two pictures is a measure of the displacement that they have undergone in relation to us. He alarmed me dreadfully by talking to me of the Verdurins, I was afraid that he might ask me to take him there, which would have been quite enough, what with the jealousy that I should be feeling all the time, to spoil all the pleasure that I found in going there with Albertine. But fortunately Robert assured me that, on the contrary, the one thing he desired above all others was not to know them. \u201cNo,\u201d he said to me, \u201cI find that sort of clerical atmosphere maddening.\u201d I did not at first understand the application of the adjective clerical to the Verdurins, but the end of Saint-Loup\u2019s speech threw a light on his meaning, his concessions to those fashions in words which one is often astonished to see adopted by intelligent men. \u201cI mean the houses,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere people form a tribe, a religious order, a chapel. You aren\u2019t going to tell me that they\u2019re not a little sect; they\u2019re all butter and honey to the people who belong, no words bad enough for those who don\u2019t. The question is not, as for Hamlet, to be or not to be, but to belong or not to belong. You belong, my uncle Charlus belongs. I can\u2019t help it, I never have gone in for that sort of thing, it isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I need hardly say that the rule which I had imposed upon Saint-Loup, never to come and see me unless I had expressly invited him, I promulgated no less strictly for all and sundry of the persons with whom I had gradually begun to associate at la Raspeli\u00e8re, F\u00e9terne, Montsurvent, and elsewhere; and when I saw from the hotel the smoke of the three o\u2019clock train which in the anfractuosity of the cliffs of Parville left its stable plume which long remained hanging from the flank of the green slopes, I had no hesitation as to the identity of the visitor who was coming to tea with me and was still, like a classical deity, concealed from me by that little cloud. I am obliged to confess that this visitor, authorised by me beforehand to come, was hardly ever Saniette, and I have often reproached myself for this omission. But Saniette\u2019s own consciousness of his being a bore (far more so, naturally, when he came to pay a call than when he told a story) had the effect that, albeit he was more learned, more intelligent and a better man all round than most people, it seemed impossible to feel in his company, I do not say any pleasure, but anything save an almost intolerable irritation which spoiled one\u2019s whole afternoon. Probably if Saniette had frankly admitted this boredom which he was afraid of causing, one would not have dreaded his visits. Boredom is one of the least of the evils that we have to endure, his boringness existed perhaps only in the imagination of other people, or had been inoculated into him by them by some process of suggestion which had taken root in his charming modesty. But he was so anxious not to let it be seen that he was not sought after, that he dared not offer himself. Certainly he was right in not behaving like the people who are so glad to be able to raise their hats in a public place, that when, not having seen you for years, they catch sight of you in a box with smart people whom they do not know, they give you a furtive but resounding good-evening, seeking an excuse in the pleasure, the emotion that they felt on seeing you, on learning that you are going about again, that you are looking well, etc. Saniette, on the contrary, was lacking in courage. He might, at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s or in the little tram, have told me that it would give him great pleasure to come and see me at Balbec, were he not afraid of disturbing me. Such a suggestion would not have alarmed me. On the contrary, he offered nothing, but with a tortured expression on his face and a stare as indestructible as a fired enamel, into the composition of which, however, there entered, with a passionate desire to see one \u2014 provided he did not find some one else who was more entertaining \u2014 the determination not to let this desire be manifest, said to me with a detached air: \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to know what you will be doing in the next few days, because I shall probably be somewhere in the neighbourhood of Balbec? Not that it makes the slightest difference, I just thought I would ask you.\u201d This air deceived nobody, and the inverse signs whereby we express our sentiments by their opposites are so clearly legible that we ask ourselves how thete can still be people who say, for instance: \u201cI have so many invitations that I don\u2019t know where to lay my head\u201d to conceal the fact that they have been invited nowhere. But what was more, this detached air, probably on account of the heterogeneous elements that had gone to form it, gave you, what you would never have felt in the fear of boredom or in a frank admission of the desire to see you, that is to say that sort of distaste, of repulsion, which in the category of relations of simple social courtesy corresponds to \u2014 in that of love \u2014 the disguised offer made to a lady by the lover whom she does not love to see her on the following day, he protesting the while that it does not really matter, or indeed not that offer but an attitude of false coldness. There emanated at once from San-iette\u2019s person something or other which made you answer him in the ten-derest of tones: \u201cNo, unfortunately, this week, I must explain to you. . . . \u201d And I allowed to call upon me instead people who were a long way his inferiors but had not his gaze charged with melancholy or his mouth wrinkled with all the bitterness of all the calls which he longed, while saying nothing about them, to pay upon this person and that. Unfortunately it was very rarely that Saniette did not meet in the \u2018crawler\u2019 the guest who was coming to see me, if indeed the latter had not said to me at the Verdurins\u2019: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I\u2019m coming to see you on Thursday,\u201d the very day on which I had just told Saniette that I should not be at home. So that he came in the end to imagine life as filled with entertainments arranged behind his back, if not actually at his expense. On the other hand, as none of us is ever a single person, this too discreet of men was morbidly indiscreet. On the one occasion on which he happened to come and see me uninvited, a letter, I forget from whom, had been left lying on my table. After the first few minutes, I saw that he was paying only the vaguest attention to what I was saying. The letter, of whose subject he knew absolutely nothing, fascinated him and at every moment I expected his glittering eyeballs to detach themselves from their sockets and fly to the letter which, of no importance in itself, his curiosity had made magnetic. You would have called him a bird about to dash into the jaws of a serpent. Finally he could restrain himself no longer, he began by altering its position, as though he were trying to tidy my room. This not sufficing him, he took it up, turned it over, turned it back again, as though mechanically. Another form of his indiscretion was that once he had fastened himself to you he could not tear himself away. As I was feeling unwell that day, I asked him to go back by the next train, in half-an-hour\u2019s time. He did not doubt that I was feeling unwell, but replied: \u201cI shall stay for an hour and a quarter, and then I shall go.\u201d Since then I have regretted that I did not tell him, whenever I had an opportunity, to come and see me. Who knows? Possibly I might have charmed away his ill fortune, other people would have invited him for whom he would immediately have deserted myself, so that my invitations would have had the twofold advantage of giving him pleasure and ridding me of his company\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the days following those on which I had been \u2018at home,\u2019 I naturally did not expect any visitors and the motor-car would come to fetch us, Albertine and myself. And, when we returned, Aim\u00e9, on the lowest step of the hotel, could not help looking, with passionate, curious, greedy eyes, to see what tip I was giving the chauffeur. It was no use my enclosing my coin or note in my clenched fist, Aim\u00e9\u2018s gaze tore my fingers apart. He turned his head away a moment later, for he was discreet, well bred, and indeed was himself content with relatively small wages. But the money that another person received aroused in him an irrepressible curiosity and made his mouth water. During these brief moments, he wore the attentive, feverish air of a boy reading one of Jules Verne\u2019s tales, or of a diner seated at a neighbouring table in a restaurant who, seeing the waiter carving for you a pheasant which he himself either could not afford or would not order, abandons for an instant his serious thoughts to fasten upon the bird a gaze which love and longing cause to smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, day after day, these excursions in the motor-car followed one another. But once, as I was being taken up to my room, the lift-boy said to me: \u201cThat gentleman has been, he gave me a message for you.\u201d The lift-boy uttered these words in an almost inaudible voice, coughing and expectorating in my face. \u201cI haven\u2019t half caught cold!\u201d he went on, as though I were incapable of perceiving this for myself. \u201cThe doctor says it\u2019s whooping-cough,\u201d and he began once more to cough and expectorate over me. \u201cDon\u2019t tire yourself by trying to speak,\u201d I said to him with an air of kindly interest, which was feigned. I was afraid of catching the whooping-cough which, with my tendency to choking fits, would have been a serious matter to me. But he made a point of honour, like a virtuoso who refuses to let himself be taken to hospital, of talking and expectorating all the time. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said (\u201cPerhaps not to you,\u201d I thought, \u201cbut to me it does\u201d). \u201cBesides, I shall be returning soon to Paris.\u201d (\u201cExcellent, provided he doesn\u2019t give it to me first.\u201d) \u201cIt seems,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat Paris is quite superb. It must be even more superb than here or Monte-Carlo, although pages, in fact visitors, and even head waiters who have been to Monte-Carlo for the season have often told me that Paris was not so superb as Monte-Carlo. They were cheated, perhaps, and yet, to be a head waiter, you\u2019ve got to have your wits about you; to take all the orders, reserve tables, you need a head! I\u2019ve heard it said that it\u2019s even more terrible than writing plays and books.\u201d We had almost reached my landing when the lift-boy carried me down again to the ground floor because he found that the button was not working properly, and in a moment had put it right. I told him that I preferred to walk upstairs, by which I meant, without putting it in so many words, that I preferred not to catch whooping-cough. But with a cordial and contagious burst of coughing the boy thrust me back into the lift. \u201cThere\u2019s no danger now, I\u2019ve fixed the button.\u201d Seeing that he was not ceasing to talk, preferring to learn the name of my visitor and the message that he had left, rather than the comparative beauties of Balbec, Paris and Monte-Carlo, I said to him (as one might say to a tenor who is wearying one with Benjamin Godard, \u201cWon\u2019t you sing me some Debussy?\u201d) \u201cBut who is the person that called to see me?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the gentleman you went out with yesterday. I am going to fetch his card, it\u2019s with my porter.\u201d As, the day before, I had dropped Robert de Saint-Loup at Donci\u00e8res station before going to meet Albertine, I supposed that the lift-boy was referring to him, but it was the chauffeur. And by describing him in the words: \u201cThe gentleman you went out with,\u201d he taught me at the same time that a working man is just as much a gentleman as a man about town. A lesson in the use of words only. For in point of fact I had never made any distinction between the classes. And if I had felt, on hearing a chauffeur called a gentleman, the same astonishment as Comte X who had only held that rank for a week and whom, by saying: \u201cthe Comtesse looks tired,\u201d I made turn his head round to see who it was that I meant, it was simply because I was not familiar with that use of the word; I had never made any difference between working men, professional men and noblemen, and I should have been equally ready to make any of them my friends. With a certain preference for the working men, and after them for the noblemen, not because I liked them better, but because I knew that one could expect greater courtesy from them towards the working men than one finds among professional men, whether because the great nobleman does not despise the working man as the professional man does or else because they are naturally polite to anybody, as beautiful women are glad to bestow a smile which they know to be so joyfully received. I cannot however pretend that this habit that I had of putting people of humble station on a level with people in society, even if it was quite understood by the latter, was always entirely satisfactory to my mother. Not that, humanly speaking, she made any difference between one person and another, and if Fran\u00e7oise was ever in sorrow or in pain she was comforted and tended by Mamma with the same devotion as her best friend. But my mother was too much my grandmother\u2019s daughter not to accept, in social matters, the rule of caste. People at Combray might have kind hearts, sensitive natures, might have adopted the most perfect theories of human equality, my mother, when a footman became emancipated, began to say \u2018you\u2019 and slipped out of the habit of addressing me in the third person, was moved by these presumptions to the same wrath that breaks out in Saint-Simon\u2019s Memoirs, whenever a nobleman who is not entitled to it seizes a pretext for assuming the style of \u2018Highness\u2019 in an official document, or for not paying dukes the deference he owes to them and is gradually beginning to lay aside. There was a \u2018Combray spirit\u2019 so refractory that it will require centuries of good nature (my mother\u2019s was boundless), of theories of equality, to succeed in dissolving it. I cannot swear that in my mother certain particles of this spirit had not remained insoluble. She would have been as reluctant to give her hand to a footman as she would have been ready to give him ten francs (which for that matter he was far more glad to receive). To her, whether she admitted it or not, masters were masters, and servants were the people who fed in the kitchen. When she saw the driver of a motor-car dining with me in the restaurant, she was not altogether pleased, and said to me: \u201cIt seems to me you might have a more suitable friend than a mechanic,\u201d as she might have said, had it been a question of my marriage: \u201cYou might find somebody better than that.\u201d This particular chauffeur (fortunately I never dreamed of inviting him to dinner) had come to tell me that the motor-car company which had sent him to Balbec for the season had ordered him to return to Paris on the following day. This excuse, especially as the chauffeur was charming and expressed himself so simply that one would always have taken anything he said for Gospel, seemed to us to be most probably true. It was only half so. There was as a matter of fact no more work for him at Balbec. And in any case, the Company being only half convinced of the veracity of the young Evangelist, bowed over the consecration cross of his steering-wheel, was anxious that he should return as soon as possible to Paris. And indeed if the young Apostle wrought a miracle in multiplying his mileage when he was calculating it for M. de Charlus, when on the other hand it was a matter of rendering his account to the Company, he divided what he had earned by six. In consequence of which the Company, coming to the conclusion either that nobody wanted a car now at Balbec, which, so late in the season, was quite probable, or that it was being robbed, decided that, upon either hypothesis, the best thing was to recall him to Paris, not that there was very much work for him there. What the chauffeur wished was to avoid, if possible, the dead season. I have said \u2014 though I was unaware of this at the time, when the knowledge of it would have saved me much annoyance \u2014 that he was on intimate terms (without their ever shewing any sign of acquaintance before other people) with Morel. Starting from the day on which he was ordered back, before he realised that there was still a way out of going, we were obliged to content ourselves for our excursions with hiring a carriage, or sometimes, as an amusement for Albertine and because she was fond of riding, a pair of saddle-horses. The carriages were unsatisfactory. \u201cWhat a rattle-trap,\u201d Albertine would say. I would often, as it happened, have preferred to be driving by myself. Without being ready to fix a date, I longed to put an end to this existence which I blamed for making me renounce not so much work as pleasure. It would happen also, however, that the habits which bound me were suddenly abolished, generally when some former self, full of the desire to live a merry life, took the place of what was my self at the moment. I felt this longing to escape especially strong one day when, having left Albertine at her aunt\u2019s, I had gone on horseback to call on the Verdurins and had taken an unfrequented path through the woods the beauty of which they had extolled to me. Clinging to the outline of the cliffs, it alternately climbed and then, hemmed in by dense woods on either side, dived into savage gorges. For a moment the barren rocks by which I was surrounded, the sea visible in their jagged intervals, swam before my eyes, like fragments of another universe: I had recognised the mountainous and marine landscape which Elstir had made the scene of those two admirable water colours: \u2018Poet meeting a Muse,\u2019 \u2018Young Man meeting a Centaur\u2019 which I had seen at the Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019s. The thought of them transported the place in which I was so far beyond the world of to-day that I should not have been surprised if, like the young man of the prehistoric age that Elstir painted, I had in the course of my ride come upon a mythological personage. Suddenly, my horse gave a start; he had heard a strange sound; it was all I could do to hold him and remain in the saddle, then I raised in the direction from which the sound seemed to come my eyes filled with tears and saw, not two hundred feet above my head, against the sun, between two great wings of flashing metal which were carrying him on, a creature whose barely visible face appeared to me to resemble that of a man. I was as deeply moved as a Greek upon seeing for the first time a demigod. I cried also, for I was ready to cry the moment I realised that the sound came from above my head \u2014 aeroplanes were still rare in those days \u2014 at the thought that what I was going to see for the first time was an aeroplane. Then, just as when in a newspaper one feels that one is coming to a moving passage, the mere sight of the machine was enough to make me burst into tears. Meanwhile the airman seemed to be uncertain of his course; I felt that there lay open before him \u2014 before me, had not habit made me a prisoner \u2014 all the routes in space, in life itself; he flew on, let himself glide for a few moments, over the sea, then quickly making up his mind, seeming to yield to some attraction the reverse of gravity, as though returning to his native element, with a slight movement of his golden wings, rose sheer into the sky\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To come back to the mechanic, he demanded of Morel that the Verdurins should not merely replace their break by a motor-car (which, granted their generosity towards the faithful, was comparatively easy), but, what was less easy, replace their head coachman, the sensitive young man who was inclined to dark thoughts, by himself, the chauffeur. This change was carried out in a few days by the following device. Morel had begun by seeing that the coachman was robbed of everything that he needed for the carriage. One day it was the bit that was missing, another day the curb. At other times it was the cushion of his box-seat that had vanished, or his whip, his rug, his hammer, sponge, chamois-leather. But he always managed to borrow what he required from a neighbour; only he was late in bringing round the carriage, which put him in M. Verdurin\u2019s bad books and plunged him in a state of melancholy and dark thoughts. The chauffeur, who was in a hurry to take his place, told Morel that he would have to return to Paris. It was time to do something desperate. Morel persuaded M. Verdurin\u2019s servants that the young coachman had declared that he would set a trap for the lot of them, boasting that he could take on all six of them at once, and assured them that they could not overlook such an insult. He himself could not take any part in the quarrel, but he warned them so that they might be on their guard. It was arranged that while M. and Mme. Verdurin and their guests were out walking the servants should fall upon the young man in the coach house. I may mention, although it was only the pretext for what was bound to happen, but because the people concerned interested me later on, that the Verdurins had a friend staying with them that day whom they had promised to take for a walk before his departure, which was fixed for that same evening\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What surprised me greatly when we started off for our walk was that Morel, who was coming with us, and was to play his violin under the trees, said to me: \u201cListen, I have a sore arm, I don\u2019t want to say anything about it to Mme. Verdurin, but you might ask her to send for one of her footmen, Howsler for instance, he can carry my things.\u201d \u201cI think you ought to suggest some one else,\u201d I replied. \u201cHe will be wanted here for dinner.\u201d A look of anger passed over Morel\u2019s face. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to trust my violin to any Tom, Dick or Harry.\u201d I realised later on his reason for this selection. Howsler was the beloved brother of the young coachman, and, if he had been left at home, might have gone to his rescue. During our walk, dropping his voice so that the elder Howsler should not overhear: \u201cWhat a good fellow he is,\u201d said Morel. \u201cSo is his brother, for that matter. If he hadn\u2019t that fatal habit of drinking. . . . \u201d \u201cDid you say drinking?\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, turning pale at the idea of having a coachman who drank. \u201cYou\u2019ve never noticed it. I always say to myself it\u2019s a miracle that he\u2019s never had an accident while he\u2019s been driving you.\u201d \u201cDoes he drive anyone else, then?\u201d \u201cYou can easily see how many spills he\u2019s had, his face to-day is a mass of bruises. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s escaped being killed, he\u2019s broken his shafts.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him to-day,\u201d said Mme.\u2019 Verdurin, trembling at the thought of what might have happened to her, \u201cyou appal me.\u201d She tried to cut short the walk so as to return at once, but Morel chose an aria by Bach with endless variations to keep her away from the house. As soon as we got back she went to the stable, saw the new shaft and Howsler streaming with blood. She was on the point of telling him, without making any comment on what she had seen, that she did not require a coachman any longer, and of paying him his wages, but of his own accord, not wishing to accuse his fellow-servants, to whose animosity he attributed retrospectively the theft of all his saddlery, and seeing that further patience would only end in his being left for dead on the ground, he asked leave to go at once, which made everything quite simple. The chauffeur began his duties next day and, later on, Mme. Verdurin (who had been obliged to engage another) was so well satisfied with him that she recommended him to me warmly, as a man on whom I might rely. I, knowing nothing of all this, used to engage him by the day in Paris, but I am anticipating events, I shall come to all this when I reach the story of Albertine. At the present moment we are at la Raspeli\u00e8re, where I have just been dining for the first time with my mistress, and M. de Charlus with Morel, the reputed son of an \u2018Agent\u2019 who drew a fixed salary of thirty thousand francs annually, kept his carriage, and had any number of major-domos, subordinates, gardeners, bailiffs and farmers at his beck and call. But, since I have so far anticipated, I do not wish to leave the reader under the impression that Morel was entirely wicked. He was, rather, a mass of contradictions, capable on certain days of being genuinely kind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was naturally greatly surprised to hear that the coachman had been dismissed, and even more surprised when I recognised his successor as the chauffeur who had been taking Albertine and myself in his car. But he poured out a complicated story, according to which he had thought that he was summoned back to Paris, where an order had come for him to go to the Verdurins, and I did not doubt his word for an instant. The coachman\u2019s dismissal was the cause of Morel\u2019s talking to me for a few minutes, to express his regret at the departure of that worthy fellow. However, even apart from the moments when I was alone, and he literally bounded towards me beaming with joy, Morel, seeing that everybody made much of me at la Raspeli\u00e8re and feeling that he was deliberately cutting himself off from the society of a person who could in no way imperil him, since he had made me burn my boats and had destroyed all possibility of my treating him with an air of patronage (which I had never, for that matter, dreamed of adopting), ceased to hold aloof from me. I attributed his change of attitude to the influence of M. de Charlus, which as a matter of fact did make him in certain respects less limited, more of an artist, but in others, when he interpreted literally the eloquent, insincere, and moreover transient formulas of his master, made him stupider than ever. That M. de Charlus might have said something to him was as a matter of fact the only thing that occurred to me. How was I to have guessed then what I was told afterwards (and have never been certain of its truth, Andr\u00e9e\u2019s assertions as to everything that concerned Albertine, especially later on, having always seemed to me to be statements to be received with caution, for, as we have already seen, she was not genuinely fond of my mistress and was jealous of her), a thing which in any event, even if it was true, was remarkably well concealed from me by both of them: that Albertine was on the best of terms with Morel? The novel attitude which, about the time of the coachman\u2019s dismissal, Morel adopted with regard to myself, enabled me to change my opinion of him. I retained the ugly impression of his character which had been suggested by the servility which this young man had shewn me when he needed my services, followed, as soon as the service had been rendered, by a scornful aloofness as though he did not even see me. I still lacked evidence of his venal relations with M. de Charlus, and also of his bestial and purposeless instincts, the non-gratification of which (when it occurred) or the complications that they involved, were the cause of his sorrows; but his character was not so uniformly vile and was full of contradictions. He resembled an old book of the middle ages, full of mistakes, of absurd traditions, of obscenities; he was extraordinarily composite. I had supposed at first that his art, in which he was really a past-master, had given him superiorities that went beyond the virtuosity of the mere performer. Once when I spoke of my wish to start work: \u201cWork, become famous,\u201d he said to me. \u201cWho said that?\u201d I inquired. \u201cFontanes, to Chateaubriand.\u201d He also knew certain love letters of Napoleon. Good, I thought to myself, he reads. But this phrase which he had read I know not where was doubtless the only one that he knew in the whole of ancient or modern literature, for he repeated it to me every evening. Another which he quoted even more frequently to prevent me from breathing a word about him to anybody was the following, which he considered equally literary, whereas it is barely grammatical, or at any rate makes no kind of sense, except perhaps to a mystery-loving servant: \u201cBeware of the wary.\u201d As a matter of fact, if one cast back from this stupid maxim to what Fontanes had said to Chateaubriand, one explored a whole side, varied but less contradictory than one might suppose, of Morel\u2019s character. This youth who, provided there was money to be made by it, would have done anything in the world, and without remorse \u2014 perhaps not without an odd sort of vexation, amounting to nervous excitement, to which however the name remorse could not for a moment be applied \u2014 who would, had it been to his advantage, have plunged in distress, not to say mourning, whole families, this youth who set money above everything, above, not to speak of unselfish kindness, the most natural sentiments of common humanity, this same youth nevertheless set above money his certificate as first-prize winner at the Conservatoire and the risk of there being anything said to his discredit in the flute or counterpoint class. And so his most violent rages, his most sombre and unjustifiable fits of ill-temper arose from what he himself (generalising doubtless from certain particular cases in which he had met with spiteful people) called universal treachery. He flattered himself that he escaped from this fault by never speaking about anyone, by concealing his tactics, by distrusting everybody. (Alas for me, in view of what was to happen after my return to Paris, his distrust had not \u2018held\u2019 in the case of the Balbec chauffeur, in whom he had doubtless recognised a peer, that is to say, in contradiction of his maxim, a wary person in the good sense of the word, a wary person who remains obstinately silent before honest folk and at once comes to an understanding with a blackguard.) It seemed to him \u2014 and he was not absolutely wrong \u2014 that his distrust would enable him always to save his bacon, to slip unscathed out of the most perilous adventures, without anyone\u2019s being able not indeed to prove but even to suggest anything against him, in the institution in the Rue Berg\u00e8re. He would work, become famous, would perhaps be one day, with his respectability still intact, examiner in the violin on the Board of that great and glorious Conservatoire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But it is perhaps crediting Morel\u2019s brain with too much logic to attempt to discriminate between these contradictions. As a matter of fact his nature was just like a sheet of paper that has been folded so often in every direction that it is impossible to straighten it out. He seemed to act upon quite lofty principles, and in a magnificent hand, marred by the most elementary mistakes in spelling, spent hours writing to his brother that he had behaved badly to his sisters, that he was their elder, their natural support, etc., and to his sisters that they had shewn a want of respect for himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently, as summer came to an end, when one got out of the train at Douville, the sun dimmed by the prevailing mist had ceased to be anything more in a sky that was uniformly mauve than a lump of redness. To the great peace which descends at nightfall over these tufted salt-marshes, and had tempted a number of Parisians, painters mostly, to spend their holidays at Douville, was added a moisture which made them seek shelter early in their little bungalows. In several of these the lamp was already lighted. Only a few cows remained out of doors gazing at the sea and lowing, while others, more interested in humanity, turned their attention towards our carriages. A single painter who had set up his easel where the ground rose slightly was striving to render that great calm, that hushed luminosity. Perhaps the cattle were going to serve him unconsciously and kindly as models, for their contemplative air and their solitary presence when the human beings had withdrawn, contributed in their own way to enhance the strong impression of repose that evening conveys. And, a few weeks later, the transposition was no less agreeable when, as autumn advanced, the days became really short, and we were obliged to make our journey m the dark. If I had been out anywhere in the afternoon, I had to go back to change my clothes, at the latest, by five o\u2019clock, when at this season the round, red sun had already sunk half way down the slanting sheet of glass, which formerly I had detested, and, like a Greek fire, was inflaming the sea in the glass fronts of all my bookcases. Some wizard\u2019s gesture having revived, as I put on my dinner-jacket, the alert and frivolous self that was mine when I used to go with Saint-Loup to dine at Rivebelle and on the evening when I looked forward to taking Mme. de Stermaria to dine on the island in the Bois, I began unconsciously to hum the same tune that I had hummed then; and it was only when I realised this that by the song I recognised the resurrected singer, who indeed knew no other tune. The first time that I sang it, I was beginning to be in love with Albertine, but I imagined that I would never get to know her. Later on, in Paris, it was when I had ceased to be in love with her and some days after I had enjoyed her for the first time. Now it was when I was in love with her again and on the point of going out to dinner with her, to the great regret of the manager who supposed that I would end by staying at la Raspeli\u00e8re altogether and deserting his hotel, and assured me that he had heard that fever was prevalent in that neighbourhood, due to the marshes of the Bac and their \u2018stagnous\u2019 water. I was delighted by the multiplicity in which I saw my life thus spread over three planes; and besides, when one becomes for an instant one\u2019s former self, that is to say different from what one has been for some time past, one\u2019s sensibility, being no longer dulled by habit, receives the slightest shocks of those vivid impressions which make everything that has preceded them fade into insignificance, and to which, because of their intensity, we attach ourselves with the momentary enthusiasm of a drunken man. It was already night when we got into the omnibus or carriage which was to take us to the station where we would find the little train. And in the hall the chief magistrate was saying to us: \u201cAh! You are going to la Raspeli\u00e8re! Sapristi, she has a nerve, your Mme. Verdurin, to make you travel an hour by train in the dark, simply to dine with her. And then to start off again at ten o\u2019clock at night, with a wind blowing like the very devil. It is easy to see that you have nothing else to do,\u201d he added, rubbing his hands together. No doubt he spoke thus from annoyance at not having been invited, and also from the satisfaction that people feel who are \u2018busy\u2019\u2014 though it be with the most idiotic occupation \u2014 at \u2018not having time\u2019 to do what you are doing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly it is only right that the man who draws up reports, adds up figures, answers business letters, follows the movements of the stock exchange, should feel when he says to you with a sneer: \u201cIt\u2019s all very well for you; you have nothing better to do,\u201d an agreeable sense of his own superiority. But this would be no less contemptuous, would be even more so (for dining out is a thing that the busy man does also) were your recreation writing Hamlet or merely reading it. Wherein busy men shew a want of reflexion. For the disinterested culture which seems to them a comic pastime of idle people at the moment when they find them engaged in it is, they ought to remember, the same that in their own profession brings to the fore men who may not be better magistrates or administrators than themselves but before whose rapid advancement they bow their heads, saying: \u201cIt appears he\u2019s a great reader, a most distinguished individual.\u201d But above all the chief magistrate did not take into account that what pleased me about these dinners at la Raspeli\u00e8re was that, as he himself said quite rightly, though as a criticism, they \u2018meant a regular journey,\u2019 a journey whose charm appeared to me all the more thrilling in that it was not an object in itself, and no one made any attempt to find pleasure in it \u2014 that being reserved for the party for which we were bound, and greatly modified by all the atmosphere that surrounded it. It was already night now when I exchanged the warmth of the hotel \u2014 the hotel that had become my home \u2014 for the railway carriage into which I climbed with Albertine, in which a glimmer of lamplight on the window shewed, at certain halts of the panting little train, that we had arrived at a station. So that there should be no risk of Cottard\u2019s missing us, and not having heard the name of the station, I opened the door, but what burst headlong into the carriage was not any of the faithful, but the wind, the rain, the cold. In the darkness I could make out fields, I could hear the sea, we were in the open country. Albertine, before we were engulfed in the little nucleus, examined herself in a little mirror, extracted from a gold bag which she carried about with her. The fact was that on our first visit, Mme. Verdurin having taken her upstairs to her dressing-room so that she might make herself tidy before dinner, I had felt, amid the profound calm in which I had been living for some time, a slight stir of uneasiness and jealousy at being obliged to part from Albertine at the foot of the stair, and had become so anxious while I was by myself in the drawing-room, among the little clan, and asking myself what my mistress could be doing, that I had sent a telegram the next day, after finding out from M. de Charlus what the correct thing was at the moment, to order from Cartier\u2019s a bag which was the joy of Alber-tine\u2019s life and also of mine. It was for me a guarantee of peace of mind, and also of my mistress\u2019s solicitude. For she had evidently seen that I did not like her to be parted from me at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s and arranged to make in the train all the toilet that was necessary before dinner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Included in the number of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s regular frequenters, and reckoned the most faithful of them all, had been, for some months now, M. de Charlus. Regularly, thrice weekly, the passengers who were sitting in the waiting-rooms or standing upon the platform at Donci\u00e8res-Ouest used to see that stout gentleman go past with his grey hair, his black moustaches, his lips reddened with a salve less noticeable at the end of the season than in summer when the daylight made it more crude and the heat used to melt it. As he made his way towards the little train, he could not refrain (simply from force of habit, as a connoisseur, since he now had a sentiment which kept him chaste, or at least, for most of the time, faithful) from casting at the labourers, soldiers, young men in tennis flannels, a furtive glance at once inquisitorial and timorous, after which he immediately let his eyelids droop over his half-shut eyes with the unction of an ecclesiastic engaged in telling his beads, with the modesty of a bride vowed to the one love of her life or of a well-brought-up girl. The faithful were all the more convinced that he had not seen them, since he got into a different compartment from theirs (as, often enough, did Princess Sherbatoff also), like a man who does not know whether people will be pleased or not to be seen with him and leaves them the option of coming and joining him if they choose. This option had not been taken, at first, by the Doctor, who had asked us to leave him by himself in his compartment. Making a virtue of his natural hesitation now that he occupied a great position in the medical world, it was with a smile, throwing back his head, looking at Ski over his glasses, that he said, either from malice or in the hope of eliciting the opinion of the \u2018comrades\u2019: \u201cYou can understand that if I was by myself, a bachelor, but for my wife\u2019s sake I ask myself whether I ought to allow him to travel with us after what you have told me,\u201d the Doctor whispered. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019re saying?\u201d asked Mme. Cottard. \u201cNothing, it doesn\u2019t concern you, it\u2019s not meant for ladies to hear,\u201d the Doctor replied with a wink, and with a majestic self-satisfaction which held the balance between the dryly malicious air he adopted before his pupils and patients and the uneasiness that used in the past to accompany his shafts of wit at the Verdurins\u2019, and went on talking in a lowered tone. Mme. Cottard could make out only the words \u2018one of the brotherhood\u2019 and \u2018tapette,\u2019 and as in the Doctor\u2019s vocabulary the former expression denoted the Jewish race and the latter a wagging tongue, Mme. Cottard concluded that M. de Charlus must be a garrulous Israelite. She could not understand why people should keep aloof from the Baron for that reason, felt it her duty as the senior lady of the clan to insist that he should not be left alone, and so we proceeded in a body to M. de Charlus\u2019s compartment, led by Cottard who was still perplexed. From the corner in which he was reading a volume of Balzac, M. de Charlus observed this hesitation; and yet he had not raised his eyes. But just as deaf-mutes detect, from a movement of the air imperceptible to other people, that some one is standing behind them, so he had to warn him of other people\u2019s coldness towards him, a positive hyperaesthesia. This had, as it habitually does in every sphere, developed in M. de Charlus imaginary sufferings. Like those neuropaths who, feeling a slight lowering of the temperature, induce from this that there must be a window open on the floor above, become violently excited and start sneezing, M. de Charlus, if a person appeared preoccupied in his presence, concluded that somebody had repeated to that person a remark that he had made about him. But there was no need even for the other person to have a distracted, or a sombre, or a smiling air, he would invent them. On the other hand, cordiality completely concealed from him the slanders of which he had not heard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having begun by detecting Cottard\u2019s hesitation, if, greatly to the surprise of the faithful who did not suppose that their presence had yet been observed by the reader\u2019s lowered gaze, he held out his hand to them when they were at a convenient distance, he contented himself with a forward inclination of his whole person which he quickly drew back for Cottard, without taking in his own gloved hand the hand which the Doctor had held out to him. \u201cWe felt we simply must come and keep you company, Sir, and not leave you alone like that in your little corner. It is a great pleasure to us,\u201d Mme. Cottard began in a friendly tone to the Baron. \u201cI am greatly honoured,\u201d the Baron intoned, bowing coldly. \u201cI was so pleased to hear that you have definitely chosen this neighbourhood to set up your taber. . . . \u201d She was going to say \u2018tabernacle\u2019 but it occurred to her that the word was Hebraic and discourteous to a Jew who might see an allusion in it. And so she paused for a moment to choose another of the expressions that were familiar to her, that is to say a consecrated expression: \u201cto set up, I should say, your penates.\u201d (It is true that these deities do not appertain to the Christian religion either, but to one which has been dead for so long that it no longer claims any devotees whose feelings one need be afraid of hurting.) \u201cWe, unfortunately, what with term beginning, and the Doctor\u2019s hospital duties, can never choose our domicile for very long in one place.\u201d And glancing at a cardboard box: \u201cYou see too how we poor women are less fortunate than the sterner sex, to go only such a short distance as to our friends the Verdurins\u2019, we are obliged to take a whole heap of impedimenta.\u201d I meanwhile was examining the Baron\u2019s volume of Balzac. It was not a paper-covered copy, picked up on a bookstall, like the volume of Bergotte which he had lent me at our first meeting. It was a book from his own library, and as such bore the device: \u201cI belong to the Baron de Charlus,\u201d for which was substituted at times, to shew the studious tastes of the Guermantes: \u201cIn proeliis non semper,\u201d or yet another motto: \u201cNon sine labore.\u201d But we shall see these presently replaced by others, in an attempt to please Morel. Mme. Cottard, a little later, hit upon a subject which she felt to be of more personal interest to the Baron. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you agree with me, Sir,\u201d she said to him presently, \u201cbut I hold very broad views, and, to my mind, there is a great deal of good in all religions. I am not one of the people who get hydrophobia at the sight of a . . . Protestant.\u201d \u201cI was taught that mine is the true religion,\u201d replied M. de Charlus. \u201cHe\u2019s a fanatic,\u201d thought Mme. Cottard, \u201cSwann, until recently, was more tolerant; it is true that he was a converted one.\u201d Now, so far from this being the case, the Baron was not only a Christian, as we know, but pious with a mediaeval fervour. To him as to the sculptors of the middle ages, the Christian church was, in the living sense of the word, peopled with a swarm of beings, whom he believed to be entirely real, Prophets, Apostles, Anpels, holy personages of every sort, surrounding the Incarnate Word, His Mother and Her Spouse, the Eternal Father, all the Martyrs and Doctors of the Church, as they may be seen carved in high relief, thronging the porches or lining the naves of the cathedrals. Out of all these M. de Charlus had chosen as his patrons and intercessors the Archangels Michael, Gabriel and Raphael, to whom he made frequent appeals that they would convey his prayers to the Eternal Father, about Whose Throne they stand. And so Mme. Cottard\u2019s mistake amused me greatly\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To leave the religious sphere, let us mention that the Doctor, who had come to Paris meagrely equipped with the counsels of a peasant mother, and had then been absorbed in the almost purely materialistic studies to which those who seek to advance in a medical career are obliged to devote themselves for a great many years, had never become cultured, had acquired increasing authority but never any experience, took the word \u2018honoured\u2019 in its literal meaning and was at once flattered by it because he was vain and distressed because he had a kind heart. \u201cThat poor de Charlus,\u201d he said to his wife that evening, \u201cmade me feel sorry for him when he said he was honoured by travelling with us. One feels, poor devil, that he knows nobody, that he has to humble himself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But presently, without any need to be guided by the charitable Mme. Cottard, the faithful had succeeded in overcoming the qualms which they had all more or less felt at first, on finding themselves in the company of M. de Charlus. No doubt in his presence they were incessantly reminded of Ski\u2019s revelations, and conscious of the sexual abnormality embodied in their travelling companion. But this abnormality itself had a sort of attraction for them. It gave for them to the Baron\u2019s conversation, remarkable in itself but in ways which they could scarcely appreciate, a savour which made the most interesting conversation, that of Brichot himself, appear slightly insipid in comparison. From the very outset, moreover, they had been pleased to admit that he was intelligent. \u201cThe genius that is perhaps akin to madness,\u201d the Doctor declaimed, and albeit the Princess, athirst for knowledge, insisted, said not another word, this axiom being all that he knew about genius and seeming to him less supported by proof than our knowledge of typhoid fever and arthritis. And as he had become proud and remained ill-bred: \u201cNo questions, Princess, do not interrogate me, I am at the seaside for a rest. Besides, you would not understand, you know nothing about medicine.\u201d And the Princess held her peace with apologies, deciding that Cottard was a charming man and realising that celebrities were not always approachable. In this initial period, then, they had ended by finding M. de Charlus an agreeable person notwithstanding his vice (or what is generally so named). Now it was, quite unconsciously, because of that vice that they found him more intelligent than the rest. The most simple maxims to which, adroitly provoked by the sculptor or the don, M. de Charlus gave utterance concerning love, jealousy, beauty, in view of the experience, strange, secret, refined and monstrous, upon which he founded them, assumed for the faithful that charm of unfamiliarity with which a psychology analogous to that which our own dramatic literature has always offered us bedecks itself in a Russian or Japanese play performed by native actors. One might still venture, when he was not listening, upon a malicious witticism at his expense. \u201cOh!\u201d whispered the sculptor, seeing a young railwayman with the sweeping eyelashes of a dancing girl at whom M. de Charlus could not help staring, \u201cif the Baron begins making eyes at the conductor, we shall never get there, the train will start going backwards. Just look at the way he\u2019s staring at him, this is not a steam-tram we\u2019re on, it\u2019s a funicular.\u201d But when all was said, if M. de Charlus did not appear, it was almost a disappointment to be travelling only with people who were just like everybody else, and not to have by one\u2019s side this painted, paunchy, tightly-buttoned personage, reminding one of a box of exotic and dubious origin from which escapes the curious odour of fruits the mere thought of tasting which stirs the heart. From this point of view, the faithful of the masculine sex enjoyed a keener satisfaction in the short stage of the journey between Saint-Martin du Ch\u00eane, where M. de Charlus got in, and Donci\u00e8res, the station at which Morel joined the party. For so long as the violinist was not there (and provided the ladies and Albertine, keeping to themselves so as not to disturb our conversation, were out of hearing), M. de Charlus made no attempt to appear to be avoiding certain subjects and did not hesitate to speak of \u2018what it is customary to call degenerate morals.\u2019 Albertine could not hamper him, for she was always with the ladies, like a well-bred girl who does not wish her presence to restrict the freedom of grown-up conversation. And I was quite resigned to not having her by my side, on condition however that she remained in the same carriage. For I, who no longer felt any jealousy and scarcely any love for her, never thought of what she might be doing on the days when I did not see her; on the other hand, when I was there, a mere partition which might at a pinch be concealing a betrayal was intolerable to me, and if she retired with the ladies to the next compartment, a moment later, unable to remain in my seat any longer, at the risk of offending whoever might be talking, Brichot, Cottard or Charlus, to whom I could not explain the reason for my flight, I would rise, leave them without ceremony, and, to make certain that nothing abnormal was going on, walk down the corridor. And, till we came to Donci\u00e8res, M. de Charlus, without any fear of shocking his audience, would speak sometimes in the plainest terms of morals which, he declared, for his own part he did not consider either good or evil. He did this from cunning, to shew his breadth of mind, convinced as he was that his own morals aroused no suspicion in the minds of the faithful. He was well aware that there did exist in the world several persons who were, to use an expression which became habitual with him later on, \u2018in the know\u2019 about himself. But he imagined that these persons were not more than three or four, and that none of them was at that moment upon the coast of Normandy. This illusion may appear surprising in so shrewd, so suspicious a man. Even in the case of those whom he believed to be more or less well informed, he flattered himself that their information was all quite vague, and hoped, by telling them this or that fact about anyone, to clear the person in question from all suspicion on the part of a listener who out of politeness pretended to accept his statements. Indeed, being uncertain as to what I might know or guess about him, he supposed that my opinion, which he imagined to be of far longer standing than it actually was, was quite general, and that it was sufficient for him to deny this or that detail to be believed, whereas on the contrary, if our knowledge of the whole always precedes our knowledge of details, it makes our investigation of the latter infinitely easier and having destroyed his cloak of invisibility no longer allows the pretender to conceal what he wishes to keep secret. Certainly when M. de Charlus, invited to a dinner-party by one of the faithful or of their friends, took the most complicated precautions to introduce among the names of ten people whom he mentioned that of Morel, he never imagined that for the reasons, always different, which he gave for the pleasure or convenience which he would find that evening in being invited to meet him, his hosts, while appearing to believe him implicitly, substituted a single reason, always the same, of which he supposed them to be ignorant, namely that he was in love with him. Similarly, Mme. Verdurin, seeming always entirely to admit the motives, half artistic, half charitable, with which M. de Charlus accounted to her for the interest that he took in Morel, never ceased to thank the Baron with emotion for his kindness \u2014 his touching kindness, she called it \u2014 to the violinist. And how astonished M. de Charlus would have been, if, one day when Morel and he were delayed and had not come by the train, he had heard the Mistress say: \u201cWe\u2019re all here now except the young ladies.\u201d The Baron would have been all the more stupefied in that, going hardly anywhere save to la Raspeli\u00e8re, he played the part there of a family chaplain, like the abb\u00e9 in a stock company, and would sometimes (when Morel had 48 hours\u2019 leave) sleep there for two nights in succession. Mme. Verdurin would then give them communicating rooms and, to put them at their ease, would say: \u201cIf you want to have a little music, don\u2019t worry about us, the walls are as thick as a fortress, you have nobody else on your floor, and my husband sleeps like lead.\u201d On such days M. de Charlus would relieve the Princess of the duty of going to meet strangers at the station, apologise for Mme. Verdurin\u2019s absence on the grounds of a state of health which he described so vividly that the guests entered the drawing-room with solemn faces, and uttered cries of astonishment on finding the Mistress up and doing and wearing what was almost a low dress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For M. de Charlus had for the moment become for Mme. Verdurin the faithfullest of the faithful, a second Princess Sherbatoff. Of his position in society she was not nearly so certain as of that of the Princess, imagining that if the latter cared to see no one outside the little nucleus it was out of contempt for other people and preference for it. As this pretence was precisely the Verdurins\u2019 own, they treating as bores everyone to whose society they were not admitted, it is incredible that the Mistress can have believed the Princess to possess a heart of steel, detesting what was fashionable. But she stuck to her guns, and was convinced that in the case of the great lady also it was in all sincerity and from a love of things intellectual that she avoided the company of bores. The latter were, as it happened, diminishing in numbers from the Verdurins\u2019 point of view. Life by the seaside robbed an introduction of the ulterior consequences which might be feared in Paris. Brilliant men who had come down to Balbec without their wives (which made everything much easier) made overtures to la Raspeli\u00e8re and, from being bores, became too charming. This was the case with the Prince de Guermantes, whom the absence of his Princess would not, however, have decided to go \u2018as a bachelor\u2019 to the Verdurins\u2019, had not the lodestone of Dreyfusism been so powerful as to carry him in one stride up the steep ascent to la Raspeli\u00e8re, unfortunately upon a day when the Mistress was not at home. Mme. Verdurin as it happened was not certain that he and M. de Charlus moved in the same world. The Baron had indeed said that the Duc de Guermantes was his brother, but this was perhaps the untruthful boast of an adventurer. Man of the world as he had shewn himself to be, so friendly, so \u2018faithful\u2019 to the Verdurins, the Mistress still almost hesitated to invite him to meet the Prince de Guermantes. She consulted Ski and Brichot: \u201cThe Baron and the Prince de Guermantes, will they be all right together?\u201d \u201cGood gracious, Madame, as to one of the two I think I can safely say.\u201d \u201cWhat good is that to me?\u201d Mme. Verdurin had retorted crossly. \u201cI asked you whether they would mix well together.\u201d \u201cAh! Madame, that is one of the things that it is hard to tell.\u201d Mme. Verdurin had been impelled by no malice. She was certain of the Baron\u2019s morals, but when she expressed herself in these terms had not been thinking about them for a moment, but had merely wished to know whether she could invite the Prince and M. de Charlus on the same evening, without their clashing. She had no malevolent intention when she employed these ready-made expressions which are popular in artistic \u2018little clans.\u2019 To make the most of M. de Guermantes, she proposed to take him in the afternoon, after her luncheon-party, to a charity entertainment at which sailors from the neighbourhood would give a representation of a ship setting sail. But, not having time to attend to everything, she delegated her duties to the faithfullest of the faithful, the Baron. \u201cYou understand, I don\u2019t want them to hang about like mussels on a rock, they must keep moving, we must see them weighing anchor, or whatever it\u2019s called. Now you are always going down to the harbour at Balbec-Plage, you can easily arrange a dress rehearsal without tiring yourself. You must know far more than I do, M. de Charlus, about getting hold of sailors. But after all, we\u2019re giving ourselves a great deal of trouble for M. de Guermantes. Perhaps he\u2019s only one of those idiots from the Jockey Club. Oh! Heavens, I\u2019m running down the Jockey Club, and I seem to remember that you\u2019re one of them. Eh, Baron, you don\u2019t answer me, are you one of them? You don\u2019t care to come out with us? Look, here is a book that has just come, I think you\u2019ll find it interesting. It is by Roujon. The title is attractive: Life among men.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For my part, I was all the more glad that M. de Charlus often took the place of Princess Sherbatoff, inasmuch as I was thoroughly in her bad books, for a reason that was at once trivial and profound. One day when I was in the little train, paying every attention, as was my habit, to Princess Sherbatoff, I saw Mme. de Villeparisis get in. She had as a matter of fact come down to spend some weeks with the Princesse de Luxembourg, but, chained to the daily necessity of seeing Albertine, I had never replied to the repeated invitations of the Marquise and her royal hostess. I felt remorse at the sight of my grandmother\u2019s friend, and, purely from a sense of duty (without deserting Princess Sherbatoff), sat talking to her for some time. I was, as it happened, entirely unaware that Mme. de Villeparisis knew quite well who my companion was but did not wish to speak to her. At the next station, Mme. de Villeparisis left the carriage, indeed I reproached myself with not having helped her on to the platform; I resumed my seat by the side of the Princess. But one would have thought \u2014 a cataclysm frequent among people whose position is far from stable and who are afraid that one may have heard something to their discredit, and may be looking down upon them \u2014 that the curtain had risen upon a fresh scene. Buried in her Revue des Deux Mondes, Madame Sherbatoff barely moved her lips in reply to my questions and finally told me that I was making her head ache. I had not the faintest idea of the nature of my crime. When I bade the Princess good-bye, the customary smile did not light up her face, her chin drooped in a dry acknowledgment, she did not even offer me her hand, nor did she ever speak to me again. But she must have spoken \u2014 though what she said I cannot tell \u2014 to the Verdurins; for as soon as I asked them whether I ought not to say something polite to Princess Sherbatoff, they replied in chorus: \u201cNo! Nol No! Nothing of the sort! She does not care for polite speeches!\u201d They did not say this to effect a breach between us, but she had succeeded in making them believe that she was unmoved by civilities, that hers was a spirit unassailed by the vanities of this world. One needs to have seen the politician who was reckoned the most single-minded, the most uncompromising, the most unapproachable, so long as he was in office, one must have seen him in the hour of his disgrace, humbly soliciting, with a bright, affectionate smile, the haughty greeting of some unimportant journalist, one must have seen Cottard (whom his new patients regarded as a rod of iron) draw himself erect, one must know out of what disappointments in love, what rebuffs to snobbery were built up the apparent pride, the universally acknowledged anti-snobbery of Princess Sherbatoff, in order to grasp that among the human race the rule \u2014 which admits of exceptions, naturally \u2014 is that the reputedly hard people are weak people whom nobody wants, and that the strong, caring little whether they are wanted or not, have alone that meekness which the common herd mistake for weakness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, I ought not to judge Princess Sherbatoff severely. Her case is so common! One day, at the funeral of a Guermantes, a distinguished man who was standing next to me drew my attention to a slim person with handsome features. \u201cOf all the Guermantes,\u201d my neighbour informed me, \u201cthat is the most astonishing, the most singular. He is the Duke\u2019s brother.\u201d I replied imprudently that he was mistaken, that the gentleman in question, who was in no way related to the Guermantes, was named Journier-Sarlov\u00e8ze. The distinguished man turned his back upon me, and has never even bowed to me since\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A great musician, a member of the Institute, occupying a high official position, who was acquainted with Ski, came to Harambouville, where he had a niece staying, and appeared at one of the Verdurins\u2019 Wednesdays. M. de Charlus was especially polite to him (at Morel\u2019s request), principally in order that on his return to Paris the Academician might enable him to attend various private concerts, rehearsals and so forth, at which the violinist would be playing. The Academician, who was flattered, and was naturally a charming person, promised, and kept his promise. The Baron was deeply touched by all the consideration which this personage (who, for his own part, was exclusively and passionately a lover of women) shewed him, all the facilities that he procured to enable him to see Morel in those official quarters which the profane world may not enter, all the opportunities by which the celebrated artist secured that the young virtuoso might shew himself, might make himself known, by naming him in preference to others of equal talent for auditions which were likely to make a special stir. But M. de Charlus never suspected that he ought to be all the more grateful to the maestro in that the latter, doubly deserving, or, if you prefer it, guilty twice over, was completely aware of the relations between the young violinist and his noble patron. He favoured them, certainly without any sympathy for them, being unable to comprehend any other love than that for the woman who had inspired the whole of his music, but from moral indifference, a professional readiness to oblige, social affability, snobbishness. As for his doubts as to the character of those relations, they were so scanty that, at his first dinner at la Raspeli\u00e8re, he had inquired of Ski, speaking of M. de Charlus and Morel, as he might have spoken of a man and his mistress: \u201cHave they been long together?\u201d But, too much the man of the world to let the parties concerned see what was in his mind, prepared, should any gossip arise among Morel\u2019s fellow-students, to rebuke them, and to reassure Morel by saying to him in a fatherly tone: \u201cOne hears that sort of thing about everybody nowadays,\u201d he did not cease to load the Baron with civilities which the latter thought charming, but quite natural, being incapable of suspecting the eminent maestro of so much vice or of so much virtue. For the things that were said behind M. de Charlus\u2019s back, the expressions used about Morel, nobody was ever base enough to repeat to him. And yet this simple situation is enough to shew that even that thing universally decried, which would find no defender anywhere: the breath of scandal, has itself, whether it be aimed at us and so become especially disagreeable to us, or inform us of something about a third person of which we were unaware, a psychological value of its own. It prevents the mind from falling asleep over the fictitious idea that it has of what it supposes things to be when it is actually no more than their outward appearance. It turns this appearance inside out with the magic dexterity of an idealist philosopher and rapidly presents to our gaze an unsuspected corner of the reverse side of the fabric. How could M. de Charlus have imagined the remark made of him by a certain tender relative: \u201cHow on earth can you suppose that M\u00e9m\u00e9 is in love with me, you forget that I am a woman!\u201d And yet she was genuinely, deeply attached to M. de Charlus. Why then need we be surprised that in the case of the Verdurins, whose affection and goodwill he had no title to expect, the remarks which they made behind his back (and they did not, as we shall see, confine themselves to remarks), were so different from what he imagined them to be, that is to say from a mere repetition of the remarks that he heard when he was present? The latter alone decorated with affectionate inscriptions the little ideal tent to which M. de Charlus retired at times to dream by himself, when he introduced his imagination for a moment into the idea that the Verdurins held of him. Its atmosphere was so congenial, so cordial, the repose it offered so comforting, that when M. de Charlus, before going to sleep, had withdrawn to it for a momentary relief from his worries, he never emerged from it without a smile. But, for each one of us, a tent of this sort has two sides: as well as the side which we suppose to be the only one, there is the other which is normally invisible to us, the true front, symmetrical with the one that we know, but very different, whose decoration, in which we should recognise nothing of what we-expected to see, would horrify us, as being composed of the hateful symbols of an unsuspected hostility. What a shock for M. de Charlus, if he had found his way into one of these enemy tents, by means of some piece of scandal as though by one of those service stairs where obscene drawings are scribbled outside the back doors of flats by unpaid tradesmen or dismissed servants. But, just as we do not possess that sense of direction with which certain birds are endowed, so we lack the sense of our own visibility as we lack that of distances, imagining as quite close to us the interested attention of the people who on the contrary never give us a thought, and not suspecting that we are at the same time the sole preoccupation of others. And so M. de Charlus lived in a state of deception like the fish which thinks that the water in which it is swimming extends beyond the glass wall of its aquarium which mirrors it, while it does not see close beside it in the shadow the human visitor who is amusing himself by watching its movements, or the all-powerful keeper who, at the unforeseen and fatal moment, postponed for the present in the case of the Baron (for whom the keeper, in Paris, will be Mme. Verdurin), will extract it without compunction from the place in which it was happily living to cast it into another. Moreover, the races of mankind, in so far as they are not merely collections of individuals, may furnish us with examples more vast, but identical in each of their parts, of this profound, obstinate and disconcerting blindness. Up to the present, if it was responsible for M. de Charlus\u2019s discoursing to the little clan remarks of a wasted subtlety or of an audacity which made his listeners smile at him in secret, it had not yet caused him, nor was it to cause him at Balbec any serious inconvenience. A trace of albumen, of sugar, of cardiac arythmia, does not prevent life from remaining normal for the man who is not even conscious of it, when only the physician sees in it a prophecy of catastrophes in store. At present the fondness \u2014 whether Platonic or not \u2014 that M. de Charlus felt for Morel merely led the Baron to say spontaneously in Morel\u2019s absence that he thought him very good looking, supposing that this would be taken in all innocence, and thereby acting like a clever man who when summoned to make a statement before a Court of Law will not be afraid to enter into details which are apparently to his disadvantage but for that very reason are more natural and less vulgar than the conventional protestations of a stage culprit. With the same freedom, always between Saint-Martin du Ch\u00e2ne and Donci\u00e8res-Ouest \u2014 or conversely on the return journey \u2014 M. de Charlus would readily speak of men who had, it appeared, very strange morals, and would even add: \u201cAfter all, I say strange, I don\u2019t know why, for there\u2019s nothing so very strange about that,\u201d to prove to himself how thoroughly he was at his ease with his audience. And so indeed he was, provided that it was he who retained the initiative, and that he knew his gallery to be mute and smiling, disarmed by credulity or good manners\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When M. de Charlus was not speaking of his admiration for Morel\u2019s beauty, as though it had no connexion with an inclination \u2014 called a vice \u2014 he would refer to that vice, but as though he himself were in no way addicted to it. Sometimes indeed he did not hesitate to call it by its name. As after examining the fine binding of his volume of Balzac I asked him which was his favourite novel in the Com\u00e9die Humaine, he replied, his thoughts irresistibly attracted to the same topic: \u201cEither one thing or the other, a tiny miniature like the Cur\u00e9 de Tours and the Femme abandonn\u00e9e, or one of the great frescoes like the series of Illusions perdues. What! You\u2019ve never read Illusions perdues? It\u2019s wonderful. The scene where Carlos Herrera asks the name of the ch\u00e2teau he is driving past, and it turns out to be Rastignac, the home of the young man he used to love. And then the abb\u00e9 falls into a reverie which Swann once called, and very aptly, the Tristesse d\u2019Olympia of paederasty. And the death of Lucien! I forgot who the man of taste was who, when he was asked what event in his life had most distressed him, replied: \u2018The death of Lucien de Rubempr\u00e9 in Splendeurs et Mis\u00e8res.\u2019\u201d \u201cI know that Balzac is all the rage this year, as pessimism was last,\u201d Brichot interrupted. \u201cBut, at the risk of distressing the hearts that are smitten with the Balzacian fever, without laying any claim, damme, to being a policeman of letters, or drawing up a list of offences against the laws of grammar, I must confess that the copious improviser whose alarming lucubrations you appear to me singularly to overrate, has always struck me as being an insufficiently meticulous scribe. I have read these Illusions perdues of which you are telling us, Baron, flagellating myself to attain to the fervour of an initiate, and I confess in all simplicity of heart that those serial instalments of bombastic balderdash, written in double Dutch \u2014 and in triple Dutch: Esther heureuse, O\u00f9 m\u00e8nent les mauvais chemins, A combien l\u2019amour revient aux vieillards, have always had the effect on me of the Myst\u00e8res de Rocambole, exalted by an inexplicable preference to the precarious position of a masterpiece.\u201d \u201cYou say that because you know nothing of life,\u201d said the Baron, doubly irritated, for he felt that Brichot would not understand either his aesthetic reasons or the other kind. \u201cI quite realise,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cthat, to speak like Master Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, you mean that I am moult sorbonagre, sorbonicole et sorboniforme. And yet, just as much as any of the comrades, I like a book to give an impression of sincerity and real life, I am not one of those clerks. . . . \u201d \u201cThe quart d\u2019heure de Rabelais,\u201d the Doctor broke in, with an air no longer of uncertainty but of assurance as to his own wit. \u201c . . . who take a vow of literature following the rule of the Abbaye-aux-Bois, yielding obedience to M. le Vicomte de Chateaubriand, Grand Master of common form, according to the strict rule of the humanists. M. le Vicomte de Chateaubriand\u2019s mistake. . . . \u201d \u201cWith fried potatoes?\u201d put in Dr. Cottard. \u201cHe is the patron saint of the brotherhood,\u201d continued Brichot, ignoring the wit of the Doctor, who, on the other hand, alarmed by the don\u2019s phrase, glanced anxiously at M. de Charlus. Brichot had seemed wanting in tact to Cottard, whose pun had brought a delicate smile to the lips of Princess Sherbatoff. \u201cWith the Professor, the mordant irony of the complete sceptic never forfeits its rights,\u201d she said kindly, to shew that the scientist\u2019s witticism had not passed unperceived by herself. \u201cThe sage is of necessity sceptical,\u201d replied the Doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. Gnothi seauton, said Socrates. He was quite right, excess in anything is a mistake. But I am dumbfoundered when I think that those words have sufficed to keep Socrates\u2019s name alive all this time. What is there in his philosophy, very little when all is said. When one reflects that Charcot and others have done work a thousand times more remarkable, work which moreover is at least founded upon something, upon the suppression of the pupillary reflex as a syndrome of general paralysis, and that they are almost forgotten. After all, Socrates was nothing out of the common. They were people who had nothing better to do, and spent their time strolling about and splitting hairs. Like Jesus Christ: \u2018Love one another!\u2019 it\u2019s all very pretty.\u201d \u201cMy dear,\u201d Mme. Cottard implored. \u201cNaturally my wife protests, women are all neurotic.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear Doctor, I am not neurotic,\u201d murmured Mme. Cottard. \u201cWhat, she is not neurotic! When her son is ill, she exhibits phenomena of insomnia. Still, I quite admit that Socrates, and all the rest of them, are necessary for a superior culture, to acquire the talent of exposition. I always quote his gnothi seauton to my pupils at the beginning of the course. P\u00e8re Bouchard, when he heard of it, congratulated me.\u201d \u201cI am not one of those who hold to form for form\u2019s sake, any more than I should treasure in poetry the rhyme millionaire,\u201d replied Brichot. \u201cBut all the same the Com\u00e9die Humaine \u2014 which is far from human \u2014 is more than the antithesis of those works in which the art exceeds the matter, as that worthy hack Ovid says. And it is permissible to choose a middle course, which leads to the presbytery of Meudon or the hermitage of Ferney, equidistant from the Valley of Wolves, in which Ren\u00e9 superbly performed the duties of a merciless pontificate, and from les Jardies, where Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, browbeaten by the bailiffs, never ceased voiding upon paper to please a Polish woman, like a zealous apostle of balderdash.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cChateaubriand is far more alive now than you say, and Balzac is, after all, a great writer,\u201d replied M. de Charlus, still too much impregnated with Swann\u2019s tastes not to be irritated by Brichot, \u201cand Balzac was acquainted with even those passions which the rest of the world ignores, or studies only to castigate them. Without referring again to the immortal Illusions perdues; Sarrazine, La Fille aux yeux d\u2019or, Une passion dans le d\u00e9sert, even the distinctly enigmatic Fausse Ma\u00eetresse can be adduced in support of my argument. When I spoke of this \u2018unnatural\u2019 aspect of Balzac to Swann, he said to me: \u2018You are of the same opinion as Taine.\u2019 I never had the honour of knowing Monsieur Taine,\u201d M. de Charlus continued, with that irritating habit of inserting an otiose \u2018Monsieur\u2019 to which people in society are addicted, as though they imagine that by styling a great writer \u2018Monsieur\u2019 they are doing him an honour, perhaps keeping him at his proper distance, and making it evident that they do not know him personally. \u201cI never knew Monsieur Taine, but I felt myself greatly honoured by being of the same opinion as he.\u201d However, in spite of these ridiculous social affectations, M. de Charlus was extremely intelligent, and it is probable that if some remote marriage had established a connexion between his family and that of Balzac, he would have felt (no less than Balzac himself, for that matter) a satisfaction which he would have been unable to help displaying as a praiseworthy sign of condescension\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now and again, at the station after Saint-Martin du Ch\u00eane, some young men would get into the train. M. de Charlus could not refrain from looking at them, but as he cut short and concealed the attention that he was paying them, he gave it the air of hiding a secret, more personal even than his real secret; one would have said that he knew them, allowed his acquaintance to appear in spite of himself, after he had accepted the sacrifice, before turning again to us, like children who, in consequence of a quarrel among their respective parents, have been forbidden to speak to certain of their schoolfellows, but who when they meet them cannot forego the temptation to raise their heads before lowering them again before their tutor\u2019s menacing cane\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the word borrowed from the Greek with which M. de Charlus in speaking of Balzac had ended his comparison of the Tristesse d\u2019Olympiowith the Splendeurs et Mis\u00e8res, Ski, Brichot and Cottard had glanced at one another with a smile perhaps less ironical than stamped with that satisfaction which people at a dinner-party would shew who had succeeded in making Dreyfus talk about his own case, or the Empress Eug\u00e9nie about her reign. They were hoping to press him a little further upon this subject, but we were already at Donci\u00e8res, where Morel joined us. In his presence, M. de Charlus kept a careful guard over his conversation and, when Ski tried to bring it back to the love of Carlos Herrera for Lucien de Rubempr\u00e9, the Baron assumed the vexed, mysterious, and finally (seeing that nobody was listening to him) severe and judicial air of a father who hears people saying something indecent in front of his daughter. Ski having shewn some determination to pursue the subject, M. de Charlus, his eyes starting out of his head, raised his voice and said, in a significant tone, looking at Albertine, who as a matter of fact could not hear what we were saying, being engaged in conversation with Mme. Cottard and Princess Sherbatoff, and with the suggestion of a double meaning of a person who wishes to teach ill-bred people a lesson: \u201cI think it is high time we began to talk of subjects that are likely to interest this young lady.\u201d But I quite realised that, to him, the young lady was not Albertine but Morel; he proved, as it happened, later on, the accuracy of my interpretation by the expressions that he employed when he begged that there might be no more of such conversation in front of Morel. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said to me, speaking of the violinist, \u201cthat he is not at all what you might suppose, he is a very respectable youth who has always behaved himself, he is very serious.\u201d And one gathered from these words that M. de Charlus regarded sexual inversion as a danger as menacing to young men as prostitution is to women, and that if he employed the epithet \u2018respectable,\u2019 of Morel it was in the sense that it has when applied to a young shop-girl. Then Brichot, to change the conversation, asked me whether I intended to remain much longer at Incarville. I had pointed out to him more than once, but in vain, that I was staying not at Incarville but at Balbec, he always repeated the mistake, for it was by the name of Incarville or Balbec-Incarville that he described this section of the coast. There are people like that, who speak of the same things as ourselves but call them by a slightly different name. A certain lady of the Faubourg Saint-Germain used invariably to ask me, when she meant to refer to the Duchesse de Guermantes, whether I had seen Z\u00e9na\u00efde lately, or Oriane-Z\u00e9na\u00efde, the effect of which was that at first I did not understand her. Probably there had been a time when, some relative of Mme. de Guermantes being named Oriane, she herself, to avoid confusion, had been known as Oriane-Z\u00e9na\u00efde. Perhaps, too, there had originally been a station only at Incarville, from which one went in a carriage to Balbec. \u201cWhy, what have you been talking about?\u201d said Albertine, astonished at the solemn, paternal tone which M. de Charlus had suddenly adopted. \u201cAbout Balzac,\u201d the Baron hastily replied, \u201cand you are wearing this evening the very same clothes as the Princesse de Cadignan, not her first gown, which she wears at the dinnerparty, but the second.\u201d This coincidence was due to the fact that, in choosing Albertine\u2019s clothes, I sought inspiration in the taste that she had acquired thanks to Elstir, who greatly appreciated a sobriety which might have been called British, had it not been tempered with a gentler, more flowing grace that was purely French. As a rule the garments that he chose offered to the eye a harmonious combination of grey tones like the dress of Diane de Cadignan. M. de Charlus was almost the only person capable of appreciating Albertine\u2019s clothes at their true value; at a glance, his eye detected what constituted their rarity, justified their price; he would never have said the name of one stuff instead of another, and could always tell who had made them. Only he preferred \u2014 in women \u2014 a little more brightness and colour than Elstir would allow. And so this evening she cast a glance at me half smiling, half troubled, wrinkling her little pink cat\u2019s nose. Indeed, meeting over her skirt of grey cr\u00eape de chine, her jacket of grey cheviot gave the impression that Albertine was dressed entirely in grey. But, making a sign to me to help her, because her puffed sleeves needed to be smoothed down or pulled up, for her to get into or out of her jacket, she took it off, and as her sleeves were of a Scottish plaid in soft colours, pink, pale blue, dull green, pigeon\u2019s breast, the effect was as though in a grey sky there had suddenly appeared a rainbow. And she asked herself whether this would find favour with M. de Charlus. \u201cAh!\u201d he exclaimed in delight, \u201cnow we have a ray, a prism of colour. I offer you my sincerest compliments.\u201d \u201cBut it is this gentleman who has earned them,\u201d Albertine replied politely, pointing to myself, for she liked to shew what she had received from me. \u201cIt is only women who do not know how to dress that are afraid of colours,\u201d went on M. de Charlus. \u201cA dress may be brilliant without vulgarity and quiet without being dull. Besides, you have not the same reasons as Mme. de Cadignan for wishing to appear detached from life, for that was the idea which she wished to instil into d\u2019Arthez by her grey gown.\u201d Albertine, who was interested in this mute language of clothes, questioned M. de Charlus about the Princesse de Cadignan. \u201cOhl It is a charming tale,\u201d said the Baron in a dreamy tone. \u201cI know the little garden in which Diane de Cadignan used to stroll with M. d\u2019Espard. It belongs to one of my cousins.\u201d \u201cAll this talk about his cousin\u2019s garden,\u201d Brichot murmured to Cottard, \u201cmay, like his pedigree, be of some importance to this worthy Baron. But what interest can it have for us who are not privileged to walk in it, do not know the lady, and possess no titles of nobility?\u201d For Brichot had no suspicion that one might be interested in a gown and in a garden as works of art, and that it was in the pages of Balzac that M, de Charlus saw, in his mind\u2019s eye, the garden paths of Mme. de Cadignan. The Baron went on: \u201cBut you know her,\u201d he said to me, speaking of this cousin, and, by way of flattering me, addressing himself to me as to a person who, exiled amid the little clan, was to M. de Charlus, if not a citizen of his world, at any rate a visitor to it. \u201cAnyhow you must have seen her at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s.\u201d \u201cIs that the Marquise de Villeparisis who owns the chateau at Baucreux?\u201d asked Brichot with a captivated air. \u201cYes, do you know her?\u201d inquired M. de Charlus dryly. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cbut our colleague Norpois spends part of his holidays every year at Baucreux. I have had occasion to write to him there.\u201d I told Morel, thinking to interest him, that M. de Norpois was a friend of my father. But not a movement of his features shewed that he had heard me, so little did he think of my parents, so far short did they fall in his estimation of what my great-uncle had been, who had employed Morel\u2019s father as his valet, and, as a matter of fact, being, unlike the rest of the family, fond of not giving trouble, had left a golden memory among his servants. \u201cIt appears that Mme. de Villeparisis is a superior woman; but I have never been allowed to judge of that for myself, nor for that matter have any of my colleagues. For Norpois, who is the soul of courtesy and affability at the Institute, has never introduced any of us to the Marquise. I know of no one who has been received by her except our friend Thureau-Dangin, who had an old family connexion with her, and also Gaston Boissier, whom she was anxious to meet because of an essay which interested her especially. He dined with her once and came back quite enthralled by her charm. Mme. Boissier, however, was not invited.\u201d At the sound of these names, Morel melted in a smile. \u201cAh! Thureau-Dangin,\u201d he said to me with an air of interest as great as had been his indifference when he heard me speak of the Marquis de Norpois and my father. \u201cThureau-Dangin; why, he and your uncle were as thick as thieves. Whenever a lady wanted a front seat for a reception at the Academy, your uncle would say: \u2018I shall write to Thureau-Dangin.\u2019 And of course he got the ticket at once, for you can understand that M. Thureau-Dangin would never have dared to refuse anything to your uncle, who would have been certain to pay him out for it afterwards if he had. I can\u2019t help smiling, either, when I hear the name Boissier, for that was where your uncle ordered all the presents he used to give the ladies at the New Year. I know all about it, because I knew the person he used to send for them.\u201d He had not only known him, the person was his father. Some of these affectionate allusions by Morel to my uncle\u2019s memory were prompted by the fact that we did not intend to remain permanently in the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes, where we had taken an apartment only on account of my grandmother. Now and again there would be talk of a possible move. Now, to understand the advice that Charlie Morel gave me in this connexion, the reader must know that my great-uncle had lived, in his day, at 40_bis Boulevard Malesherbes. The consequence was that, in the family, as we were in the habit of frequently visiting my uncle Adolphe until the fatal day when I made a breach between my parents and him by telling them the story of the lady in pink, instead of saying \u2018at your uncle\u2019s\u2019 we used to say \u2018at 40_bis.\u2019 If I were going to call upon some kinswoman, I would be warned to go first of all \u2018to 40_bis,\u2019 in order that my uncle might not be offended by my not having begun my round with him. He was the owner of the house and was, I must say, very particular as to the choice of his tenants, all of whom either were or became his personal friends. Colonel the Baron de Vatry used to look in every day and smoke a cigar with him in the hope of making him consent to pay for repairs. The carriage entrance was always kept shut. If my uncle caught sight of a cloth or a rug hanging from one of the windowsills he would dash into the room and have it removed in less time than the police would take to do so nowadays. All the same, he did let part of the house, reserving for himself only two floors and the stables. In spite of this, knowing that he was pleased when people praised the house, we used always to talk of the comfort of the \u2018little mansion\u2019 as though my uncle had been its sole occupant, and he allowed us to speak, without uttering the formal contradiction that might have been expected. The \u2018little mansion\u2019 was certainly comfortable (my uncle having installed in it all the most recent inventions). But there was nothing extraordinary about it. Only, my uncle, while saying with a false modesty \u2018my little hovel,\u2019 was convinced, or in any case had instilled into his valet, the latter\u2019s wife, the coachman, the cook, the idea that there was no place in Paris to compare, for comfort, luxury, and general attractiveness, with the little mansion. Charles Morel had grown up in this belief. Nor had he outgrown it. And so, even on days when he was not talking to me, if in the train I mentioned to anyone else the possibility of our moving, at once he would smile at me and, with a wink of connivance, say: \u201cAh! What you want is something in the style of 40_bis! That\u2019s a place that would suit you down to the ground! Your uncle knew what he was about. I am quite sure that in the whole of Paris there\u2019s nothing to compare with 40_bis.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The melancholy air which M. de Charlus had assumed in speaking of the Princesse de Cadignan left me in no doubt that the tale in question had not reminded him only of the little garden of a cousin-to whom he was not particularly attached. He became lost in meditation, and, as though he were talking to himself: \u201cThe secrets of the Princesse de Cadignan!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cWhat a masterpiece! How profound, how heartrending the evil reputation of Diane, who is afraid that the man she loves may hear of it. What an eternal truth, and more universal than might appear, how far it extends!\u201d He uttered these words with a sadness in which nevertheless one felt that he found a certain charm. Certainly M. de Charlus, unaware to what extent precisely his habits were or were not known, had been trembling for some time past at the thought that when he returned to Paris and was seen there in Morel\u2019s company, the latter\u2019s family might intervene and so his future happiness be jeopardised. This eventuality had probably not appeared to him hitherto save as something profoundly disagreeable and painful. But the Baron was an artist to his finger tips. And now that he had begun to identify his own position with that described by Balzac, he took refuge, in a sense, in the tale, and for the calamity which was perhaps in store for him and did not in any case cease to alarm him, he had the consolation of finding in his own anxiety what Swann and also Saint-Loup would have called something \u2018quite Balzacian.\u2019 This identification of himself with the Princesse de Cadignan had been made easy for M. de Charlus by virtue of the mental transposition which was becoming habitual with him and of which he had already furnished several examples. It was enough in itself, moreover, to make the mere conversion of a woman, as the beloved object, into a young man immediately set in motion about him the whole sequence of social complications which develop round a normal love affair. When, for any reason, we introduce once and for all time a change in the calendar, or in the daily time-table, if we make the year begin a few weeks later, or if we make midnight strike a quarter of an hour earlier, as the days will still consist of twenty-four hours and the months of thirty days, everything that depends upon the measure of time will remain unaltered. Everything may have been changed without causing any disturbance, since the ratio of the figures is still the same. So it is with lives which adopt Central European time, or the Eastern calendar. It seems even that the gratification a man derives from keeping an actress played a part in these relations. When, after their first meeting, M. de Charlus had made inquiries as to Morel\u2019s actual position, he must certainly have learned that he was of humble extraction, but a girl with whom we are in love does not forfeit our esteem because she is the child of poor parents. On the other hand, the well known musicians to whom he had addressed his inquiries, had \u2014 and not even from any personal motive, unlike the friends who, when introducing Swann to Odette, had described her to him as more difficult and more sought after than she actually was \u2014 simply in the stereotyped manner of men in a prominent position overpraising a beginner, answered the Baron: \u201cAh! Great talent, has made a name for himself, of course he is still quite young, highly esteemed by the experts, will go far.\u201d And, with the mania which leads people who are innocent of inversion to speak of masculine beauty: \u201cBesides, it is charming to watch him play; he looks better than anyone at a concert; he has lovely hair, holds himself so well; his head is exquisite, he reminds one of a violinist in a picture.\u201d And so M. de Charlus, raised to a pitch of excitement moreover by Morel himself, who did not fail to let him know how many offers had been addressed to him, was flattered by the prospect of taking him home with him, of making a little nest for him to which he would often return. For during the rest of the time he wished him to enjoy his freedom, which was necessary to his career, which M. de Charlus meant him, however much money he might feel bound to give him, to continue, either because of the thoroughly \u2018Guermantes\u2019 idea that a man ought to do something, that he acquires merit only by his talent, and that nobility or money is simply the additional cypher that multiplies a figure, or because he was afraid lest, having nothing to do and remaining perpetually in his company, the violinist might grow bored. Moreover he did not wish to deprive himself of the pleasure which he found, at certain important concerts, in saying to himself: \u201cThe person they are applauding at this moment is coming home with me to-night.\u201d Fashionable people, when they are in love and whatever the nature of their love, apply their vanity to anything that may destroy the anterior advantages from which their vanity would have derived satisfaction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morel, feeling that I bore him no malice, being sincerely attached to M. de Charlus, and at the same time absolutely indifferent physically to both of us, ended by treating me with the same display of warm friendship as a courtesan who knows that you do not desire her and that her lover has a sincere friend in you who will not attempt to part him from her. Not only did he speak to me exactly as Rachel, Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress, had spoken to me long ago, but what was more, to judge by what M. de Charlus reported to me, he used to say to him about me in my absence the same things that Rachel had said about me to Robert. In fact M. de Charlus said to me: \u201cHe likes you so much,\u201d as Robert had said: \u201cShe likes you so much.\u201d And just as the nephew on behalf of his mistress, so it was on Morel\u2019s behalf that the uncle often invited me to come and dine with them. There were, for that matter, just as many storms between them as there had been between Robert and Rachel. To be sure, after Charlie (Morel) had left us, M. de Charlus would sing his praises without ceasing, repeating \u2014 the thought of it was flattering to him \u2014 that the violinist was so good to him. But it was evident nevertheless that often Charlie, even in front of all the faithful, wore an irritated expression, instead of always appearing happy and submissive as the Baron would have wished. This irritation became so violent in course of time, owing to the weakness which led M. de Charlus to forgive Morel his want of politeness, that the violinist made no attempt to conceal, if he did not even deliberately assume it. I have seen M. de Charlus, on entering a railway carriage in which Morel was sitting with some of his soldier friends, greeted with a shrug of the musician\u2019s shoulders, accompanied by a wink in the direction of his comrades. Or else he would pretend to be asleep, as though this incursion bored him beyond words. Or he would begin to cough, and the others would laugh, derisively mimicking the affected speech of men like M. de Charlus; would draw Charlie into a corner, from which he would return, as though under compulsion, to sit by M. de Charlus, whose heart was pierced by all these cruelties. It is inconceivable how he can have put up with them; and these ever varied forms of suffering set the problem of happiness in fresh terms for M. de Charlus, compelled him not only to demand more, but to desire something else, the previous combination being vitiated by a horrible memory. And yet, painful as these scenes came to be, it must be admitted that at first the genius of the humble son of France traced for Morel, made him assume charming forms of simplicity, of apparent frankness, even of an independent pride which seemed to be inspired by disinterestedness. This was not the case, but the advantage of this attitude was all the more on Morel\u2019s side since, whereas the person who is in love is continually forced to return to the charge, to increase his efforts, it is on the other hand easy for him who is not in love to proceed along a straight line, inflexible and graceful. It existed by virtue of the privilege of the race in the face \u2014 so open \u2014 of this Morel whose heart was so tightly shut, that face imbued with the neo-Hellenic grace which blooms in the basilicas of Champagne. Notwithstanding his affectation of pride, often when he caught sight of M. de Charlus at a moment when he was not expecting to see him, he would be embarrassed by the presence of the little clan, would blush, lower his eyes, to the delight of the Baron, who saw in this an entire romance. It was simply a sign of irritation and shame. The former sometimes found expression; for, calm and emphatically decent as Morel\u2019s attitude generally was, it was not without frequent contradictions. Sometimes, indeed, at something which the Baron said to him, Morel would come out, in the harshest tone, with an insolent retort which shocked everybody. M. de Charlus would lower his head with a sorrowful air, make no reply, and with that faculty which doting fathers possess of believing that the coldness, the rudeness of their children has passed unnoticed, would continue undeterred to sing the violinist\u2019s praises. M. de Charlus was not, indeed, always so submissive, but as a rule his attempts at rebellion proved abortive, principally because, having lived among people in society, in calculating the reactions that he might provoke he made allowance for the baser instincts, whether original or acquired. Now, instead of these, he encountered in Morel a plebeian tendency to spells of indifference. Unfortunately for M. de Charlus, he did not understand that, with Morel, everything else must give place when the Conservatoire (and the good reputation of the Conservatoire, but with this, which was to be a more serious matter, we are not at present concerned) was in question. Thus, for instance, people of the middle class will readily change their surnames out of vanity, noblemen for personal advantage. To the young violinist, on the contrary, the name Morel was inseparably linked with his first prize for the violin, and so impossible to alter. M. de Charlus would have liked Morel to take everything from himself, including a name. Going upon the facts that Morel\u2019s other name was Charles, which resembled Charlus, and that the place where they were in the habit of meeting was called les Charmes, he sought to persuade Morel that, a pleasant name, easy to pronounce, being half the battle for artistic fame, the virtuoso ought without hesitation to take the name Charmel, a discreet allusion to the scene of their intimacy. Morel shrugged his shoulders. As a conclusive argument, M. de Charlus was unfortunately inspired to add that he had a footman of that name. He succeeded only in arousing the furious indignation of the young man. \u201cThere was a time when my ancestors were proud of the title of groom, of butler to the King.\u201d \u201cThere was also a time,\u201d replied Morel haughtily, \u201cwhen my ancestors cut off your ancestors\u2019 heads.\u201d M. de Charlus would have been greatly surprised had he been told that even if, abandoning the idea of \u2018Channel,\u2019 he made up his mind to adopt Morel and to confer upon him one of the titles of the Guermantes family which were at his disposal but which circumstances, as we shall see, did not permit him to offer the violinist, the other would decline, thinking of the artistic reputation attached to the name Morel, and of the things that would be said about him in \u2018the class.\u2019 So far above the Faubourg Saint-Germain did he place the Rue Berg\u00e8re. And so M. de Charlus was obliged to content himself with having symbolical rings made for Morel, bearing the antique device: PLVS VLTRA CAR\u2019LVS. Certainly, in the face of an adversary of a sort with which he was unfamiliar, M. de Charlus ought to have changed his tactics. But which of us is capable of that? Moreover, if M. de Charlus made blunders, Morel was not guiltless of them either. Far more than the actual circumstance which brought about the rupture between them, what was destined, provisionally, at least (but this provisional turned out to be final), to ruin him with M. de Charlus was that his nature included not only the baseness which made him lie down under harsh treatment and respond with insolence to kindness. Running parallel to this innate baseness, there was in him a complicated neurasthenia of ill breeding, which, roused to activity on every occasion when he was in the wrong or was becoming a nuisance, meant that at the very moment when he had need of all his politeness, gentleness, gaiety, to disarm the Baron, he became sombre, petulant, tried to provoke discussions on matters where he knew that the other did not agree with him, maintained his own hostile attitude with a weakness of argument and a slashing violence which enhanced that weakness. For, very soon running short of arguments, he invented fresh ones as he went along, in which he displayed the full extent of his ignorance and folly. These were barely noticeable when he was in a friendly mood and sought only to please. On the contrary, nothing else was visible in his fits of sombre humour, when, from being inoffensive, they became odious. Whereupon M. de Charlus felt that he could endure no more, that his only hope lay in a brighter morrow, while Morel, forgetting that the Baron was enabling him to live in the lap of luxury, gave an ironical smile, of condescending pity, and said: \u201cI have never taken anything from anybody. Which means that there is nobody to whom I owe a word of thanks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, and as though he had been dealing with a man of the world, M. de Charlus continued to give vent to his rage, whether genuine or feigned, but in either case ineffective. It was not always so, however. Thus one day (which must be placed, as a matter of fact, subsequent to this initial period) when the Baron was returning with Charlie and myself from a luncheon party at the Verdurins\u2019, and expecting to spend the rest of the afternoon and the evening with the violinist at Donci\u00e8res, the latter\u2019s dismissal of him, as soon as we left the train, with: \u201cNo, I\u2019ve an engagement,\u201d caused M. de Charlus so keen a disappointment, that in spite of all his attempts to meet adversity with a brave face, I saw the tears trickling down and melting the paint beneath his eyes, as he stood helpless by the carriage door. Such was his grief that, since we intended, Albertine and I, to spend the rest of the day at Donci\u00e8res, I whispered to her that I would prefer that we did not leave M. de Charlus by himself, as he seemed, I could not say why, to be unhappy. The dear girl readily assented. I then asked M. de Charlus if he would not like me to accompany him for a little. He also assented, but declined to put my \u2018cousin\u2019 to any trouble. I found a certain charm (and one, doubtless, not to be repeated, since I had made up my mind to break with her), in saying to her quietly, as though she were my wife: \u201cGo back home by yourself, I shall see you this evening,\u201d and in hearing her, as a wife might, give me permission to do as I thought fit, and authorise me, if M. de Charlus, to whom she was attached, needed my company, to place myself at his disposal. We proceeded, the Baron and I, he waddling obesely, his Jesuitical eyes downcast, and I following him, to a caf\u00e9 where we were given beer. I felt M. de Charlus\u2019s eyes turning uneasily towards the execution of some plan. Suddenly he called for paper and ink, and began to write at an astonishing speed. While he covered sheet after sheet, his eyes glittered with furious fancies. When he had written eight pages: \u201cMay I ask you to do me a great service?\u201d he said to me. \u201cYou will excuse my sealing this note. I am obliged to do so. You will take a carriage, a motor-car if you can find one, to get there as quickly as possible. You are certain to find Morel in his quarters, where he has gone to change his clothes. Poor boy, he tried to bluster a little when we parted, but you may be sure that his heart is fuller than mine. You will give him this note, and, if he asks you where you met me, you will tell him that you stopped at Donci\u00e8res (which, for that matter, is the truth) to see Robert, which is not quite the truth perhaps, but that you met me with a person whom you do not know, that I seemed to be extremely angry, that you thought you heard something about sending seconds (I am, as a matter of fact, fighting a duel to-morrow). Whatever you do, don\u2019t say that I am asking for him, don\u2019t make any effort to bring him here, but if he wishes to come with you, don\u2019t prevent him from doing so. Go, my boy, it is for his good, you may be the means of averting a great tragedy. While you are away, I am going to write to my seconds. I have prevented you from spending the afternoon with your cousin. I hope that she will bear me no ill will for that, indeed I am sure of it. For hers is a noble soul, and I know that she is one of the people who are strong enough not to resist the greatness of circumstances. You must thank her on my behalf. I am personally indebted to her, and I am glad that it should be so.\u201d I was extremely sorry for M. de Charlus; it seemed to me that Charlie might have prevented this duel, of which he was perhaps the cause, and I was revolted, if that were the case, that he should have gone off with such indifference, instead of staying to help his protector. My indignation was increased when, on reaching the house in which Morel lodged, I recognised the voice of the violinist, who, feeling the need of an outlet for his happiness, was singing boisterously: \u201cSome Sunday morning, when the wedding-bells rrring!\u201d If poor M. de Charlus had heard him, he who wished me to believe, and doubtless believed himself, that Morel\u2019s heart at that moment was full! Charlie began to dance with joy when he caught sight of me. \u201cHallo, old boy I (excuse me, addressing you like that; in this damned military life, one picks up bad habits) what luck, seeing you. I have nothing to do all evening. Do let\u2019s go somewhere together. We can stay here if you like, or take a boat if you prefer that, or we can have some music, it\u2019s all the same to me.\u201d I told him that I was obliged to dine at Balbec, he seemed anxious that I should invite him to dine there also, but I refrained from doing so. \u201cBut if you\u2019re in such a hurry, why have you come here?\u201d \u201cI have brought you a note from M. de Charlus.\u201d At that moment all his gaiety vanished; his face contracted. \u201cWhat! He can\u2019t leave me alone even here. So I\u2019m a slave, am I? Old boy, be a sport. I\u2019m not going to open his letter. You can tell him that you couldn\u2019t find me.\u201d \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to open it, I fancy it contains something serious.\u201d \u201cNo, certainly not, you don\u2019t know all the lies, the infernal tricks that old scoundrel\u2019s up to. It\u2019s a dodge to make me go and see him. Very well! I\u2019m not going, I want to have an evening in peace.\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t there going to be a duel to-morrow?\u201d I asked Morel, whom I supposed to be equally well informed. \u201cA duel?\u201d he repeated with an air of stupefaction. \u201cI never heard a word about it. After all, it doesn\u2019t matter a damn to me, the dirty old beast can go and get plugged in the guts if he likes. But wait a minute, this is interesting, I\u2019m going to look at his letter after all. You can tell him that you left it here for me, in case I should come in.\u201d While Morel was speaking to me, I was looking with amazement at the beautiful books which M. de Charlus had given him, and which littered his room. The violinist having refused to accept those labelled: \u201cI belong to the Baron\u201d etc., a device which he felt to be insulting to himself, as a mark of vassalage, the Baron, with the sentimental ingenuity in which his ill-starred love abounded, had substituted others, originated by his ancestors, but ordered from the binder according to the circumstances of a melancholy friendship. Sometimes they were terse and confident, as Spes mea orExpectata non eludet. Sometimes merely resigned, as J\u2019attendrai. Others were gallant: Mesmes plaisir du mestre, or counselled chastity, such as that borrowed from the family of Simiane, sprinkled with azure towers and lilies, and given a fresh meaning: Sus-tendant lilia turres. Others, finally, were despairing, and appointed a meeting in heaven with him who had spurned the donor upon earth: Manet ultima caelo, and (finding the grapes which he had failed to reach too sour, pretending not to have sought what he had not secured) M. de Charlus said in one: Non mortale quod opto. But I had not time to examine them all\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If M. de Charlus, in dashing this letter down upon paper had seemed to be carried away by the demon that was inspiring his flying pen, as soon as Morel had broken the seal (a leopard between two roses gules, with the motto: atavis et armis) he began to read the letter as feverishly as M. de Charlus had written it, and over those pages covered at breakneck speed his eye ran no less rapidly than the Baron\u2019s pen. \u201cGood God!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthis is the last straw! But where am I to find him? Heaven only knows where he is now.\u201d I suggested that if he made haste he might still find him perhaps at a tavern where he had ordered beer as a restorative. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I shall be coming back,\u201d he said to his landlady, and added in petto, \u201cit will depend on how the cat jumps.\u201d A few minutes later we reached the caf\u00e9. I remarked M. de Charlus\u2019s expression at the moment when he caught sight of me. When he saw that I did not return unaccompanied, I could feel that his breath, his life were restored to him. Feeling that he could not get on that evening without Morel, he had pretended that somebody had told him that two officers of the regiment had spoken evil of him in connexion with the violinist and that he was going to send his seconds to call upon them. Morel had foreseen the scandal, his life in the regiment made impossible, and had hastened to the spot. In doing which he had not been altogether wrong. For to make his falsehood more plausible, M. de Charlus had already written to two of his friends (one was Cottard) asking them to be his seconds. And, if the violinist had not appeared, we may be certain that, in the frantic state in which M. de Charlus then was (and to change his sorrow into rage), he would have sent them with a challenge to some officer or other with whom it would have been a relief to him to fight. During the interval, M. de Charlus, remembering that he came of a race that was of purer blood than the House of France, told himself that it was really very good of him to take so much trouble over the son of a butler whose employer he would not have condescended to know. On the other hand, if his only amusement, almost, was now in the society of disreputable persons, the profoundly ingrained habit which such persons have of not replying to a letter, of failing to keep an appointment without warning you beforehand, without apologising afterwards, aroused in him, since, often enough, his heart was involved, such a wealth of emotion and the rest of the time caused him such irritation, inconvenience and anger, that he would sometimes begin to regret the endless letters over nothing at all, the scrupulous exactitude of Ambassadors and Princes, who, even if, unfortunately, their personal charms left him cold, gave him at any rate some sort of peace of mind. Accustomed to Morel\u2019s ways, and knowing how little hold he had over him, how incapable he was of insinuating himself into a life in which friendships that were vulgar but consecrated by force of habit occupied too much space and time to leave a stray hour for the great nobleman, evicted, proud, and vainly imploring, M. de Charlus was so convinced that the musician was not coming, was so afraid of losing him for ever if he went too far, that he could barely repress a cry of joy when he saw him appear. But feeling himself the victor, he felt himself bound to dictate the terms of peace and to extract from them such advantages as he might. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he said to him. \u201cAnd you?\u201d he went on, gazing at myself, \u201cI told you, whatever you did, not to bring him back with you.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to bring me,\u201d said Morel, turning upon M. de Charlus, in the artlessness of his coquetry, a glance conventionally mournful and languorously old-fashioned, with an air, which he doubtless thought to be irresistible, of wanting to kiss the Baron and to burst into tears. \u201cIt was I who insisted on coming in spite of him. I come, in the name of our friendship, to implore you on my bended knees not to commit this rash act.\u201d M. de Charlus was wild with joy. The reaction was almost too much for his nerves; he managed, however, to control them. \u201cThe friendship to which you appeal at a somewhat inopportune moment,\u201d he replied in a dry tone, \u201cought, on the contrary, to make you support me when I decide that I cannot allow the impertinences of a fool to pass unheeded. However, even if I chose to yield to the prayers of an affection which I have known better inspired, I should no longer be in a position to do so, my letters to my seconds have been sent off and I have no doubt of their consent. You have always behaved towards me like a little idiot and, instead of priding yourself, as you had every right to do, upon the predilection which I had shewn for you, instead of making known to the mob of serjeants or servants among whom the law of military service compels you to live, what a source of incomparable satisfaction a friendship such as mine was to you, you have sought to make excuses for yourself, almost to make an idiotic merit of not being grateful enough. I know that in so doing,\u201d he went on, in order not to let it appear how deeply certain scenes had humiliated him, \u201cyou are guilty merely of having let yourself be carried away by the jealousy of others. But how is it that at your age you are childish enough (and a child ill-bred enough) not to have seen at once that your election by myself and all the advantages that must result for you from it were bound to excite jealousies, that all your comrades while they egged you on to quarrel with me were plotting to take your place? I have not thought it necessary to tell you of the letters that I have received in that connexion from all the people in whom you place most confidence. I scorn the overtures of those flunkeys as I scorn their ineffective mockery. The only person for whom I care is yourself, since I am fond of you, but affection has its limits and you ought to have guessed as much.\u201d Harsh as the word flunkey might sound in the ears of Morel, whose father had been one, but precisely because his father had been one, the explanation of all social misadventures by \u2018jealousy,\u2019 an explanation fatuous and absurd, but of inexhaustible value, which with a certain class never fails to \u2018catch on\u2019 as infallibly as the old tricks of the stage with a theatrical audience or the threat of the clerical peril in a parliament, found in him an adherence hardly less solid than in Fran\u00e7oise, or the servants of Mme. de Guermantes, for whom jealousy was the sole cause of the misfortunes that beset humanity. He had no doubt that his comrades had tried to oust him from his position and was all the more wretched at the thought of this disastrous, albeit imaginary duel. \u201cOh! How dreadful!\u201d exclaimed Charlie. \u201cI shall never hold up my head again. But oughtn\u2019t they to see you before they go and call upon this officer?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, I suppose they ought. I\u2019ve sent word to one of them that I shall be here all evening and can give him his instructions.\u201d \u201cI hope that before he comes I can make you listen to reason; you will, anyhow, let me stay with you,\u201d Morel asked him tenderly. This was all that M. de Charlus wanted. He did not however yield at once. \u201cYou would do wrong to apply in this case the \u2018Whoso loveth well, chasteneth well\u2019 of the proverb, for it is yourself whom I loved well, and I intend to chasten even after our parting those who have basely sought to do you an injury. Until now, their inquisitive insinuations, when they dared to ask me how a man like myself could mingle with a boy of your sort, sprung from the gutter, I have answered only in the words of the motto of my La Rochefoucauld cousins: \u2018\u2019Tis my pleasure.\u2019 I have indeed pointed out to you more than once that this pleasure was capable of becoming my chiefest pleasure, without there resulting from your arbitrary elevation any degradation of myself.\u201d And in an impulse of almost insane pride he exclaimed, raising his arms in the air: \u201cTantus ab uno splendor! To condescend is not to descend,\u201d he went on in a calmer tone, after this delirious outburst of pride and joy. \u201cI hope at least that my two adversaries, notwithstanding their inferior rank, are of a blood that I can shed without reproach. I have made certain discreet inquiries in that direction which have reassured me. If you retained a shred of gratitude towards me, you ought on the contrary to be proud to see that for your sake I am reviving the bellicose humour of my ancestors, saying like them in the event of a fatal issue, now that I have learned what a little rascal you are: \u2018Death to me is life.\u2019\u201d And M. de Charlus said this sincerely, not only because of his love for Morel, but because a martial instinct which he quaintly supposed to have come down to him from his ancestors filled him with such joy at the thought of fighting that this duel, which he had originally invented with the sole object of making Morel come to him, he could not now abandon without regret. He had never engaged in any affair of the sort without at once imagining himself the victor, and identifying himself with the illustrious Constable de Guermantes, whereas in the case of anyone else this same action of taking the field appeared to him to be of the utmost insignificance. \u201cI am sure it will be a fine sight,\u201d he said to us in all sincerity, dwelling upon each word. \u201cTo see Sarah Bernhardt in L\u2019Aiglon, what is that but tripe? Mounet-Sully in Oedipus, tripe! At the most it assumes a certain pallid transfiguration when it is performed in the Arena of N\u00eemes. But what is it compared to that unimaginable spectacle, the lineal descendant of the Constable engaged in battle.\u201d And at the mere thought of such a thing, M. de Charlus, unable to contain himself for joy, began to make passes in the air which recalled Moli\u00e8re, made us take the precaution of drawing our glasses closer, and fear that, when the swords crossed, the combatants, doctor and seconds would at once be wounded. \u201cWhat a tempting spectacle it would be for a painter. You who know Monsieur Elstir,\u201d he said to me, \u201cyou ought to bring him.\u201d I replied that he was not in the neighbourhood. M. de Charlus suggested that he might be summoned by telegraph. \u201cOh! I say it in his interest,\u201d he added in response to my silence. \u201cIt is always interesting for a master \u2014 which he is, in my opinion \u2014 to record such an instance of racial survival. And they occur perhaps once in a century.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if M. de Charlus was enchanted at the thought of a duel which he had meant at first to be entirely fictitious, Morel was thinking with terror of the stories that might be spread abroad by the regimental band and might, thanks to the stir that would be made by this duel, penetrate to the holy of holies in the Rue Berg\u00e8re. Seeing in his mind\u2019s eye the \u2018class\u2019 fully informed, he became more and more insistent with M. de Charlus, who continued to gesticulate before the intoxicating idea of a duel. He begged the Baron to allow him not to leave him until the day after the next, the supposed day of the duel, so that he might keep him within sight and try to make him listen to the voice of reason. So tender a proposal triumphed over M. de Charlus\u2019s final hesitations. He said that he would try to find a way out of it, that he would postpone his final decision for two days. In this fashion, by not making any definite arrangement at once, M. de Charlus knew that he could keep Charlie with him for at least two days, and make use of the time to fix future engagements with him in exchange for his abandoning the duel, an exercise, he said, which in itself delighted him and which he would not forego without regret. And in saying this he was quite sincere, for he had always enjoyed taking the field when it was a question of crossing swords or exchanging shots with an adversary. Cottard arrived at length, although extremely late, for, delighted to act as second but even more upset by the prospect, he had been obliged to halt at all the caf\u00e9s or farms by the way, asking the occupants to be so kind as to shew him the way to \u2018No. 100\u2019 or \u2018a certain place.\u2019 As soon as he arrived, the Baron took him into another room, for he thought it more correct that Charlie and I should not be present at the interview, and excelled in making the most ordinary room serve for the time being as throne-room or council chamber. When he was alone with Cottard he thanked him warmly, but informed him that it seemed probable that the remark which had been repeated to him had never really been made, and requested that, in view of this, the Doctor would be so good as let the other second know that, barring possible complications, the incident might be regarded as closed. Now that the prospect of danger was withdrawn, Cottard was disappointed. He was indeed tempted for a moment to give vent to anger, but he remembered that one of his masters, who had enjoyed the most successful medical career of his generation, having failed to enter the Academy at his first election by two votes only, had put a brave face on it and had gone and shaken hands with his successful rival. And so the Doctor refrained from any expression of indignation which could have made no difference, and, after murmuring, he the most timorous of men, that there were certain things which one could not overlook, added that it was better so, that this solution delighted him. M. de Charlus, desirous of shewing his gratitude to the Doctor, just as the Duke his brother would have straightened the collar of my father\u2019s greatcoat or rather as a Duchess would put her arm round the waist of a plebeian lady, brought his chair close to the Doctor\u2019s, notwithstanding the dislike that he felt for the other. And, not only without any physical pleasure, but having first to overcome a physical repulsion, as a Guermantes, not as an invert, in taking leave of the Doctor, he clasped his hand and caressed it for a moment with the affection of a rider rubbing his horse\u2019s nose and giving it a lump of sugar. But Cottard, who had never allowed the Baron to see that he had so much as heard the vaguest rumours as to his morals, but nevertheless regarded him in his private judgment as one of the class of \u2018abnormals\u2019 (indeed, with his habitual inaccuracy in the choice of terms, and in the most serious tone, he said of one of M. Verdurin\u2019s footmen: \u201cIsn\u2019t he the Baron\u2019s mistress?\u201d), persons of whom he had little personal experience; imagined that this stroking of his hand was the immediate prelude to an act of violence in anticipation of which, the duel being a mere pretext, he had been enticed into a trap and led by the Baron into this remote apartment where he was about to be forcibly outraged. Not daring to stir from his chair, to which fear kept him glued, he rolled his eyes in terror, as though he had fallen into the hands of a savage who, for all he could tell, fed upon human flesh. At length M. de Charlus, releasing his hand and anxious to be hospitable to the end, said: \u201cWon\u2019t you come and take something with us, as the saying is, what in the old days used to be called a mazagran or a gloria, drinks that are no longer to be found, as archaeological curiosities, except in the plays of Labiche and the caf\u00e9s of Donci\u00e8res. A gloria would be distinctly suitable to the place, eh, and to the occasion, what do you say?\u201d \u201cI am President of the Anti-Alcohol League,\u201d replied Cottard. \u201cSome country sawbones has only got to pass, and it will be said that I do not practise what I preach. Os homini sublime dedit coelumque tueri,\u201d he added, not that this had any bearing on the matter, but because his stock of Latin quotations was extremely limited, albeit sufficient to astound his pupils. M. de Charlus shrugged his shoulders and led Cottard back to where we were, after exacting a promise of secrecy which was all the more important to him since the motive for the abortive duel was purely imaginary. It must on no account reach the ears of the officer whom he had arbitrarily selected as his adversary. While the four of us sat there drinking, Mme. Cottard, who had been waiting for her husband outside, where M. de Charlus could see her quite well, though he had made no effort to summon her, came in and greeted the Baron, who held out his hand to her as though to a housemaid, without rising from his chair, partly in the manner of a king receiving homage, partly as a snob who does not wish a woman of humble appearance to sit down at his table, partly as an egoist who enjoys being alone with his friends, and does not wish to be bothered. So Mme. Cottard remained standing while she talked to M. de Charlus and her husband. But, possibly because politeness, the knowledge of what \u2018ought to be done,\u2019 is not the exclusive privilege of the Guermantes, and may all of a sudden illuminate and guide the most uncertain brains, or else because, himself constantly unfaithful to his wife, Cottard felt at odd moments, as a sort of compensation, the need to protect her against anyone else who failed in his duty to her, the Doctor quickly frowned, a thing I had never seen him do before, and, without consulting M. de Charlus, said in a tone of authority: \u201cCome, L\u00e9ontine, don\u2019t stand about like that, sit down.\u201d \u201cBut are you sure I\u2019m not disturbing you?\u201d Mme. Cottard inquired timidly of M. de Charlus, who, surprised by the Doctor\u2019s tone, had made no observation. Whereupon, without giving him a second chance, Cottard repeated with authority: \u201cI told you to sit down.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently the party broke up, and then M. de Charlus said to Morel: \u201cI conclude from all this business, which has ended more happily than you deserved, that you are incapable of looking after yourself and that, at the expiry of your military service, I must lead you back myself to your father, like the Archangel Raphael sent by God to the young Tobias.\u201d And the Baron began to smile with an air of grandeur, and a joy which Morel, to whom the prospect of being thus led home afforded no pleasure, did not appear to share. In the exhilaration of comparing himself to the Archangel, and Morel to the son of Tobit, M. de Charlus no longer thought of the purpose of his speech which had been to explore the ground and see whether, as he hoped, Morel would consent to come with him to Paris. Intoxicated with his love or with his self-love, the Baron did not see or pretended not to see the violinist\u2019s wry grimace, for, leaving him by himself in the caf\u00e9, he said to me with a proud smile: \u201cDid you notice how, when I compared him to the son of Tobit, he became wild with joy? That was because, being extremely intelligent, he at once understood that the Father in whose company he was henceforth to live was not his father after the flesh, who must be some horrible valet with moustaches, but his spiritual father, that is to say Myself. What a triumph for him! How proudly he reared his head! What joy he felt at having understood me. I am sure that he will now repeat day by day: \u2018O God Who didst give the blessed Archangel Raphael as guide to thy servant Tobias, upon a long journey, grant to us, Thy servants, that we may ever be protected by him and armed with his succour.\u2019 I had no need even,\u201d added the Baron, firmly convinced that he would one day sit before the Throne of God, \u201cto tell him that I was the heavenly messenger, he realised it for himself, and was struck dumb with joy!\u201d And M. de Charlus (whom his joy, on the contrary, did not deprive of speech), regardless of the passers-by who turned to stare at him, supposing that he must be a lunatic, cried out by himself and at the top of his voice raising his hands in the air: \u201cAlleluia!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This reconciliation gave but a temporary respite to M. de Charlus\u2019s torments; often, when Morel had gone out on training too far away for M. de Charlus to be able to go and visit him or to send me to talk to him, he would write the Baron desperate and affectionate letters, in which he assured him that he was going to put an end to his life because, owing to a ghastly affair, he must have twenty-five thousand francs. He did not mention what this ghastly affair was, and had he done so, it would doubtless have been an invention. As far as the money was concerned, M. de Charlus would willingly have sent him it, had he not felt that it would make Charlie independent of him and free to receive the favours of some one else. And so he refused, and his telegrams had the dry, cutting tone of his voice. When he was certain of their effect, he hoped that Morel would never forgive him, for, knowing very well that it was the contrary that would happen, he could not help dwelling upon all the drawbacks that would be revived with this inevitable tie. But, if no answer came from Morel, he lay awake all night, had not a moment\u2019s peace, so great is the number of the things of which we live in ignorance, and of the interior and profound realities that remain hidden from us. And so he would form every conceivable supposition as to the enormity which put Morel in need of twenty-five thousand francs, gave it every possible shape, labelled it with, one after another, many proper names. I believe that at such moments M. de Charlus (in spite of the fact that his snobbishness, which was now diminishing, had already been overtaken if not outstripped by his increasing curiosity as to the ways of the lower orders) must have recalled with a certain longing the lovely, many-coloured whirl of the fashionable gatherings at which the most charming men and women sought his company only for the disinterested pleasure that it afforded them, where nobody would have dreamed of \u2018doing him down,\u2019 of inventing a \u2018ghastly affair,\u2019 on the strength of which one is prepared to take one\u2019s life, if one does not at once receive twenty-five thousand francs. I believe that then, and perhaps because he had after all remained more \u2018Combray\u2019 at heart than myself, and had grafted a feudal dignity upon his Germanic pride, he must have felt that one cannot with impunity lose one\u2019s heart to a servant, that the lower orders are by no means the same thing as society, that in short he did not \u2018get on\u2019 with the lower orders as I have always done\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next station upon the little railway, Maineville, reminds me of an incident in which Morel and M. de Charlus were concerned. Before I speak of it, I ought to mention that the halt of the train at Maineville (when one was escorting to Balbec a fashionable stranger, who, to avoid giving trouble, preferred not to stay at la Raspeli\u00e8re) was the occasion of scenes less painful than that which I am just about to describe. The stranger, having his light luggage with him in the train, generally found that the Grand Hotel was rather too far away, but, as there was nothing until one came to Balbec except small bathing places with uncomfortable villas, had, yielding to a preference for comfortable surroundings, resigned himself to the long journey when, as the train came to a standstill at Maineville, he saw the Palace staring him in the face, and never suspected that it was a house of ill fame. \u201cBut don\u2019t let us go any farther,\u201d he would invariably say to Mme. Cottard, a woman well-known for her practical judgment and sound advice. \u201cThere is the very thing I want. What is the use of going on to Balbec, where I certainly shan\u2019t find anything better. I can tell at a glance that it has all the modern comforts; I can quite well invite Mme. Verdurin there, for I intend, in return for her hospitality, to give a few little parties in her honour. She won\u2019t have so far to come as if I stay at Balbec. This seems to me the very place for her, and for your wife, my dear Professor. There are bound to be sitting rooms, we can have the ladies there. Between you and me, I can\u2019t imagine why Mme, Verdurin didn\u2019t come and settle here instead of taking la Raspeli\u00e8re. It is far healthier than an old house like la Raspeli\u00e8re, which is bound to be damp, and is not clean either, they have no hot water laid on, one can never get a wash. Now, Maineville strikes me as being far more attractive. Mme. Verdurin would have played the hostess here to perfection. However, tastes differ; I intend, anyhow, to remain here. Mme. Cottard, won\u2019t you come along with me; we shall have to be quick, for the train will be starting again in a minute. You can pilot me through that house, which you must know inside out, for you must often have visited it. It is the ideal setting for you.\u201d The others would have the greatest difficulty in making the unfortunate stranger hold his tongue, and still more in preventing him from leaving the train, while he, with the obstinacy which often arises from a blunder, insisted, gathered his luggage together and refused to listen to a word until they had assured him that neither Mme. Verdurin nor Mme. Cottard would ever come to call upon him there. \u201cAnyhow, I am going to make my headquarters there. Mme. Verdurin has only to write, if she wishes to see me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The incident that concerns Morel was of a more highly specialised order. There were others, but I confine myself at present, as the train halts and the porter calls out \u2018Donci\u00e8res,\u2019 \u2018Grattevast,\u2019 \u2018Maineville,\u2019 etc., to noting down the particular memory that the watering-place or garrison town recalls to me. I have already mentioned Maineville (media villa) and the importance that it had acquired from that luxurious establishment of women which had recently been built there, not without arousing futile protests from the mothers of families. But before I proceed to say why Maineville is associated in my memory with Morel and M. de Char-lus, I must make a note of the disproportion (which I shall have occasion to examine more thoroughly later on) between the importance that Morel attached to keeping certain hours free, and the triviality of the occupations to which he pretended to devote to them, this same disproportion recurring amid the explanations of another sort which he gave to M. de Charlus. He, who played the disinterested artist for the Baron\u2019s benefit (and might do so without risk, in view of the generosity of his protector), when he wished to have the evening to himself, in order to give a lesson, etc., never failed to add to his excuse the following words, uttered with a smile of cupidity: \u201cBesides, there may be forty francs to be got out of it. That\u2019s always something. You will let me go, for, don\u2019t you see it\u2019s all to my advantage. Damn it all, I haven\u2019t got a regular income like you, I have my way to make in the world, it\u2019s a chance of earning a little money.\u201d Morel, in professing his anxiety to give his lesson, was not altogether insincere. For one thing, it is false to say that money has no colour. A new way of earning them gives a fresh lustre to coins that are tarnished with use. Had he really gone out to give a lesson, it is probable that a couple of louis handed to him as he left the house by a girl pupil would have produced a different effect on him from a couple of louis coming from the hand of M. de Charlus. Besides, for a couple of louis the richest of men would travel miles, which become leagues when one is the son of a valet. But frequently M. de Charlus had his doubts as to the reality of the violin lesson, doubts which were increased by the fact that often the musician pleaded excuses of another sort, entirely disinterested from the material point of view, and at the same time absurd. In this Morel could not help presenting an image of his life, but one that deliberately, and unconsciously too, he so darkened that only certain parts of it could be made out. For a whole month he placed himself at M. de Charlus\u2019s disposal, on condition that he might keep his evenings free, for he was anxious to put in a regular attendance at a course of algebra. Come and see M. de Charlus after the class? Oh, that was impossible, the classes went on, sometimes, very late. \u201cEven after two o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d the Baron asked. \u201cSometimes.\u201d \u201cBut you can learn algebra just as easily from a book.\u201d \u201cMore easily, for I don\u2019t get very much out of the lectures.\u201d \u201cVery well, then! Besides, algebra can\u2019t be of any use to you.\u201d \u201cI like it. It soothes my nerves.\u201d \u201cIt cannot be algebra that makes him ask leave to go out at night,\u201d M. de Charlus said to himself. \u201cCan he be working for the police?\u201d In any case Morel, whatever objection might be made, reserved certain evening hours, whether for algebra or for the violin. On one occasion it was for neither, but for the Prince de Guermantes who, having come down for a few days to that part of the coast, to pay the Princesse de Luxembourg a visit, picked up the musician, without knowing who he was or being recognised by him either, and offered him fifty francs to spend the night with him in the brothel at Maineville; a twofold pleasure for Morel, in the profit received from M. de Guermantes and in the delight of being surrounded by women whose sunburned breasts would be visible to the naked eye. In some way or other M. de Charlus got wind of what had occurred and of the place appointed, but did not discover the name of the seducer. Mad with jealousy, and in the hope of finding out who he was, he telegraphed to Jupien, who arrived two days later, and when, early in the following week, Morel announced that he would again be absent, the Baron asked Jupien if he would undertake to bribe the woman who kept the establishment, and make her promise to hide the Baron and himself in some place where they could witness what occurred. \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll see to it, dearie,\u201d Jupien assured the Baron. It is hard to imagine to what extent this anxiety was agitating, and by so doing had momentarily enriched the mind of M. de Charlus. Love is responsible in this way for regular volcanic upheavals of the mind. In his, which, a few days earlier, resembled a plain so uniform that as far as the eye could reach it would have been impossible to make out an idea rising above the level surface, there had suddenly sprung into being, hard as stone, a chain of mountains, but mountains as elaborately carved as if some sculptor, instead of quarrying and carting his marble from them, had chiselled it on the spot, in which there writhed in vast titanic groups Fury, Jealousy, Curiosity, Envy, Hatred, Suffering, Pride, Terror and Love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the evening on which Morel was to be absent had come. Jupien\u2019s mission had proved successful. He and the Baron were to be there about eleven o\u2019clock, and would be put in a place of concealment. When they were still three streets away from this gorgeous house of prostitution (to which people came from all the fashionable resorts in the neighbourhood), M. de Charlus had begun to walk upon tiptoe, to disguise his voice, to beg Jupien not to speak so loud, lest Morel should hear them from inside. Whereas, on creeping stealthily into the entrance hall, M. de Charlus, who was not accustomed to places of the sort, found himself, to his terror and amazement, in a gathering more clamorous than the Stock Exchange or a sale room. It was in vain that he begged the girls who gathered round him to moderate their voices; for that matter their voices were drowned by the stream of announcements and awards made by an old \u2018assistant matron\u2019 in a very brown wig, her face crackled with the gravity of a Spanish attorney or priest, who kept shouting at every minute in a voice of thunder, ordering the doors to be alternately opened and shut, like a policeman regulating the flow of traffic: \u201cTake this gentleman to twenty-eight, the Spanish room.\u201d \u201cLet no more in.\u201d \u201cOpen the door again, these gentlemen want Mademoiselle No\u00e9mie. She\u2019s expecting them in the Persian parlour.\u201d M. de Charlus was as terrified as a countryman who has to cross the boulevards; while, to take a simile infinitely less sacrilegious than the subject represented on the capitals of the porch of the old church of Corleville, the voices of the young maids repeated in a lower tone, unceasingly, the assistant matron\u2019s orders, like the catechisms that we hear school-children chanting beneath the echoing vault of a parish church in the country. However great his alarm, M. de Charlus who, in the street, had been trembling lest he should make himself heard, convinced in his own mind that Morel was at the window, was perhaps not so frightened after all in the din of those huge staircases on which one realised that from the rooms nothing could be seen. Coming at length to the end of his calvary, he found Mlle. No\u00e9mie, who was to conceal him with Jupien, but began by shutting him up in a sumptuously furnished Persian sitting-room from which he could see nothing at all. She told him that Morel had asked for some orangeade, and that as soon as he was served the two visitors would be taken to a room with a transparent panel. In the meantime, as some one was calling for her, she promised them, like a fairy godmother, that to help them to pass the time she was going to send them a \u2018clever little lady.\u2019 For she herself was called away. The clever little lady wore a Persian wrapper, which she proposed to remove. M. de Charlus begged her to do nothing of the sort, and she rang for champagne which cost 40 francs a bottle. Morel, as a matter of fact, was, during this time, with the Prince de Guermantes; he had, for form\u2019s sake, pretended to go into the wrong room by mistake, had entered one in which there were two women, who had made haste to leave the two gentlemen undisturbed. M. de Charlus knew nothing of this, but was fidgeting with rage, trying to open the doors, sent for Mlle. No\u00e9mie, who, hearing the clever little lady give M. de Charlus certain information about Morel which was not in accordance with what she herself had told Jupien, banished her promptly, and sent presently, as a substitute for the clever little lady, a \u2018dear little lady\u2019 who exhibited nothing more but told them how respectable the house was and called, like her predecessor, for champagne. The Baron, foaming with rage, sent again for Mlle. No\u00e9mie, who said to them: \u201cYes, it is taking rather long, the ladies are doing poses, he doesn\u2019t look as if he wanted to do anything.\u201d Finally, yielding to the promises, the threats of the Baron, Mlle. No\u00e9mie went away with an air of irritation, assuring them that they would not be kept waiting more than five minutes. The five minutes stretched out into an hour, after which No\u00e9mie came and tiptoed in front of M. de Charlus, blind with rage, and Jupien plunged in misery, to a door which stood ajar, telling them: \u201cYou\u2019ll see splendidly from here. However, it\u2019s not very interesting just at present, he is with three ladies, he is telling them about life in his regiment.\u201d At length the Baron was able to see through the cleft of the door and also the reflexion in the mirrors beyond. But a deadly terror forced him to lean back against the wall. It was indeed Morel that he saw before him, but, as though the pagan mysteries and Enchantments still existed, it was rather the shade of Morel, Morel embalmed, not even Morel restored to life like Lazarus, an apparition of Morel, a phantom of Morel, Morel \u2018walking\u2019 or \u2018called up\u2019 in that room (in which the walls and couches everywhere repeated the emblems of sorcery), that was visible a few feet away from him, in profile. Morel had, as though he were already dead, lost all his colour; among these women, with whom one might have expected him to be making merry, he remained livid, fixed in an artificial immobility; to drink the glass of champagne that stood before him, his arm, sapped of its strength, tried in vain to reach out, and dropped back again. One had the impression of that ambiguous state implied by a religion which speaks of immorality but means by it something that does not exclude annihilation. The women were plying him with questions. \u201cYou see,\u201d Mlle. No\u00e9mie whispered to the Baron, \u201cthey are talking to him about his life in the regiment, it\u2019s amusing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u2014 here she laughed \u2014\u201cYou\u2019re glad you came? He is calm, isn\u2019t he,\u201d she added, as though she were speaking of a dying man. The women\u2019s questions came thick and fast, but Morel, inanimate, had not the strength to answer them. Even the miracle of a whispered word did not occur. M. de Charlus hesitated for barely a moment before he grasped what had really happened, namely that, whether from clumsiness on Jupien\u2019s part when he had called to make the arrangements, or from the expansive power of a secret lodged in any breast, which means that no secret is ever kept, or from the natural indiscretion of these ladies, or from their fear of the police, Morel had been told that two gentlemen had paid a large sum to be allowed to spy on him, unseen hands had spirited away the Prince de Guermantes, metamorphosed into three women, and had placed the unhappy Morel, trembling, paralysed with fear, in such a position that if M. de Charlus had but a poor view of him, he, terrorised, speechless, not daring to lift his glass for fear of letting it fall, had a perfect view of the Baron\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The story moreover had no happier ending for the Prince de Guermantes. When he had been sent away, so that M. de Charlus should not see him, furious at his disappointment, without suspecting who was responsible for it, he had implored Morel, still without letting him know who he was, to make an appointment with him for the following night in the tiny villa which he had taken and which, despite the shortness of his projected stay in it, he had, obeying the same insensate habit which we have already observed in Mme. de Villeparisis, decorated with a number of family keepsakes, so that he might feel more at home. And so, next day, Morel, turning his head every moment, trembling with fear of being followed and spied upon by M. de Charlus, had finally, having failed to observe any suspicious passer-by, entered the villa. A valet shewed him into the sitting-room, telling him that he would inform \u2018Monsieur\u2019 (his master had warned him not to utter the word \u2018Prince\u2019 for fear of arousing suspicions). But when Morel found himself alone, and went to the mirror to see that his forelock was not disarranged, he felt as though he were the victim of a hallucination. The photographs on the mantelpiece (which the violinist recognised, for he had seen them in M. de Charlus\u2019s room) of the Princesse de Guermantes, the Duchesse de Luxembourg, Mme. de Villeparisis, left him at first petrified with fright. At the same moment he caught sight of the photograph of M. de Charlus, which was placed a little behind the rest. The Baron seemed to be concentrating upon Morel a strange, fixed glare. Mad with terror, Morel, recovering from his first stupor, never doubting that this was a trap into which M. de Charlus had led him in order to put his fidelity to the test, sprang at one bound down the steps of the villa and set off along the road as fast as his legs would carry him, and when the Prince (thinking he had kept a casual acquaintance waiting sufficiently long, and not without asking himself whether it were quite prudent and whether the person might not be dangerous) entered the room, he found nobody there. In vain did he and his valet, afraid of burglary, and armed with revolvers, search the whole house, which was not large, every corner of the garden, the basement; the companion of whose presence he had been certain had completely vanished. He met him several times in the course of the week that followed. But on each occasion it was Morel, the dangerous person, who turned tail and fled, as though the Prince were more dangerous still. Confirmed in his suspicions, Morel never outgrew them, and even in Paris the sight of the Prince de Guermantes was enough to make him take to his heels. Whereby M. de Charlus was protected from a betrayal which filled him with despair, and avenged, without ever having imagined such a thing, still less how it came about\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But already my memories of what I have been told about all this are giving place to others, for the B. A. G., resuming its slow crawl, continues to set down or take up passengers at the following stations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Grattevast, where his sister lived with whom he had been spending the afternoon, there would sometimes appear M. Pierre de Verjus, Comte de Cr\u00e9cy (who was called simply the Comte de Cr\u00e9cy), a gentleman without means but of the highest nobility, whom I had come to know through the Cambremers, although he was by no means intimate with them. As he was reduced to an extremely modest, almost a penurious existence, I felt that a cigar, a \u2018drink\u2019 were things that gave him so much pleasure that I formed the habit, on the days when I could not see Albertine, of inviting him to Balbec. A man of great refinement, endowed with a marvellous power of self-expression, snow-white hair, and a pair of charming blue eyes, he generally spoke in a faint murmur, very delicately, of the comforts of life in a country house, which he had evidently known from experience, and also of pedigrees. On my inquiring what was the badge engraved on his ring, he told me with a modest smile: \u201cIt is a branch of verjuice.\u201d And he added with a relish, as though sipping a vintage: \u201cOur arms are a branch of verjuice \u2014 symbolic, since my name is Verjus \u2014 slipped and leaved vert.\u201d But I fancy that he would have been disappointed if at Balbec I had offered him nothing better to drink than verjuice. He liked the most expensive wines, because he had had to go without them, because of his profound knowledge of what he was going without, because he had a palate, perhaps also because he had an exorbitant thirst. And so when I invited him to dine at Balbec, he would order the meal with a refinement of skill, but ate a little too much, and drank copiously, made them warm the wines that needed warming, place those that needed cooling upon ice. Before dinner and after he would give the right date or number for a port or an old brandy, as he would have given the date of the creation of a marquisate which was not generally known but with which he was no less familiar\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I was in Airne\u2019s eyes a favoured customer, he was delighted that I should give these special dinners and would shout to the waiters: \u201cQuick, lay number 25\u201d; he did not even say \u2018lay\u2019 but \u2018lay me,\u2019 as though the table were for his own use. And, as the language of head waiters is not quite the same as of that of sub-heads, assistants, boys, and so forth, when the time came for me to ask for the bill he would say to the waiter who had served us, making a continuous, soothing gesture with the back of his hand, as though he were trying to calm a horse that was ready to take the bit in its teeth: \u201cDon\u2019t go too fast\u201d (in adding up the bill), \u201cgo gently, very gently.\u201d Then, as the waiter was retiring with this guidance, Aim\u00e9, fearing lest his recommendations might not be carried out to the letter, would call him back: \u201cHere, let me make it out.\u201d And as I told him not to bother: \u201cIt\u2019s one of my principles that we ought never, as the saying is, to sting a customer.\u201d As for the manager, since my guest was attired simply, always in the same clothes, which were rather threadbare (albeit nobody would so well have practised the art of dressing expensively, like one of Balzac\u2019s dandies, had he possessed the means), he confined himself, out of respect for me, to watching from a distance to see that everything was all right, and ordering, with a glance, a wedge to be placed under one leg of the table which was not steady. This was not to say that he was not qualified, though he concealed his early struggles, to lend a hand like anyone else. It required some exceptional circumstance nevertheless to induce him one day to carve the turkey-poults himself. I was out, but I heard afterwards that he carved them with a sacerdotal majesty, surrounded, at a respectful distance from the service-table, by a ring of waiters who were endeavouring thereby not so much to learn the art as to make themselves conspicuously visible, and stood gaping in open-mouthed admiration. Visible to the manager, for that matter (as he plunged a slow gaze into the flanks of his victims, and no more removed his eyes, filled with a sense of his exalted mission, from them than if he had been expected to read in them some augury), they were certainly not. The hierophant was not conscious of my absence even. When he heard of it, he was distressed: \u201cWhat, you didn\u2019t see me carving the turkey-poults myself?\u201d I replied that having failed, so far, to see Rome, Venice, Siena, the Prado, the Dresden gallery, the Indies, Sarah in Ph\u00e8dre, I had learned to resign myself, and that I would add his carving of turkey-poults to my list. The comparison with the dramatic art (Sarah in Ph\u00e8dre) was the only one that he seemed to understand, for he had already been told by me that on days of gala performances the elder Coque-lin had accepted a beginner\u2019s parts, even that of a character who says but a single line or nothing at all. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I am sorry for your sake. When shall I be carving again? It will need some great event, it will need a war.\u201d (It did, as a matter of fact, need the armistice.) From that day onwards, the calendar was changed, time was reckoned thus: \u201cThat was the day after the day I carved the turkeys myself.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right, a week after the manager carved the turkeys himself.\u201d And so this prosectomy furnished, like the Nativity of Christ or the Hegira, the starting point for a calendar different from the rest, but neither so extensively adopted nor so long observed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sadness of M. de Cr\u00e9cy\u2019s life was due, just as much as to his no longer keeping horses and a succulent table, to his mixing exclusively with people who were capable of supposing that Cambremers and Guermantes were one and the same thing. When he saw that I knew that Legrandin, who had now taken to calling himself Legrand de M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, had no sort of right to that name, being moreover heated by the wine that he was drinking, he broke out in a transport of joy. His sister said to me with an understanding air: \u201cMy brother is never so happy as when he has a chance of talking to you.\u201d He felt indeed that he was alive now that he had discovered somebody who knew the unimportance of the Cambremers and the greatness of the Guermantes, somebody for whom the social universe existed. So, after the burning of all the libraries on the face of the globe and the emergence of a race entirely unlettered, an old Latin scholar would recover his confidence in life if he heard somebody quoting a line of Horace. And so, if he never left the train without saying to me: \u201cWhen is our next little gathering?\u201d, it was not so much with the hunger of a parasite as with the gluttony of a savant, and because he regarded our symposia at Balbec as an opportunity for talking about subjects which were precious to him and of which he was never able to talk to anyone else, and analogous in that way to those dinners at which assemble on certain specified dates, round the particularly succulent board of the Union Club, the Society of Bibliophiles. He was extremely modest, so far as his own family was concerned, and it was not from M. de Cr\u00e9cy that I learned that it was a very great family indeed, and a genuine branch transplanted to France of the English family which bears the title of Crecy. When I learned that he was a true Cr\u00e9cy, I told him that one of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s nieces had married an American named Charles Crecy, and said that I did not suppose there was any connexion between them. \u201cNone,\u201d he said. \u201cAny more than \u2014 not, of course, that my family is so distinguished \u2014 heaps of Americans who call themselves Montgomery, Berry, Chandos or Capel have with the families of Pembroke, Buckingham or Essex, or with the Duc de Berry.\u201d I thought more than once of telling him, as a joke, that I knew Mme. Swann, who as a courtesan had been known at one time by the name Odette de Cr\u00e9cy; but even if the Duc d\u2019Alencon had shewn no resentment when people mentioned in front of him \u00c9milienne d\u2019Alencon, I did not feel that I was on sufficiently intimate terms with M. de Cr\u00e9cy to carry a joke so far. \u201cHe comes of a very great family,\u201d M. de Montsurvent said to me one day. \u201cHis family name is Saylor.\u201d And he went on to say that on the wall of his old castle above Incarville, which was now almost uninhabitable and which he, although born to a great fortune, was now too much impoverished to put in repair, was still to be read the old motto of the family. I thought this motto very fine, whether applied to the impatience of a predatory race niched in that eyrie from which its members must have swooped down in the past, or at the present day, to its contemplation of its own decline, awaiting the approach of death in that towering, grim retreat. It is, indeed, in this double sense that this motto plays upon the name Saylor, in the words: \u201cNe s\u00e7ais l\u2019heure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Hermenonville there would get in sometimes M. de Chevregny, whose name, Brichot told us, signified like that of Mgr. de Cabri\u00e8res, a place where goats assemble. He was related to the Cambremers, for which reason, and from a false idea of what was fashionable, the latter often invited him to F\u00e9terne, but only when they had no other guests to dazzle. Living all the year round at Beausoleil, M. de Chevregny had remained more provincial than they. And so when he went for a few weeks to Paris, there was not a moment to waste if he was to \u2018see everything\u2019 in the time; so much so that occasionally, a little dazed by the number of spectacles too rapidly digested, when he was asked if he had seen a particular play he would find that he was no longer sure. But this uncertainty was rare, for he had that detailed knowledge of Paris only to be found in people who seldom go there. He advised me which of the \u2018novelties\u2019 I ought to see (\u201cIt\u2019s worth your while\u201d), regarding them however solely from the point of view of the pleasant evening that they might help to spend, and so completely ignoring the aesthetic point of view as never to suspect that they might indeed constitute a \u2018novelty\u2019 occasionally in the history of art. So it was that, speaking of everything in the same tone, he told us: \u201cWe went once to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, but the show there is nothing much. It\u2019s called Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande. It\u2019s rubbish. P\u00e9rier always acts well, but it\u2019s better to see him in something else. At the Gymnase, on the other hand, they\u2019re doing La Ch\u00e2telaine. We went again to it twice; don\u2019t miss it, whatever you do, it\u2019s well worth seeing; besides, it\u2019s played to perfection; you have Fr\u00e9valles, Marie Magnier, Baron fils\u201d; and he went on to quote the names of actors of whom I had never heard, and without prefixing Monsieur, Madame or Mademoiselle, like the Duc de Guermantes, who used to speak in the same ceremoniously contemptuous tone of the \u2018songs of Mademoiselle Yvette Guilbert\u2019 and the \u2018experiments of Monsieur Charcot.\u2019 This was not M. de Chevregny\u2019s way, he said \u201cCornaglia and Dehelly,\u201d as he might have said \u201cVoltaire and Montesquieu.\u201d For in him, with regard to actors as to everything that was Parisian, the aristocrat\u2019s desire to shew his scorn was overcome by the desire to appear on familiar terms of the provincial\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Immediately after the first dinner-party that I had attended at la Raspeli\u00e8re with what was still called at F\u00e9terne \u2018the young couple,\u2019 albeit M. and Mme. de Cambremer were no longer, by any means, in their first youth, the old Marquise had written me one of those letters which one can pick out by their handwriting from among a thousand. She said to me: \u201cBring your delicious \u2014 charming \u2014 nice cousin. It will be a delight, a pleasure,\u201d always avoiding, and with such unerring dexterity, the sequence that the recipient of her letter would naturally have expected, that I finally changed my mind as to the nature of these diminuendoes, decided that they were deliberate, and found in them the same corruption of taste \u2014 transposed into the social key \u2014 that drove Sainte-Beuve to upset all the normal relations between words, to alter any expression that was at all conventional. Two methods, taught probably by different masters, came into conflict in this epistolary style, the second making Mme. de Cambremer redeem the monotony of her multiple adjectives by employing them in a descending scale, by avoiding an ending upon the perfect chord. On the other hand, I was inclined to see in these inverse gradations, not an additional refinement, as when they were the handiwork of the Dowager Marquise, but an additional clumsiness whenever they were employed by the Marquis her son or by his lady cousins. For throughout the family, to quite a remote degree of kinship and in admiring imitation of aunt Z\u00e9lia, the rule of the three adjectives was held in great honour, as was a certain enthusiastic way of catching your breath when you were talking. An imitation that had passed into the blood, moreover; and whenever, in the family circle, a little girl, while still in the nursery, stopped short while she was talking to swallow her saliva, her parents would say: \u201cShe takes after aunt Z\u00e9lia,\u201d would feel that as she grew up, her upper lip would soon tend to hide itself beneath a faint moustache, and would make up their minds to cultivate her inherited talent for music. It was not long before the Cambremers were on less friendly terms with Mme. Verdurin than with myself, for different reasons. They felt, they must invite her to dine. The \u2018young\u2019 Marquise said to me contemptuously: \u201cI don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t invite that woman, in the country one meets anybody, it needn\u2019t involve one in anything.\u201d But being at heart considerably impressed, they never ceased to consult me as to the way in which they should carry out their desire to be polite. I thought that as they had invited Albertine and myself to dine with some friends of Saint-Loup, smart people of the neighbourhood, who owned the ch\u00e2teau of Gourville, and represented a little more than the cream of Norman society, for which Mme. Verdurin, while pretending never to look at it, thirsted, I advised the Cambremers to invite the Mistress to meet them. But the lord and lady of F\u00e9terne, in their fear (so timorous were they) of offending their noble friends, or (so simple were they) that M. and Mme. Verdurin might be bored by people who were not intellectual, or yet again (since they were impregnated with a spirit of routine which experience had not fertilised) of mixing different kinds of people, and making a social blunder, declared that it would not be a success, and that it would be much better to keep Mme. Verdurin (whom they would invite with all her little group) for another evening. For this coming evening \u2014 the smart one, to meet Saint-Loup\u2019s friends \u2014 they invited nobody from the little nucleus but Morel, in order that M. de Charlus might indirectly be informed of the brilliant people whom they had in their house, and also that the musician might help them to entertain their guests, for he was to be asked to bring his violin. They threw in Cottard as well, because M. de Cambremer declared that he had \u2018a go\u2019 about him, and would be a success at the dinner-table; besides, it might turn out useful to be on friendly terms with a doctor, if they should ever have anybody ill in the house. But they invited him by himself, so as not to \u2018start any complications with the wife.\u2019 Mme. Verdurin was furious when she heard that two members of the little group had been invited without herself to dine at F\u00e9terne \u2018quite quietly.\u2019 She dictated to the doctor, whose first impulse had been to accept, a stiff reply in which he said: \u201cWe are dining that evening with Mme. Verdurin,\u201d a plural which was to teach the Cambremers a lesson, and to shew them that he was not detachable from Mme. Cottard. As for Morel, Mme. Verdurin had no need to outline a course of impolite behaviour for him, he found one of his own accord, for the following reason. If he preserved, with regard to M. de Charlus, in so far as his pleasures were concerned, an independence which distressed the Baron, we have seen that the latter\u2019s influence was making itself felt more and more in other regions, and that he had for instance enlarged the young virtuoso\u2019s knowledge of music and purified his style. But it was still, at this point in our story, at least, only an influence. At the same time there was one subject upon which anything that M. de Charlus might say was blindly accepted and put into practice by Morel. Blindly and foolishly, for not only were M. de Charlus\u2019s instructions false, but, even had they been justifiable in the case of a great gentleman, when applied literally by Morel they became grotesque. The subject as to which Morel was becoming so credulous and obeyed his master with such docility was that of social distinction. The violinist, who, before making M. de Charlus\u2019s acquaintance, had had no conception of society, had taken literally the brief and arrogant sketch of it that the Baron had outlined for him. \u201cThere are a certain number of outstanding families,\u201d M. de Charlus had told him, \u201cfirst and foremost the Guermantes, who claim fourteen alliances with the House of France, which is flattering to the House of France if anything, for it was to Aldonce de Guermantes and not to Louis the Fat, his consanguineous but younger brother, that the Throne of France should have passed. Under Louiv XIV, we \u2018draped\u2019 at the death of Monsieur, having the same grandmother as the king; a long way below the Guermantes, one may however mention the families of La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, descended from the Kings of Naples and the Counts of Poitiers; of d\u2019Uz\u00e8s, scarcely old as a family, but the premier peers; of Luynes, who are of entirely recent origin, but have distinguished themselves by good marriages; of Choiseul, Harcourt, La Rochefoucauld. Add to these the family of the Noailles (notwithstanding the Comte de Toulouse), Montesquieu and Castellane, and, I think I am right in saying, those are all. As for all the little people who call themselves Marquis de Cambremerde or de Vatefairefiche, there is no difference between them and the humblest private in your regiment. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you go and p \u2014-at Comtesse S\u2014 t\u2019s or s \u2014 t at Baronne P\u2014\u2018s, it\u2019s exactly the same, you will have compromised yourself and have used a dirty rag instead of toilet paper. Which is not nice.\u201d Morel had piously taken in this history lesson, which was perhaps a trifle cursory, and looked upon these matters as though he were himself a Guermantes and hoped that he might some day have an opportunity of meeting the false La Tour d\u2019Auvergnes in order to let them see, by the contemptuous way in which he shook hands, that he did not take them very seriously. As for the Cambremers, here was his very chance to prove to them that they were no better than \u2018the humblest private in his regiment.\u2019 He did not answer their invitation, and on the evening of the dinner declined at the last moment by telegram, as pleased with himself as if he had behaved like a Prince of Blood. It must be added here that it is impossible to imagine how intolerable and interfering M. de Charlus could be, in a more general fashion, and even, he who was so clever, how stupid, on all occasions when the flaws in his character came into play. We may say indeed that these flaws are like an intermittent malady of the mind. Who has not observed the fact among women, and even among men, endowed with remarkable intelligence but afflicted with nerves, when they are happy, calm, satisfied with their surroundings, we cannot help admiring their precious gifts, the words that fall from their lips are the literal truth. A touch of headache, the slightest injury to their self-esteem is enough to alter everything. The luminous intelligence, become abrupt, convulsive and narrow, reflects nothing but an irritated, suspicious, teasing self, doing everything that it can to give trouble. The Cambremers were extremely angry; and in the interval other incidents brought about a certain tension in their relations with the little clan. As we were returning, the Cottards, Charlus, Brichot, Morel and I, from a dinner at la Raspeli\u00e8re, one evening after the Cambremers who had been to luncheon with friends at Harambouville had accompanied us for part of our outward journey: \u201cYou who are so fond of Balzac, and can find examples of him in the society of to-day,\u201d I had remarked to M. de Charlus, \u201cyou must feel that those Cambremers come straight out of the Sc\u00e8nes de la Vie de Province.\u201d But M. de Charlus, for all the world as though he had been their friend, and I had offended him by my remark, at once cut me short: \u201cYou say that because the wife is superior to the husband,\u201d he informed me in a dry tone. \u201cOh, I wasn\u2019t suggesting that she was the Muse du d\u00e9partement, or Mme. de Bargeton, although. . . . \u201d M. de Charlus again interrupted me: \u201cSay rather, Mme. de Mortsauf.\u201d The train stopped and Brichot got out. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see us making signs to you? You are incorrigible.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWhy, have you never noticed that Brichot is madly in love with Mme. de Cambremer?\u201d I could see from the attitude of Cottard and Charlie that there was not a shadow of doubt about this in the little nucleus. I felt that it shewed a trace of malice on their part. \u201cWhat, you never noticed how distressed he became when you mentioned her,\u201d went on M. de Charlus, who liked to shew that he had experience of women, and used to speak of the sentiment which they inspire with a natural air and as though this were the sentiment which he himself habitually felt. But a certain equivocally paternal tone in addressing all young men \u2014 notwithstanding his exclusive affection for Morel \u2014 gave the lie to the views of a woman-loving man which he expressed. \u201cOh! These children,\u201d he said in a shrill, mincing, sing-song voice, \u201cone has to teach them everything, they are as innocent as a newborn babe, they can\u2019t even tell when a man is in love with a woman. I wasn\u2019t such a chicken at your age,\u201d he added, for he liked to use the expressions of the underworld, perhaps because they appealed to him, perhaps so as not to appear, by avoiding them, to admit that he consorted with people whose current vocabulary they were. A few days later, I was obliged to yield to the force of evidence, and admit that Brichot was enamoured of the Marquise. Unfortunately he accepted several invitations to luncheon with her. Mme. Verdurin decided that it was time to put a stop to these proceedings. Quite apart from the importance of such an intervention to her policy in controlling the little nucleus, explanations of this sort and the dramas to which they gave rise caused her an ever increasing delight which idleness breeds just as much in the middle classes as in the aristocracy. It was a day of great emotion at la Raspeli\u00e8re when Mme. Verdurin was seen to disappear for a whole hour with Brichot, whom (it was known) she proceeded to inform that Mme. de Cambremer was laughing at him, that he was the joke of her drawing-room, that he would end his days in disgrace, having forfeited his position in the teaching world. She went so far as to refer in touching terms to the laundress with whom he was living in Paris, and to their little girl. She won the day, Brichot ceased to go to F\u00e9terne, but his grief was such that for two days it was thought that he would lose his sight altogether, while in any case his malady increased at a bound and held the ground it had won. In the meantime, the Cambremers, who were furious with Morel, invited M. de Charlus on one occasion, deliberately, without him. Receiving no reply from the Baron, they began to fear that they had committed a blunder, and, deciding that malice made an evil counsellor, wrote, a little late in the day, to Morel, an ineptitude which made M. de Charlus smile, as it proved to him the extent of his power. \u201cYou shall answer for us both that I accept,\u201d he said to Morel. When the evening of the dinner came, the party assembled in the great drawing-room of F\u00e9terne. In reality, the Cambremers were giving this dinner for those fine flowers of fashion M. and Mme. F\u00e9r\u00e9. But they were so much afraid of displeasing M. de Charlus, that although she had got to know the F\u00e9r\u00e9s through M. de Chevregny, Mme. de Cambremer went into a fever when, on the afternoon before the dinner, she saw him arrive to pay a call on them at F\u00e9terne. She made every imaginable excuse for sending him back to Beausoleil as quickly as possible, not so quickly, however, that he did not pass, in the courtyard, the F\u00e9r\u00e9s, who were as shocked to see him dismissed like this as he himself was ashamed. But, whatever happened, the Cambremers wished to spare M. de Charlus the sight of M. de Chevregny, whom they judged to be provincial because of certain little points which are overlooked in the family circle and become important only in the presence of strangers, who are the last people in the world to notice them. But we do not like to display to them relatives who have remained at the stage which we ourselves have struggled to outgrow. As for M. and Mme. F\u00e9r\u00e9, they were, in the highest sense of the words, what are called \u2018really nice people.\u2019 In the eyes of those who so defined them, no doubt the Guermantes, the Rohans and many others were also really nice people, but their name made it unnecessary to say so. As everybody was not aware of the exalted birth of Mme. F\u00e9r\u00e9\u2018s mother, and the extraordinarily exelusive circle in which she and her husband moved, when you mentioned their name, you invariably added by way of explanation that they were \u2018the very best sort.\u2019 Did their obscure name prompt them to a sort of haughty reserve? However that may be, the fact remains that the F\u00e9r\u00e9s refused to know people on whom a La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle would have called. It needed the position of queen of her particular stretch of coast, which the old Marquise de Cambremer held in the Manche, to make the F\u00e9r\u00e9s consent to come to one of her afternoons every year. The Cambremers had invited them to dinner and were counting largely on the effect that would be made on them by M. de Charlus. It was discreetly announced that he was to be one of the party. As it happened, Mme. F\u00e9r\u00e9 had never met him. Mme. de Cambremer, on learning this, felt a keen satisfaction, and the smile of the chemist who is about to bring into contact for the first time two particularly important bodies hovered over her face. The door opened, and Mme. de Cambremer almost fainted when she saw Morel enter the room alone. Like a private secretary charged with apologies for his Minister, like a morganatic wife vho expresses the Prince\u2019s regret that he is unwell (so Mme. de Clinchamp used to apologise for the Duc d\u2019Aumale), Morel said in the airiest of tones: \u201cThe Baron can\u2019t come. He is not feeling very well, at least I think that is why, I haven\u2019t seen him this week,\u201d he added, these last words completing the despair of Mme. de Cambremer, who had told M. and Mme. F\u00e9r\u00e9 that Morel saw M. de Charlus at every hour of the day. The Cambremers pretended that the Baron\u2019s absence gave an additional attraction to their party, and without letting Morel hear them, said to their other guests: \u201cWe can do very well without him, can\u2019t we, it will be all the better.\u201d But they were furious, suspected a plot hatched by Mme. Verdurin, and, tit for tat, when she invited them again to la Raspeli\u00e8re, M. de Cambremer, unable to resist the pleasure of seeing his house again and of mingling with the little group, came, but came alone, saying that the Marquise was so sorry, but her doctor had ordered her to stay in her room. The Cambremers hoped by this partial attendance at once to teach M. de Charlus a lesson, and to shew the Verdurins that they were not obliged to treat them with more than a limited politeness, as Princesses of the Blood used in the old days to \u2018shew out\u2019 Duchesses, but only to the middle of the second saloon. After a few weeks, they were scarcely on speaking terms. M. de Cambremer explained this to me as follows: \u201cI must tell you that with M. de Charlus it was rather difficult. He is an extreme Dreyfusard. . . . \u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d \u201cYes. . . . Anyhow his cousin the Prince de Guermantes is, they\u2019ve come in for a lot of abuse over that. I have some relatives who are very particular about that sort of thing. I can\u2019t afford to mix with those people, I should quarrel with the whole of my family.\u201d \u201cSince the Prince de Guermantes is a Dreyfusard, that will make it all the easier,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cfor Saint-Loup, who is said to be going to marry his niece, is one too. Indeed, that is perhaps why he is marrying her.\u201d \u201cCome now, my dear, you mustn\u2019t say that Saint-Loup, who is a great friend of ours, is a Dreyfusard. One ought not to make such allegations lightly,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cYou would make him highly popular in the army!\u201d \u201cHe was once, but he isn\u2019t any longer,\u201d I explained to M. de Cambremer. \u201cAs for his marrying Mlle, de Guermantes-Brassac, is there any truth in that?\u201d \u201cPeople are talking of nothing else, but you should be in a position to know.\u201d \u201cBut I repeat that he told me himself, he was a Dreyfusard,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer. \u201cNot that there isn\u2019t every excuse for him, the Guermantes are half German.\u201d \u201cThe Guermantes in the Rue de Varenne, you can say, are entirely German,\u201d said Cancan. \u201cBut Saint-Loup is a different matter altogether; he may have any amount of German blood, his father insisted upon maintaining his title as a great nobleman of France, he rejoined the service in 1871 and was killed in the war in the most gallant fashion. I may take rather a strong line about these matters, but it doesn\u2019t do to exaggerate either one way or the other. In medio . . . virtus, ah, I forget the exact words. It\u2019s a remark Doctor Cottard made. Now, there\u2019s a man who can always say the appropriate thing. You ought to have a small Larousse in the house.\u201d To avoid having to give an opinion as to the Latin quotation, and to get away from the subject of Saint-Loup, as to whom her husband seemed to think that she was wanting in tact, Mme. de Cambremer fell back upon the Mistress whose quarrel with them was even more in need of an explanation. \u201cWe were delighted to let la Raspeli\u00e8re to Mme, Verdurin,\u201d said the Marquise. \u201cThe only trouble is, she appears to imagine that with the house, and everything else that she has managed to tack on to it, the use of the meadow, the old hangings, all sorts of things which weren\u2019t in the lease at all, she should also be entitled to make friends with us. The two things are entirely distinct. Our mistake lay in our not having done everything quite simply through a lawyer or an agency. At F\u00e9terne it doesn\u2019t matter, but I can just imagine the face my aunt de Ch\u2019nouville would make if she saw old mother Verdurin come marching in, on one of my days, with her hair streaming. As for M. de Charlus, of course, he knows some quite nice people, but he knows some very nasty people too.\u201d I asked for details. Driven into a corner, Mme. de Cambremer finally admitted: \u201cPeople say that it was he who maintained a certain Monsieur Moreau, Morille, Morue, I don\u2019t remember. Nothing to do, of course, with Morel, the violinist,\u201d she added, blushing. \u201cWhen I realised that Mme. Verdurin imagined that because she was our tenant in the Manche, she would have the right to come and call upon me in Paris, I saw that it was time to cut the cable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding this quarrel with the Mistress, the Cambremers were on quite good terms with the faithful, and would readily get into our carriage when they were travelling by the train. Just before we reached Douville, Albertine, taking out her mirror for the last time, would sometimes feel obliged to change her gloves, or to take off her hat for a moment, and, with the tortoiseshell comb which I had given her and which she wore in her hair, would smooth the plaits, pull out the puffs, and if necessary, over the undulations which descended in regular valleys to the nape of her neck, push up her chignon. Once we were in the carriages which had come to meet us, we no longer had any idea where we were; the roads were not lighted; we could tell by the louder sound of the wheels that we were passing through a village, we thought we had arrived, we found ourselves once more in the open country, we heard bells in the distance, we forgot that we were in evening dress, and had almost fallen asleep when, at the end of this wide borderland of darkness which, what with the distance we had travelled and the incidents characteristic of all railway journeys, seemed to have carried us on to a late hour of the night and almost half way back to Paris, suddenly after the crunching of the carriage wheels over a finer gravel had revealed to us that we had turned into the park, there burst forth, reintroducing us into a social existence, the dazzling lights of the drawing-room, then of the dining-room where we were suddenly taken aback by hearing eight o\u2019clock strike, that hour which we supposed to have so long since passed, while the endless dishes and vintage wines followed one another round men in black and women with bare arms, at a dinner-party ablaze with light like any real dinner-party, surrounded only, and thereby changing its character, by the double veil, sombre and strange, that was woven for it, with a sacrifice of their first solemnity to this social purpose, by the nocturnal, rural, seaside hours of the journey there and back. The latter indeed obliged us to leave the radiant and soon forgotten splendour of the lighted drawing-room for the carriages in which I arranged to sit beside Albertine so that my mistress might not be left with other people in my absence, and often for another reason as well, which was that we could both do many things in a dark carriage, in which the jolts of the downward drive would moreover give us an excuse, should a sudden ray of light fall upon us, for clinging to one another. When M. de Cambremer was still on visiting terms with the Verdurins, he would ask me: \u201cYou don\u2019t think that this fog will bring on your choking fits? My sister was terribly bad this morning. Ah! You have been having them too,\u201d he said with satisfaction. \u201cI shall tell her that to-night. I know that, as soon as I get home, the first thing she will ask will be whether you have had any lately.\u201d He spoke to me of my sufferings only to lead up to his sister\u2019s, and made me describe mine in detail simply that he might point out the difference between them and hers. But notwithstanding these differences, as he felt that his sister\u2019s choking fits entitled him to speak with authority, he could not believe that what \u2018succeeded\u2019 with hers was not indicated as a cure for mine, and it irritated him that I would not try these remedies, for if there is one thing more difficult than submitting oneself to a regime it is refraining from imposing it upon other people. \u201cNot that I need speak, a mere outsider, when you are here before the areopagus, at the fountainhead of wisdom. What does Professor Cottard think about them?\u201d I saw his wife once again, as a matter of fact, because she had said that my \u2018cousin\u2019 had odd habits, and I wished to know what she meant by that. She denied having said it, but finally admitted that she had been speaking of a person whom she thought she had seen with my cousin. She did not know the person\u2019s name and said faintly that, if she was not mistaken, it was the wife of a banker, who was called Lina, Linette, Lisette, Lia, anyhow something like that. I felt that \u2018wife of a banker\u2019 was inserted merely to put me off the scent. I decided to ask Albertine whether this were true. But I preferred to speak to her with an air of knowledge rather than of curiosity. Besides Albertine would not have answered me at all, or would have answered me only with a \u2018no\u2019 of which the \u2018n\u2019 would have been too hesitating and the \u2018o\u2019 too emphatic. Albertine never related facts that were capable of injuring her, but always other facts which could be explained only by them, the truth being rather a current which flows from what people say to us, and which we apprehend, invisible as it may be, than the actual thing that they say. And so when I assured her that a woman whom she had known at Vichy had a bad reputation, she swore to me that this woman was not at all what I supposed, and had never attempted to make her do anything improper. But she added, another day, when I was speaking of my curiosity as to people of that sort, that the Vichy lady had a friend, whom she, Albertine, did not know, but whom the lady had \u2018promised to introduce to her.\u2019 That she should have promised her this, could only mean that Albertine wished it, or that the lady had known that by offering the introduction she would be giving her pleasure. But if I had pointed this out to Albertine, I should have appeared to be depending for my information upon her, I should have put an end to it at once, I should never have learned anything more, I should have ceased to make myself feared. Besides, we were at Balbec, the Vichy lady and her friend lived at Menton; the remoteness, the impossibility of the danger made short work of my suspicions. Often when M. de Cambremer hailed me from the station I had been with Albertine making the most of the darkness, and with all the more difficulty as she had been inclined to resist, fearing that it was not dark enough. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sure Cottard saw us, anyhow, if he didn\u2019t, he must have noticed how breathless we were from our voices, just when they were talking about your other kind of breathlessness,\u201d Albertine said to me when we arrived at the Douville station where we were to take the little train home. But this homeward, like the outward journey, if, by giving me a certain poetical feeling, it awakened in me the desire to travel, to lead a new life, and so made me decide to abandon any intention of marrying Albertine, and even to break off our relations finally, also, and by the very fact of their contradictory nature, made this bleach more easy. For, on the homeward journey just as much as on the other, at every station there joined us in the train or greeted us from the platform people whom we knew; the furtive pleasures of the imagination were outweighed by those other, continual pleasures of sociability which are so soothing, so soporific. Already, before the stations themselves, their names (which had suggested so many fancies to me since the day on which I first heard them, the evening on which I travelled down to Balbec with my grandmother), had grown human, had lost their strangeness since the evening when Brichot, at Albertine\u2019s request, had given us a more complete account of their etymology. I had been charmed by the \u2018flower\u2019 that ended certain names, such as Fiquefleur, Ronfleur, Fiers, Barfleur, Harfleur, etc., and amused by the.\u2018beef that comes at the end of Bricqueboeuf. But the flower vanished, and also the beef, when Brichot (and this he had told me on the first day in the train) informed us that fleur means a harbour (like fiord), and thatboeuf, in Norman budh, means a hut. As he cited a number of examples, what had appeared to me a particular instance became general, Bricqueboeuf took its place by the side of Elbeuf, and indeed in a name that was at first sight as individual as the place itself, like the name Pennedepie, in which the obscurities most impossible for the mind to elucidate seemed to me to have been amalgamated from time immemorial in a word as coarse, savoury and hard as a certain Norman cheese, I was disappointed to find the Gallic pen which means mountain and is as recognisable in Pennemarck as in the Apennines. As at each halt of the train I felt that we should have friendly hands to shake if not visitors to receive in our carriage, I said to Albertine: \u201cHurry up and ask Brichot about the names you want to know. You mentioned to me Mar-couville l\u2019Orgueilleuse.\u201d \u201cYes, I love that orgueil, it\u2019s a proud village,\u201d said Albertine. \u201cYou would find it,\u201d Brichot replied, \u201cprouder still if, instead of turning it into French or even adopting a low Latinity, as we find in the Cartulary of the Bishop of Bayeux, Marcouvilla superba, you were to take the older form, more akin to the Norman, Marculplinvilla superba, the village, the domain of Merculph. In almost all these names which end in ville, you might see still marshalled upon this coast, the phantoms of the rude Norman invaders. At Hermenonville, you had, standing by the carriage door, only our excellent Doctor, who, obviously, has nothing of the Nordic chief about him. But, by shutting your eyes, ypu might have seen the illustrious H\u00e9rimund (Herimundivilla). Although I can never understand why people choose those roads, between Loigny and Balbec-Plage, rather than the very picturesque roads that lead from Loigny to Old Balbec, Mme. Verdurin has perhaps taken you out that way in her carriage. If so, you have seen Incarville, or the village of Wiscar; and Tourville, before you come to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, is the village of Turold. And besides, there were not only the Normans. It seems that the Germans (Alemanni) came as far as here: Aumenancourt, Alemanicurtis \u2014 don\u2019t let us speak of it to that young officer I see there; he would be capable of refusing to visit his cousins there any more. There were also Saxons, as is proved by the springs of Sissonne\u201d (the goal of one of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s favourite excursions, and quite rightly), \u201cjust as in England you have Middlesex, Wessex. And what is inexplicable, it seems that the Goths, miserable wretches as they are said to have been, came as far as this, and even the Moors, for Mortagne comes from Mauretania. Their trace has remained at Gourville \u2014 Gothorunvilla. Some vestige of the Latins subsists also, Lagny (Latiniacum).\u201d \u201cWhat I should like to have is an explanation of Thorpehomme,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cI understand homme,\u201d he added, at which the sculptor and Cottard exchanged significant glances. \u201cBut Thorpe?\u201d \u201cHomme does not in the least mean what you are naturally led to suppose, Baron,\u201d replied Brichot, glancing maliciously at Cottard and the sculptor. \u201cHomme has nothing to do, in this instance, with the sex to which I am not indebted for my mother.Homme is holm which means a small island, etc. . . . As for Thorpe, or village, we find that in a hundred words with which I have already bored our young friend. Thus in Thorpehomme there is not the name of a Norman chief, but words of the Norman language. You see how the whole of this country has been Germanised.\u201d \u201cI think that is an exaggeration,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cYesterday I was at Orgeville.\u201d \u201cThis time I give you back the man I took from you in Thorpehomme, Baron. Without wishing to be pedantic, a Charter of Robert I gives us, for Orgeville, Otgervilla, the domain of Otger. All these names are those of ancient lords. Octeville la Venelle is a corruption of l\u2019Avenel. The Avenels were a family of repute in the middle ages. Bour-guenolles, where Mme. Verdurin took us the other day, used to be written Bourg de M\u00f4les, for that village belonged in the eleventh century to Baudoin de M\u00f4les, as also did la Chaise-Baudoin, but here we are at Donci\u00e8res.\u201d \u201cHeavens, look at all these subalterns trying to get in,\u201d said M. de Charlus with feigned alarm. \u201cI am thinking of you, for it doesn\u2019t affect me, I am getting out here.\u201d \u201cYou hear, Doctor?\u201d said Brichot. \u201cThe Baron is afraid of officers passing over his body. And yet they have every right to appear here in their strength, for Donci\u00e8res is precisely the same as Saint-Cyr, Dominus Cyriacus. There are plenty of names of towns in which Sanctus and Sancta are replaced by Dominus and Domina. Besides, this peaceful military town has sometimes a false air of Saint-Cyr, of Versailles, and even of Fontainebleau.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During these homeward (as on the outward) journeys I used to tell Albertine to put on her things, for I knew very well that at Aumenancourt, Donci\u00e8res, Epreville, Saint-Vast we should be receiving brief visits from friends. Nor did I at all object to these, when they took the form of (at Hermenonville \u2014 the domain of Herimund) a visit from M. de Chevregny, seizing the opportunity, when he had come down to meet other guests, of asking me to come over to luncheon next day at Beausoleil, or (at Donci\u00e8res) the sudden irruption of one of Saint-Loup\u2019s charming friends sent by him (if he himself was not free) to convey to me an invitation from Captain de Borodino, from the officers\u2019 mess at the Cocq-Hardi, or the serjeants\u2019 at the Faisan Dor\u00e9. If Saint-Loup often came in person, during the whole of the time that he was stationed there, I contrived, without attracting attention, to keep Albertine a prisoner under my own watch and ward, not that my vigilance was of any use. On one occasion however my watch was interrupted. When there was a long stop, Bloch, after greeting us, was making off at once to join his father, who, having just succeeded to his uncle\u2019s fortune, and having leased a country house by the name of La Commanderie, thought it befitting a country gentleman always to go about in a post chaise, with postilions in livery. Bloch begged me to accompany him to the carriage. \u201cBut make haste, for these quadrupeds are impatient, come, O man beloved of the gods, thou wilt give pleasure to my father.\u201d But I could not bear to leave Albertine in the train with Saint-Loup; they might, while my back was turned, get into conversation, go into another compartment, smile at one another, touch one another; my eyes, glued to Albertine, could not detach themselves from her so long as Saint-Loup was there. Now I could see quite well that Bloch, who had asked me, as a favour, to go and say how d\u2019ye do to his father, in the first place thought it not very polite of me to refuse when there was nothing to prevent me from doing so, the porters having told us that the train would remain for at least a quarter of an hour in the station, and almost all the passengers, without whom it would not start, having alighted; and, what was more, had not the least doubt that it was because quite decidedly \u2014 my conduct on this occasion furnished him with a definite proof of it \u2014 I was a snob. For he was well aware of the names of the people in whose company I was. In fact M. de Charlus had said to me, some time before this and without remembering or caring that the introduction had been made long ago: \u201cBut you must introduce your friend to me, you are shewing a want of respect for myself,\u201d and had talked to Bloch, who had seemed to please him immensely, so much so that he had gratified him with an: \u201cI hope to meet you again.\u201d \u201cThen it is irrevocable, you won\u2019t walk a hundred yards to say how d\u2019ye do to my father, who would be so pleased,\u201d Bloch said to me. I was sorry to appear to be wanting in good fellowship, and even more so for the reason for which Bloch supposed that I was wanting, and to feel that he imagined that I was not the same towards my middle class friends when I was with people of \u2018birth.\u2019 From that day he ceased to shew me the same friendly spirit and, what pained me more, had no longer the same regard for my character. But, in order to undeceive him as to the motive which made me remain in the carriage, I should have had to tell him something \u2014 to wit, that I was jealous of Albertine \u2014 which would have distressed me even more than letting him suppose that I was stupidly worldly. So it is that in theory we find that we ought always to explain ourselves frankly, to avoid misunderstandings. But very often life arranges these in such a way that, in order to dispel them, in the rare circumstances in which it might be possible to do so, we must reveal either \u2014 which was not the case here \u2014 something that would annoy our friend even more than the injustice that he imputes to us, or a secret the disclosure of which \u2014 and this was my predicament \u2014 appears to us even worse than the misunderstanding. Besides, even without my explaining to Bloch, since I could not, my reason for not going with him, if I had begged him not to be angry with me, I should only have increased his anger by shewing him that I had observed it. There was nothing to be done but to bow before the decree of fate which had willed that Albertine\u2019s presence should prevent me from accompanying him, and that he should suppose that it was on the contrary the presence of people of distinction, the only effect of which, had they been a hundred times more distinguished, would have been to make me devote my attention exclusively to Bloch and reserve all my civility for him. It is sufficient that accidentally, absurdly, an incident (in this case the juxtaposition of Albertine and Saint-Loup) be interposed between two destinies whose lines have been converging towards one another, for them to deviate, stretch farther and farther apart, and never converge again. And there are friendships more precious than Bloch\u2019s for myself which have been destroyed without the involuntary author of the offence having any opportunity to explain to the offended party what would no doubt have healed the injury to his self-esteem and called back his fugitive affection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Friendships more precious than Bloch\u2019s is not, for that matter, saying very much. He had all the faults that most annoyed me. It so happened that my affection for Albertine made them altogether intolerable. Thus in that brief moment in which I was talking to him, while keeping my eye on Robert, Bloch told me that he had been to luncheon with Mme. Bontemps and that everybody had spoken about me with the warmest praise until the \u2018decline of Helios.\u2019 \u201cGood,\u201d thought I, \u201cas Mme. Bontemps regards Bloch as a genius, the enthusiastic support that he must have given me will do more than anything that the others can have said, it will come round to Albertine. Any day now she is bound to learn, and I am surprised that her aunt has not repeated it to her already, that I am a \u2018superior person.\u2019\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Bloch went on, \u201ceverybody sang your praises. I alone preserved a silence as profound as though I had absorbed, in place of the repast (poor, as it happened) that was set before us, poppies, dear to the blessed brother of Thanatos and Lethe, the divine Hypnos, who enwraps in pleasant bonds the body and the tongue. It is not that I admire you less than the band of hungry dogs with whom I had been bidden to feed. But I admire you because I understand you, and they admire you without understanding you. To tell the truth, I admire you too much to speak of you thus in public, it would have seemed to me a profanation to praise aloud what I carry in the profoundest depths of my heart. In vain might they question me about you, a sacred Pudor, daughter of Kronion, made me remain mute.\u201d I had not the bad taste to appear annoyed, but this Pudor seemed to me akin \u2014 far more than to Kronion \u2014 to the modesty that prevents a critic who admires you from speaking of you because the secret temple in which you sit enthroned would be invaded by the mob of ignorant readers and journalists \u2014 to the modesty of the statesman who does not recommend you for a decoration because you would be lost in a crowd of people who are not your equals, to the modesty of the academician who refrains from voting for you in order to spare you the shame of being the colleague of X\u2014\u2014-who is devoid of talent, to the modesty in short, more respectable and at the same time more criminal, of the sons who implore us not to write about their dead father who abounded in merit, so that we shall not prolong his life and create a halo of glory round the poor deceased who would prefer that his name should be borne upon the lips of men to the wreaths, albeit laid there by pious hands, upon his tomb\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Bloch, while he distressed me by his inability to understand the reason that prevented me from going to speak to his father, had exasperated me by confessing that he had depreciated me at Mme. Bontemps\u2019s (I now understood why Albertine had never made any allusion to this luncheon-party and remained silent when I spoke to her of Bloch\u2019s affection for myself), the young Israelite had produced upon M. de Charlus an impression that was quite the opposite of annoyance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly Bloch now believed not only that I was unable to remain for a second out of the company of smart people, but that, jealous of the advances that they might make to him (M. de Charlus, for instance), I was trying to put a spoke in his wheel and to prevent him from making friends with them; but for his part the Baron regretted that he had not seen more of my friend. As was his habit, he took care not to betray this feeling. He began by asking me various questions about Bloch, but in so casual a tone, with an interest that seemed so assumed, that one would have thought he did not hear the answers. With an air of detachment, an intonation that expressed not merely indifference but complete distraction, and as though simply out of politeness to myself: \u201cHe looks intelligent, he said he wrote, has he any talent?\u201d I told M. de Charlus that it had been very kind of him to say that he hoped to see Bloch again. The Baron made not the slightest sign of having heard my remark, and as I repeated it four times without eliciting a reply, I began to wonder whether I had not been the dupe of an acoustic mirage when I thought I heard M. de Charlus utter those words. \u201cHe lives at Balbec?\u201d intoned the Baron, with an air so far from questioning that it is a nuisance that the written language does not possess a sign other than the mark of interrogation with which to end these speeches which are apparently so little interrogative. It is true that such a sign would scarcely serve for M. de Charlus. \u201cNo, they have taken a place near here, La Commanderie.\u201d Having learned what he wished to know, M. de Charlus pretended to feel a contempt for Bloch. \u201cHow appalling,\u201d he exclaimed, his voice resuming all its clarion strength. \u201cAll the places or properties called La Commanderie were built or owned by the Knights of the Order of Malta (of whom I am one), as the places called Temple or Cavalerie were by the Templars. That I should live at La Commanderie would be the most natural thing in the world. But a Jew! However, I am not surprised; it comes from a curious instinct for sacrilege, peculiar to that race. As soon as a Jew has enough money to buy a place in the country he always chooses one that is called Priory, Abbey, Minster, Chantry. I had some business once with a Jewish official, guess where he lived: at Pont-l\u2019Ev\u00eaque. When he came to grief, he had himself transferred to Brittany, to Pont-l\u2019Abb\u00e9. When they perform in Holy Week those indecent spectacles that are called \u2018the Passion,\u2019 half the audience are Jews, exulting in the thought that they are going to hang Christ a second time on the Cross, at least in effigy. At one of the Lamoureux concerts, I had a wealthy Jewish banker sitting next to me. They played the Boyhood of Christ by Berlioz, he was quite shocked. But he soon recovered his habitually blissful expression when he heard the Good Friday music. So your friend lives at the Commanderie, the wretch! What sadism! You shall shew me the way to it,\u201d he went on, resuming his air of indifference, \u201cso that I may go there one day and see how our former domains endure such a profanation. It is unfortunate, for he has good manners, he seems to have been well brought up. The next thing I shall hear will be that his address in Paris is Rue du Temple!\u201d M. de Charlus gave the impression, by these words, that he was seeking merely to find a fresh example in support of his theory; as a matter of fact he was aiming at two birds with one stone, his principal object being to find out Bloch\u2019s address. \u201cYou are quite right,\u201d put in Brichot, \u201cthe Rue du Temple used to be called Rue de la Chevalerie-du-Temple. And in that connexion will you allow me to make a remark, Baron?\u201d said the don. \u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d said M. de Charlus tartly, the proffered remark preventing him from obtaining his information. \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d replied Brichot in alarm. \u201cIt is with regard to the etymology of Balbec, about which they were asking me. The Rue du Temple was formerly known as the Rue Barre-du-Bac, because the Abbey of Bac in Normandy had its Bar of Justice there in Paris.\u201d M. de Charlus made no reply and looked as if he had not heard, which was one of his favourite forms of insolence. \u201cWhere does your friend live, in Paris? As three streets out of four take their name from a church or an abbey, there seems every chance of further sacrilege there. One can\u2019t prevent Jews from living in the Boulevard de la Madeleine, Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 or Place Saint-Augustin. So long as they do not carry their perfidy a stage farther, and pitch their tents in the Place du Parvis Notre-Dame, Quai de l\u2019Archev\u00each\u00e9, Rue Chanoinesse or Rue de l\u2019Avemaria, we must make allowance for their difficulties.\u201d We could not enlighten M. de Charlus, not being aware of Bloch\u2019s address at the time. But I knew that his father\u2019s office was in the Rue des Blancs-Manteaux. \u201cOh! Is not that the last word in perversity?\u201d exclaimed M. de Charlus, who appeared to find a profound satisfaction in his own cry of ironical indignation. \u201cRue des Blancs-Manteaux!\u201d he repeated, dwelling with emphasis upon each syllable and laughing as he spoke. \u201cWhat sacrilege! Imagine that these White Mantles polluted by M. Bloch were those of the mendicant brethren, styled Serfs of the Blessed Virgin, whom Saint Louis established there. And the street has always housed some religious Order. The profanation is all the more diabolical since within a stone\u2019s throw of the Rue des Blancs-Manteaux there is a street whose name escapes me, which is entirely conceded to the Jews, there are Hebrew characters over the shops, bakeries for unleavened bread, kosher butcheries, it is positively the Judengasse of Paris. That is where M. Bloch ought to reside. Of course,\u201d he went on in an emphatic, arrogant tone, suited to the discussion of aesthetic matters, and giving, by an unconscious strain of heredity, the air of an old musketeer of Louis XIII to his backward-tilted face, \u201cI take an interest in all that sort of thing only from the point of view of art. Politics are not in my line, and I cannot condemn wholesale, because Bloch belongs to it, a nation that numbers Spinoza among its illustrious sons. And I admire Rembrandt too much not to realise the beauty that can be derived from frequenting the synagogue. But after all a ghetto is all the finer, the more homogeneous and complete it is. You may be sure, moreover, so far are business instincts and avarice mingled in that race with sadism, that the proximity of the Hebraic street of which I was telling you, the convenience of having close at hand the fleshpots of Israel will have made your friend choose the Rue des Blancs-Manteaux. How curious it all is! It was there, by the way, that there lived a strange Jew who used to boil the Host, after which I think they boiled him, which is stranger still, since it seems to suggest that the body of a Jew can be equivalent to the Body of Our Lord. Perhaps it might be possible to arrange with your friend to take us to see the church of the White Mantles. Just think that it was there that they laid the body of Louis d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans after his assassination by Jean sans Peur, which unfortunately did not rid us of the Orl\u00e9ans. Personally, I have always been on the best of terms with my cousin the Duc de Chartres; still, after all, they are a race of usurpers who caused the assassination of Louis XVI and dethroned Charles X and Henri V. One can see where they get that from, when their ancestors include Monsieur, who was so styled doubtless because he was the most astounding old woman, and the Regent and the rest of them. What a family!\u201d This speech, anti-Jew or pro-Hebrew \u2014 according as one regards the outward meaning of its phrases or the intentions that they concealed \u2014 had been comically interrupted for me by a remark which Morel whispered to me, to the fury of M. de Charlus. Morel, who had not failed to notice the impression that Bloch had made, murmured his thanks in my ear for having \u2018given him the push,\u2019 adding cynically: \u201cHe wanted to stay, it\u2019s all jealousy, he would like to take my place. Just like a yid!\u201d \u201cWe might have taken advantage of this halt, which still continues, to ask your friend for some explanations of his ritual. Couldn\u2019t you fetch him back?\u201d M. de Charlus asked me, with the anxiety of uncertainty. \u201cNo, it\u2019s impossible, he has gone away in a carriage, and besides, he is vexed with me.\u201d \u201cThank you, thank you,\u201d Morel breathed. \u201cYour excuse is preposterous, one can always overtake a carriage, there is nothing to prevent your taking a motor-car,\u201d replied M. de Charlus, in the tone of a man accustomed to see everyone yield before him. But, observing my silence: \u201cWhat is this more or less imaginary carriage?\u201d he said to me insolently, and with a last ray of hope. \u201cIt is an open post chaise which must by this time have reached La Commanderie.\u201d Before the impossible, M. de Charlus resigned himself and made a show of jocularity. \u201cI can understand their recoiling from the idea of a new brougham. It might have swept them clean.\u201d At last we were warned that the train was about to start, and Saint-Loup left us. But this was the only day when by getting into our carriage he, unconsciously, caused me pain, when I thought for a moment of leaving him with Albertine in order to go with Bloch. The other times his presence did not torment me. For of her own accord Albertine, to save me from any uneasiness, would upon some pretext or other place herself in such, a position that she could not even unintentionally brush against Robert, almost too far away to have to hold out her hand to him, and turning her eyes away from him would plunge, as soon as he appeared, into ostentatious and almost affected conversation with any of the other passengers, continuing this make-believe until Saint-Loup had gone. So that the visits which he paid us at Donci\u00e8res, causing me no pain, no inconvenience even, were in no way discordant from the rest, all of which I found pleasing because they brought me so to speak the homage and invitation of this land. Already, as the summer drew to a close, on our journey from Balbec to Douville, when I saw in the distance the watering-place at Saint-Pierre des Ifs where, for a moment in the evening, the crest of the cliffs glittered rosy pink as the snow upon a mountain glows at sunset, it no longer recalled to my mind, I do not say the melancholy which the sight of its strange, sudden elevation had aroused in me on the first evening, when it filled me with such a longing to take the train back to Paris instead of going on to Balbec, but the spectacle that in the morning, Elstir had told me, might be enjoyed from there, at the hour before sunrise, when all the colours of the rainbow are refracted from the rocks, and when he had so often wakened the little boy who had served him, one year, as model, to paint him, nude, upon the sands. The name Saint-Pierre des Ifs announced to me merely that there would presently appear a strange, intelligent, painted man of fifty with whom I should be able to talk about Chateaubriand and Balzac. And now in the mists of evening, behind that cliff of Incarville, which had filled my mind with so many dreams in the past, what I saw, as though its old sandstone wall had become transparent, was the comfortable house of an uncle of M. de Cambremer in which I knew that I should always find a warm welcome if I did not wish to dine at la Raspeli\u00e8re or to return to Balbec. So that it was not merely the place-names of this district that had lost their initial mystery, but the places themselves. The names, already half-stripped of a mystery which etymology had replaced by reason, had now come down a stage farther still. On our homeward journeys, at Hermenonville, at Incarville, at Harambouville, as the train came to a standstill, we could make out shadowy forms which we did not at first identify, and which Brichot, who could see nothing at all, might perhaps have mistaken in the darkness for the phantoms of Herimund, Wiscar and Herimbald. But they came up to our carriage. It was merely M. de Cambremer, now completely out of touch with the Verdurins, who had come to see off his own guests and, as ambassador for his wife and mother, came to ask me whether I would not let him \u2018carry me off\u2019 to keep me for a few days at F\u00e9terne where I should find successively a lady of great musical talent, who would sing me the whole of Gluck, and a famous chess-player, with whom I could have some splendid games, which would not interfere with the fishing expeditions and yachting trips on the bay, nor even with the Verdurin dinner-parties, for which the Marquis gave me his word of honour that he would \u2018lend\u2019 me, sending me there and fetching me back again, for my greater convenience and also to make sure of my returning. \u201cBut I cannot believe that it is good for you to go so high up. I know my sister could never stand it. She would come back in a fine state! She is not at all well just now. Indeed, you have been as bad as that! To-morrow you won\u2019t be able to stand up!\u201d And he shook with laughter, not from malevolence but for the same reason which made him laugh whenever he saw a lame man hobbling along the street, or had to talk to a deaf person. \u201cAnd before this? What, you haven\u2019t had an attack for a fortnight. Do you know, that is simply marvellous. Really, you ought to come and stay at F\u00e9terne, you could talk about your attacks to my sister.\u201d At Incarville it was the Marquis de Montpeyroux who, not having been able to go to F\u00e9terne, for he had been away shooting, had come \u2018to meet the train\u2019 in top boots, with a pheasant\u2019s feather in his hat, to shake hands with the departing guests and at the same time with myself, bidding me expect, on the day of the week that would be most convenient to me, a visit from his son, whom he thanked me for inviting, adding that he would be very glad if I would make the boy read a little; or else M. de Cr\u00e9cy, come out to digest his dinner, he explained, smoking his pipe, accepting a cigar or indeed more than one, and saying to me: \u201cWell, you haven\u2019t named a day for our next Lucullus evening? We have nothing to discuss? Allow me to remind you that we left unsettled the question of the two families of Montgomery. We really must settle it. I am relying upon you.\u201d Others had come simply to buy newspapers. And many others came and chatted with us who, I have often suspected, were to be found upon the platform of the station nearest to their little mansion simply because they had nothing better to do than to converse for a moment with people of their acquaintance. A scene of social existence like any other, in fact, these halts on the little railway. The train itself appeared conscious of the part that had devolved upon it, had contracted a sort of human kindliness; patient, of a docile nature, it waited as long as they pleased for the stragglers, and even after it had started would stop to pick up those who signalled to it; they would then run after it panting, in which they resembled itself, but differed from it in that they were running to overtake it at full speed whereas it employed only a wise slowness. And so Hermenonville, Harambouville, Incarville no longer suggested to me even the rugged grandeurs of the Norman Conquest, not content with having entirely rid themselves of the unaccountable melancholy in which I had seen them steeped long ago in the moist evening air. Donci\u00e8res! To me, even after I had come to know it and had awakened from my dream, how much had long survived in that name of pleasantly glacial streets, lighted windows, succulent flesh of birds. Donci\u00e8res! Now it was nothing more than the station at which Morel joined the train, Egleville (Aquilae villa) that at which we generally found waiting for us Princess Sherbatoff, Maineville, the station at which Albertine left the train on fine evenings, when, if she was not too tired, she felt inclined to enjoy a moment more of my company, having, if she took a footpath, little if any farther to walk than if she had alighted at Parville (Paterni villa). Not only did I no longer feel the anxious dread of isolation which had gripped my heart the first evening, I had no longer any need to fear its reawakening, nor to feel myself a stranger or alone in this land productive not only of chestnut trees and tamarisks, but of friendships which from beginning to end of the journey formed a long chain, interrupted like that of the blue hills, hidden here and there in the anfractuosity of the rock or behind the lime trees of the avenue, but delegating at each stage an amiable gentleman who came to interrupt my course with a cordial handclasp, to prevent me from feeling it too long, to offer if need be to continue the journey with me. Another would be at the next station, so that the whistle of the little tram parted us from one friend only to enable us to meet others. Between the most isolated properties and the railway which skirted them almost at the pace of a person who is walking fast, the distance was so slight that at the moment when, from the platform, outside the waiting-room, their owners hailed us, we might almost have imagined that they were doing so from their own doorstep, from their bedroom window, as though the little departmental line had been merely a street in a country town and the isolated mansion-house the town residence of a family; and even at the few stations where no \u2018good evening\u2019 sounded, the silence had a nourishing and calming fulness, because I knew that it was formed from the slumber of friends who had gone to bed early in the neighbouring manor, where my arrival would have been greeted with joy if I had been obliged to arouse them to ask for some hospitable office. Not to mention that a sense of familiarity so fills up our time that we have not, after a few months, a free moment in a town where on our first arrival the day offered us the absolute disposal of all its twelve hours, if one of these had by any chance fallen vacant, it would no longer have occurred to me to devote it to visiting some church for the sake of which I had come to Bal-bec in the past, nor even to compare a scene painted by Elstir with the sketch that I had seen of it in his studio, but rather to go and play one more game of chess at M. F\u00e9r\u00e9\u2018s. It was indeed the degrading influence, as it was also the charm that this country round Balbec had had, that it should become for me in the true sense a friendly country; if its territorial distribution, its sowing, along the whole extent of the coast, with different forms of cultivation, gave of necessity to the visits which I paid to these different friends the form of a journey, they also reduced that journey to nothing more than the social amusement of a series of visits. The same place-names, so disturbing to me in the past that the mere Country House Year Book, when I turned over the chapter devoted to the Department of the Manche, caused me as keen an emotion as the railway time-table, had become so familiar to me that, in the time-table itself, I could have consulted the page headed: Balbec to Douville via Donci\u00e8res, with the same happy tranquillity as a directory of addresses. In. this too social valley, along the sides of which I felt assembled, whether visible or not, a numerous company of friends, the poetical cry of the evening was no longer that of the owl or frog, but the \u2018How goes it?\u2019 of M. de Criquetot or the \u2018Chaire!\u2019 of Brichot. Its atmosphere no longer aroused my anguish, and, charged with effluvia that were purely human, was easily breathable, indeed unduly soothing. The benefit that I did at least derive from it was that of looking at things only from a practical point of view. The idea of marrying Albertine appeared to me to be madnessEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/749459", "artist_names": "10,000 Maniacs", "full_title": "These Are

(Controversy) (Prince)\n(I wanna be your lover) (Partyup) (Controversy)\n\n[Verse 1: Prince]\nMy name is Prince and I am funky\nMy name is Prince the one and only\nI did not come to funk around\n'Tll I get your daughter I won't leave this town\nIn the beginning God made the sea\nBut on the seventh day he made me\nHe was tryin' to rest y'all when He heard the sound\nSound like a guitar cold gettin' down\nI tried to bust a high note, but I bust a string\nMy God was worried 'til he heard me sing\n\n[Chorus: Prince]\nMy name is Prince and I am funky\nMy name is Prince the one and only - hurt

you're seekin'?\nThe syncopated rhymes are at their peak\nWhen you jumped on my D.I.C.K\nThat's the one thing that I don't play\nThe jock strap was to big for u anyway\nYou're just a simpleton\nI'll bust you like a pimple, son\nMy star is to bright\nBoy, I'll sink you like the ship Poseidon Adventure\nYou're bumpin' dentures to be cocksure\nThere must be more coming from\nYour mouth than manure\nSo with a flow and a spray, I say hey\nYou must become a prince before you're king anyway\n(Do that, do that somebody)\n(Do that, do that somebody)\nIt's time I get ig-nig-nig-nig-nig-nig-n-ignorant\nDef be the beat that I'm rockin'\nYo so, come get a hit\nAnd put your thinking cap on\nYou've been forewarned\nI call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin'\nIn my cauldron. That means my nugget\nSometimes I'm rugged\nThe style I posses be havin'\nThe other brothers buggin' and this is for those who oppose\nAnd propose to overexpose disclose\nPose a threat to my brother\nLike any other man makin' a stand\nI'll be damned if I let you play this hand\nI'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked\nWhat do you expect you win when you're used to playing craps?\n(Do that, do that somebody)\nHell yeah, let's get this under the hmm\n(Do that, do that somebody)\n\nDamn, It's gettin' tricky\nI mean it's a sticky situation\nTo resurrect a groove with feeling\nAnd give it this much affection\nPassion flows and who knows\nWhat lurks in the gallows of my mind\nI put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow\n12 inches of non-stop soul\nI'm on a roll with P, and it's time for the show\nSo do that, do that somebody\nWave your hands in the air\nThis is a motherfucking party\nWhile you're laying back I'm on the attack paddywhack\nGive yourself a bone\nThis is my house and I'm prone\nTo layin' some chrome upside some motherfuckers dome\nAnd I'm out\n\n[Chorus: Prince]\nMy name is Prince and I am funky\nMy name is Prince the one and only\n\n[Outro: Prince]\nMy name is Prince\nMy name is Prince\nMy name is Prince\nMy name is Prince\nMy name is Prince\nMy name is Prince\nMy name is Prince\nMy name is Prince\nMy name is Prince\n\nYo Man!\nWhat?\nShe

underground hit\nMovin thangs, a local nigga made good\nI made a name off of making tapes for niggas in the hood\nAnd now, let me tell a little story\nAbout the places that I been to and the shit that I been through\nLike fightin' and shootouts and bangin and shit\nAll because a nigga made a hit, check it\n1991, it was double or nothing, not a nigga wit' hit\nThen we broke out with the fonky shit\nAbout bitches and niggas and gettin' drunk and off that bud\nI was doing the shit they hadn't heard of\nBut foolish was I to think that it wasn't no other cities like this\nAnd they didn't like this\nThat Compton was the home of a foot in yo' ass\nWhere you got blast, and now that's just a thing of the past\nLet me tell ya why firsthand\nWe did a show up in Oak-land and niggas was kickin up sand\nTo them bangin' ain't nothin' new, and slangin' ain't nothin' new\nAnd for every nigga we done shot, they done shot two\nStraight doin' locs since the sixties, before I was born\nFamilies of young niggas mourn\nSo I'm just letting you know\nThat if ya plan to take a trip to the Bay\nKeep your hand on your clip\nBecause Oakland (ha ha ha, is just like Compton)\nYeah, I'm telling y'all Oakland (ha ha ha, is just like Compton, fool)\n\n[Verse 2: DJ Quik]\nMoving on to St. Louis, where they country as fuck\nWith gold teeth in they mouth but they still know what's up\nWhere it's hot as a muthafucka, hot enough to make ya cuss\nThat's why I kept my ass on the bus\nBut later on when it cooled off we came down and met a couple of friends\nWho put us up on the St. Louis cap\nThe Smith Center, with Big Bob, Little Steve, Tojo, Biss and Rich\nAnd a couple of bitches\nThen they took us to a man named Gus in a store\nHe put us down with a herringbone and shoes galore\nThat's when I started thinking that this wasn't like home\nBut then they had to prove me wrong\n'Cause later that night after we did the show\nWe went back to the afterset, and wouldn't ya know\nYeah, Bloods and Crips start scrappin' and shootin' -- in Missouri?\nDamn, how could this happen?\n\nNow St. Louis (ha ha ha, is just like Compton)\nYeah y'all, St. Louis (ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton, nigga)\n\n[Verse 3: DJ Quik]\nI don't think they know, they too crazy for their own good\nThey need to stop watchin' that Colors and Boyz n the Hood\nToo busy claimin Sixties, tryin to be raw\nAnd never ever seen the 'Shaw\nBut now, back to the story that I'm tellin'\nWe packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin'\nWhen we arrived I saw red and blue sweatsuits\nWhen I'm thinkin' 'bout horse dookie, and cowboy boots\nI guess Texas ain't no different from the rest\nAnd San Antonio, was just waitin' to put us to the test\nAnd before it was over the shit got deep\nA nigga got shot in the face, and was dead in the street\nThen they came in the club thinkin' of scrappin'\nLittle did they know that we was packin'\nYeah, we was puttin' 'em down and scaring the rest, shit\nI even had to wear the bulletproof vest\nYou might also likeNow San Antonio (ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton)\nYeah, San Antonio (ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton, bitch)\n\n[Verse 4: DJ Quik]\nAfter about a month on the road\nWe came home and I can safely say\nThat L.A. is a much better place to stay\nHow could a bunch of niggas in a town like this\nHave such a big influence on niggas so far away?\nBut still my story ain't over 'cause I got one more to tell\nAnd the people of Colorado, they know it well\nIt was all in the news and if you don't remember\nI had this show I did in Denver\nWith a punk ass promoter in a bunk ass skating rink\nBitches was lovin it, but niggas was shovin and shit\nTo the front of the stage to throw their gang signs\nBut I'm getting paid so I didn't pay it no mind\nThen I poured out my brew onto their face and chest\nThen they start throwin' soda, and fuckin' up my Guess\nWhen it was over two niggas needed stitches\nGot cracked in they jaw for being punk ass bitches\n\nNow Denver (ha ha ha, is just like Compton)\nYeah, y'all Denver (ha ha ha, they wanna be like Compton, bitch)\nAnd you know that Oakland (ha ha ha, is just like Compton)\nYeah, y'all, St. Louis (ha ha ha ha, we made it just like Compton, fool)\nUh-huh, San Antonio (ha ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton)\nYeah, and Denver (ha ha ha, they wanna be like Compton, punk ass niggas)\nI thought ya knew (ha ha ha, yeah)Embed"}]
