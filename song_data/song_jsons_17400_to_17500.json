I take good care of you?\nNo no, I can't believe you're leaving me\n\n[Chorus]\nStay with me baby\nPlease, stay with me baby\nOoh, stay with me baby\nI can't go on\n[Verse 2]\nWho did you touch when you needed tenderness?\nI gave you so much\nAnd in return I found happiness\nBaby what did I do?\nMaybe, maybe I was too good, too good to you\nNo no, I can't believe you're leaving me\n\n[Chorus]\nStay with me baby\nOoh, stay with me baby\nOoh, please, please stay with me baby\n\n[Bridge]\nRemember you said you'd always gonna need me\nRemember you said you'd never ever leave me\nRemember, remember, I'm asking you, begging you, ooh, ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nStay with me baby\nPlease, please stay with me baby\nStay with me baby\nI can't go on\n\n[Outro]\nOoh stay with me baby\nI'm

times that are few\nAnd once I was happy\nWhen I had you\n\nBut days have come and gone\nSince you were here\nNights are twice as long\nWithout you near\nPictures on my mind\nStand out so clear\nNo matter where I am or what I do\nMy darling, all I see is you\n\nYou're there in every dream\nI ever dream\nThere at every place\nI've ever been\n\nEveryday I find\nYou're in my heart and on my mind\nI close my eyes, but I'm not blind\nI see you still\n\nAnd when I throw my arms out wide\nI find that you're not by my side\nBut one thing is for sure, until I do\nAll I see is you\n\nEveryday I find\nYou're in my heart and on my mind\nI close my eyes, but I'm not blind\nI see you still, oh\n\nI won't live again\nTill I'm with you\nOh darling, I won't love again\nUnless it's with you\nYou

WAYNE MANOR - SUNSET\n\nA beautiful, sprawling suburban estate at sunset.  Classic wrought-iron\ngates protect a winding driveway which snakes its way up through a\nneatly manicured lawn.\n\nINT. WAYNE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nALFRED PENNYWORTH, the Wayne family butler, fluffs up a cushion in the\nlarge, elegant living room.  A kind-looking man in his late forties\nwith dark moustache and hair, he epitomizes the proper British moor\ndomo, dressed in a morning coat and striped vest.\n\nAlfred turns, straightens up a pile of thick-looking papers on the\nliving room table.  He picks up the top one, looks at it critically,\nbut with satisfaction.\n\nINSERT SHOT - CAMPAIGN POSTER\n\nThe thick-looking papers are, in fact, political campaign posters.\nThey feature the face of a handsome, fortyish man, with the block\nlettered caption: DR. THOMAS WAYNE FOR CITY COUNCIL - A BETTER TOMORROW\nFOR GOTHAM.\nDR. WAYNE'S VOICE\nBruce?  Hurry up, son, we're going\nto be late.  Martha?\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nAlfred turns to look at DR. THOMAS WAYNE (the man on the poster) enters\nthe room.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nNow where's Martha?  Alfred, have\nyou seen Mrs. Wayne?\n\nALFRED\nI believe she was headed for Master\nBruce's laboratory. Sir.\n\nDr. Wayne checks his watch, exits, muttering.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nThat nymphomaniacal hamster of his\nmust have given birth again...\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\nDr. Wayne heads down the hallway towards a door.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nCome on, everybody, the movie starts\nin less than an hour.  Let's not\nkeep you next city councilman\nwaiting...\n\nINT. BRUCE'S LAB\n\nDr. Wayne opens the door.  The makeshift lab room has a large work\ntable crammed with beakers, test tubes, and other scientific equipment.\nBRUCE WYANE, aged ten, sits behind a microscope, peers down intently at\na specimen on a slide.  He does not look up as his father enters.\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(crossing)\nSon, whatever you're looking at\ncouldn't possible be as pretty as\nAudrey Hepburn, so...\n\nDr. Wayne puts his hand on Bruce's shoulder.  Incredibly enough - it\npasses right through it!  He recoils, shocked, reaches out to touch the\nbody's head.  His hand cuts right through the skull.  Giggling is\nHEARD, O.S.\n\nYoung Bruce stands behind the door with his mother, MARTHA, a beautiful\nwoman in her mid-thirties.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's called a \"holograph,\" dad.  Two\nInterconnecting laser beams...\n(pointing)\nThere and there.  Pretty neat, huh?\n\nDr. Wayne stares at the laser tubes, totally nonplussed.\n\nMARTHA\nWell, don't look at me.  My side\nof the family still can't figure out\nwhy it gets dark at night.  Ready to\ngo?\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(eyes narrowing)\nHow can I be sure you're the real\nthing?\n\nMartha kisses him warmly.  He looks back, impressed.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nSomewhat lifelike, I'll admit...\n\nMARTH\nThat's all?  Then hold on to your\nsocks, buster...\n\nShe kisses him again with passion.  Bruce turns away with the typical\nself-consciousness of a pre-adolescent.\n\nBRUCE\nOh, guy...\n\nHis parents break.  Dr. Wayne looks down at him.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nBruce, you may be the brightest ten\nyear old in Gotham City, or any-\nwhere else, for that matter.  But I\nfeel I ought to let you in on some-\nthing.\n(at Martha)\nThis - is definitely not a guy.\n\nINT. PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT\n\nA huge 35mm motion picture projector springs to life.\n\nINT. THEATER\n\nThe shifting colored rays of a projected film knife though the\nblackness of the theater.\n\nSCREEN VOICE\nSister, you make a beautiful nun.\n\nANGLE ON MOVIE SCREEN\n\nThe screen is filled by the face of AUDREY HEPBURN, dressed as a nun.\nWe are watched The Nun's Story, as are:\n\nANGLE ON WAYNE FAMILY IN SEATS\n\nDr. Wayne, Martha, and Bruce, who downs the remains of his box of Good\nand Plenty.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MOVIE THEATER & STREET - NIGHT\n\nRumblings of distant thunder echo through the night sky.  The Wayne\nfamily exits the theater, heads down a deserted street.  Suddenly - a\nflash of lightning.  A closer, louder clap of thunder.  Dr. Wayne takes\nMartha's arm.  Bruce straggles behind, staring at the pavement.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nI wish I hadn't parked so far away.\nWe're going to get soaked.\n\nMARTHA\n(over her shoulder)\nDo try and keep up, Bruce.  What on\nearth are you staring at, anyway?\n\nBRUCE\nThe cracks, Mom.  It's bad luck to\nstep on one.\n(does so)\nOh, darnit...\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nHold it, you people.  Freeze!\n\nA large man (JOE CHILL) partially hidden by shadows, points a gun at\nthem.  He stands in the sunken entrance to a deserted brownstone house,\ngestures with his weapon.\n\nCHILL\nGet down in here.  Now.\n\nMARTHA\n(terrified)\nThomas...\n\nDR. WAYNE\nYou're welcome to our money.  Any-\nthing we have.  Okay?\n\nChill stares coldly.  Dr. Wayne pulls out his money, takes off his\nwatch.  Martha and Bruce watch, petrified.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nHere...just be careful with that\ngun, will you?  It could go off...\n\nCHILL\nYou know something, Doc?  You're\nright.\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(expression changing)\nDoc?  How did you know I was a...\n\nThere is a deafening roar as Chill fires the gun, lifting Dr. Wayne off\nhis feet, hurling him backwards.\n\nBRUCE\nDaddy!!\n\nMartha screams.  A bolt of lightning flashes.  Chill turns.\n\nCHILL\nLet's have that necklace, lady...\n\nMARTHA\nOh, my God!\n\nMartha tries to escape but is jerked back by Chill's hand as it closes\non her necklace.  Bruce runs at Chill, grabs him by the leg, tries to\npull him down.\n\nBRUCE\nLeave my mommy alone!  Mommy!\nMommy!\n\nChill fires again!  The necklace snaps free as Martha is jerked\nbackwards, then crumples next to her husband.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nHe kneels over his mother's body, pauses in shock, then looks up: the\nbarrel of Chill's gun comes into frame.\n\nCLOSE ON CHILL\n\nThe necklace in one hand, his gun in the other.  He looks down at\nBruce, his expression suddenly changing.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHe stares at Chill, his jaw inadvertently twitching with rage.  A LOUD\nCLAP OF THUNDER rolls across the sky.  Bruce's eyes have become steel,\nvisible fury shooting forth from them in an almost demonic fashion.\n\nChill's gun hand suddenly starts to tremble.  Incredibly, the savage\nface of this young boy has unnerved him.\n\nCHILL\nStop...lookin' at me like that, kid...\n(no response)\nStop looking at me like that!\n\nSuddenly - A FLASH OF LIGHTNING!  Rain begins to fall in sheets.\nChill, runs up to the street, disappears into the rain-swept darkness.\n\nANGLE ON APARTMENT BUILDING\n\nLIGHTS have flicked on in the apartment building across the street.\nFACELESS WITNESSES stand silhouetted in the windows, gazing down at the\ntragedy across the street.\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN on one particular window.  A SHADOWY FIGURE half-\nemerges from the darkness, his face still hidden from us.  All that is\nvisible is an oversized pair of striped pants and a large white daisy\nstuck through the coat lapel.  The Shadowy Figure pauses, then reaches\nout an arm and slowly lowers the window shade.\n\nFrom behind the shade - an insane, maniacal giggle starts to rise.\nTiny at first, but gradually building to a sudden explosion of\ncascading, frightening glee!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nKneeling in the rain across the street, paralyzed with shock and grief.\nHe looks up from the bodies of his parents as a COUPLE approaches along\nthe pavement above.\n\nBRUCE'S VOICE\nHelp...oh, please help me...\n\nThe couple stop, stare down at the scene.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's...my mom and dad.  Please...I\nthink they're dead.\n\nThe couple exchange a quick, horrified glance, then hurry off down the\nstreet.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nSobbing uncontrollably now, tears mixing with the rain.  In the\ndistance: the low whine of an approaching siren.  CAMERA RISES into the\nnight sky:\n\nA FLASHING BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS ACROSS THE SCREEN: the residue\nremains in the night sky - a searing yellow dot.  ANOTHER BOLT OF\nLIGHTNING - another yellow dot.  Then a deafening clap of thunder as\nthe gray-black clouds arrange themselves into a dark and eerie\nsilhouette.  The siren grows louder, piercing shrilly through the\nrumblings of the storm.  The SILHOUETTE becomes more familiar now, as\nthe billowing clouds form themselves into a dark cape.  The dots of\nlightning begin to pulsate as they evolve into two searing yellow eyes.\n\nThis then, is the signal of the future presence of the Dark Redeemer of\nthe Night.  The Black Wraith.  The Avenger of Countless Wrongs...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t THE BATMAN\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE\nTHROUGH TO:\n\nEXT.

GOTHAM CITY - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT\n\nA hot sun showers a blazing glow on the throbbing metropolis of Gotham\nCity, choked with cars, buses, PEDESTRIANS, and the attendant\npollution.

CAMERA PANS UP from the front page to the\nhorrified face of a NEWS VENDOR, staring in disbelief at the person\nreading the Tribune.\n\nCLOSE ON JOKER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nWe see the hideous face of THE JOKER.  A revolting perversion of a\nhuman being with a chalk-white complexion, ruby red lips, and a\nstartling shock of green hair.  He continues to giggle as he reads.  A\nCONFEDERATE stands behind.  The Vendor continues to stare as The Joker\nsuddenly notices.\n\nJOKER\nSomething wrong?\n\nVENDOR\nYour...face.  It's...\n\nJOKER\nFamiliar?

His eyes are glassed over, but tears do not fall.\nHe crosses to Alfred who puts a protective arm around him.\n\nALFRED\nIt's unfair, of course.

JOKER'S LAIR - DAY\n\nA huge room, garishly decorated in a clown motif.  The wallpaper is one\ncontiguous deck of cards.  There are harlequin chairs, jesters, and\nopen Jack-In-The-Box, etc.\n\nA MAN sits in a chair at the end of the room, facing away from CAMERA.\nHe watches Thorne on a TV set.\n\nTHORNE\n(from TV)\nBut his murderer will be caught and\nexecuted, I promise you!

The Man in the chair swivels around\nslowly: It is JOE CHILL!\n\nThe Joker stands at the entrance to the room, lowers a remote control\nbox.  He grins at Chill.  Chill stares back nervously, clearly\nfrightened by The Joker's maniacal presence.\n\nCHILL\nI was...headed for the airport.\nThey said you wanted to see me.\nSomething...wrong?\n\nJOKER\nWrong?  I thought we'd celebrate.  I\nthought you'd like to join me in a\ndrink.\n\nCHILL\n(visibly relieved)\nWhy not...\n\nThe Joker leads him to a table, suddenly glowers darkly.\n\nJOKER\nYou know, I'm disappointed in you,\nJoe.  Very disappointed.\n\nCHILL\n(swallowing)\nYou...are?\n\nJOKER\nI said, \"Would you like to join me\nin a drink.\"  Then you're supposed\nto say, \"Sure there'll be room\nenough for both of us?\"\n(giggle)\nGet it?\n(louder giggle)\n\"Room enough...\"\n\nCHILL\nYeah...sure...I get it now...\n\nJOKER\nYou're a quick study, Joe.\n\nThe Joker claps him on the back as they sit at the table.  The\nConfederate enters with two glasses on a tray.  One contains a clear\nliquid.  The other - a bilious, thick yellow concoction.  The Joker\nedges it across the table toward Chill who eyes it suspiciously.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nDrink up.\n\nChill examines the yellow liquid, wary.\n\nCHILL\nHow come...you ain't drinkin' this...\n\nJOKER\nGood question.  I like lemonade...\n\nHe takes it from Chill, hands him the clear liquid.  They both down\ntheir drinks.

The corners of his mouth twitch, then rise involuntarily.\nHe snickers.  Again.  Starts to giggle.  The Joker's eyes narrow.  His\nsmile becomes cruel.\n\nJOKER\nThe doctor says, \"I can sure you.  The\ndisease is hereditary.\"  The patient\nsays, \"Then send the bill to my father.\"\n\nChill instantly explodes with laughter!\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nHe says, \"Help me, Doctor, I've got\namnesia.\"  Doctor says, \"How long\nhave you had it?\"  He says, \"How\nlong have I had what?\"\n\nChill is on his feet now, convulsed in glee.

He tries again, then drops to the floor in a\nheap.\n\nALFRED\nPerhaps if we lowered them.\n\nBRUCE\n(grim stare)\nIf you'll excuse me now, Alfred.\nI'll see you at dinner.\n\nALFRED\nYes, Sir.\n\nAlfred leaves, closing the door.  Bruce turns, glares up at the rings\nlike deadly enemies.  He jumps again, catches hold, starts to hoist\nhimself up, straining with the effort.  The veins standing out on his\nforehead.  Slowly, painfully, he begins to inch himself higher and\nhigher.\n\nINT KARATE STUDIO - DAY\n\nBruce is dressed in a martial arts outfit, tensely faces a thick pine\nboard being held by a Japanese INSTRUCTOR.\n\nINSTRUCTOR\n...but you must believe, really\nbelieve you can do it.

MOUNTAIN ROAD - SUNRISE\n\nA tree-lined winding road at dawn.  Bruce jogs along easily, his right\nhand encased in a plaster cast.

Alfred stands by the\nRolls Royce, checking his watch.  The spent Professor peels off to the\nside as Bruce continues on.\n\nBRUCE\nMerci, mon Professeur!  Tommorrow at\nSix again, okay?\n\nThe Professor manages a feeble wave, collapses by the side of the road\nin front of Alfred who administers a thermos of hot coffee and a\ncroissant to the stricken man.\n\nANGLE AROUND OTHER SIDE OF BEND.\n\nAnother jogger has joined Bruce around the bend - an older man, his\nbearded RUSSIAN PROFESSOR.\n\nBRUCE\nDobroye utro, Boris...I am happy...\n\nBORIS\nOchen priyatno...\n\nBRUCE\nOchen priyatno...To make your\nacquaintance.\n\nBORIS\nVam...poznakomit...\n\nThe two of them jog off into the distance.\n\nBORIS' VOICE\n(already winded)\nBozhe moy!...\n\nEXT.

EXERCISE ROOM - DAY\n\nBruce is on the rings again.  By now using them with considerable\nexpertise, swinging his body in somersaults, then performing the\ndifficult \"Iron Cross\" maneuver.  He pauses at full extension, then\nswings back, launches himself towards the parallel bars.\n\nCatching the bars expertly, he performs a complicated routine, pausing\nat the top to look across the room:\n\nA thin balance beam sits below, ten feet away.\n\nBruce swings back one more time on the upper parallel bar, then flies\nthrough the air for the beam!  His feet land on top for one split,\ntenuous second.  He teeters - then crashes heavily to the floor.\nShaking his head to clear the cobwebs, he stares back at the beam,\ndetermined.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nAlfred exits the rear of Wayne Manor onto the lawn, looks around,\nmystified.\n\nALFRED\nMaster Bruce?  Luncheon is served!\n\nAlfred hears a CUMBLING SOUND, looks up as a piece of brick falls,\nnarrowly missing him.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE - ALFRED'S P.O.V.\n\nBruce is scaling the side of the house!  A thick rope encircles the\nchimney of Wayne Manor as Bruce makes his way up the structure, hand\nover hand.  Suddenly:  the old brick chimney STARTS TO CRUMBLE!  The\nrope jerks free as bricks fly everywhere and Bruce tumbles heavily down\nto the lawn at Alfred'' feet.\n\nBruce looks up, grins sheepishly.  Alfred glances back up at the\ndemolished chimney, then back down at Bruce again.\n\nALFRED\nSanta will be heartbroken.\n\nINT. KARATE STUDIO - DAY\n\nA TERRIFYING SCREAM!  A PINE BOARD is smashed to smithereens by a\nlightning-quick fist!\n\nBruce wheels to FACE CAMERA.  HE IS NOW SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD.  Cool,\nclear eyes flick in the opposite direction as:\n\nTwo STUDENTS charge him!  He flips one over his head, flips the other\nwhile simultaneously spinning around to face the Instructor who closes\nranks from behind.\n\nThe fight is furiously expert - hands and feet working like windmills.\nBruce is parrying every thrust the\nInstructor has to offer, countering every move, but is nonetheless\nbeing backed into a corner.\n\nThe Instructor moves in for the kill as Bruce suddenly vaults up and\nover him in a seven-foot backflip!  Grabbing the man's black belt from\nbehind for leverage, he hoists the Instructor over his head, then sends\nthe bewildered man flying through the air, crashing onto the mat in a\nheap.\n\nBruce looks over, suddenly concerned.  He holds the Instructor's black\nbelt in his hands.  The Instructor is half-dazed, in some pain.  His\neyes suddenly pop open - he grins broadly back at Bruce.\n\nINSTRUCTOR\nThat's okay.  Keep it.\n\nINT. BALLET STUDIO - DAY\n\nA line of beautiful young would-be BALLERINAS perform the various\npositions at the bar in a dance studio to the musical strains of Swan\nLake.

We appeal to\nyou, Mr. Pennyworth, as the executor\nof this estate.\n\nALFRED\nIt was Dr. Wayne's intention for his\nson to achieve self-reliance at the\nearliest possible age.  With that in\nmind, I suggest you accept the lad's\n\"lucky guesses\" as instructions.\n\nBRUCE\nLet's hold on to our oil stocks for\nnow.  I see a chance of gasoline\nprices rising to sixty, even seventy\ncents a gallon.\n\nBROKER\n(tolerant smile)\nWhy not a dollar?\n\nBRUCE\nAnd I'd like to transfer our mutual\nfunds into the development of the\ncomputer chip.

EXERCISE ROOM - DAY\n\nCAMERA PANS past the balancing beam, parallel bars, and exercise rings\nto Bruce, who faces them confidently, but this time with a big\ndifference - HE IS BLINDFOLDED.  He takes a tentative step forward,\ngauging his distance, then leaps up into the air - grabbing the rings\nwith perfect accuracy!  He performs a series of difficult routines with\nclockwork precision, then swings through the air to the parallel bars,\nlatching on to the lower one, then propelling himself up to the higher\none.  His gyrations become faster, gaining speed and momentum.\nSuddenly - he launches himself toward the balance beam!\n\nBruce lands on the end of the beam like a cat - keeping his balance,\nhaving calculated the exact distance to the inch.  He steps forward\nwith total security, travels the length of the beam with the ease of a\npedestrian.  Reaching the end, he does a complete forward somersault,\nlands solidly on his feet.

A\ndisgruntled MARIO ANDRETTI elbows his way through the throng to shake\nhands with the winner.\n\nMARIO ANDRETTI\nHell of a race, Bruce.\n\nBRUCE\nThanks, Mario.\n\nANDRETTI\nRemember how you told me this was\njust a hobby?  Well keep it that way\nand let the rest of us make a\nliving, okay?\n\nMiss Gotham leans in, hugs Bruce tightly, giggles, then whispers\nsomething in his ear.

Millionaire playboy cleared in Miss\nGotham paternity suit.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM COURTHOUSE - DAY\n\nA throng a REPORTERS waits with a predominantly FEMALE CROWD at the\nentrance to Gotham Courthouse.\n\nBruce suddenly appears in the Courthouse doorway as a LOUD CHEER rises\nfrom the Female Crowd.  He elbows his way through them, Alfred at his\nside.  FLASHBULBS POP!  The Women scream and reach out at him, trying\nto tear off a souvenir.  REPORTERS yell overlapping questions.\n\nBRUCE\nSorry, no comment.  Sorry...\n\nALFRED\n(at hysterical Woman)\nMadame, do try to compose yourself...\n\nThey reach the sidewalk and the car.  Alfred heads for the front door\nas Bruce jostles his way inside the back.\n\nINT. ROLLS - DAY\n\nBruce slams the door shut behind him, turns, stops, stares:  Already\nsitting in the back seat is a beautiful FEMALE REPORTER, legs crossed,\nperfectly composed, with a portable tape recorder settled on her lap.\n\nREPORTER\nAnn Daniel.  Gotham Tribune.\n\nBRUCE\n(reaching for door handle)\nBruce Wayne.  Nice to have met you.\n\nHe tries the door - there's another scream from the Female Crowd who\npress around the car anticipating his exit.  Two ANGRY FEMINISTS raise\nprotesting placards threateningly as Bruce slams the door shut again.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\n(at Alfred)\nGo.\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nThe Rolls lurches its way out of the Crowd into traffic.\n\nINT. ROLLS - DAY\n\nBruce stares ahead in silence.  ANN studies him with a wry smile, then\npushes the \"record\" button on her machine.\n\nBRUCE\nAre you going to play some music?\n\nANN\nYou know what they say about Bruce\nWayne?\n(no response)\nThat he's idle and jaded, with no\nambition left - because there's\nnothing he hasn't done and been the\nbest at.\n\nBRUCE\nSounds like a pretty boring guy.\n\nANN\nWhat haven't you done, Mr. Wayne?\nCured cancer?  Climbed Everest?\n(no response)\nYou climbed Everest?\n\nBruce smiles, reaches out, punches off the recorder.\n\nANN (CONT'D)\nThat's...not much of an exclusive.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat did you have in mind?\n\nANN\nSomething slightly more...in depth.\n\nBRUCE\nSort of like - \"A Day in the Life\nof Bruce Wayne?\"\n\nANN\nExactly.  You just go ahead and do\nwhatever you'd be doing naturally -\nonly make me a part of it.\n\nBRUCE\nMiss Daniel - I'll do my level best\nto accommodate you.\n\nINT. ANN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA CLOSE on Ann's sleeping face as she lies naked in bed, her\nfeatures locked in a dreamy smile.  She sighs contentedly as HER OWN\nVOICE IS HEARD from across the room.\n\nANN'S VOICE\n...because there's nothing he hasn't\ndone and been the best at...\n\nBruce stands at the bedroom window, staring down absent-mindedly into\nthe street as he finishes dressing.  A LOUD CLAP OF THUNDER rolls\nacross the city.\n\nBRUCE'S VOICE\n(from tape)\nSounds like a pretty boring guy.\n\nBruce punches off the recorder, then presses \"rewind.\"  He looks over\nat Ann's sleeping body, then down at the recorder again.  He stops it,\nthen presses \"play.\"\n\nANN'S VOICE\n(from tape)\n...he's idle and jaded with no ambi-\ntion left...\n\nBruce smiles to himself bitterly, exits silently.\n\nEXT. APARTMENT STREET - NIGHT\n\nBruce crosses the street to a gleaming Aston-Martin sportscar.  ANOTHER\nTHUNDER CLAP!  Rain falls as he reaches into the car, takes out a\ntopcoat and hat.  He starts to pull the convertible top up, glances\ndown the street:\n\nPEOPLE scurry to avoid the rain.  Down the block, across the street, a\nCOUPLE with a YOUNG DAUGHTER look over nervously as a tough-looking\nBIKER on a huge Harley-Davidson rolls up parallel to them on the\nstreet.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nAdjusting the convertible top.  Looking off again.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE'S P.O.V.\n\nSuddenly:  the Biker hops the curb in front of the Family!  Pulling a\ngun, he herds them back into a dark alleyway.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nEyes narrowing.  His jaw twitches.  A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT!  Bruce\nexplodes across the street for the alleyway.\n\nAs Bruce arrives:  the Young Girl bursts out screaming, runs past him.\nBruce hesitates, then runs inside the alley.\n\nANGLE IN ALLEYWAY\n\nThe Man lies in the alley, being cradled by the Woman.  Blood oozes\nfrom the side of his head Bruce arrives.\n\nWOMAN\nI...think he'll be all right.  Our\ndaughter's run to call an ambulance.\n\nBruce hears the REVVING of a motorcycle.  He looks off down the alley,\neyes flashing with anger.\n\nANGLE DOWN ALLEY - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe Biker grins at him from the far end of the alley, puts his Harley\nin gear, rolls off through the pouring rain.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHe makes his decision, takes off in pursuit.\n\nWOMAN\nCareful!  He's got a gun!\n\nEXT. END OF ALLEYWAY\n\nBruce arrives at the alley corner, looks off:\n\nANGLE ON BIKER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe Biker hovers by the side of an apartment building, still grinning\nat Bruce through the rain.  He rolls forward slowly, almost as if\nenticing Bruce to follow him, now disappears again.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce arrives at the rear of the building, which faces on a vacant dirt\nlot.  He edges forward through the mud, turning the corner, suddenly\ncoming face to face with:\n\nThe Biker.  Still grinning.  Switching off his Harley.  Muscles bulging\nthrough his wet T-shirt as he dismounts.\n\nBIKER\nCongratulations, man.\n(wide smile)\nYou caught me.  Matter of fact...\n\nThe ROAR OF ENGINES is HEARD!  Bruce turns to see:  TWO MORE BIKERS,\nrolling into position behind him.  Bruce is hopelessly trapped.\n\nBIKER (CONT'D)\n...you caught all of us...\n\nThe other two Bikers now dismount and close in.  The first Biker draws\nhis gun.  Biker #2 looks Bruce up and down critically, squinting at him\nthrough the rain.\n\nBIKER #2\nThat's my raincoat you're wearing.\nTake it off.\n\nBiker #2 snaps his arm forward - a switchblade appears in his hand.  He\nflicks it at Bruce who stands his ground, slicing a button off the\nfront of his raincoat.\n\nBIKER #2 (CONT'D)\nPick up the button, Wimpy.  Then\nlick it clean and hand me my coat.\n\nBruce stares icily, then slowly bends down to retrieve the button from\nthe mud.  Suddenly:  Biker #1's foot flashes INTO FRAME, headed\nstraight at Bruce's face!  In a lightning-quick move, Bruce grabs the\nswinging leg with both hands, rises, swings Biker #1 off the ground in\na circle, sends him crashing into the motorcycles as his gun goes\nflying.\n\nBiker #2, switchblade in hand, rushes Bruce.  Biker #3 unhooks chains\nfrom his belt.  Bruce sidesteps:  the knife slashes through his\nraincoat, sending it billowing out behind him like a cape!  Biker #3\nwhistles the chains past Bruce's ear:  He snatches them, karate-kicks\nBiker #3 in the stomach, simultaneously belting Biker #2 across the\nside of the head with the chains, knocking him unconscious.\n\nBiker #3 lunges at Bruce from behind!  Bruce spins, grabbing his arm,\ntwisting the knife away, catching it in his other hand as he trips\nBiker #3, sends him sprawling in the mud.  Bruce now straddles him,\nknife in hand.\n\nCLOSE ON BIKER #3\n\nBlinking in fear, his head pressed into the mud next to the button.\n\nBRUCE\nYour turn to pick up the button,\nscumbag...\n\nBiker #3's arm slowly starts forward as Bruce steps on it.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nWith your mouth.\n\nBiker #3 shuts his eyes in humiliation as:  THE SOUND OF A SIREN IS\nHEARD!\n\nANGLE ON SIDE OF BUILDING\n\nTWO POLICEMEN round the corner of the apartment building, now stop,\nstare in astonished silence at:\n\nThe Three Bikers, sprawled in the mud near their machines.  Bruce has\ncompletely disappeared.\n\nEXT. ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT\n\nA paramedic van is parked at the entrance.  Umbrella-holding ONLOOKERS\nwatch.  A gurney with the wounded Man is wheeled out.  The Woman and\nthe Young Girl follow.\n\nBruce appears at the edge of the crowd, collar still up, hat adjusted\nlow over his face  He stares.\n\nThe Paramedics stop.  One leans down, examines the Man, then covers his\nface with the sheet.  The Woman turns away in silence.  The Young Girl\nclings to her.\n\nBruce watches,  his eyes filled with tears.  He turns, walks off as\nCAMERA RACKS FOCUS to the pouring rain.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA RACKS BACK from the rain to Bruce, standing by the Aston-Martin\nin front of Wayne Manor.\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nBruce enters the empty living room.  His expression is numb.  He\npauses, lost in thought.  Then, moving as if by instinct, he heads for\nthe stairs leading to the basement.\n\nINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nBruce descends the stairs, walks down the hallway to a door.  He stops,\nlooks down at the heavy padlock which seals it shut.  His eyes close in\npain, remembering an earlier time.\n\nINT. YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - NIGHT\n\nSeen through dim half-light:  his childhood lab is coated with dust - a\nroom obviously left unused for years.  We hear A KEY TURNING IN THE\nLOCK.  The door to the lab swings open.  Bruce trains a flashlight on\nthe interior of the musty room.  He enters, finds a light switch, flips\nit on.\n\nThe lab table is much as we remember it, crammed with old test tubes,\nbeakers, etc.  Bruce crosses, stares down, lost in his past, then\nswitches on the holograph machine.  He stares - stunned and amazed as:\n\nTHE HOLOGRAPH FIGURE OF TEN-YEAR-OLD BRUCE WAYNE SPRINGS TO LIFE!  An\nexact visual reproduction of the Child who used to be.  The Young Boy\npeers down through a cobwebbed microscope in precisely the position we\nfirst saw him.\n\nBruce's eyes fill with tears - he shuts them tightly as he hears a\nVOICE from long ago.\n\nYOUNG BRUCE'S VOICE\nIt's called a holograph, Dad.\nPretty neat, huh?\n\nOne laser beam suddenly shorts out with age:  the image of Young Bruce\ndisappears.  The second beam continues to burn, its energy directed at\na disintegrating basement wall.\n\nBruce slumps at the other side of the table, oblivious, his face buried\nin his hands.\n\nOVERLAPPING IMAGES AND VOICE START TO APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.\n\nMartha Wayne\t\t\t   - giggling with Young Bruce, then kissing\nher husband passionately.\n\nDR. WAYNE'S VOICE\nThis - is definitely not a guy.\n\nThomas Wayne\t\t\t  - his face twisted in anguish as Chill's\nbullet blows.\n\nMARTHA'S VOICE\nOh, my God!  No!!\n\nA SHARP CRACK!\t    - As a piece of something crumbles away.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nLooking up.  Staring across the room:\n\nThe remaining laser beam has eaten away a piece of the basement wall -\nthere is a dull ECHOING THUD as the plaster hits the bottom of some\nunseen cavernous space below.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nRising.  Crossing curiously to the hole in the wall.  Training his\nflashlight torch through it.\n\nANGLE DOWN HOLE - HIS P.O.V.\n\nAN IMMENSE CAVERN trails down and away into the blackness.  A network\nof aged timbers intersect themselves, shoring up the side of the\nfoundation.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring.  Playing his flashlight against the visible parts of the\nunderground cavity.  He picks up a beaker from the lab table, then lets\nit fall through the hole.  There is an interminable wait.  Finally -\nthe impact of SHATTERING GLASS.\n\nANGLE BACK THROUGH HOLE\n\nSeen from inside:  the torch beam shines.  Suddenly - a long length of\nrope is tossed through.  Bruce appears in the opening.  He wriggles\nthrough, hanging on to the rope.\n\nBruce expertly shimmies down the rope, a man completely at home in an\naction he knows well.  The beam from the torch dances across the walls\nof the cavern:  high-ribbed, jagged walls, suggesting some sort of\nlabyrinth beyond.  The rope has played out.  Bruce hangs by the end,\nlooks down, lets himself fall to the cavern floor below.\n\nHe rises, plays the torch against the sides of the cave.\n\nANGLE ON BEAM - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe beam searches into crannies, exploring dark gray walls.  It comes\nacross a large patch of solid black.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nLooking curiously.\n\nBACK TO BLACK PATCH\n\nAs the beam hits the black patch fully - dozens of yellow eyes appear.\nThe entire mass LAUNCHES ITSELF INTO CAMERA with a terrifying screech\nand the sound of beating wings.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHis jaw drops, stunned, as THE COLONY OF BATS swarm over him!  He\nstumbles, protecting his face.  The torch drops to the floor.  Its\nshaft of light dances crazily around the cavern.\n\nFrom O.S. - a low moan is heard from Bruce.  It rises, gathers in\nvolume and intensity, gradually becoming a deep, booming guttural roar\n- at once a scream of total pain and a cry of defiance.  The terrified\nbats scream back in a maze of hot and cold light bouncing off beating\nblack wings.\n\nINT. ALFRED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe wind and rain batter against Alfred's partially open bedroom\nwindow.  Mixed with the sounds - a strong echo of the roar from the\ncavern.  Alfred's eyes pop open.  He rises groggily, makes his way to\nthe window, closes it.  CAMERA HOLDS on window, PANS UP to the moon.\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nEXT. CEMETERY - CLOSE ON MOON - NIGHT\n\nA FLASHING LIGHTNING BOLT:  CAMERA PANS DOWN from the moon through the\nraging storm to the graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne in the country\ncemetery, high on the hill.\n\nKneeling between them is Bruce - fists clenched, head bowed, tiny\nrivulets of water running off his face and body - totally lost in\nsilent prayer.\n\nBRUCE'S VOICE\nI've worked hard to make you proud of\nme.  To become the kind of person\nwhose presence could make a difference\nin the world.  But one man can only do\nonly so much, Father.  Mother, to-\nnight I saw the sign I thought would\nnever come.  Now - for the first time\nI realize I must...be...more...than\na man.\n\nA FLASHING LIGHTNING BOLT WIPES THE SCREEN!\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT\n\nThe remaining gossamer wisp of a transparent cloud pulls away from a\nglowing FULL MOON over Gotham City.\n\nINT. GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\nAn express train roars through a seedy subway station.\n\nINT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT\n\nA well-scrubbed TEENAGE COUPLE sit together holding hands.  The BOY is\ndressed in a dinner jacket, the GIRL is a chiffon party dress with a\nprominent orchid corsage pinned to it.  They exchange a nervous glance,\nlooking across the car at:\n\nA TOUGH-LOOKING THUG who sits opposite them, his muscular arms bulging\nthrough a torn windbreaker.  He grins across at the nervous Teenagers\nmenacingly, exposing yellow teeth, then sneaks a sideways look at:  A\nTHICKLY-BUILT TRUCKDRIVER-TYPE who stares straight ahead.\n\nThese are the only four people in the car.\n\nThe subway slows for the next stop.  The Truckdriver-Type rises\ndisinterestedly, crosses the car, looks down at the Teenagers who are\nnone too happy with his departure.\n\nTRUCKDRIVER-TYPE\nHave a nice time at the prom, kids?\n\nBOY\nYes, thank you, Sir.\n\nThe subway doors hiss open.  The Truckdriver-Type smiles and exits.\nThe Teenagers looks across the car worried.\n\nThe car pulls out of the station.  The Thug rises, crosses the car,\ngrabs hold of a vertical pole to steady himself, smirks down at the\nTeenagers.\n\nTHUG\nYou smell good enough to eat, Sweet-\nheart.\n\nBOY\n(nervous bravado)\nIf you've got something to say,\nMister, talk to me, okay?\n\nTHUG\nI was talking to you - Sweetheart.\n\nA knife drops out of the Thug's sleeve into his hand, its razor-sharp\nblade glinting in the light.  The Teenagers freeze with terror.\n\nTHUG (CONT'D)\nMaybe it's that flower that smells\nso good.\n\nThe Thug plucks the corsage off the trembling Girl's bodice, holds it\nup to his nose, inhales deeply, shaking his head.\n\nTHUG (CONT'D)\nNope.  Still can't place it.\n\nVOICE\nFunny.  I can smell you from way\nover here.\n\nThe Thug wheels, stares off at the end of the car, his jaw dropping\nopen.  The Teenagers' eyes bulge in disbelief.\n\nCLOSE ON CHEST\n\nA golden circle with the black figure of a bat sits in the middle of a\nsteel-gray skin-tight fabric stretched across a massively muscled\nchest.\n\nVOICE\nGive the lady back her flower.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Thug looks his unseen adversary up and down cautiously, unsure of\nwhether to laugh or obey.\n\nTHUG\nOkay...sure.  Just wanted to have a\nlittle fun.  I...\n\nWith a sudden lightning move he flips the switchblade in his hand,\nsending it whizzing in the direction of the Voice.\n\nCLOSE ON KNIFE\n\nThe knife whistles through the air TOWARD CAMERA.  Suddenly a black-\ngloved hand miraculously snatches it out of mid-air, spinning it, then\nsends it flying back!\nThe switchblade pierces the corsage, jerking it out of the Thug's hand,\nsticking it into the wall where it quivers behind him.  The Thug\nfreezes, turning white.\n\nVOICE\nNow then.  I think you said you\nwanted to have a little fun.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\nThe express wheezes to a stop at the next station.  A MIDDLE-AGED\nCOUPLE waits for the doors to open, then enter the car.  They suddenly\nstop, staring in amazement:\n\nThe Thug stands spread-eagled in the middle of the car, both wrists\ncuffed to overhanging metal handholds.  The center vertical pole\ndisappears up one pants leg, finally reappearing out of the collar of\nhis shirt.\n\nThe teenage Boy passes the amazed Couple, confidently dusting his\nhands.  He reaches back for the Girl who sniffs her corsage, then\nfollows him out of the car.\n\nEXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nGotham Police Headquarters.  CAMERA TRACKS PAST cubicles and offices,\nCLACKING, RINGING, DETECTIVES interrogating SUSPECTS, etc., catching up\nwith DAVID GORDON, the Commissioner of Police, a gruff-looking man in\nhis middle fifties who pauses to light a cheap cigarette.\n\nHeading toward him from the other direction:  SERGEANT HALEY, a smooth-\nfaced kissass in his thirties.\n\nGORDON\nWhat's up Haley?\n\nHALEY\nPretty slow, Commissioner.  Half a\ndozen muggings, some kids on PCP,\nand...oh, yeah.  Looks like we got a\ntransvestite prowling the southside\nsubway system.\n\nGORDON\nFull moon tonight.  Pervo heaven.\n\nGordon walks through his office door, Haley following.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThe extremely cluttered office of an immensely overworked civil\nservant.\n\nHALEY\nFrom his description, this guy could\nmake it as a float in the Rose\nParade.  Big black cape, black\nboots, black hood over his head...\n\nA squawk box intercom crackles on Gordon's desk.\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nHostage situation, Commissioner.\nMan holding two women near 3rd and\nGrand.

I may need\nto swap someone for those women.\n\nEXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY & STREET - NIGHT\n\nPolice cars barricade a major avenue, their spotlights trained on a\ndead-end alley.  A SWAT LIEUTENANT speaks through a mike.\n\nSWAT LT.\nCome on out of there, Wells!  Come\nout of we're coming in after you!\n\nWELLS' VOICE\nI got hostages!

DEAD-END ALLEY\n\nA pockmarked thug (WELLS) holds one YOUNG WOMAN roughly, trains his gun\non ANOTHER.  He squints out into the light.\n\nWELLS\nThirty seconds, Pig!

TWO\nPULSATING YELLOW EYES pierce through the blackness.\n\nVOICE\nI just counted you out, Wells.\n\nWells fires!  The Shadow swings the manhole cover up as the bullet\nricochets off it harmlessly.  Wells prepares to fire again.  The\nmanhole cover suddenly explodes out of the darkness!  One swing of a\nmassively muscled arm - one sickening \"clang\" - and it's over.\n\nANGLE ON STREET\n\nSWAT LT.\nLet's go!\n\nThe Police rush toward the alley, Gordon and Haley bringing up the\nrear, as the two Women emerge.\n\nWOMAN\nWOMAN #2\nHe saved us!  A giant black\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   Eight\nfee tall!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   monster from the\nsewers!\n\nThe Police storm into the alley as Gordon and Haley comfort the panting\nWomen.\n\nWOMAN\nWOMAN #3\t\t\t\t\t    He had black wings...\nAnd...and yellow eyes...\n\nGORDON\nWell, of course he did...You can\nboth calm down now, ladies.

GOTHAM APARTMENT HOUSE - HIGH SHOT - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA LOOKS DOWN from the roof of a Gotham skyscraper at the windows\nof a forty-story apartment house below.\n\nCAMERA HOLDS on a pair of glass doors leading out to a rosetta-carved\nstone balcony.  Clearly visible through the doors:  AN ELDERLY COUPLE\nlie face down on the floor of their living room, guarded by a masked\nBURGLAR holding a shotgun.  ANOTHER BURGLAR has managed to open a wall\nsafe and begins stuffing valuables into a gunny sack.\n\nCAMERA ZOOMS BACK!\n\nWe are some thirty stories higher across a wide avenue.\n\nA black-gloved hand ENTERS FRAME, holding a thin, clear nylon cord with\na tiny barbed fishhook on the end.\n\nThe other gloved hand steadies a gleaming titanium rifle barrel with an\ninfrared scope.  The fishhook is threaded through the chamber.\n\nA flap is opened in a thick, compartmentalized black belt.  The\nmoonlight glints off a cylindrical silver gas cartridge.\n\nANGLE ACROSS STREET THROUGH SCOPE\n\nSeen through the magnified infrared scope:  the cross hairs of the\nrifle sight settle in on the head of the Burglar holding the shotgun.\n\nThe cross hairs pause - then suddenly lower to the balcony.  The rifle\nFIRES with an audible \"hiss\" of compressed gas.\n\nANGLE ON ROSETTA BALCONY\n\nAs the fishhook whistles through a hole in the rosetta stone framework\nof the balcony.  On impact with the floor it pops open - expanding to\nten times its size, having now become an effective grappling hook.\n\nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe Burglar with the shotgun turns at the muffled metallic NOISE, looks\nthrough the glass doors at the empty balcony.\n\nEXT.

SKYSCRAPER ROOF - NIGHT\n\nThe nylon cord has been pulled taut - it disappears down into the\nblackness at a dizzying height, some four hundred feet above the avenue\nand crisscrossing traffic lights below.\n\nBlack-gloved hands take hold of the cord, testing it.\n\nEXT.

GORDON'S CAR - NIGHT\n\nA surly Gordon looks over as his intercom crackles.\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nCommissioner, this is Sergeant\nHavemeyer.  I'm on the fortieth\nfloor of the Gotham Arms.

We responded and\nheard a gunshot as we were running\ndown the hallway.  The victims are\nfine.  Sonofabitch cold-cocked both\nperpetrators.\n\nGORDON\nAtta boy, Havemeyer.  Hold him for\nquestioning till I get there.\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nCan't do that, Sir.  He's...already\nleft.\n\nGORDON\nBut you were right outside the door...\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nHe left...by the window, Sir.\n\nGORDON\nBy the window?  Goddamnit, Man,\nyou're on the fortieth floor!\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nThat's...affirmative, Sir.\n\nGORDON\nYou get back to headquarters pronto,\nMister!  I want your urine checked\nfor drugs!\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nYes, Sir.\n\nGordon slams down the intercom in disgust.\n\nGORDON\nMaybe it's something in the water.\nMaybe the whole city's on drugs.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT\n\nPolice SIRENS everywhere.  A squad car rolls slowly down the street,\nits spotlight searching the doorways and alleys.\n\nINT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT\n\nThe COP DRIVER yawns, turns to his PARTNER who works the spotlight, now\nnotices something.\n\nCOP DRIVER\nWhat's that?\n\nPARTNER\nWino...\n(out the window)\nGo back to sleep, Ace!\n\nSuddenly:  A WHISTLING SOUND through the air!  The two Cops blink, snap\ntheir heads forward as the searchlight is trained on:\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN - THEIR  P.O.V.\n\nTHE BATMAN! - Seen in his majestic totality for the very first time.  A\ntruly awesome figure from his black cowl to his gleaming black boots.\nHis huge, dark cape billows out ominously behind him.\n\nBACK TO SQUAD CAR\n\nCOP DRIVER\nHolee shit...\n\nPARTNER\nLet's get him!\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe squad car lurches forward!  Batman whirls, runs down an alley.  The\nsquad car swings, pulls in after him.\n\nINT. ALLEY - NIGHT\n\nBatman runs with the speed of an Olympic sprinter, but the squad car\ngains rapidly.  He looks over his shoulder.\n\nANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe squad car fills the alleyway.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nHe looks in front of him in horror - another squad car speed at him\nfrom the other direction.  It too fills the alleyway.  There's no place\nto hide.\n\nANGLE ON SQUAD CAR #1\n\nFilling frame - the Cops grinning.\n\nANGLE ON SQUAD CAR #2\n\nFilling frame - the Cops grinning.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nHe stands his ground.  Then - curiously - runs directly at the first\nsquad car.\n\nANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SQUAD CAR #1\n\nCOP #1\nWhat the...?\n\nBACK TO BATMAN - SLOW MOTION SHOT\n\nWith a perfectly timed leap, Batman vaults onto the hood of the car in\na somersault and does a complete 360 - up the windshield - over the\nroof - off the trunk - lands on the pavement with the grave of a cat.\n\nANGLE ON TWO POLICE CARS\n\nThey crash head-on with a sickening sound of crunching metal and flying\nglass.  Two groggy Police exit, front doors falling off, try to clear\ntheir heads.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAWN\n\nThe first orange rays of the morning sun stab upwards through the\nclouds over Wayne Manor.\n\nINT. YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - DAY\n\nYoung Bruce Wayne's lab room remains much as we remember it, except\nthat the gaping hole in the wall caused by the laser has been\nreinforced and shaped into a doorway.  A make-shift ladder-like\nstairway leads down into the cavern below.\n\nFOOTSTEPS are heard climbing the ladder from deep within the cave.\nAfter a moment, Bruce appears, stripped to the waist, still wearing his\nutility belt and the bottom half of his Batman suit.  His chest and\nstomach are nicked with small cuts and bruises from his previous\nnight's work.  His forehead glistens with sweat born of utter\nexhaustion.  He sits heavily on a cot, buries his face in his hands,\nlooks up suddenly as the door to the lab opens.\n\nAlfred enters, stares silently, first appalled by Bruce's physical\ncondition, then shaking his head with sympathy.  Bruce stares back,\neyes heavy with lack of sleep.\n\nBRUCE\nYou...think I'm crazy, don't you?\nCertifiably insane.\n\nALFRED\n(pause; smile)\nA bit...eccentric, perhaps.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's...what I have to do, Alfred.\nAfter all those years of searching\n-- it was always what I had to do.\n\nALFRED\nIf I may be permitted, Sir...\n(with difficulty)\nI've...never had any children of my\nown.  Never saw the advantage in it,\nconsidering my profession.  I've\nalways thought myself more talented\nat raising flowers than people...\n\nBruce looks up with a warm smile of gratitude.\n\nALFRED\nOh, I didn't raise you, Sir, I\nsimply watched you grow.\n\nINSERT SHOT - GOTHAM TRIBUNE\n\nA Banner edition of the Gotham Tribune cartwheels INTO FRAME:  On the\nfront page:  fanciful artist's renditions drawn from eyewitness\nrecollections of the Batman.\n\nOne is of a menacing black vampire with long, pointed fangs.  Another\nshow a dark, furry giant with huge feathered wings.  Above them the\nheadline:  BAT-MAN INVADES CITY.  MASS HYSTERIA GRIPS GOTHAM.  POLICE\nNO MATCH FOR WINGED INTRUDER.\n\nCAMER HOLDS on the newspaper as we hear the jumbled and excited VOICES\nof REPORTERS underneath:\n\nREPORTER'S VOICE\nCommissioner, how do you explain this\nFantastic phenomenon?\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nI can't explain it.  I only hope for the\npoor fellow's sake, he's sobered up by now.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM COUNTRY CLUB - DAY\n\nBruce lies on a deck chair by the swimming pool of the Gotham Country\nClub, his body coated with sun oil.  He listens to Gordon's TV press\nconference on a tiny transistor set next to him.  His eyes flutter open\nwith amusement.\n\nTV REPORTER\nWell considering the fact he apprehended\nfour criminals last night, shouldn't we\nbe calling him...a good Samaritan?\n\nGORDON\nSure.  If you feel like calling John\nHinkley a political activist.\n\nBruce's eyes suddenly bulge wider.  He gazes across the swimming pool,\ntransfixed by what he sees.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER - BRUCE'S P.O.V.\n\nA stunning-looking woman (SILVER ST. CLOUD) steps out onto the high\nboard of the pool, dressed in a daringly-cut shiny white latex tank\nsuit.  A shining mane of glistening silver hair cascades down across\nher shoulders.  She pauses, a shimmering white diamond in the sun.\n\nREPORTER'S VOICE\nCommissioner, it might surprise you\nto know that several polls taken\ntoday show more than eighty percent\nof those interviewed approve of\nthis...vigilante and what he did...\n\nSilver glances over in Bruce's direction.  Curiously enough, she seems\nto smile at him and wave.\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nWell I can't account for public\ntaste, bit I'd like to warn any\npotential copy cats who may be out\nthere that...\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce is stunned and confused, but starts to lift his hand to wave back\nwhen:\n\nTHORNE'S VOICE\nIf brains were bodies, she'd look\njust the same.  Can you believe it?\n\nBruce swivels, lowering his hand.  Thorne stands behind him, waves back\nat Silver who executes a complicated but perfect dive into the pool.\nShe starts to swim across in their direction as Throne grins down at\nBruce.\n\nTHORNE\nName's Silver St. Cloud.  Phi Beta\nKappa, Masters Degree in Political\nScience.  Just arrived in Gotham to\nfinish her doctorate on municipal\ngovernment and guess which City\ncouncilman drew her as an intern?\n\nBRUCE\n(staring)\nTaught her much so far?\n\nTHORNE\n(chuckle)\nNot as much as I plan to.\n\nSilver reaches the edge of the pool.  Thorne starts to help her out as\nBruce continues to start.\n\nSILVER\nThe water's glorious, Rupert.  Come\non in.\n\nTHORNE\nNever had time to learn how to swim.\nToo busy trying to make a living, I\nguess.  Not like Mr. Wayne over\nhere...\n(chuckle)\nRight, Bruce?\n(turns)\nSilver St. Cloud - Bruce Wayne.\n\nBruce looks up, totally mesmerized by the sight of her.  She gazes down\nwith a devastating smile, the sun sparkling off the beads of water on\nher face.  She is instantly and equally smitten as they lock eyes.\n\nSILVER\nPlease don't get up.\n\nBRUCE\n(lost)\nHmm?\n\nSILVER\nI said - please don't get up.\n\nBRUCE\nOh.\n(starts to get up)\nSorry...\n\nSILVER\nThat's all right.  I asked you not\nto, remember?\n\nBRUCE\n(stops)\nSo you did.  Thanks.\n\nSILVER\nDon't mention it.\n\nRupert watches them watching each other.  The uncomfortable silence is\nfilled by Gordon's VOICE from the television.\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nAnd now, if there are no other ques-\ntions, it's my birthday tonight and\nI have a formal party to get ready\nfor...\n\nThorne reaches down, turns off the TV in disgust.\n\nTHORNE\nThat clown has been a disgrace to\nlaw enforcement his entire career.\nThis city's going to hell in a hand-\nbasket and some imbecile's giving\nhim a formal birthday party.\n\nBRUCE\nIt should be fun.  I'm giving it.\n\nThorne raises his eyebrows.  Silver still stares.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nPerhaps the two of you would like to\ncome?\n\nTHORNE\nSILVER\nI'm busy, thanks.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   I'd\nlove to.\n\nTHORNE\n(irritated)\nSilver, I don't think...ah...\n\nSILVER\nIf I'm not being too inquisitive,\nMr. Wayne - exactly what is it you\ndo?\n\nBRUCE\nDo?\n\nSILVER\nFor a living?\n\nTHORNE\n(chuckles)\nYou're looking at it.\n\nBRUCE\nActually, Rupert's not being\nentirely fair about his...\n(nice smile)\nSometimes I go hang gliding.\n\nSILVER\nAnd that's it?\n\nBRUCE\nNot quite.\n\nSILVER\nI didn't think so.\n\nBRUCE\nI have a dog as well.\n\nSilver manages a tiny, unsure smile.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nWayne Manor.  Eight o'clock.  I'll\nhave my car pick you up.\n\nTHORNE\nWhy don't you take my car, Silver?\nIn case you want to leave early.\n\nSILVER\nI'm very flattered by the dueling\nlimos, gentlemen, but I can grab a\ncab, thanks.\n(nods)\nMr. Wayne...\n\nSilver excuses herself.  Both men watch her departure avidly.\n\nTHORNE\nGotham City's no place for a beauti-\nful woman to be travelling alone.\nI'm holding you personally responsi-\nble for her safety, Wayne.\n\nBRUCE\nDon't worry, Rupert.  I'll treat her\njust as if I were in love with her\ninstead of you.\n\nThorne's eyes narrow.  Bruce smiles ingenuously.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nDozens of expensive cars disgorge their passengers in front of stately\nWayne Manor.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nA lavish party is in progress.  A DANCE BAND plays off to the side,\nunder a banner reading \"Happy Birthday to the Finest of Gotham's\nFinest.\"\n\nBruce Wayne greets his arriving GUESTS, his neck craning around in vain\nfor a sight of Silver.\n\nGordon stands by the bar, downs a double scotch, scowls at GUESTS who\ntalks animatedly to him while flapping his arms like wings - doing a\ncrude imitation of the Batman.  The Guest howls with laughter, moves\noff as Gordon orders another drink and Bruce joins him with a\nsympathetic smile.\n\nBRUCE\nThey're giving you a pretty hard time\nabout that Batman, aren't they...\n\nGordon nods, tosses back his drink angrily.\n\nGORDON\nI'd give up half my pension to be\nstanding face to face with that\ncaped fruitcake right now.\n(looks off; stares)\nNow there's a sight to make an old\nman's eyes water.\n\nSilver St. Cloud approaches them, threading her way through the\nappreciative glances of the Guests, dressed in a sparkling, metallic\nevening gown, the light bouncing off it like tiny bursts of shooting\nstars.  She reaches Bruce, extends her hand with a warm smile.\n\nSILVER\nI hope I'm not too late.\n\nGORDON\nIn my case, by twenty years.\n\nBRUCE\nSilver, St. Cloud - this is David\nGordon, Commissioner of Police.\nMiss St. Cloud is picking up the\nfiner points of the city government from\nCouncilman Thorne.\n\nSILVER\nMy ambition is to hold a job as\nimportant as yours one day, Commis-\nsioner.\n\nGORDON\nThen you and Mr. Thorne already have\nmuch in common.\n\nSILVER\n(suddenly)\nWould you care to dance, Mr. Wayne?\n\nBRUCE\n(locking eyes)\nYou're as clairvoyant as you are\nbeautiful, Miss St. Cloud.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nNow heading into the driveway is a brightly painted version of an old-\ntime twenties paddy wagon, with two look-alikes of the old KEYSTONE\nKOPS riding on top.  They honk a comical horn loudly as laughing\nPARKING ATTENDANTS greet them\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ANGLE ON DANCE FLOOR\n\nBruce and Silver glide smoothly across the floor - a perfect fit.\nBruce looks down curiously.\n\nSILVER\nSomething wrong?\n\nBRUCE\nYou're...leading.\n\nSILVER\nI asked you, remember?\n\nAlfred arrives, interrupting them.\n\nALFRED\nExcuse me, Sir, but there are some\noddly dressed gentlemen outside with a\nsinging telegram for the Commissioner.\n\nBRUCE\nAsk them to come in, will you,\nAlfred?\n\nBruce makes his way to the bandstand, whispers some instructions to the\nBANDLEADER.  A LOUD FANFARE is played.  All conversation stops as the\nfront door opens.\n\nNow entering Wayne Manor:  the Two Keystone Kops, in their twenties'\ncostumes with handlebar moustaches.  They dance their way to the center\nof the room in a prearranged routine, singing in harmony from Pirates\nof Penzance.\n\nKOPS\nWhen a felon's not engaged in his\nemployment,\nOr maturing his felonious little\nplans,\nHis capacity for innocent enjoyment\nIs just as great as any honest\nman's...\nOh, a policeman's lot is not a happy\none...\n\nThe Guests applaud loudly.  Gordon joins Bruce and Silver as the Kops\nbreak into a vaudeville routine.\n\nKOP\nExcuse me, Sir.  Have you seen a\npoliceman around here?\n\nKOP #2\nWhy no, I haven't.\n\nKOP\n(drawing gun)\nGood.  Then give me your watch.\n\nSeveral Guests laugh.  Bruce winces at the bad joke.\n\nKOP #2\nBut this watch isn't worth anything.\nIt only has a sentimental value.\n\nKOP\nWell give it to me anyway.  I feel\nlike a good cry.\n\nGordon laughs loudly as the Kop turns to him.\n\nKOP (CONT'D)\nNow, Commissioner, if we could\nborrow your watch for a moment...\n\nGORDON\n(taking it off)\nSure.  Be careful with it, okay?\n\nThe Kop smiles, takes the watch, dangles it from his hand.  Kop #2\nsilently sidles in behind Bruce and Silver.\n\nKOP\nHere's a good one:  what's a police-\nman's favorite way to kill time?\n\nGORDON\n(grinning)\nI'll bite.  What is a policeman's\nfavorite way to kill time?\n\nThe Kop grins, pull his gun - FIRES!  Gordon's watch is smashed to\nsmithereens.  Kop #2's gun suddenly at the back of Silver's head,\nhammer cocked.\n\nKOP #2\nUp against the wall, everybody!\nMove!!\n\nThe Guests scream as six more Kops burst through the front door\ncarrying automatic weapons.  Bruce, Silver, and Gordon are herded back\nagainst the wall with the others.\n\nThe KOP grins, then suddenly starts to giggle insanely.  He takes off\nhis helmet, as a shock of GREEN HAIR is exposed!  He wipes his lips\nclean which now become ruby red.  Cackling in glee, THE JOKER faces his\nvictims, his gaze suddenly becoming cruel and cold.\n\nJOKER\nOne at a time, your money and your\njewels, and no one's head'll wind\nup looking like the Commissioner's\nwatch, capisce?\n\nKOP #3\nHey, boss!  Look!\n\nThe Joker turns.  Kop #3 and a PARTNER have set Gordon's huge birthday\ncake on the floor, now wade through it, stomping up and down, kicking\nthe insides across the room.\n\nKOP #3\nWe're doing the cake walk!\n\nThe Joker giggles, then shoots a satanically maniacal look at the\nGuests who instantly begin stripping off their jewelry, taking out\nwallets, etc. as more Kops pass by with a gunny sack.  The Joker walks\ndown the line, stopping to level a searching and curious gaze into the\neyes of:\n\nBruce Wayne, between Gordon and Silver, his face set, eyes steely,\nstaring at the Joker.  His jaw twitches.\n\nSilver watches him, noticing the twitch.  She gives him a tiny,\nsympathetic smile, then turns to face:\n\nKop #2, who has moved down the line to Silver.  He looks her up and\ndown hungrily as she stares back in defiance.  His fingers slowly reach\nup to grip her necklace, then linger.\n\nKOP #2\nIn your case, lady, I'd like to\nrip the rest off and leave this on.\n\nSuddenly:  BRUCE'S FIST FLASHES INTO FRAME!  Kop #2 is knocked backward\nthrough the air as another Kop lunges at Bruce who grabs the gunny sack\nfilled with jewelry and bashes him in the face!  The Kop crumples to\nthe floor as Bruce wheels to face the Joker and sees:\n\nThe Joker, grinning cruelly, the barrel of his gun pressing up under\nSilver's chin.  Her eyes are welded shut with fear.\n\nJOKER\nNow that was extremely bad manners,\nMr. Wayne.  Especially from someone...\n(gestures)\n...to the Manor born...\n(giggles)\nSo why don't you rejoin the lady here,\nor if you like...\n(cocks gun; glowers)\nI can send part of her over to you.\n\nBruce hesitates, then rejoins the line.  The Joker lowers his gun,\nturns to stare at a painting on the wall as a Kop holds out the open\ngunny sack to Gordon.\n\nGORDON\n(to Joker)\nI'll see you rot in the gas chamber\nfor this.\n\nThe Joker smiles, ignoring him, looking at the portrait painting which\nis of a distinguished older man.  He removes it from the wall.  An\nindignant Alfred speaks up from farther down the line of Guests.\n\nALFRED\nBe careful, you clot!  That portrait\ngoes back to Mr. Wayne's grandfather!\n\nJOKER\nWhy?  Is there something wrong with\nit?\n\nThe Joker cackles, punching the painting out of its frame.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nBruce stares silently.  His jaw twitches with anger born of\nhumiliation.  Silver notices again.\n\nSILVER\n(whisper)\nLook on the bright side.  You're\nadorable when your jaw twitches.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Joker crosses to Gordon with the empty picture frame.  Another Kop\npoints a camera as the Joker holds the frame up to encircle his and\nGordon's face.\n\nJOKER\n(giggling)\nI've always wanted to frame a Police\nCommissioner...\n\nCLOSE ON JOKER'S AND GORDON'S FACES\n\nGordon shuts his eyes in disgrace.  The Joker howls with glee.\n\nTHE FLASHBULB STROBE WIPES THE SCEEN!\n\nEXT.

The\nphone line seems to have been cut.\n\nGORDON\nI'll report it myself, Alfred.\nRight before I cut my throat.\n\nHe tries to check his watch, stares at an empty wrist, sighs, then\njoins the stream of departing Guests as Bruce looks over at Silver\nglumly.\n\nBRUCE\nWell.  Good-night.  I guess...\n\nSILVER\n(sudden grin)\nWhy don't be silly.  I've only just\narrived.\n\nBRUCE\n(smile)\nWould you care to dance, Miss St. Cloud?\n\nSILVER\n(offering her arm)\nYou're as clairvoyant as you are\ngallant, Mr. Wayne...\n\nEXT.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nGordon walks slowly and dejectedly down the nearly deserted hallway.\nAs he passes one DETECTIVE'S cubicle, the sound of SNICKERING is HEARD\nfrom inside.\n\nGordon stops defiantly.  The snickering instantly dies away.  Muttering\ndisgustedly, Gordon enters his office.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThe office is lit only be a small desk lamp.  Strung up behind the desk\nis a crudely-made banner reading:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO OUT COMMISH - FROM\nALL YOUR BOYS IN BLUE.\n\nGordon shakes his head sadly, crosses to a cabinet, pours himself an\nenormous glass of Scotch, then crosses with the bottle to the open\noffice window.  He takes a long swig, exhales, then slams the window\nshut.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nThe Wayne Manor driveway is deserted under the moonlight.\n\nINT.

How did...\n(smile)\nRupert Thorne describe me?\n\nSILVER\nAs a rather ineffectual playboy.\nBut pleasant enough in a harmless\nsort of way.\n\nBRUCE\nLike an affable grasshopper bouncing\naround in the middle of all you\nhard-working ants...\n\nSILVER\nSomething like that.\n\nBruce takes her hand gently, stares deeply into her eyes.\n\nBRUCE\nAnd you?  How would you describe me?\n\nSILVER\n(staring back)\nI don't think you're harmless.  And\nI don't think anyone who's looked\nstraight in your eyes could say so.\n\nBruce's jaw twitches involuntarily.  Silver grins.  He leans in, kisses\nher lingeringly on the mouth.  They break.  He gazes into her\ndisoriented eyes.\n\nBRUCE\nFrightened?\n\nSILVER\nTerrified...but don't worry...\n(soft smile)\nAs a kid they always had to drag me\noff the roller coaster.\n\nThey kiss again, passionately.

Then,\nthe other foot on the remaining hand.  Batman grimaces in unbelievable\npain.\n\nSuddenly:  Batman swings his leg back!  He bursts forward again in an\narc, propelling his feet under the girder and up again around the other\nside.  His boots crash into the back of Malone's legs - launching him\nout into space with an agonizing scream!\n\nThe Batman stands on the girder, looking down.  He gives a tiny salute,\nthen DIVES OUT INTO THE NIGHT!  Sailing down through the blackness for\nmore than a hundred feet, he hits the river with an enormous splash,\nthen disappears.\n\nBACK TO GORDON\n\nGordon watches, stunned, as a Reporter comes up.\n\nREPORTER\nIncredible!

It\nframes the figure of THE PENGUIN who lies in bed, an ice pack on his\nhead, a thermometer sticking out of his mouth.\n\nThis is an elegant man, dressed in a white robe with a black collar,\npropped up on black silk sheets against black-and-white checkered\npillows.  A COOING SOUND makes him glance at a partially opened window\nwhere a pigeon has landed, now looks at him questioningly.  The Penguin\nmakes a clucking birdlike sound of welcome which the pigeon seems to\nrecognize.  It flies over to his bed, hops up into his lap.\n\nA STATUESQUE WOMAN (EMPRESS) enters, carrying a tureen of shrimp\nembedded in ice.  She wears a tight wool body stocking, a muffler\nwrapped around her neck.\n\nEMPRESS\nHere, sweetie.  Eat them while they're\nnice and frozen.

Four sets of candelabra are drawn in around him for warmth.\n\nJOKER\nNice little meat locker you got here.\nWho'd you buy it from, Bird's Eye?\n\nA frozen giggle collapses.  The Penguin blinks stoically.\n\nPENGUIN\nI'm heart-broken you haven't touched\nyour food.

Alfred stands on a ladder, polishing a tooth of a mechanical\nTyrannosaurus Rex.  Next to it is the giant penny.  This, along with\nother exhibits, is the trophy section.\n\nCAMERA PANS:  One area of the cave is devoted to exercise - weights,\nNautilus machines, rings - even a trapeze.  The acetylene torch whines.\n\nCAMERA PANS:  Another section features a myriad of complicated machines\nand a fully equipped crime lab.\n\nPAST the crime lab:  Bruce lies on his back under a partially\nconstructed futuristic automobile.  He trains an acetylene torch\nagainst one section as the sparks fly.  It's just the shell of a car\nnow - other sections and odd electronic devices are strewn about the\narea.  Bruce shuts off his torch, removes a faceplate, reaches back for\na long cylindrical network of crisscrossing cables.  He starts to fit\nit onto one underside edge of the chassis.\n\nBRUCE\nI'm sorry, Alfred.  Did you say\nsomething?\n\nALFRED\n(noticing cylinder)\nWhat on earth is all that metallic\nspaghetti in aid of?\n\nBRUCE\nThere's a Magnum pistol in the table\ndrawer over there.  Take it out,\nwould you?\n\nAlfred descends the ladder as Bruce rises, crosses to two larger\nversions of the cabled cylinders.  They stand upright, some eight feet\napart from each other.  Bruce leans down, opens the top of a large\ntransformer box.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nI've connected two mega-transformer\nleads to form a force field of a\nmillion volts.\n\nBruce flips a switch - dazzling blue light begins to dance between the\ncable cylinders.  Alfred turns with the gun in his hands as Bruce calls\nto him from behind the sparkling wall of blue light.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nShoot me.\n\nALFRED\nPardon?\n\nBRUCE\nShoot to kill.  Aim for the heart.\n\nALFRED\nI...assume this apparatus has been\nthoroughly tested, Sir?\n\nBRUCE\nWe're doing it right now.\n\nAlfred stares incredulously, the gun shaking in his hand.\n\nALFRED\nSir...if you've miscalculated...\n\nBRUCE\nBe a good soldier, Alfred.\n(pause)\nShoot.  Now!\n\nAlfred straightens his arm, his finger squeezing the trigger.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\n(suddenly)\nWait!\n\nTOO LATE:  Alfred fires!  The bullet bounces off the blue wall of\nlight, then ricochets back at Alfred, pinging into the cavern wall next\nto his head!  Alfred hits the deck as the lead cartridge continues a\nseemingly endless path of ricochets until there is sudden silence.\n\nAlfred rises, sweat dripping from his brow.

The Joker giggles as Thorne rises\nfrom behind the desk, the ropes dropping off him like spaghetti.  He\ntakes the gag out of his mouth, looks down at Silver, nervous and\nagitated.\n\nTHORNE\nI can't get her involved.

ALLEYWAY - NIGHT\n\nThe screen is totally black.  Suddenly - one glaring yellow headlight\nin the shape of an eye appears!  Then another.\n\nANGLE ON ENGINES\n\nTwin turbine engines fire up - their glowing red exhaust filling the\nscreen.\n\nANGLE ON STREET\n\nTHE BATMOBILE screams from the alley out into the street.  A sleek,\npowerful, futuristic panther of a car - jet black with a domed\ninterior.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nThe interior is a glistening, intricate maze of computers, screens, and\ncomplicated electrical systems.  Silver's eyes are frozen open in\nastonishment.

There is one.\n\nANGLE ON SKY\n\nThe Penguin and his three Jetpack Bandits zoom down at the car, their\nmounted machine guns BLAZING.  Bandit #1 powers forward, spewing\nbullets as he comes.\n\nINT.

They soar higher to avoid their own fire.\n\nBACK ON BATMOBILE\n\nSpeeding down an avenue along the side of the park.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nSilver looks over hopefully.\n\nSILVER\nI guess we frightened them off.\n\nBatman shakes his head, flips another switch:  A small radar screen\nlights up.  Three blinking LIGHT BLIPS are still following them.\nBatman suddenly looks ahead, eyes widening.\n\nANOTHER CAR heads directly at them, guns blazing!\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nI think I'll keep my mouth shut.\n\nANGLE ON STREET\n\nThe HOOD CAR swerves off the street into the park.  The Batmobile\nsqueals into a 180 and roars after it.\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN SKY\n\nThe Penguin watches from the sky with satisfaction.\n\nPENGUIN\nHe's taken the bait...\n\nHe motions two Bandits to fly off in another direction, then:  swivels\nin mid-air, points Bandit #3 down at the Batmobile.\n\nPENGUIN (CONT'D)\nThe tires, you Cretin!

A giant horseshoe\nmagnet swivels, pointing out behind the car!\n\nANGLE ON BANDIT #3\n\nScreaming, wide-eyed, as the force of the powerful magnet spins him in\nmid-air and he is sucked into the trunk by his jetpack.

PARK - ANGLE ON CURVE - NIGHT\n\nA Bandit watches near a curve in the park road as the Hood Car roars\nby.

PARK - ANGLE OF BRIDGE OVER LAKE - NIGHT\n\nThe Park road curves onto a bridge which spans the park lake.  The Hood\nCar speeds quickly across it.\n\nANGLE BELOW BRIDGE\n\nA Bandit stands by a plunger-detonator device.\n\nBACK TO BRIDGE\n\nThe Batmobile starts across at full speed.  Suddenly - A HUGE EXPLOSION\ncollapses the section of the bridge directly in front of it!\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nPlummeting down through the air toward the lake.  Batman works his\ncontrols frantically as Silver screams!\n\nANGLE ON LAKE\n\nThe Batmobile plunges into the lake!  A brilliant SHOWER OF BLUE SPARKS\nexplode across the water's surface as the vehicle disappears.  For a\nmoment, all is still.\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN AIR\n\nThe Penguin looks down, \"clucking\" contentedly.  His expression\nsuddenly starts to change.\n\nANGLE ON LAKE - HIS P.O.V.\n\nSlowly re-emerging on the surface of the lake:  The Batmobile!  Its\nroaring turbine engines propel it forward, now supported by TWO\nHYDROFOIL PONTOONS!  The makeshift craft speeds over the water at\nspeedboat velocity.\n\nThe Batmobile reaches shore, churning up chunks of mud as the pontoons\ncontract and the car bounces onto the park road.  The protective blue\nlight has been extinguished.  From either side:  two Hood Cars\napproach, machine guns blazing!\n\nBatman swerves the Batmobile onto the grass, roars cross-country toward\na park exit as the hail of bullets begins to make CRACKS across its\nprotective dome.\n\nANGLE ON PARK EXIT AND STREET\n\nThe Batmobile speeds out into the street.  One Hood Car is in hot\npursuit - the other exits the park a block ahead and roars at the\nBatmobile from the other direction!\n\nINT.

STREET - NIGHT\n\nThe Batmobile is about to become a sandwich as Batman suddenly squeals\nthe vehicle into a parking building!  The Hood Cars do respective 180's\nand follow suit.\n\nINT. PARKING BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nThe Batmobile roars around hairpin turns, ascending the levels of the\nparking building like a sportscar.\n\nThe Hood Cars screech after him, gaining speed.  They pursue Batman\nhigher and higher, threading the narrow openings through the lines of\nparked cars, tearing off side mirrors, doors, and fenders on their way\nby.\n\nANGLE ON HIGHER LEVEL\n\nThe Batmobile, reaching the level just under the roof, squeals around a\ncorner, catches the fender of a parked car, and spins out of control!\n\nBatman slams on the brakes as the Batmobile skids and turns to face:\n\nThe two Hood Cars, which have stopped so that they are completely\nblocking off the exit ramps, up and down.  The OCCUPANTS stare in\namazement as the Batmobile suddenly roars at them!\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nBatman's jaw sets as he looks forward.\n\nANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD\n\nA sign at the bottom of a narrow ramp leading to the roof screams in\nred letters:  WRONG WAY - DO NOT ENTER - SEVERE TIRE DAMAGE!\n\nBACK TO PARKING LEVEL\n\nThe Batmobile shoots up the wrong-way ramp!\n\nCLOSE OF METAL TEETH\n\nAs the Batmobile's tires make contact with the viciously protruding\nmetal teeth - ALL FOUR TIRES BLOW!  The vehicle roars on, flub-a-\ndubbing up toward the roof.\n\nEXT.

Jet-\npropelled afterburners ignite!\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe Batmobile has reached the edge of the roof, now LAUNCHES ITSELF\ninto space in an upwards arc!\n\nThe two Hood Cars are unable to cope with the sudden void between them\nand crash head-on with a sickening crunch!\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN MID-AIR\n\nStaring in total shock - frozen in mid-air as the Batmobile arcs up\ntoward him.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nThe figure of the Penguin grows rapidly larger through the windshield.\nBATMAN HONKS AT HIM!\n\nBACK TO MID-AIR\n\nThe Penguin takes a panicked, last-second evasive action, diving low as\nthe Batmobile streaks by:\n\nThe white-hot turbine flames from the vehicle's exhaust crease the top\nof his umbrella-copter's whirling ribs, MELTING THEM INTO DISFIGURED\nCURLEQUES!\n\nThe Penguin looks up in despair as his umbrella-copter begins to spin\nout of control.  He gives a birdlike SCREECH, then zig-zags helplessly\nthrough the air!\n\nBACK TO BATMOBILE\n\nThe sleek vehicle completes its downward arc through the air and lands\non the roof of the building across the street.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SKY\n\nThe Penguin cartwheels end over end through the air, his umbrella-\ncopter sputtering.\n\nINT. RICH APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nDozens of GUESTS surround a lavishly decorated banquet table in an\nexpensive apartment.  A Bar Mitzvah celebration is in progress.

APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe Penguin crash-lands on the end of the banquet table, sending food\nand Guests flying everywhere as he skids along, clearing it, finally\nsplattering to a stop through an enormous pile of chicken livers into a\nmountain of cracked ice under a banner reading:  TODAY YOU ARE A MAN.\n\nThe stunned Guests hesitate a moment, then burst into wild,\nunrestrained APPLAUSE!\n\nEXT.

SILVER'S HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nBatman and Silver stop at her apartment door.  She smiles at him\nthrough smeared elevator cable grease.\n\nBATMAN\nI'm...very sorry for tonight.  You\nmust have been terrified.\n\nSILVER\nWell, I've thought of a way you can\nmake it up to me.\n\nBatman looks at her curiously.  She suddenly kisses him, deeply.  He\nallows it, unwilling or unable to pull away.\n\nCLOSE-UP\n\nSilver's eyes open.  She knows - or thinks she does.\n\nThey break.  Silver smiles mysteriously, whistles under her breath,\nenters her apartment.\n\nINT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nShe leans against the door, sighs.  Could it be true?\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nOn the other side of the door, worried.  Does she know?\n\nINT. TV STUDIO - DAY\n\nThe quiz show The Joker Is Wild broadcasts before a live audience.

I\nJust flew in from Lost Wages,\nNevada, and boy, are my arms tired!\n\nHe giggles.  There is a stony silence from the audience.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nGimme a break, folks, I'm a Veteran.\nMan walks into a bar, says, \"Have\nyou got any Wild Turkey?\"  Bartender\nsay, \"No, but I can get a tame one\nand irritate it for you.\"\n\nHe roars.  The audience stares back.  His eyes narrow.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nBut I digress.  You see, I'm in the\nprocess of developing a new series...\n(evil smile)\n...of killings.  All original, all\ndifferent, believe me, folks, you're\ngonna die laughing.  And there's only\none man who can cancel my little show\nthe Batman.  Because from now\non, each time he appears in public,\nevery time he's seen anywhere - one\nprominent citizen of Gotham will die.\n(to camera)\nI'm tired of fighting you, Batman,\nso the people are going to do it for\nme.

I can't chance it.\n\nBruce turns away in disgust, his mind racing.\n\nALFRED\n(sympathetic)\nWell...perhaps a night on the town\nas Bruce Wayne might be therapeutic\nfor you after all.  You do have\ntickets for the gala opening of the\nopera.  I was planning on using one\nmyself, but if you'd prefer a more\nlively and decorative companion I\nquite understand.\n\nBRUCE\nYou know what?

GOTHAM OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nDozens of shiny limousines disgorge Gotham's formally dressed ELITE in\nfront of the opera house.  Photographer's flashbulbs indicate that it\nis indeed a gala opening.  The billboard marquee advertises:\nI PAGLIACCI.\n\nCAMERA PANS to one arriving limo and we hear a TELEPHONE RINGING over\nthe scene.  Silver's VOICE answers it.\n\nSILVER'S VOICE\nHi.  This is Silver.  I'm not home\nright now, but if you'd leave a\nmessage at the \"beep,\" I'll get back\nto you as soon as I can.\n\nThe limo pulls up to the front of the opera house.  Silver exits in a\nshimmering evening gown.  AT THE SOUND OF THE \"BEEP\" we see her escort:\nRupert Thorne.  They make their way inside past a battery of\nphotographers.\n\nINT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nA maze of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE mingles in the lobby, exchanging greetings\nand appreciative glances.  An ARMY ARCHERD-type comments on the passing\nparade for local television.\n\nARMY ARCHERD\n...I'm telling you, they're all\nhere tonight, folks!

Archerd blinks in disbelief as the Crowd\nparts and Batman enters the lobby.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nFrozen.  He exchanges an incredulous glance with Alfred.\n\nCLOSE ON SILVER\n\nTotally taken aback.

(His resemblance to Bruce is uncanny.)  Archerd swallows\nnervously.\n\nARCHERD\nYou're...taking quite a chance,\nshowing up in public like this,\naren't you, Batman?\n\nBATMAN\nThe way I see it, we're all taking\nquite a chance if we let a sick\ncriminal mind like the Joker paralyze\nthis entire community with fear.\n\nAn angry MUTTERING is heard from within the Crowd.\n\nCROWD MEMBER\nSure.  He's not the one who's\ngoing to get killed...\n\nBatman's head snaps around angrily at the remark.\n\nBATMAN\nStep forward and say that to my\nface, if you've got the guts!\n\nThe Crowd hangs back, confused and frightened.  More angry muttering is\nheard, now mixed in with boos.\n\nCROWD #2\nCROWD #3\n\t\t\t\t\t Get him out of here!\nGo home, Batman!\n\nThe boos grow louder and defiant, as Gordon hurries to the fake\nBatman's side and Thorne smiles thinly at the imposter.\n\nTHORNE\nIt seems you're not exactly the\npeople's choice anymore, Batman...\n\nGORDON\n(at Batman)\nC'mon.  Let me get you out of here\nbefore these gentle people tear you\nup into little pieces...\n\nGordon leads a reluctant Batman away through the jeering Crowd.

A stern-faced Thorne plays to his audience for all\nhe's worth.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nWhat the Batman just did was inex-\ncusable.  Perhaps even criminal.\nBut he's right about one thing.  No\ncheap hoodlum is going to intimidate\nRupert Thorne while I still have the\nsaliva to spit on him!  My ticket\nsays seat E-6, and that's where I'm\nparking my keyster for the next\nfew hours!\n(pause; low voice)\nAnd I call upon His Honor, the\nMayor, to join me in the audience.\n\nThe Crowd looks over to the side of the lobby:\n\nGOTHAM'S MAYOR emerges from a group of onlookers.  A grey-haired man\nwho is visibly terrified, he swallows hard.\n\nMAYOR\nCouncilman Thorne is right, of\ncourse.  And I expect every other\ndecent citizen of Gotham City to\nstand up and be counted.\n\nThe Mayor silently starts up the stairs to the mezzanine.  After a\nbeat, Thorne theatrically extends his arm to Silver who hesitates, then\nreluctantly joins him.  They start for the orchestra section as others\nin the Crowd begin to follow.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nWatching Silver disappear.  His jaw twitches.\n\nINT. OPERA MEZZANINE - NIGHT\n\nBruce and Alfred head for their box.  The Mayor approaches from the\nother direction, now escorted by Gordon and a phalanx of Police.

A loud ovation is heard.\n\nWIDE SHOT - AUDIENCE\n\nThe audience is on its feet, facing away from the stage, applauding the\nMayor in his box.  The Mayor lifts his arms in a victory salute.  The\napplause dies down.  The lights dim.  The Overture to I Pagliacci is\nheard, O.S.   CAMERA RISES past the Mayor and his party to the hanging\nchandelier directly above him.

With a magnificent voice, he\nreaches for a \"High C\", hits it strongly and purely, holds on to the\nnote.\n\nANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX\n\nThe Mayor and his party exchange impressed glances.  CAMERA PUSHES IN\nON the chandelier teardrop.  It trembles from the force of the High C -\nnow cracks.  The liquid drips down into the box.\n\nBACK TO STAGE\n\nThe sad aria is ending.  Canio is on his knees, sobbing.  He sings\npianissimo, milking every heart-breaking second.  Suddenly - O.S. - a\nchuckle.  Then the sound of laughter.  Canio peers angrily into the\naudience.\n\nANGLE ON AUDIENCE\n\nConfused, then irritated, as the laughter grows louder.\n\nANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX\n\nThe Mayor and his Party guffaw loudly, pounding their chairs in glee.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nBruce rises from his seat, concerned.\n\nBACK TO MAYOR\n\nTears of laughter stream down the Mayor's cheeks.

Panicking.  As:\n\nANGLE ON STAGE\n\nThe huge clown drum suddenly rips apart from the center.  The Joker\nsteps out, dressed as an obese soprano.\n\nJOKER\nWait!

On it - a new version of the battering ram.  Bruce picks it\nup, smiles bitterly, carries it in one hand as he continues to wander,\npassing the crime lab section.\n\nSuddenly - he lashes out - sends the battering ram flying through a set\nof glass beakers filled with chemicals.  Swinging it wildly now, he\ndestroys a section of the crime lab, then sinks heavily into a chair,\nhead bowed.\n\nEXTREME WIDE ANGLE\n\nThe cavernous Batcave.

His body is encased in\nseveral layers of exercise clothes, deeply stained by perspiration,\nthat turn him into a human pressure cooker.  His legs churn like\ndisassociated pistons.\n\nBACK TO ALFRED\n\nThe telephone continues to RING.  Alfred turns, still distracted by the\nsight of Bruce and answers it.\n\nALFRED\n(into phone)\nMr. Wayne's residence...I'm sorry, he's\nnot available...No, as I told you previ-\nously, I don't know when that would be,\nbut if you'd care to leave another\nmessage...\n\nINT. CITY HALL OFFICE - DAY\n\nCAMERA CLOSE on the door to an inner office marked:  Special Assistant\nto the Mayor - Private.\n\nThe door opens as Silver exits into her outer office, followed by\nseveral NEEDY-LOOKING CONSTITUENTS.\n\nSILVER\n...I'll take it up with Mayor\nThorne.  Gotham needs an effective\nnetwork of daycare centers, and\ntomorrow night's charity opening of\nthe circus seems like a good place\nto start.\n\nThe Constituents thank her profusely.  Silver crosses to her\nSECRETARY's desk with a hopeful look.\n\nSILVER\nAny luck?\n\nSECRETARY\nNada.  Mr. Wayne seems to be perma-\nnently...unavailable.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nWayne Manor seems deserted under the glow of the moon.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE IN POOL\n\nThe Olympic-sized Wayne Manor swimming pool is illuminated by the glow\nof outdoor lights.  In it:  Bruce swims laps, knifing through the water\nwith powerful strokes.\n\nEXT. POOL - CLOSE ON BRUCE - NIGHT\n\nBruce churns through the water, eyes glazed with a total single-\nmindedness.  His speed is Olympian.  As he tilts his head to take\nanother gulp of air, he suddenly stops dead in the water as he sees:\n\nANGLE ON SILVER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nSilver emerges from the darkness, her glistening hair cascading down\nover an evening dress.  She carries a wooden tray with two glasses of\nchampagne on it, smiles as she faces a stunned Bruce who stands waist-\nhigh in the water.\n\nSILVER\nYou know, Bruce, you simply must\npick up your phone messages.\n\nBRUCE\n(careful pause)\nIf I did - what would they say?\n\nSILVER\nThat we were supposed to have dinner\ntonight.\n\nSilver smiles, kicks off her shoes.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nFor some strange reason, I thought you\nmight suddenly have an evening free.\n\n\nBRUCE\nSilver...look...\n(with difficulty)\nI...hope you won't misunderstand\nwhat I'm about to say...\n\nSILVER\nThere aren't going to be any more\nMisunderstandings between us, Bruce.\nAnd I warn you.\n\nSilver slowly and calmly begins walking down the steps into the pool,\ncarrying the tray with her.  The water rises above the hemline of her\nevening dress, heading up for her waist as she advance toward as\nastonished Bruce.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nI can be a very determined person.\n\nSilver arrives at Bruce, the water now up to her chest, letting the\nwooden tray with the champagne float on the surface next to them.  She\nhands him a glass, takes the other herself, raises it, stares deeply\ninto his eyes.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nTo no more misunderstandings.\n\nBruce smiles in spite of himself, tosses back his champagne, then\nstudies her unwavering gaze carefully.  Flipping the glass over his\nhead, he suddenly pulls her toward him, locking her in a passionate,\nhungry kiss.\n\nThey finally break.  Silver purrs, whispers into his ear.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nThere...see what I mean about mis-\nunderstandings?\n\nBRUCE\nNo.  What?\n\nSILVER\nWell just now - a moment ago - I\nthought you were being rude, not\ngetting out of the pool to say hello.\n(looks down; grins)\nI didn't realize you weren't wearing\na bathing suit.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nBruce lies naked under powder-blue silk sheets.  A lovely hand comes\nINTO FRAME, gently strokes his cheek.\n\nSILVER (O.S.)\nWhen I think of how many nights I've\nreached across an empty pillow, hoping\nmy hand would find that face...\n\nThen - a shining mane of hair as Silver, also naked, wraps him in a\ntight embrace.  They kiss.\n\nBRUCE\nThere's so much to explain.  And I'm\nnot quite sure I ever can.\n\nSILVER\nI don't need explanations.  I just\nwant whatever it was to evaporate.\nto simple disappear...\n\nShe rolls over, looks at him carefully.  A Police siren is heard\nfaintly in the distance.  Bruce blinks.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nDid you ever meet him?\n\nBRUCE\nWho?\n\nSILVER\nThe Batman.\n(smiles)\nEvery time I hear a siren.  I think\nof the Batman.\n\nBRUCE\nI...ran into him a few times.  Here\nand there.\n\nSilver smiles down tenderly, studying him.\n\nSILVER\nYou know...that night at the opera.  I\nnever believed that the real Batman\nwould show up like that in public -\nnot when he knew someone else's life\nwas on the line.\n\nBRUCE\n(deadly stare)\nYou're right.  He wouldn't.\n\nBruce suddenly breaks eye contact, unsure if she thinks she's talking\nabout Batman or to Batman.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nYou...met him too one night, didn't\nyou?  Commissiner Gordon told me he\ntook you home or something.\n\nSILVER\n(smiles; remembers)\nOr something.\n(pause)\nWhat can I say?  He was dashing, re-\nsourceful, strong - very sweet in\nhis own special way - all the\nthings you'd expect from the Batman.\n(grins)\nThe next morning I told Rupert I'd\nfallen madly in love with him.\n\nBRUCE\nYou don't say.\n\nSILVER\n(penetrating gaze)\nAnd what's more - I told Rupert I\nwas sure that the Batman...had\nfallen in love with me.\n\nThey look deeply into each other's eyes.  Silver smiles.\n\nBRUCE\nI...think I'm jealous.\n\nSILVER\nI think I'm in love.\n\nThey wrap themselves in each other passionately.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM CIRCUS GROUNDS - NIGHT\n\nA billboard:  THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH.  Featuring - The Flying\nGraysons.  All new spectacular extravaganza - THE GLORY THAT WAS ROME.\nPast the billboard is a maze of smaller tents for sideshows, the\nhousing of animals, etc.  Past the - the big top itself.\n\nCAMERA PANS the arriving SPECTATORS, Bruce and Silver among them.  They\nare surrounded by mothers and children.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's almost immoral, you know.\nGoing to the circus without bringing\nyour own children along.\n\nSILVER\nDon't worry.  I've made plans for\nthe next time.\n\nBruce looks over, alarmed.  Silver grins.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nLighten up.  My sister has two kids.\n\nINT. BIG TOP - NIGHT\n\nA major parade (The Glory That Was Rome) is filing out.  Pretty GIRLS\nin togas ride elephants.  Handsome CHARIOTEERS drive by, GLADIATORS\nwith trained bears, etc.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nAnd there you have it, ladies and\ngentlemen, The Glory That Was Rome!\n\nANGLE ON AUDIENCE\n\nBruce and Silver sit in the audience applauding.  He eats popcorn.  She\nmunches on cotton candy.\n\nANGLE ON BIG TOP ENTRANCE\n\nA dozen CLOWNS of every shape and variety run into the arena, squirting\nwater at each other through toy guns, roughhousing, doing pratfalls,\netc., all to the delight of the Crowd.\n\nANGLE INTO ARENA FROM TUNNEL\n\nInside an entrance tunnel, CAMERA HOLDS behind the outline of a black-\ncowled head with pointed ears!  The head lowers OUT OF FRAME, then\nreappears, this time covered by a CLOWN MASK!\n\nThe Clown Figure hurries out of the tunnel, wearing a floor-lengthed\ngranny dress.\n\nBACK TO ARENA\n\nSeveral of the other Clowns have dispersed, running up into the\naudience as a DRUM ROLL is heard.  The Granny Clown edges over toward\nthe cage containing the big cats.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nOne Clown runs up the aisle past them with what seems to be a bucket of\nwater, spots Silver, flings the contents of the bucket at her!  Bruce\nand Silver flinch as a SHOWER OF CONFETTI blankets them to general\nlaughter and applause.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nNow let me direct your attention to\nthe trapeze and high wire.  Out\nstars of the evening - The Flying\nGraysons!\n\nANGLE ON GRAYSONS\n\nA family of aerialists.  The older Graysons, trim and athletic, stand\non one platform.  Their son, DICK, stands on the other.  He is in his\nmiddle teens, a handsome young man in immaculate physical shape.  He\ntakes hold of a trapeze, swings down.\n\nANGLE ON STANDS\n\nThe Clown who poured the confetti on Bruce and Silver watches through\npancake makeup with more than a passing interest.  Protruding from\nunderneath a large silly hat:  we see the edges of a startling green\nshock of hair.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nDick Grayson swings on the trapeze in a long, powerful arc, executes a\ndifficult flip into the arms of his father.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBRUCE\nRemarkable.  That young boy's one of\nthe greatest natural aerialists I've\never seen.\n\nSILVER\nOh?  I didn't realize you were so\nfamiliar with the sport.\n\nSilver gives Bruce a sideways look which he avoids.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nAnd now Dick Grayson will attempt to\nperform the incredible \"Quadruple!\"\nWithout a net!  He is the only flier\nin the world to accomplish this feet!\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nA DRUM ROLL is heard.  Dick swings down, picking up momentum, then back\nup, then down again.  On his third pass, he tries it:  revolves\ndizzyingly - MAKING FOUR COMPLETE SOMERSAULTS IN MID-AIR!  (Note:\nThere is, actually, only one person in the world who can do this, with\nRingling Bros.)  Dick completes the impossible feat to wild applause.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nOn their feet, applauding enthusiastically with the Crowd.\n\nANGLE ON CLOWN (JOKER)\n\nThe Clown (Joker) giggles under his breath, lifts one billowing sleeve\nof his oversized costume, begins to unbutton it.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nThe Graysons will now perform their\nworld-famous maneuver on the high-\nwire - passing each other and\nexchanging positions - all without\na net!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nBoth starring up, wide-eyed.\n\nANGLE ON GRAYSONS\n\nThe older Graysons stand at either end of a high wire some seventy feet\noff the ground.  They each hold a long balancing pole, now start\nforward toward each other.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nDick looks up from below, nervous but proud.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nThe slightest vibration - the\ntiniest misstep - could send them\nboth plunging to their death.\n\nBACK TO GRAYSONS\n\nInching forward toward each other along the taut wire, using their\nbalancing poles for support.\n\nANGLE ON JOKER\n\nAll eyes are riveted on the Graysons.  The Joker opens the billowing\nsleeve of his clown costume.  Popping out:  A LIVE FALCON.  It\nhesitates, then takes off!\n\nBACK TO GRAYSONS\n\nThey're face to face now, on the wire, preparing to pass each other\nabove the hushed Crowd.  Suddenly - the falcon flies into view, lands\nheavily on one end of the male Grayson's pole with a SHRIEK!  The\nsurprised man teeters - the wire trembles - the falcon suddenly flies\nat his face!  Both Grayson's tumble off the wire together, plummet\ndownward.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nAs his parents hit the ground heavily in front of him.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nSilver screams in horror.  Bruce stares unbelievingly.\n\nANGLE NEAR BIG CAT CAGE\n\nSuddenly:  the Granny Clown standing by the big cat cage rips his mask\naway!  The dress falls to the ground, revealing:\n\nTHE BATMAN!\n\nQUICK CUTS\n\n1. The Crowd gasps.\n\n2. Bruce gapes in disbelief as Silver watches him.\n\n3. Dick Grayson looks over from the bodies of his parents.\n\n4. The Joker grins.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nThe Batman stares coldly, speaks in a icily clear voice.\n\nBATMAN\nI've risked my life to help this\ncity.  I stood up for what I knew\nwas right because I thought you\npeople were willing to stand with\nme.  Well, now you can pay for your\ncowardice.  Now I don't care how\nmany have to die.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND CROWD\n\nAn angry MURMURING rumbles through the Crowd.\n\nCROWD #1\nCROWD #2\n\t\t  Stop him!\nDon't let him get away!\n\nBruce vaults into the aisle, lunges down the steps after the fake\nBatman as:\n\nCLOSE ON JOKER\n\nThe Joker takes off his huge clown nose, throws it into the arena - a\ngiant smoke bomb!\n\nAll over the arena, OTHER CLOWNS follow suit.  The big top has become a\nscene of impenetrable chaos as:\n\nTHE FAKE BATMAN OPENS THE DOOR TO THE BIG CATS CAGE!  Lions, tigers, et\nal., bound off their perches for freedom, rushing out of the cage to\nthe SCREAMS of the Crowd.\n\nThe fake Batman disappears into an enveloping wall of smoke.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nKnifing his way through the panicked Spectators, lunging through the\nsmoke after the fake Batman.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nSilver stumbles after Bruce through the pandemonium, reaching the empty\ncat cage, gasping for breath with teary eyes.\n\nSILVER\nBruce...?  Bruce!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nNearby.  Spotting her.  Eyes widening in horror!\n\nBRUCE\nSilver, look out!\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nA HUGE TIGER SNARLS, preparing to spring at her!  It launches itself\ninto mid-air as:\n\nBruce flies at Silver from the other direction, pulling her down to the\nground as the enormous cat sails over them, banging its head into the\ncage bars, knocking itself senseless.\n\nBruce pulls Silver to her feet, wraps a protective arm around her,\nleads her off through the smoky panic and confusion.\n\nANGLE ON DICK GRAYSON\n\nDick kneels protectively over the bodies of his parents, oblivious to\nthe insanity around him.  Spectators and Animals rush past in all\ndirections as he removes his aerialist's cape, then gently covers the\nfaces of his Mother and Father.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA LOOKS DOWN on the aftermath.  Police cars and ambulances\neverywhere.  Smoke still drifts from the big top.  Dazed PATRONS mill\naround looking for lost family members.\n\nANGLE NEAR BIG TOP ENTRANCE\n\nSilver emerges from a medical tent marked by a red cross, sporting a\nheavily bandaged hand.  She spots Alfred and the Rolls Royce near the\nentrance to the big top, walks over.\n\nSILVER\nThe doctor says no more crap games\nfor a week or so, Alfred...\n(stops; looks)\nWhere's Bruce?\n\nALFRED\n(hesitantly)\nMr. Wayne wondered...if you'd be good\nenough to let me drive you home.\n\nSILVER\nDrive me...\n\nShe looks off into the big top:\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE - HER P.O.V.\n\nBruce stands motionless in the dark shadows at one end of the tent.  He\nstares across the arena:\n\nANGLE ON DICK - BRUCE'S P.O.V.\n\nDick Grayson sits alone in the corner, head bowed.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce's eyes are filled with tears.\n\nBACK TO SILVER\n\nSilver watches, somehow feeling the deep significance of the moment\nwithout the specifics.  She turns to Alfred quietly, nods, gets in the\ncar.\n\nINT. TENT - CLOSE ON DICK\n\nDick is slumped, his head still bowed.  Tears roll down his cheeks.\nSuddenly - a dark shadow inches across his face, almost blacking it\nout.  He looks up.\n\nBruce stands over him, peering down, looking deeply into him with a\nmesmerizing stare.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat will you do now, son?\n\nDICK\nI...don't know.  They were my only\nfamily.  I...I...\n\nHe bursts into tears.  Bruce grabs him, holds him tightly.\n\nBRUCE\nI know exactly how you feel, son.\nYou may not believe that - but I do.\n\nBruce gazes down darkly, almost hypnotically, his eyes revealing the\ntruth.  Dick looks up slowly, riveted.\n\nSuddenly:  WE HEAR the sound of ANGRY MURMURING from a CROWD - then,\nthe RAPPING of a Judge's gavel, silencing them.\n\nINT. GOTHAM COURTHOUSE - DAY\n\nCAMERA PANS DOWN from the symbol of Justice with her scales, painted on\nthe Gotham Courthouse ceiling.\n\nJUDGE (O.S.)\nI find you guilty of wanton negli-\ngence against society.  Of knowingly\ncausing the death of an innocent\nhuman being.\n\nA black-robbed JUDGE reads the verdict to a courthouse full of\nSPECTATORS, but an empty defense table.  The witness chair is also\nempty.  Alone at the prosecution table - Rupert Thorne.\n\nJUDGE (CONT'D)\nOf usurping the authority of those\nlegally sworn in to uphold law and\norder.  The time has come to be rid\nof you and your reckless vigilantism.\n\nBruce and Gordon sit in the front row.  Bruce's eyes reveal more\nemotion than he would care to.  The Judge turns to face the empty\nwitness chair.\n\nJUDGE (CONT'D)\nBatman - you have been tried in\nabsentia and found guilty of murder.\nYou are sentenced to death.\n(looks)\nMayor Thorne...\n\nThorne rises, pompous and grave.\n\nTHORNE\nYour Honor, this is a tragic day in\nthe history of Gotham.  A once-\nadmired champion of the people has\nnow become a threat to their very\nexistence.  A lethal weapon dealing\nin indiscriminate death.  Therefore,\nto prevent further carnage, I've in-\nstructed Commissioner Gordon and his\ndepartment to bring in the Batman by\nwhatever means necessary.\n\nThorne sits.  The stunned Spectators begin to murmur loudly.\n\nGORDON\nThe Batman.  A killer.  Who'd\nbelieve it...?\nBRUCE\nI still don't.\n\nGORDON\nBruce I deal in facts.  And the simple\nfact is - you're looking at one poor\nsonofabitch who made a deal with the\ndevil.\n\nBruce stares blankly at the witness chair.  The Judge pounds his gavel\nfor silence.

WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nAs Dick enters with Bruce:  the towering hallway of Wayne Manor is\nfilled with balloons and a banner reading:  \"WELCOME HOME, DICK.\"\nSilver grins down from the staircase.\n\nDick drinks it all in, slightly uneasy and embarrassed.  He wanders\ninto the enormous living room, unsure, visually adjusting himself to\nhis new, outsized life.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nCAMERA PANS ACROSS a fully outfitted trapeze and ring set on the lawn\nof Wayne Manor.  Bruce gazes up proudly at it, looks over to Dick for\nhis reaction.\n\nDick looks up at the apparatus somewhat apprehensively, then flashes\nBruce a self-conscious smile.  Bruce understands, claps a hand on his\nshoulder, leads him away.\n\nEXT. POOLSIDE - DAY\n\nDick lies sunning himself on a chaise by the pool.  Suddenly, a large,\nwet beach ball lands on his stomach.  He pops up, looks off toward the\npool:\n\nBruce and Silver laugh from inside the pool, gesture at Dick to come\nand join them.  He gives them a half-hearted smile, shakes his head,\nthen tosses the ball back.\n\nSilver looks at Bruce with concern.\n\nINT.

You've been wonder-\nful to me.  It's my fault you've\nhad to try so hard.  It's...\n(eyes misting)\nIt's just that I still hurt so much\nsometimes...and then I remember, and\nI get so filled with...hate again.\n\nBRUCE\nHate?\n\nDick's eyes harden.  His face sets with a cold look, not unlike that of\na young Bruce Wayne when he faced Joe Chill.\n\nDICK\nI made a promise to myself the day my\nparents died.  A promise that someday\n-- somehow - I'm going to keep.\n\nBruce's eyes flick over carefully.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat did you promise?\n\nDICK\nI'm going to kill the Batman.\n\nThere is a long silence.  Bruce smiles tentatively.\n\nBRUCE\nThat's a pretty tall order.\n\nDICK\nWe'll see.  I have the rest of my\nlife to get it done.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat if he's...skipped town?  Given\nthe whole thing up?  Died, even.  No\none ever knew who he was in the\nfirst place.  You can't dedicate\nyour whole life to killing a ghost.\n\nDICK\nI thought you'd understand when you\ntold me how your parents were\nkilled.  Didn't you feel the same way?\n\nBRUCE\n(avoiding his gaze)\nWell I was younger than you are,\nand...\n\nDICK\n(pressing him)\nDidn't you hate?  Didn't you want\nto do something about it?\n\nBRUCE\n(pause)\nYes.  For a while.  But then I...\n(looks down)\n...realized how fruitless it was.\n\nDICK\nWell that's not going to happen to\nme!\n\nDick rises from the table, looks over with total, piercing sincerity,\nhis eyes misting over again.\n\nDICK (CONT'D)\nListen, I'm...grateful for every-\nthing you've done for me - and for\nall you intend to do.  But if you\ncan't live with my promise, accept\nit, support it, even - then maybe\nwe've both made a mistake.\n(eyes glistening)\nMay I be excused now?\n\nBruce stares back, deeply moved, almost whispers.\n\nBRUCE\nYes.  Of course you can.\n\nDick hurries out the door.  Bruce grits his teeth, crumples up his\nnapkin, squeezing it into a tiny ball.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nDamn.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM INTERSECTION - NIGHT\n\nRupert Thorne walks briskly down the street, hat tipped low over his\nface, coat collar turned up against the night wind.

JOKER'S LAIR - NIGHT\n\nThe Joker speaks into a microphone attached to a tiny transmitting set.\n\nA VIDEO SCREEN above shows Thorne standing by the mailbox.\n\nNOTE:  THIS SCENE TO BE INTERCUT AS REQUIRED:\n\nJOKER\nThat's what I felt like twenty years\nago, Thorne.  When I decided to start\noff your political career with a\n\"bang.\"  Remember Thomas Wayne?\n\nTHORNE\n(cold pause)\nEvery time I see his son.\n\nJOKER\nNo regrets now, Mr. Mayor.  It's\ntaken me too long to maneuver us\ninto a position of total control in\nthis city.  I've got the judges\nlined up, the public at your feet...\n(cold pause)\nYou owe me, Rupert Thorne.\n\nTHORNE\nIt's a two-way street.  Once I\nrelieve Commissioner Gordon of his\nduties, you'll have a free rein in\nGotham - less my cut.  And now that\nit's legal to shoot the Batman...\n\nJOKER\nWe have to find him first.  So far,\nit's been like looking for a virgin\nin a maternity ward.\n\nTHORNE\nThen don't find him.  Let him find\nYou.\n\nJOKER\nHow?

I...want\nyou to kidnap her.\n\nJOKER\nNow take my wife - please...\n\nTHORNE\nThe girl is not to be harmed.  Once\nyou've killed Batman and made your\nescape - I'll call the police and\nrescue her.\n\nJOKER\nHer knight in shining armor.\n\nTHORNE\nSomething like that.\n\nJOKER\nI underestimated you, Thorne.  I always\nknew you were corrupt, but I had no\nidea you'd turn out to be such a\ndelightfully repellent human being.\n\nThe Joker cackles insanely.  Thorne spots someone coming, closes the\nslot, hurries off.\n\nAfter a beat, an ANCIENT WOMAN approaches the mailbox with a handful of\nletters.  She lowers the slot.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\n(outraged)\nDo you mind?  I'll never get these\npictures developed!\n\nThe Woman SCREAMS!  Her letters go flying up in the air as she hustles\ndown the street.

WAYNE MANOR STUDY - NIGHT\n\nAlfred is tidying up the study, turns as Dick appears.\n\nDICK\nAll right if I make a sandwich in\nthe kitchen, Alfred?\n\nALFRED\nWhy certainly, Master Grayson.  If I\nmay be of help...\n\nDICK\n(grin)\nI think I can handle it.  Thanks.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT\n\nBruce sits at the computer, runs through a criminal history of the\nJoker on the video screen.  He pauses, looks off.\n\nANGLE ON BATPHONE\n\nThe red Batphone lights up, then dies.  Lights up, then dies.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring.  Unsure.\n\nINT. WAYNE STUDY - NIGHT\n\nAlfred reaches to turn off the desk lamp.  Suddenly, the light from the\nlamp rises, then dies.  Rises, then dies.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThorne sits, Batphone in hand, waits.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce crosses to the phone.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred presses the button under the desk.  The bottom drawer pops open.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce picks up the phone, listens.\n\nBACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE\n\nTHORNE\nBatman?\n(no reply)\nBatman - if you're there - this is\nMayor Rupert Thorne.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce listens silently, frowning.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred holds the extension, listens in as well.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nNOTE:  THIS CONVERSATION TO BE INTERCUT BETWEEN THORNE, BRUCE, AND\nALFRED AS REQUIRED:\n\nTHORNE\nThis...isn't easy for me, Batman,\nconsidering what I've said and done\nwhere you're concerned.  But I love\nSilver St. Cloud very much - and I\nhave reason to believe you do too.\n\nBruce and Alfred react in their respective locations.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI...dropped by to have a drink with\nher tonight.  The door was open,\nthere were signs of a struggle, and\nshe was gone.  The Joker left a\nplaying card - addressed to you.\n\nBruce's face sets darkly.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\n\"Dear Batman.  Crime fighters may come\nand go, but I carry on in the Great\nAmerican Tradition of violence.  I'm\ncalling my little caper, Slaughter In\nSilver.  Sorry I have to run now.\nWrite if you get work.\"\n\nBruce's eyes narrow, thinking.  Thorne's voice begins to crack\nemotionally over the phone.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI...don't know where they took her\n...or why the note was left for you.\nI only know that Silver means more\nthan my life to me, and I beg you to\nfind her and save her.  You're her\nonly chance, Batman, I...\n\nThorne's voice dies away theatrically.  He hangs up.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce hangs up, stares coldly.  His jaw twitches.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred hangs up in the study, worried.\n\nBACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE\n\nThorne takes a deep breath, smiles, rises, exits.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nDick has made his sandwich, closes the refrigerator door, starts off\nfor the hallway.\n\nANGLE ON HALLWAY ENTRANCE\n\nDick enters the dark hallway, starts for the stairs as he sees:\n\nANGLE ON ALFRED - HIS P.O.V.\n\nAlfred rushes out of the study, heading for the living room.  He slips,\nfalls heavily, picks himself up, oblivious to the pain, rushes into the\nliving room.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nWatching.  He starts for the stairs, then stops, now curiously heads\nfor the living room himself.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nDick enters, look around in amazement:  Alfred is nowhere to be seen!\nHis eyes scan the room for any other exit.\n\nANGLE ON GRANDFATHER CLOCK - DICK'S P.O.V.\n\nThe tall grandfather clock stands against one wall.  A thin shaft of\nlight seems to be emanating from behind it.\n\nDick advances to the clock, looks down, puzzled.  It seems to be\nstanding at a slight angle away from the wall.  Exploring the edge of\nthe clock with his hand, he starts to pull back.  The clock swivels,\nrevealing:\n\nANGLE DOWN INTO BATCAVE - DICK'S P.O.V.\n\nThe Batcave - with all its trophies, computers - in all its regal\nsplendor.  Alfred is standing near the gleaming Batmobile, looks off\nwith concern.\n\nNow emerging from the shadows - THE BATMAN!  Dressed in his full\nregalia, heading quickly toward Alfred and the Batmobile.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nStaring down, his jaw slack.  Stunned.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT\n\nBatman crosses to Alfred, who stares with deadly concern.\n\nALFRED\nDon't go, Sir.\n\nBATMAN\nPlease get out of my way, Alfred.\n\nALFRED\nSince when have you trusted Rupert\nThorne?  You don't even know where\nyou're meant to be going.\n\nBATMAN\nThe clues in the note were obvious.\nThe \"Great American Tradition\" line?\nThat's the name of this year's series\nof exhibits at the Gotham Museum.\nAnd \"Write if you get work\"?  This\nmonth it's on American writers and\nWriting.\n\nALFRED\nIf the clues are that obvious, they\nmust want you to come.  It's a\ntrap, can't you see that?\n\nBATMAN\nThat boy up there thinks the Batman\nkilled his parents.  I told him he\ncouldn't live his whole life chasing\na ghost.  What I realize now is - I\ncan't live the rest of my life\nbeing a ghost.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nListening at the top of the stairs.  Thunderstruck.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nBatman puts an arm on Alfred's shoulder.\n\nBATMAN\nIf I come back, old friend, I'll\nexplain things to Dick.  Tell him\nthe truth and have the Joker to\nprove it.\n(pause)\nAnd if I don't - take care of him,\nAlfred.  He'll be in much better\nhands than he has been in mine.\n\nAlfred silently steps aside as Batman enters the Batmobile, roars off\nthrough the cave.\n\nAlfred pauses sadly, then turns back, heading for the staircase again.\nHe looks up.\n\nANGLE ON DICK - ALFRED'S P.O.V.\n\nDick stands at the top of the stairs, staring down, grimly determined,\nhis face carved in granite.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM ROOFTOPS - NIGHT\n\nBatman's silhouette as he leaps and glides effortlessly across the tops\nof buildings.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\nThe deserted museum with the billboard:  GREAT AMERICAN TRADITIONS.\nThis month:  American Writers and Writing.\n\nEXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT\n\nThe museum roof is a network of vaulted glass skylights.  TWO THUGS\nstand on a surrounding catwalk.\n\nCLOSE ON CATWALK\n\nA sharp metallic \"ping\" is heard across the catwalk.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Thugs look up.  One pulls a gun.\n\nTHUG\nThe Batman...\n\nBATMAN'S VOICE\nCount on it.\n\nThey wheel.  Batman stands directly behind them.  He grabs the first\nThug, swivels him as the second Thug fires - killing his partner.\nBatman shoves the dead man into the second Thug, as both bodies crash\ndown through the glass skylight.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - UP ANGLE - NIGHT\n\nThe bodies explode through the glass, falling some sixty feet to the\nfloor.  Then - total silence.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStaring down through the broken glass.  Listening.  He pulls a tiny\nrevolver from his belt.  A barbed metal dart sticks out of the barrel.\nBatman aims it through the hole, fires.\n\nANGLE ON MUSEUM RAFTERS\n\nThe dart embeds itself deeply into a rafter.  Attached to it is a white\nnylon cord.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nSecuring the other end of the cord.  He hooks himself to it with a\nclip, glides through the opening in the glass.\n\nBACK TO RAFTERS\n\nBatman shoots silently along the cord to a rafter, lands gracefully,\nlooks down.\n\nANGLE DOWN ON MUSEUM - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThrough the dim, eerie light.  This exhibit (like the one including the\ngiant penny) consists of huge, outsized version of everyday items.  In\nthis case - the tools of a writer's trade:  enormous pencils, erasers,\nquill pens, fountain pens, ink wells, a ten-foot-high pencil sharpener,\ntall volumes of famous American novels, etc.\n\nIn the center of the display - a giant electric typewriter, some thirty\nfeet wide.  A huge sheet of blank white paper is rolled up on it.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStaring down curiously through the silent darkness.  His gaze starts to\nwander, then suddenly spots something.\n\nBACK TO TYPEWRITER\n\nA FIGURE attached to the typewriter now moves.  It is Silver, hooked\nonto the ribbon near the center of the page.  She moans, still\nrecovering from the effects of the drugs.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nEyes widening.  He hooks one end of a nylon cord to a rafter, launches\nhimself, swinging down toward Silver.\n\nBACK TO RAFTER\n\nA hand with a knife reaches out, slices through the cord!\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nNow plummeting like a rock.  He falls into the typewriter in front of\nSilver, his cape suddenly catching on something, partially ripping it,\njerking him to a stop.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe lights are turned on.  Emerging from behind or under the various\nexhibits:  thirty or forty GOONS.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman hangs helplessly from the circular element ball which prints out\nthe characters on the page.  His cape is caught on the projected edge\nof one of the giant letters.  He stares ahead, unable to extricate\nhimself.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nThe glaring lights have brought Silver back to consciousness.  Hooked\nto the huge ribbon near the center of the page, she suddenly spots\nBatman across from her.\n\nSILVER\n(horrified)\nOh, my God...\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nStepping out onto the end of the carriage - the Joker!\n\nJOKER\nI knew you'd drop in, Batman.\nYou're that type of guy.\n(insane giggle)\nGet it?  Type?\n\nThe forty Goons circle in around the typewriter.  The Joker nods to two\nof them.\n\nCLOSE ON SWITCH\n\nTwo Goons give a mighty heave, flip the \"ON\" lever.  A loud hum is\nheard as the typewriter activates.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nRupert Thorne hides in the shadows behind a large pencil box, watches\nthe scene.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nYou know, you're nothing to write\nhome about, Batman - but let's give\nit a try.\n\nThe Joker points a gun down at the keyboard.\n\nJOKER\nWhat letter could be hiding under\nyour cape?  A \"D', maybe?\n\nThe Joker fires:\n\nCLOSE ON LETTER \"D\"\n\nThe bullet hits the letter \"D\", depressing it.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nThe element ball carrying Batman shifts, hurtles toward the page with\nblinding speed.  It \"cracks\" against the paper sharply, imprinting a\n\"D\".  Batman's head has stopped mere inches from the page.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nEyes welded shut - terrified.  The printing of the letter has advanced\nthe ribbon.  She is perilously close to the exact center of the page.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nNot the \"D\".  Hmm.  The most common\nletter is \"E\"...\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nThe Joker fires!  Batman flies toward the page, this time nearly\nsquashed on the other side.  A giant \"E\" has been imprinted.  Silver\nadvances one more position on the ribbon.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nAn \"A\", maybe...\n\nThe element ball spins, hurtles toward the paper again.  It splats into\nthe page, narrowly missing Batman, pushing Silver along again.\nImmediately - another shot - the ball whizzes back, prints another \"D\".\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nI know I tried the \"D\" before, but I\nsimply couldn't resist.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe message on the page reads \"DEAD\".  The trembling Silver is only one\nletter away from being obliterated.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStruggling, but helpless.  His eyes flash nervously.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nAlarmed as he sees what could happen to Silver.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nI know what letter is hidden under\nyour cape, by the way.  It's \"B\" -\nfor Batman.  But you see, I've got a\nproblem.  If I hit the letter \"B\",\nMiss St. Cloud will die, and I pro-\nmised not to kill her.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nGrim.  Pulling a gun.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nTo \"B\" or not to \"B\"...That seems to\nbe the question.  Well, I suppose\npromises - like laws - are made to\nbe broken.\n\nVOICE\nI made a promise, too, Joker.  The\nnight you killed my parents.\n\nQUICK CUTS:\n\nThorne looks up.  Silver looks up.  Batman looks up.  The Joker looks\nup.\n\nANGLE ON ROBIN - THEIR P.O.V.\n\nDick Grayson stands high in the rafters.\n\nDICK\nI promised to wipe filthy crud like\nyou off the face of the earth.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nShoot him!\n\nThere is a hail of gunfire as Dick flies down through the air toward\nthe typewriter.\n\nDick lands on the \"TAB\" key.  The carriage releases, shoots across the\ntypewriter, carrying the Joker with it.  He flies off the end, crashes\nsickeningly into the wall, drops to the floor, unconscious.\n\nDick bounces off the \"TAB\", flies across the keyboard, lands on the\n\"SHIFT\" key.\n\nDICK\nThat ought to give you a lift,\nBatman!\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nThe \"SHIFT\" swivels the element ball 180-degress to expose the capital\nletters.  Batman is swung to the front, grabs the carriage, pulls\nhimself up, looks down as Dick launches himself into a pile of Goons\nlike a human dynamo.\n\nBATMAN\nLeave a few for me, son!\n\nBatman leaps off the carriage, joins Dick in the fray.\n\nNOTE:  The fight which follows will be outrageous and thrilling, but\nshould look physically believable.  The Dynamic Duo will overpower the\ngang using the following elements and devices:\n\nA. Dick flinging Goons back into the pointed tips of quill pens.\n\nB. Batman lifting a fountain pen lever, firing a river of ink at an\nonrushing group.\n\nC. Both of them using springy, huge erasers as launching platforms.\n\nD. Oversized volumes of literature slamming shut on the villains.\n\nE. Enormous bookmarks and letter openers swung as clubs, knocking out\nthree or four crooks at a time.\n\nF. Heavies being hurled into huge, deep ink wells, turning them sopping\nblack wet, unable to climb out again.\n\nG. Dick bashing a pair of Thugs back into the side of the giant pencil\nsharpener.  They slam back against the \"ON\" button, activating it.\n\nDuring the chaos, Rupert Thorne has made his way down the typewriter's\nsteel bar which holds the paper to the roller.  He unhooks Silver,\nlifts her to safety.\n\nSILVER\nRupert?  What...\n\nTHORNE\nDon't talk.  Let's go.\n\nThe fight continues as Rupert and Silver run down the bar, drop off the\ntypewriter, cross the floor through the furious melee, heading for the\ndoor.  Batman rounds the corner of a giant book.  Silver spots him,\nstops.\n\nSILVER\nBatman?...Batman!...\n\nThorne yanks at her.  She tries to pull away, sees two Goons coming up\nbehind Batman.\n\nSILVER\nBruce!  Look out!\n\nBatman ducks, rolls, trips the Goons, knocks their heads together.\nSilver rushes toward him as Thorne pulls a gun, realizing.\n\nTHORNE\nBruce...Bruce Wayne...\n\nBATMAN\nSilver!  Get away!\n\nDick has bashed a Goon backwards - he careens across the floor, hits\nSilver from the side, knocking her into Batman as Thorne fires.\n\nCLOSE ON SILVER\n\nBlood spurts quickly across the lacy back of Silver's powder-blue slip.\nBatman hooks an arm around her, stares into her dying face, struck\ndumb.\n\nSILVER\n(trembling)\nI'm...right...aren't I...Bruce.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nHorrified.  He turns, runs.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nGiving chase.  Dodging bullets as Thorne fires at him.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nLowering Silver to the floor.  She's barely breathing.  Thorne's\ngunfire echoes through the museum.  Batman's jaw twitches.  His eyes\nflash with rage.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nDick rounds the corner of a giant prop some ten feet high off the\nfloor.  Thorne waits for him on the next prop - gun poised and ready.\nDick spots him, freezes.\n\nTHORNE\nI don't know what part you play in\nall this, kid.  But it's turned out\nto be a one-night stand.\n\nBATMAN'S VOICE\n(roaring with rage)\nMay God damn you, Rupert Thorne!\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nBatman has placed a huge, viciously sharp thumbtack in a giant rubber\nband pulled taut.  He lets it fly.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nThe thumbtack spears Thorne in the chest, topples him back across the\nprop - which is the giant pencil sharpener - he falls into the hole:  A\ndisappearing scream is cut short as Thorne is ground to death.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman kneels, cradles Silver's head in his lap.  Her eyes flutter open\npainfully.  She tries to smile.\n\nSILVER\nHello...Bruce...\n\nHe stares down, eyes filled with tears.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nMaybe...it's better, you know?\nI'd...just...get in the way...\n\nBATMAN\n(low whisper)\nDon't...\n\nSILVER\nI could...never really have you, and\n...I could never fall in love with\nsomeone else.\n\nHer eyelids tremble.  One of his tears hits her cheek softly.  She\nreaches up, gently caresses his chin.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nPoor...darling...you're the one...\nwho's...left behind...\n\nHer eyes close.  Her face relaxes, dead.  Tears stream heavily down\nBatman's cowl.\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nINT. MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\nCommissioner Gordon supervises the aftermath and cleanup,  The Joker,\nstill groggy, handcuffed, is yanked along by a COP.\n\nJOKER\nTake it easy, okay?  I get winded\nopening clams.\n\nHe is led away.  Gordon stares across the room.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman stands by Silver's body which has been placed on a gurney.  TWO\nPARAMEDICS cover her face with a blanket.\n\nBATMAN\nWait.\n\nThey stop.  He reaches in, pulls back the blanket, stares down at her\nface.  Gordon has crossed to join him.\n\nGORDON\nWhat a Goddamn shame.  You know\nwho's going to be really broken up\nabout this - Bruce Wayne.\n\nBatman turns, glances at Gordon blankly.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nThey were real close, you know.  Or\nmaybe you didn't.\n\nGordon turns, paces thoughtfully.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nBut at least you're back, I'm\nback, and all's right with this\ncrazy world for a second.  Now I\ndon't know where the hell this kid\nthey're talking about went to,\nbut...\n\nHe turns, looks.  Batman has disappeared.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - DAWN\n\nThe gurney carrying Silver's body is loaded into an ambulance.  It\ntakes off, red lights flashing, siren wailing.  The rising sun is just\nbeginning to crack the clouds on the horizon.  CAMERA WIDENS, STARTS TO\nRISE:\n\nThe ambulance becomes a tiny red dot as we now view the magnificent\ndowntown section of Gotham.\n\nCAMERA CONTINUES TO RISE, SHOOTING UP some eighty stories, then ninety,\nthen one hundred, finally revealing:\n\nWE DISSOLVE AS:\n\nThe dark, majestic figure of the Batman, standing on the top edge of\nthe tallest building in Gotham.  He looks down silently, cape billowing\nout behind him, a regal black prince surveying his steel and concrete\nrealm.\n\nNow swinging up and across from a nearby lower building:\n\nTHE IMPOSING, GRIM-FACED, COLORFUL FIGURE OF ROBIN!  Dressed in his\ngreen shirt, red vest, flowing yellow cape and black mask, he lands on\nthe roof noiselessly.\n\nBatman's eyes acknowledge his presence without turning.  Robin\nadvances, then stops silently, several paces behind.\n\nThe DYNAMIC DUO has been joined.  Both for now, and for the future\nadventures which await them in Gotham.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nTHE ENDEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1282783", "artist_names":

This must be just some huge mistake.\n\nAutomated voice\nThis is a Global-Tel link prepaid call from Adnan Syed an inmate at a Maryland Correctional facility. This call will be recorded and monitored...\n\n\n\nSarah Koenig\nFrom This American Life and WBEZ Chicago it\u2019s Serial. One story told week by week. I\u2019m Sarah Koenig.\nToday\u2019s episode is mostly going to take place in the courtroom and before we get into the arguments at trial I just want to play you this thing from Adnan\u2019s jury selection. I used to be a reporter for the Baltimore Sun and I covered some trials and if I happened to be in the courtroom for jury selection it was always such a good reminder of what living in Baltimore was like for so many people.\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. December 8, 1999. Jury selection for Adnan\u2019s first trial. Judge William Quarles asks a standard question of the jury pool.\n\nJudge William Quarles\nHave you or any close family member ever been the victim of a crime, convicted of a crime, served time for a crime, or have pending criminal charges?\nSarah Koenig\nA lot of people rise from their seats and then line up to talk to the judge. I can\u2019t tell exactly what proportion of the jury pool but it looks to be at least half.\nJudge William Quarles\nWhat did you come up to tell me?\n\nPotential Juror\nUh, my husband\u2019s son was convicted of murder.\nJudge William Quarles\nGood morning (muffled) what did you come up to tell me?\n\n\nPotential Juror\nMy house was broken into and we were robbed in the middle of the night, about six years ago.\n\n\nJudge William Quarles\nGood morning thirty-seven.\n\nPotential Juror 37\nGood morning your honour.\n\nJudge William Quarles\nWhat did you come up to tell me?\n\nPotential Juror 37\nMy husband was shot.\n\n\nPotential Random Juror #1\nI have a brother that\u2019s wanted. He\u2019s 17.\n\nPotential Random Juror #2\nIn May my parents and I were victims of an assault and in October my aunt was shot in the head.\nPotential Random Juror #3\nUh, my husband was convicted - handgun violation.\n\nPotential Random Juror #4\nMy brother was commit-- convicted of attempted murder.\n\nPotential Random Juror #5\nMy partner is a rape victim.\n\nPotential Random Juror #6\nI was robbed of a small amount of money on the street.\n\nJudge William Quarles\nNext.\n\nCourt Official\n207.\n\nJudge William Quarles\nGood morning 207. What did you come up to tell me?\n\nPotential Juror 207\nThat I have two uncles who are serving time for murder.\n\nSarah Koenig\nOne guy says, \u201cWe moved from a very peaceful town in Oregon to a violent community,\u201d and Judge Quarles says, \u201cWelcome to Baltimore.\u201d Quarles asks all these people whether they think they could still be impartial jurors on Adnan\u2019s case. Some say no and they get dismissed. Some say yes and he sends them back to their seats. He was on the lookout for prejudice, all kind of prejudice. Against cops, against prosecutors, against Koreans and against Muslims. One guy tells them he doesn\u2019t think he can be impartial because he\u2019s got a friend of the Muslim faith and he\u2019s seen him and also his son mistreat their families.\n\nPotential Juror\nA friend of mine that was Muslim faith and I seen him mistreat his family, his wife and everything. I\u2019ve seen this go on between him and his son, he got mad and he did the same thing that father did, so I just couldn\u2019t you know, to be honest with you.\n\nJudge Quarles\nOkay, I appreciate your honesty.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThis brings me to something Shamim told me when I first interviewed her, Shamim Rahman, Adnan\u2019s mother. Shamim and her husband Syed Rahman, they believe Adnan is innocent. There\u2019s no question about it for them. Adnan\u2019s father said to me, \u201cwe\u2019ve had no happiness in our family since Adnan was arrested. It\u2019s been continuous torture.\u201d\nShamim Rahman\nI don\u2019t know what to say, believe me it\u2019s like my-- I mean my whole body is like numb you know. I cannot think, nothing we know more. But all I know he didn\u2019t do it.\n\nSarah Koenig\nWhat-- how do you guys make sense of what happened? How do you explain what-- to yourselves I mean, not to the outside world, to yourselves-- how do you understand \u201cwhy?\u201d You must think about this.\n\nShamim Rahman\nBelieve me that\u2019s the only thing you know. I still believe because he was raised a Muslim. Discrimination. And everybody feel, the whole community, because he was a Muslim child that\u2019s why they took him. It was easy for them to take him, then other people. This was so--\n\nSarah Koenig\nAnd do you believe that?\n\nShamim Rahman\nOf course, yes, I believe too, yes. Because it was easy to target, you know. For them to come and pick him up. We still don\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing it, but again it\u2019s discrimination. Because we are  Muslim, and we are minor in this country. So, that\u2019s why they took Adnan.\n\nSarah Koenig\nI don\u2019t know, I mean--\nYou can hear me not believing her, right? The notion that the cops and prosecutors in this case were driven by anti-Muslim feeling, by racism, and by racism alone. That I found very hard to believe. And I still don\u2019t believe that by the way. But I didn\u2019t wanna write off what Shamim was saying either, because maybe anti-Muslimness crept in, contributed in some way to how the investigation and the prosecution operated. Advertently or inadvertently.\nShamim said she hadn\u2019t personally felt discrimination, just out in the world in Baltimore, before the trial. And she didn\u2019t feel it after, not even after 9/11. But at a hearing on Adnan\u2019s bail status on March 31, 1999, she felt it. The courthouse that day was packed with people from Adnan\u2019s mosque, The Islamic Society of Baltimore. They\u2019d raised tens of thousands of dollars for his defence, they offered to put up their own houses and other properties to secure his bail. Adnan\u2019s attorneys during the bail phase of his case were two guys name Chris Flohr and Doug Colbert, the family would hire Christina Gutierrez soon after, for trial. Chris Flohr remembers the bus loads of people who came to Adnan\u2019s bail proceedings, filling the courtroom and hallways. He said he\u2019d never seen anything like it, before or since.\n\nChris Flohr\nI remember almost every inch of the available standing space in the courthouse at the Wabash district court where the bail review happened, being full up with people. So, a lot of beards and a lot of traditional garb.\n\nDoug Colbert\nMany of the people here are people who you would almost say they\u2019re extended family, they care for each other\u2019s children, it\u2019s one of the old fashioned sense of community.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s Doug Colbert, who did the talking during this hearing.\n\nDoug Colbert\n--and so the people who are here in this courtroom represent the doctors and the teachers and the lawyers and the accountants and the correction officers as well as three religious leaders, imams, who are from different mosques here in Baltimore. So the community here Judge, is here to say first of all, that they commit themselves to promise to vow that they will not only supervise Adnan should he be released should bail be set. But at the same time they will also accompany him to court as well.\n\nSarah Koenig\nAfter he finished, the prosecutor, Vicki Wash, took that same crowd, the people Doug Colbert describes as \u201csolid respectable folk, who make sure Adnan does the right thing,\u201d Wash cast them as a room full of aiders and abettors. The same people who are likely to help Adnan run away to Pakistan, and that\u2019s why he shouldn\u2019t get bail.\n\nVicki Wash\nYour honor, the fact that the defendant has strong support from the community, that is what makes him unique in this case. He is unique because he has limitless resources, he has the resources of this entire community here. Investigation reveals that he can tap resources from Pakistan as well. It\u2019s our position your honour that if you issue a bail, then you are issuing him a passport under these circumstances to flee the country. We do not want another Sheinbein situation your honor. We are asking you-\n\nJudge David Mitchell\n(gavel) I told you I wasn\u2019t gonna take it.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s judge David Mitchell telling the big crowd to settle down. Sheinbein is Samuel Sheinbein, a kid who was accused of brutally killing another Maryland teenager in 1997 and then absconded to Israel. Ms. Wash said she talked to a Mr. Harry Marshall, a senior legal advisor for international affairs with the justice department, and Mr. Marshall had explained to her that the U.S. had tried unsuccessfully to extradite certain criminals from Pakistan.\n\nVicki Wash\n--and he cited that there is a pattern in the United States of America where young Pakistani  males have been jilted, have committed murder, and have fled to Pakistan and we have been unable to extradite them back. He gave me a specific instance that\u2019s occurring now, that\u2019s pending in Chicago, where the factual pattern is frighteningly similar. Again it\u2019s a young Pakistani male who was jilted by his girlfriend who fled the country and they have had no success and he indicated it would be a dim situation indeed if the defendant would flee to Pakistan. We have information from our investigation that the defendant has an uncle in Pakistan, and he has indicated that he can make people disappear.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThat information about the badass uncle? I think they got that from Adnan\u2019s science teacher. I\u2019m not kidding. The cops talked to this teacher on March 24 and in their notes it says the teacher, Mr. Nicholson had had Adnan as a student the year before, the word \u201cbrooding\u201d is in there, then it says suspect \u201chad an uncle in Pakistan who can make people disappear.\u201d Under that it says, they drained blood from cows at the mosque one day, he was pumped. So that odd tidbit from Mr. Nicholson ends up as an argument at Adnan\u2019s bail hearing. I couldn\u2019t find any other source for it in the detective\u2019s or State\u2019s attorney\u2019s files I looked at. Adnan\u2019s attorney made a stab at fact checking Wash\u2019s information. One thing led to another and three weeks after that hearing, Ms. Wash writes a letter to Judge Mitchell apologizing if she misled the court. She says she\u2019d misconstrued information from Mr. Harry Marshall of the Justice Department. She talked to him again and he made it clear that there was not a pattern of young Pakistani men committing murder after they\u2019d been jilted and then running off to Pakistan. And that other case she mentioned the frighteningly similar one out of Chicago \u201cthat case parallels Syed\u2019s case only that it involves a Pakistani male charged with murder where the victim was known to the defendant,\u201d Wash wrote. Even in her apology, there\u2019s an error. Adnan is not Pakistani. He\u2019s American with Pakistani heritage. Maybe this seems like I\u2019m parsing, I don\u2019t mean to. I\u2019m only pointing all this out because to me it shows how easy it is to stir stereotypes in with facts all of which then gets baked into a story. Something like: those  Muslim men, they can\u2019t control their pride, their passions, they kill their lovers and flee the consequences with the full support of their families and communities. That\u2019s what shocked Shamim.\nObviously the State never said and was careful not say \u201cAdnan did this because he\u2019s a  Muslim,\u201d but they did skirt this idea a few time at trial. They wanted to show that this wasn\u2019t a normal high school romance, that this young couple was under an unusual amount of scrutiny and pressure from their families, and because Adnan\u2019s culture forbid the very thing he wanted, that\u2019s why he reacted the way he did to the breakup. They had various witnesses talking about what happened at the homecoming dance or how the relationship was secret. Prosecutor Casey Murphy tells the jury, \u201cThe crime was not about love, it was about pride.\u201d And in his opening argument, you\u2019ve heard this language before in an earlier episode but it bears repeating, prosecutor Kevin Urick talks about how Adnan reacted when Hae broke up with him. \u201cHe became enraged, he felt betrayed that his honor had been besmirched and he became very angry and he set out to kill Hae Min Lee\u201d. Besmirched. That\u2019s not a word you\u2019re accused of by accident. It\u2019s not a word you usually hear applied to a seventeen-year-old kid at Woodlawn High School. It\u2019s a word from the old country where honor killings come from. This word \u201chonor,\u201d it comes up a lot too. For instance, one day I was looking through a huge set of documents from the detective\u2019s investigations and I came upon a confidential report.\nIn late August of \u201899, so six months after Adnan\u2019s arrest, a woman who runs a consulting group that among its services helps law enforcement understand other cultures, wrote a report for Detectives Ritz and McGillivary, it\u2019s titled Report on Islamic Fad and Culture with Emphasis on Pakistan, a Comparative Study relevant to the Upcoming Trial of Adnan Syed. The report is eight pages long. I\u2019m gonna skip to the money shot, Summary As It Relates to Mr. Syed.\n\u201cFor her to have another man dishonored both Adnan Syed and his belief structure, it acceptable for a  Muslim man to control the actions of a woman by completely eliminating her.\u201d It goes on,\u201cwithin this harsh culture he has not violating any code he has defended his honor.\u201d Finally, \u201cFor many ethnic Pakistani men incidence like this are commonplace and in Pakistan this would not have been a crime but probably a question of honor.\u201d I have no idea what the cops made of this report, whether they looked at it and thought \u201coh dear\u201d and stuffed it in a file never to be considered again or whether they thought \u201chuh interesting\u201d but they were, at the very least, in regular communication with this consultant especially during the early stages of the investigation.\nFinally, I noticed that Jay also gives a shout out to Islam. It\u2019s during the second trial. He\u2019s testifying about what happened after he picked Adnan up at Best Buy as they\u2019re driving back to school. Jay says, \u201cthis is when we started to talk a little bit. I don\u2019t know. He said to me it kinda hurt him, but not really, and when someone treats him like that they deserve to die. How can you treat somebody like that, that you\u2019re supposed to love?\u201d and then, \u201cAll knowing is Allah.\u201d Urick asks him \u201cdid he explain what he meant by that?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Jay says. It\u2019s a detail that Jay mentioned neither to the detectives in his taped statements nor during the first trial, so why now? Allah only knows.\nReporting this story, I found plenty of examples of casual prejudice against Muslims. One of Adnan\u2019s teachers for example, \u201cthink about what he would have been taught about women and women\u2019s rights.\u201d Another teacher I talked to told me she was terrified at the time that Adnan\u2019s relatives were going to come after her for talking to the detectives. She told me she assumed his parents were evil. On that website that lists all the bodies found in Leakin Park, the author\u2019s commentary about Hae Min Lee\u2019s case is \u201cmaybe my prejudice is showing through, but who in their right mind lets their daughter date a man named Adnan Masud Syed?\u201d\nThe jurors we spoke to said Adnan\u2019s religion didn\u2019t affect their view of the case. Lisa Flynn said maybe at first it interested her, but then she pretty quickly realised that more to the point, Adnan was a teenager in America doing American teenager things. She said once they all understood that, whatever stereotypes they had went right out the window. Which is exactly what you\u2019d want in a jury. But when we pressed them a little more, it seems stereotypes about Adnan\u2019s culture were there lurking in the background.\n\nWilliam Owens\nI don\u2019t feel religion was why he did what he did. It may have been culture, but I don\u2019t think it was religion. I\u2019m not sure how the culture is over there, how they treat their women. But I know in some cultures women are second class citizens and maybe that\u2019s what it was, I don\u2019t know. He just wanted control and she wouldn\u2019t give it to him.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s juror William Owens. Here\u2019s Stella Armstrong.\n\nStella Armstrong\nThey were trying to talk about his culture, and [in] Arabic culture men rule, not women. I remembered hearing that.\n\nSarah Koenig\nYou mean when you were deliberating, one of the jurors said that?\n\nStella Armstrong\nYes when we were deliberating. So he had put his whole life on the line for her and she didn\u2019t want no part of it anymore.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThe first thing Cristina Gutierrez, Adnan\u2019s trial lawyer, said in her opening statement about her client, this is in the first trial, was, \u201cAdnan Musud Syed is an American citizen. He was born in this country like most American citizens.\u201d She obviously knew, despite what happened at jury selection, that the jurors might be prone to anti- Muslim, anti-foreigner sentiment which probably explains why she spent to what seemed to me a nutty amount of time during her opening talking about what an immigrant is, what a mosque is, what Pakistan is. \u201cA country formed in the Arab world in the tip of the land mass called Asia.\u201d She talks and talks about how Adnan was raised, about young romance, the judge interrupts her four times. \u201cHow much long will you be Miss Gutierrez? Five minutes Miss Gutierrez. One minute Miss Gutierrez,\u201d she\u2019s rushing at the end when she rather quickly throws suspicion onto Jay and then finally onto Mr. S. I know I\u2019ve talked about Christina Gutierrez in earlier episodes, about whether she should have talked to Asia McClain or whether her style might have grated on jurors. But now I\u2019m going to address this question head on. Did she blow it?\nYou might be surprised to hear that Adnan\u2019s only beef with Christina, in terms of what happened at trial is that she never contacted Asia McClain. He thinks it wasn\u2019t deliberate on her part, he just thinks she made a mistake, like a surgeon\u2019s slip of the scalpel. Personally, she was nothing but compassionate to him he said, always asking him how he was going, she made sure he got the skin medication he needed, the glasses he needed. She was his protector.\nAdnan Syed\nI mean I loved her, I still-- I just have a great deal of affection for her. I just really felt like she really really had my back. You understand? So--\n\n\nSarah Koenig\nYou trusted her like she knew what she was doing?\n\nAdnan Syed\nCompletely. I mean completely. Honestly I couldn\u2019t-- no one could understand it unless they were in that situation. The closest thing I can think of is if you combine a doctor, a nurse, a school teacher, a coach and your parents. If you combine all of that then you may have an idea of how much I trusted Miss Gutierrez in that situation.\nSarah Koenig\nYour life is really in her hands.\n\nAdnan Syed\nLiterally, literally, literally.  She never really mentioned what her plan would be, I never really knew what it would be.\n\nSarah Koenig\nCristina died in January of 2004 so obviously I can\u2019t ask her what her strategy was for conjuring reasonable doubt. I have to go by what we\u2019ve seen in her notes and in the courtroom. Based on all that I can summarise her defence theory in four words: someone else did it.  Such as Jay or the new boyfriend Don, or Mr. S the guy who found the body. After all, she argued, we don\u2019t even know for sure when Hae died, what day. It could have been the 13th or 14th or 15th. Cristina wanted to show that once the cops zeroed in on Adnan they ignored other viable suspects. So rather than pinning down an alibi for Adnan, she dumped as much suspicion as she could onto these other players.\nI mentioned before that Adnan\u2019s first trial ended in a mistrial. Here\u2019s what happened. Christina was what Chris Flohr described as a fighting person. Generally a good quality in an attorney. The scratchy part of Cristina though, sometimes it could illicit a response, shall we say, in the court room. Obviously it\u2019s an adversarial situation, both sides in Adnan\u2019s case were suspicious that the other was playing fast and loose when they could and it could get bristly. Here\u2019s prosecutor Casey Murphy during a bench conference at the first trial before Judge Quarles.\n\nCasey Murphy\nI\u2019m going to object to defence counsel calling my co-counsel an asshole at the trial table which she did just a moment ago.\n\nJudge Quarles\nI did not hear that.\n\nSarah Koenig\nI wish I could complain to a judge every time someone called me an asshole. Anyway, Quarles says he knows Cristina to be a \u201cpitbull on the pant leg of justice\u201d but an otherwise courteous person and about everybody just behaves themselves ok? But, five days later, Quarles loses his patience with Cristina. It\u2019s over something small. Kevin Urick asks if he can show exhibit thirty-one to the jurors. It\u2019s the AT&T call records from Adnan\u2019s phone showing calls from January 12, 13 and 14. Cristina says she hasn\u2019t seen it before. Urick says that\u2019s not true, she has, they\u2019d already stipulated to the call record. She says, \u201cyeah but I hadn\u2019t actually looked at it before, I haven\u2019t physically seen this exhibit.\u201d\nQuarles calls them up to the bench. \u201cMiss Gutierrez\u201d he says, \u201cif you\u2019re going to stand there and lie to the jury about something that you agreed could come in, I\u2019m not going to permit you to do that.\u201d Cristina says, \u201cJudge, the fact that I agreed--\u201d But he cuts her off. \u201cThat was a lie. You told a lie. I\u2019m not going to permit you to do that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not a lie Judge, I resent the implication.\u201d Christina starts getting heated now. Quarles says \u201cPlease be quiet, please be quiet.\u201d She says \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to be quiet when a court is accusing me of lying.\u201d\nI don\u2019t want to overdo it here, but it\u2019s possible that had this bench conference not happened, Adnan\u2019s whole life could have been different. That first trial according to Adnan, to Cristina\u2019s colleagues, to people who were watching it, seemed to be going well for Adnan\u2019s side. It was moving fast and Jay seemed to be more on the defensive, and then this happened. Of course jurors overheard it despite the white noise they turn on during bench conferences to muffle the sound. After a break, Cristina asks for a mistrial. Quarles says he\u2019s gotten a note from Alternate Number 4. \u201cIn view of the fact that you\u2019ve determined that Miss Gutierrez is a liar, will she be removed? Will we start over?\u201d Quarles says to Cristina, \u201cyour motion for mistrial is granted.\u201d\nJulie Remy was a law clerk for Cristina at this time and she said moving into trial number two, Cristina was confident.\n\nJulie Remy\nI mean look, the jury\u2019s polled after the first, at the end of the State\u2019s case and they\u2019re giving the indication that they\u2019re going to acquit and then you turn around and try it in front of a different jury and it come out complete the opposite.\n\nSarah Koenig\nWait, so you guys polled the jury after the mistrial?\n\nJulie Remy\nI wasn\u2019t part of it but I know the jury was polled after the mistrial.\n\nSarah Koenig\nBy her?\n\nJulie Remy\nBy her and I believe the law clerks on it, meaning Mike was involved, I\u2019m not sure but the jury was polled and it was at the end of the State\u2019s case, and they interviewed the jurors and they gave every indication that they were heading toward an acquittal.\n\nSarah Koenig\nIn fact it wasn\u2019t quite at the end of the State\u2019s case. The AT&T expert hadn\u2019t testified about the cell tower technology and Jen hadn\u2019t taken the stand either which is significant. But it\u2019s true the jury had heard the bulk of the State\u2019s case.\n\nJulie Remy\nTo have that information, you\u2019ve got to feel pretty good about that as the defense attorney, I would expect being a trial attorney myself that you would want to stay the course and keep doing the same thing and hope to get the same kind of result but you just never know with these juries.\n\nSarah Koenig\nTrue, different jury but also different judge, slightly different arguments, different weather, for all we know, winds blowing slightly more this way or that. There are so many factors, including chance, which no one wants to think about in a first degree murder case, but of course luck is part of it too.\nAbout a month later, they start all over again with trial two. Christina\u2019s strategy is the same. Try to show that someone else killed Hae. She did a lot of research in hopes of linking Mr. S to the crime, or at least trying to link him to Jay. Did he patronise the video store where Jay worked for instance, but she never succeeded. During that second trial it takes some doing, but she finally gets Mr. S on the stand. He so desperately didn\u2019t want to be there, the courthouse staff basically had to prevent him from leaving the building. So, even though he\u2019s her witness, he\u2019s a hostile witness. Here\u2019s Christina trying to get him to explain how work orders at his job got filled.\n\nMr. S\nIf we could get to that specific job we\u2019d do it at the time, if we can\u2019t do it at the time we\u2019d do it when we could get to it. That\u2019s my answer.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nWhich might be the next day.\n\nMr. S\nWhenever.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nWhen your work day would end, you would then leave?\n\nMr. S\nI guess so.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nWell sir, is that a yes or a no? I\u2019m not asking you to guess.\nMr. S\nIt\u2019s a yes. When you work days, don\u2019t you leave?\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nOK.\n\nSarah Koenig\nOf course, Mr. S was more of a side dish. Cristina\u2019s main prey was Jay. She tells the Judge:\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nJudge, I\u2019d just like to be heard it is our entire defense we are to make, Jay was the person who committed this crime. With all the ways in which he acted guilty in describing the ways in fact in which he acted with consciousness of guilt by concealing evidence. His clothes, his boots, his outer coat, his shovels, wiping shovels, to conceal evidence as he said, both in his statement and on cross, to conceal evidence of his involvement.\n\nSarah Koenig\nCristina cross examined Jay on five different days. She was exhaustive and exhausting. Her questions are detailed and deliberate but somehow the way she questioned him, and maybe it was the half speed pacing or the sing-songy aggression, somehow to me it added up to something less than effective. Her punches, and there were many, many punches don\u2019t always appear to land.\n\nAdnan Syed\nThe prosecution did a masterful job of presenting the facts.\n\n\nSarah Koenig\nAdnan says Cristina, actually he calls her Miss Gutierrez, that Miss Gutierrez did do some great things for him. She was successful in barring the school nurse from testifying at the second trial for instance, that was the woman who said she thought Adnan was faking his reaction after Hae\u2019s death. But, he says he wishes some of her arguments had been clearer. The State\u2019s argument, flawed as it might have been, it was at least linear.\n\nAdnan Syed\nIt seemed like Cristina, I mean Miss Gutierrez, I don\u2019t want to say she was confusing things but she was just saying-- it wasn\u2019t like a clear outline, like the prosecution had. It just seemed like everything was jumbled like she took so long to question Jay, she took so long to cross-examine people it was almost like I don\u2019t even remember what we started talking about.\n\nSarah Koenig\nRight, you kind of lose the thread of what is this even about, yeah.\n\nAdnan Syed\nRight, right, right.\n\nSarah Koenig\nTo give you an idea, in Jay\u2019s first and second taped statements to detectives, he tells them different stories about when Adnan first told him he was going to kill Hae. In the first statement he says Adnan mentions it that same day, January 13, while they\u2019re driving Adnan back to school at lunchtime. In the second taped statement he says Adnan told him the night before and also that Adnan had been talking about it for four or five days already. When he testifies at trial though, he goes back to the first version that he first heard about it from Adnan on the thirteenth. So obviously Cristina questions Jay about all this, it\u2019s fertile territory for her side. Listen to how she does it. This tape goes on for a while by the way, but I want you to get the full effect.\n\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nOn another occasion you told them \u201cwell the conversations I had with Adnan Syed, they occurred four or five days earlier,\u201d right?\n\nJay\nYes ma\u2019am.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nAnd let me make sure because now there are numerous versions. The first, your very first interview occurred at a time when there was no tape recording right?\n\nJay\nYes ma\u2019am.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nAnd on that occasion did you tell them it occurred on the thirteenth?\n\nJay\nNo.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nThen on your second interview after the tape recorder got turned on, did you tell them it occurred on the thirteenth?\n\nJay\nNo ma\u2019am.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nOn the fifteenth of March did you tell them it occurred on the thirteenth?\n\nJay\nI believe so.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nSo, sir, do you recall that actually on the fifteenth of March, you told them that Adnan told you that he was going to kill that bitch?\n\nJay\nYes I remember.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nSo on the fifteenth, you actually told them that you knew a whole day ahead of time that Adnan was gonna kill his girlfriend. Right?\n\nJay\n(garbled. Sounds like: \u201cHe deceived me.\u201d) Yes.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nPardon?\n\nJay\n(garbled. Sounds like: \u201cHe deceived me when\u201d or \u201cIt was evening when\u201d) he spoke to me.\nCristina Gutierrez\nI can\u2019t hear you sir.\n\nJay\nNo.\n\nSarah Koenig\nSo, something just happened. Jay just admitted something, or didn\u2019t admit something, but I honestly can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a point for the defense, or for the prosecution, or if it\u2019s a draw. There are lots of stretches like this where it seemed as if her cross-examination went so far into the weeds it was hard, even for me reading it years later, to hack back to the main trail. A juror that Dana interviewed, a guy named Theodore Wojtas, said Christina\u2019s strategy was a little lost on them too.\n\nTheodore Wojtas\nThat defense attorney-- it\u2019s been a long time ago, but everybody seemed to think that they\u2019re talking but they\u2019re not saying nothing, (chuckles) you know what I mean? They\u2019re not making a point.\n\nDana Chivvis\nSo there just was like a lot of words?\n\nTheodore Wojtas\nRight. They talked and talked and didn\u2019t prove anything. You know what I mean?\n\nSarah Koenig\nI think there is a good chance, though, that Cristina leaves these threads hanging for a reason. As another defense attorney explained to me, during cross-examination, you don\u2019t want to tie each point up in a bow, in the moment. You don\u2019t want to tip your hand, because then the other side might come back with questions on redirect examination that could undo what you\u2019ve just laid out. So you save all the threads and then tie them up in a nice, fat, unassailable bow at closing, after all the testifying is over. And indeed, Cristina does revisit Jay\u2019s testimony at her closing, the gist of which is: the detectives arrested Adnan because of what Jay told them, and what Jay told them wasn\u2019t true. \u201cAnd he lied to them about many, many things. It wasn\u2019t just that things didn\u2019t match up, they were lies. They called them lies. Jay called them lies. On the fifteenth of March, on the eighteenth of March, on the thirteenth of April, every single time, lies.\u201d Clearly Cristina put a ton of time and effort into discrediting Jay, but the fact is, the jurors believed him. They didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be sitting there talking about this if it weren\u2019t true.\nShe was less rigorous on other aspects of the case. The cell phone records, for instance. Her main argument there was that the way the State\u2019s expert, Abe Waranowitz, tested the sites wasn\u2019t valid because he used an Ericsson phone to make the calls, a different brand than Adnan\u2019s, which turned out to be a bad bet on her part. The brand of the phone doesn\u2019t matter. But what she didn\u2019t do with the cell phone evidence was attack the State\u2019s timeline. Call by call, tower by tower, or point out with clarity that a significant swath of the day, the hours between noon and six p.m. on the call log, do not match Jay\u2019s testimony. There did come a moment in the second trial, though, when Cristina really came to life, and just kicked ass. She teased some information out of Jay she hoped would change the course of the proceedings. It had to do with Jay\u2019s plea agreement with the State, and specifically the attorney who was representing Jay. According to Adnan, when she figured this one thing out about Jay\u2019s lawyer, she told Adnan, this was their big chance.\n\nAdnan Syed\nI remember those few days getting excited about that. Like this was a huge thing.\n\nSarah Koenig\nJay had been charged with a felony. Accessory after the fact to first degree murder. He plead guilty and had an agreement with the State that if he cooperated, basically showed up in court and told the truth, his sentence would reflect that. In the end, he got no jail time. For that plea, he had his own lawyer, a woman named Anne Benaroya. She was representing him pro bono. She wasn\u2019t a public defender, she was a private defense attorney. Now, Cristina had been complaining to the court that the prosecution hadn\u2019t been totally forthcoming about Jay\u2019s plea, and how it came about, which isn\u2019t unusual in a trial like this one. But in the middle of the second trial, Jay says something. Something that Cristina would later call, \u201cthe magic information\u201d. It happened on the stand when she was asking Jay how Benaroya came to represent him. She asked, did anyone help provide you a lawyer?\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nDid anyone help provide you a lawyer?\n\nKevin Urick\nObjection.\n\nJudge Wanda Heard\nOverruled.\n\nJay\nYes ma\u2019am.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nWho?\n\nJay\nMr. Urick.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nMr. Urick?! The prosecutor in this case helped provide you a lawyer?!\nJay\nYes ma\u2019am.\n\nSarah Koenig\nWhat?! Gutierrez freaks out! This is the magic information. Jay testifies that after his last interview with detectives, in April of \u201899, he had no contact with the cops or the prosecutors until September 6. So a long stretch where he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. He says he called the office of the public defender to try to see if he could get himself a lawyer, and they told him that unless you\u2019ve been charged, we can\u2019t help you. Which is true. So Jay says the next thing that happens is the cops come to see him, on September 6, and tell him he\u2019s about to be charged with accessory after the fact and that he\u2019ll be able to get a lawyer. The next day, September 7, they come pick him up, they book him, and they take him to the State Attorney\u2019s office. He meets Kevin Urick, the prosecutor. Jay says he\u2019s never met Urick before and then he says Urick introduces him to Anne Benaroya, who can represent him for free. Jay and Benaroya talk privately for a while, and then they sign a plea agreement. Then, that same day, they all go across the street to the courthouse and present the signed plea to a judge. If you or a loved one is an attorney, your jaw is hanging open right now, correct? Prosecutors do not find attorneys for witnesses they are prosecuting. That is not a thing. A former prosecutor that worked in the Baltimore office at the time said she\u2019s never heard of anything like that happening before. It sounded very strange to her, hence Gutierrez\u2019s freak out.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nThere is no jurisdiction in America that affords a prosecutor the right to pick counsel for its witnesses! Nowhere!\n\nSarah Koenig\nIf Jay got a free lawyer thanks to the State, Cristina argues, that\u2019s what\u2019s called a benefit. It\u2019s worth money, and it could look like Jay is being paid by the State for his testimony, or else maybe Jay felt beholden to the State for giving him this benefit, and therefore might lie to please them. If it could look like that, she says, then the defense was entitled to know about it before the second trial, or the first trial began. And here she was learning about it at this late date. That, she said, was a violation of the rules of discovery. She sounds so mad, the jury is not present for this ranting, by the way. But probably, she was also giddy with gotcha excitement. She told the judge, this is so patently improper.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nTo have a witness who has this benefit and may feel indebted in a way that may affect what he testifies to, to the man who provided him the lawyer! To the man who selected the lawyer!\n\nSarah Koenig\nOnce she\u2019d bitten into this, Cristina did not let go. She wanted to wrest from it everything she could- maybe a mistrial, maybe some other relief. They spent hours on this issue, over several days of the trial. Sometimes in front of the jury, sometimes not. I called Benaroya about this, to find out if it was true that Urick sought her out and that the first time she met Jay was in Urick\u2019s office, on the same day they signed the plea agreement. She said, \u201cNo it could not have happened that way. Absolutely not.\u201d At trial though, Urick doesn\u2019t dispute it. At Jay\u2019s sentencing in 2000, Benaroya says to the judge, \u201cwhen Mr. Urick first asked me, uh, first mentioned this case to me and asked me if I would consider speaking to Jay...\u201d\nThe Judge, Wanda Heard, agreed with Christina. That this arrangement looked fishy at best. She was not happy about it. But she also said \u201cthe witness in question, that is, Jay, he doesn\u2019t seem to be aware that it\u2019s messed up. He doesn\u2019t appear to think that he\u2019s getting a benefit, or being paid in some way for his testimony, or that anything untoward went on.\u201d So, it would seem his testimony isn\u2019t tainted by any of this and that\u2019s the main thing. So, \u2018A\u2019 for effort, Judge Heard tells Cristina, but overruled. And that, more or less, was that.\nIn terms of defense witnesses, the case Cristina brought was swift. It took about two and a half days for her to rest. Aside from the cops, a private detective, and the guy who surveyed the burial site at Leakin Park, the other witnesses Christina put on the stand were mostly character witnesses who had either neutral or nice things to say about Adnan.\n\nBetty Stuckey\nWhatever his assignment, Adnan strives for excellence at all times. His teachers remark that he\u2019s a bright, conscientious, and hard-working student who approaches his studies with sobriety...\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s Adnan\u2019s guidance counselor, Betty Stuckey, reading from a college recommendation she wrote for him. Which, incidentally, she printed out for Adnan on January 13, the same day Hae disappeared. She was the last defense witness at trial.\n\nBetty Stuckey\n...He participated in building a solar vehicle that won 6th place in national competition in Topeka, Kansas last spring. Furthermore, he worked diligently on a project sponsored by the National Honor Society\u2026 (fade out)\n\nSarah Koenig\nWhen Rabia Chaudry first told me about Adnan\u2019s case, she told me she thought Christina had bungled it, on purpose even, so she could make money off the appeal. That was the only way Rabia could account for screwing up the Asia thing. And, she said, she thought Cristina\u2019s defense, the witnesses she brought, were laughably weak.\nI do not agree with Rabia\u2019s assessment of Cristina. I do not believe Cristina threw this case, on purpose. Because, from reading the transcripts and watching the trial videos you can see her scrapping on Adnan\u2019s behalf at every opportunity. Sometimes in long and rather beautifully constructed extemporaneous paragraphs. She made a thousand strategic decisions about what to pursue when, she had four clerks plus an associate, so five people working on the case. It\u2019s not like she did some sloppy rush job.\n\nJulie Remy\nYou know, I know that losing the case, she was sick over it. I don\u2019t think she ever got over that case.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThis is Julie Remy again, who worked for Christina at the time of Adnan\u2019s trial.\n\nJulie Remy\nAnd I can tell you, the physical effects and the depression that I saw first hand. She was, I think she went into a deep depression after that case and I don\u2019t think she ever really bounced back. She really was impacted by the loss of that case.\n\nSarah Koenig\nPeople who worked with Cristina back then, they all said that same thing, that she was tireless and she cared a lot about her cases, including Adnan\u2019s. She was always going, going, a hundred miles an hour. One guy said she\u2019d sort of fly into the office in the morning, sunglasses on, hair flying, barking orders. She smoked and she cursed and she fiercely mentored her clerks. She could be a giant pain in the ass but, also she was a giant in the profession. Not just in Maryland, but nationally. She did the first, or at least one of the first DNA cases in Maryland. To figure out how to explain it to a jury, I heard a story that she went to a grade school and practiced. Each time a kid said he or she didn\u2019t understand the science, she started over. Christina did one of the first cases in Maryland that used Luminol to track blood spatter. About six people told me she was brilliant, not in a hyperbolic way either. Despite her stellar reputation though, it does seem as if something not right was happening with Cristina around this time.\n\n\nShamim Rahman\nEveryone said, she\u2019s the best, she\u2019s the best. We were begging her to take our case.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s Shamim, Adnan\u2019s mother. She and her husband consulted with friends and leaders at the mosque about who to hire. Everyone said Cristina sounded great. They felt like they were lucky to get her.\n\nShamim Rahman\nWhatever she asked for, you know, we\u2019ll just go and get it before we lose her, because we were afraid if we lose her we don\u2019t have like a nice attorney.\n\nSarah Koenig\nShamim said Cristina\u2019s bedside manner, at least with them, lacked a certain delicacy. She said, they were both intimidated by her and that they could never get her to talk to them about Adnan\u2019s case or what was going on. And, Shamim says she thought Cristina had lost some of her magic in the courtroom by the second trial. That she seemed sort of agitated.\nShamim Rahman\nSo, and all the time she would be smoking, in and out, she was a very nervous kind of person. Before, she wasn\u2019t like that, the first trial.\n\nSarah Koenig\nCristina initially asked for $50,000 to represent Adnan, that fee would more than double by the end of the second trial. Members of the mosque had donated lots of money to help pay her, but Shamim says that toward the end of the second trial, Cristina had begun to bully them about money. If they managed to get Cristina on the phone or in a meeting, Shamim said the only topic would be money. Money, money, Shamim said. At one point, Shamim says, Cristina told Adnan\u2019s parents she needed them to bring $10,000 cash to the courthouse to pay for a jury expert.\n\n\nShamim Rahman\nSo, it was kind of, you know, strange. But when I told my friend, she said \u201coh no don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s doing her job you know.\u201d\n\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s weird, that\u2019s strange.\nShamim Rahman\nIt was weird to me because--\n\nSarah Koenig\nHow could you even fit $10,000 in your pocket?\n\nShamim Rahman\nAnd plus she said, bring it cash. I mean usually, they are supposed to take the check but she said no bring it cash, oh wait a minute--\n\nSarah Koenig\nWas that the only time that she asked you for cash?\n\nShamim Rahman\nYes. Yeah, she asked for cash. Yes.\n\nSarah Koenig\nWeird.\nShamim Rahman\nYes.\n\nSarah Koenig\nBut evidently she never hired the expert. Shamim says there came another time toward the end when Cristina insisted Adnan\u2019s parents owed her money and that she could take their house if they didn\u2019t pay up. They said they had paid her for everything, they were so scared they\u2019d transferred their house into their oldest son\u2019s name. I bring all this up because Adnan\u2019s parents were not the only ones who had dealings like this with Cristina. I spoke to another couple, Ron and Sue Witman and to hear them tell it, on the heels of Adnan\u2019s conviction in early 2000, Christina began to go downhill pretty fast. The Witmans hired Cristina to defend their fifteen year old son in what might be the worst and saddest case I\u2019ve ever heard. Their son Zach was accused and ultimately convicted of killing their younger son Greg who was thirteen. It\u2019s just a terrible, gruesome, confounding case, and so the parents, I can\u2019t even begin to imagine but anyway, they seek out Cristina because she\u2019s been recommended to them and they\u2019d read about her defense work in the paper. At first she was great, they said. She successfully argued a couple of important pretrial motions. Ron Witman said she was magnificent in the courtroom. But then as time when on things started to get weird. This is around the same time she was working on Adnan\u2019s case. She\u2019d be late, really late, filing briefs with the court. The Witman\u2019s case was in Pennsylvania, they live right on the border with Maryland, so that meant the briefs had to be filed in the courthouse in Harrisburg. They\u2019d check in for weeks in advance with Cristina they said, asking, \u201cHow\u2019s it going, when can we review the brief?\u201d No brief. Day of even, no brief. Twice Ron had to go wait for the brief in person at Cristina\u2019s office in Baltimore and then race the eighty miles to Harrisburg, meeting up with Sue along I83 so they could get it stamped by 4:30pm at the court. Ron said one of them would have to run in while the other waited, they didn\u2019t even have time to park the car.\nThe Witmans talk about many of the same things Shamim told me, that they couldn\u2019t get a hold of Cristina or saw that things weren\u2019t getting done, but when they asked people who knew her they were told, \u201cdon\u2019t push it, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Here\u2019s Sue Witman.\n\nSue Witman\nAnd they would say to me, \u201cThis is how Tina works. Don\u2019t tell Tina what to do, this is what she does, she\u2019s very good at it, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d So, someone that has worked with Tina for years tells you that this is just her way, then you think that this is just her way.\n\n\nSarah Koenig\nRon says it got worse and worse. Adnan\u2019s trial ended in late February 2000. By the end of that same year Cristina had been hospitalised at length. She had diabetes, she had MS, she got very, very sick. Her law clerks told me they\u2019d bring files to her in the hospital. One of them told me Cristina would sneak cigarettes in the bathroom. In other words, she was still at it and maybe she shouldn\u2019t have been. Ron Witman says it should have been clear to everyone around her that Cristina couldn\u2019t keep up with her cases but no one cried uncle.\nRon Witman\nUltimately in January 2001 if I have my years correct, we had a brief due at the Supreme Court of the United States in ten days and she had told us that she had a University of Baltimore law professor who she had worked with many times before, doing the drafts. And finally, I called him and he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Tina about your son\u2019s case for a year and a half or two years.\u201d\nSarah Koenig\nThe Witmans say Cristina asked for an additional $65,000 for work she had to know full well she couldn\u2019t do, that they gave her $25,000 for an expert but Cristina never paid the guy so he came to them for the money. They said that happened with a second expert too for a few thousand dollars. If she was too sick, why didn\u2019t she tell them? Why did she leave them hanging?\nCristina\u2019s career had collapsed by the spring of 2001, a year after Adnan\u2019s trial ended. According to newspaper stories in the Baltimore Sun, written by me, Cristina had gotten in trouble with the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland. Clients were complaining that she\u2019d taken their money and had not done the work she promised or not used it the way she said she would. The State fund that compensates people when their lawyers misuse their money paid out a total of $282,328 on twenty eight claims against Cristina. The largest payout was to the Witmans.\nThe Witmans feel as though she was lying to them, trying to get as much money out of them as she could. A more generous assessment would be that Christina was in denial about how sick she was, and people who worked with her told me she was never much interested in the business side of things, it wasn\u2019t her forte. One former law partner of Cristina\u2019s told the Witmans that Cristina had been slipping for a while, the past five years even.\nThere have been a lot of news stories this week that Adnan\u2019s gotten an appeal. That\u2019s not quite true. He had an initial appeal which was denied and he had a hearing for post conviction relief, also denied. But he appealed that denial to a higher court, The Maryland Court of Special Appeals and recently that court ordered the State to respond to one aspect of Adnan\u2019s petition by January 14, so it is still alive, by a thread. Adnan\u2019s petition is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, meaning Cristina Gutierrez screwed up. The brunt of the claim is about Asia McClain, that she might have provided an alibi for Adnan at trial if Cristina had talked to her. But the part of the petition that the higher court wants the State to answer is actually about a different complaint. Namely that Adnan had asked Cristina to seek a plea deal, twice he\u2019d asked and Cristina never did it. Prosecutors in Adnan\u2019s case said they never made an offer but Cristina also didn\u2019t seek one. Even though Adnan says he\u2019d asked her to, once before his first trial and once before the second. When I first read his petition I told Adnan I found it hard to believe that he\u2019d asked for a deal. He\u2019s been so unshakable for fifteen years that he\u2019s innocent, that he had nothing to do with Hae\u2019s death. And it also seemed to me as if he trusted back then that the system would sort all this out and he\u2019d go home. But Adnan told me there were times when he was really scared. He was trying to be brave for his family but then he\u2019d hear stories or watch guys he knew get fifty year, seventy year, life sentences and it would hit him, \u201cI could be in prison for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nAdnan Syed\nI think it\u2019s so difficult to understand these things not ever having been in that situation. I would always think before I ever came to jail that a person would only plead guilty to something because they did it. No way would a person ever plead guilty to something. Once you come into this whole system, one thing that you really learn is that no one really beats cases and when it comes to first degree murder cases, it\u2019s almost impossible. I can think in all the years I\u2019ve been in prison I can probably think of a handful of people who ever beat a first degree murder case, simply because the odds are just so stacked against you. So there are people that I\u2019ve met and I know and I\u2019m so jealous of them, and not in a bad way, in a good way because when we were over in the jail, over city jail, their lawyer advised them, \u201cLook man, you should take a deal of life suspended for thirty years, life suspended for twenty years whether you did it or not. Because the way the elements of the case are, you don\u2019t have a strong alibi, you have someone coming to court saying that you did it whether you did it or not. You\u2019re going to go in front of a jury and twelve people are going to convict you because they have never sat in your shoes before.\u201d So it\u2019s really a choice of you having a life sentence versus the choice of you having a life, because now I still communicate with some of these guys, they\u2019re actually getting ready to go home, fifteen, sixteen years later.\n\nSarah Koenig\nAdnan says when he\u2019s seen younger guys come in on parole violations or for whatever reason, he tells them, \u201cTake the deal. Regardless of whether you did it, take the deal.\"\nBecause Adnan has maintained his innocence he\u2019s got no hope of getting out, or very little hope. That\u2019s how the system works. He understands that now. Technically Adnan is eligible for parole but the chances of getting it are so slim for anyone with a life sentence for first degree murder, but especially if you don\u2019t show remorse. Because, you know, what if he\u2019s a psychopath right? Next time, on Serial.\nSerial is produced by Julie Snyder, Dana Chivvis and me. Emily Condon is our production and operations manager.

It is a great day. We are all here because it is a great day. I am particularly happy that people like the Chief Justice of the United States is here; and other Chief Judges. (Applause). I want to confess, I begged him not to come; because I know how much work he has to do. By statute, he has jurisdiction over I don't know how many different outfits in this country, which he has to go to. And then he has to preside over some five hundred Federal Judges, each of whom is an individual prima donna. (Laughter ). And with all of that, he shouldn't find time to come something like this. But, he insisted. To him, it was that important; and to me that truly demonstrates how important it is.\n\nI would like to start off by having a couple of true stories on the record. I do not have a written speech. I have gotten away from written speeches since I heard about that legislator who had a speech committee in his off ice...and they would write up these speeches for him. He wouldn't even look at them before he delivered them. He just read them off. And this day he said, \"Look! Next Monday night I am speaking for Senator Johnson; and I want a speech, twenty minutes (long); and I want it on energy.\" And they said, \"What are...?\" And he said, \"That's it. Just go do it.\" And they did. And on Monday they gave him the speech and he went out, got in his car, got in the place, got there, got in another car, went there. When he was called on to speak, he opened up his speech, and on the first page he went on telling stories like this.... ( Laughter from the audience). Except mine is true. (Laughter). Then he went on talking in general about the energy problem. And then he said, 'he has an airtight program for taking care of the entire energy program. It was very elaborate; and it was set up in five different phases, all five of which, I shall set forth before you tonight.' And he turned over the page and to his utter surprise, he saw \"Now, you sucker, you are on your own.\" (Laughter and Applause). I have given up that idea .... (Laughter).\n\n...When I decided to come. (Laughter) ... I am not too much in the line of notes. But the one that really is what I am going to talk about today is a Las Vegas story.\n\nThis guy went out from California to Las Vegas and did what all others do. He lost his money. (Laughter). All of it including his fare home. And he was commiserating with himself; and as sometimes happens, he had to go. And when he got to the toilet room (bathroom).... (Laughter), he found out, that they had not nickel or dime: they had quarter ones (Laughter). And he didn't have a nickel. So he was in pretty bad shape. (Laughter). And just then a gentleman came by and he told the gentleman his problem ... The guy said, \"I will give you a quarter.\" And the guy said, \"Well look, you don't know me.... I don't care if you give it back to me or not. You are no problem. Here's a quarter.\" He took the quarter and went in the room there, and just as he was about to put the quarter in the slot to open the door, the door had been left open for somebody. So he put the quarter in his pocket. He went on in; and when he finished, he went upstairs. A quarter wasn't going to get him back to Los Angeles. A quarter wasn't even going to feed him. So, he put the quarter in the slot machine. And it wouldn't be any story if he didn't hit the jackpot. ( Laughter). Then he hit the bigger jackpot... and he went to the crap table; he went to the roulette table. He ended up with about ten or fifteen thousand dollars worth.\n\nHe went back to Los Angeles invested in the right stock. He got the right business together. And in pretty short order, about fifteen years, he became the second wealthiest man in the world. And on television, they asked him about it; and he said he would like to tell his story. And he told the story. And he said, \"I am so indebted to that benefactor of mine. That man who made all of this possible. And if he comes forth and proves it; that he was the man. I will give him half of my wealth in cash. (Laughter). So a man came forth.... They had all the elaborate ... private detective investigation; and sure enough, \"That was the man.\" ...The guy said, \"Well look. Are you sure you are the one I am looking for?\" He said, \"Why certainly.\" He said, \"Who are you?\" He said, \"I am the man that gave you that quarter.\" He said, \"Heck, I'm not looking for him. I am looking for the man who left the door opened.\" (Applause and Laughter). Because you see, if he hadn't left the door open, I would have had to put the quarter in the slot.\" (Laughter).\n\nI figure at a stage I like this in our development of our law school, we have to be sure we know just what we are after.\nWhy do we have occasions like this? Well, I will tell you why. Everything in any question of education depends on the reputation of the school. And a part of the reputation of the school, is the reputation of the dean. And being so old as I am, you almost scared me to death, Wiley, talking about the oldest graduate was here. (Laughter).\n\n...In order to find out just where we stand, and to be in a room like this, and on a campus I like this, I had to go back.... But you know it's an awful long way from 25th Street; which incidentally, I went by not too long ago. These of you that hadn't been by, it's gone. They have torn it down. It was a marvelous place when it was there.\n\nBut today, you know, we have reached the place where people say, \"We've come a long way.\" But so (have) other people come a long way. And so have other schools come a long way. Has the gap been getting smaller? It's getting bigger. Everybody's been doing better.\n\nAnd so, as you took at the law school today, and that's what you have to look at. You look back, and people say we are better off today. Better than what?\n\nYou know, I used to be amazed at people who would say that, \"The poorest Negro kid in the South was better off than the kid in South Africa.\" So what! We are not in South Africa. (Applause). We are here. ( Applause). \"You ought to go around the country and show yourself to Negroes; and give them inspiration.\" \"For what? These Negro kids are not fools. They know to tell them there is a possibility that someday you'll have a chance to be the o-n-I-y Negro on the Supreme Court, those odds aren't too good.\" (Applause).\n\nWhen I do get around the country like recently, I have been to places like ... unfortunately for funerals; like New Orleans, Houston, Dallas, etc. When I get out and talk with the people in the street, I still get the same problems. \"You know, like years ago, you told us things were going to get better. But they are not a darn bit better for me. I am still having trouble getting to work. I have trouble eating.\" And guess what I am getting now?  \"...You not only told me that; you told my father that. And he's no better off; and neither am 1. And can you tell me my children will be better off.\" Well, all I am trying to tell you...there's a lot more to be done. Now, think of those good old days. We started at Howard with Charlie Houston as dean.... (Charles H. Houston, Dean of Howard University Law School, 1930-1935). ...The school had several things that they did not have would be more important. They did not have a reputation, and they did not have any accreditation; and they did not have anything, 'it looked to me.'\n\nCharlie Houston took over and in two or three years got full accreditation: American Bar Association, Association of American Law School, etc. He did it the hard way.\n\nAnd for any students that might be interested, for these of you who came to this school later, and had complaints, 'you should have been there when I was there.'\n\nWe named Charlie the only repeatable names I could give him as 'Iron Shoes and Cement Pants.' (Laughter). We had a lot of others but... (Laughter).\n\nHe even installed the cutback system that would keep you on the books all the time. And that was that, a professor could take five points off your mark for no reason at all. So the only way you could really make it is to get around 95....\n\nHe gave an examination in Evidence in our second year that started at nine o'clock in the morning and ended at five in the afternoon. One subject.\n\nIn our first year he told us, \"Look at the man on your right, took at the man on your left, and at this time next year, two of you won't be here.\" (Laughter)....\n\nI know my class started, as I remember, it was around thirty; and it ended up with six.... He brought in people not on the faculty; but who were coming by Washington. And because of his reputation and background he could get them.\nAnd the people I would list. Every time they came to Washington, they would come by; and we would close up the school and listen to them, in our moot courtroom, which held about fifteen.\n\nFor example, a man by the name of Roscoe Pound who just happened to be Dean of Harvard Law School, would talk and lecture to us on the Common Law.\n\nAnd it just so happened that at that time he was the greatest authority in the world.... ...Then we had Bill Lewis, a Negro lawyer from Boston, Massachusetts who had the distinction of being Assistant Attorney General, a little while back, under Theodore Roosevelt. He would tell us about how to try a lawsuit; and how to argue with the Judges; because he was a master of it. And we would run to the Supreme Court and hear him argue.\n\nThen Garfield Hayes would drop by from the American Civil Liberties Union. The first time, I was very impressed with the fact, he was en route from Birmingham, Alabama where he had defended a poor Negro. He was then en route to Boston, Massachusetts to defend the Ku Klux Klan.... He explained to me about the constitution being colorblind.\n\nThen you had people like Clarence Darrow who told us the importance of sociology and other studies rather than law - which he considered to be unimportant. As witness one time, he was trying a case in North Carolina. A Negro beating up a white man. And his whole argument...to the jury was (he had never touched the facts of the case), ...that this was a waste of time for him to stand up there and argue to this all white Southern prejudiced jury; that no way in the world they could give this Negro a chance. They just couldn't do it because they were too prejudiced. And he argued that for two and a half-hours; and the jury went out and came back and proved to him that they weren't prejudiced. (Laughter ). And they turned the man loose. (Laughter).\n\nWe had Vaughn S. Cooke, a great expert on Conflict Law. People like that because the emphasis was not theory. The emphasis in this school was on practice. How to get it done.\n\nHarvard was training people to join big Wall Street firms. Howard was teaching lawyers to go out and go in court. Charlie's phrase was Social Engineer. To be a part of the community. And have the lawyer to take over the leadership in the community.\n\nAnd we used to hold fort in our little library down there, after school, at night. And start out on research problems sometimes sponsored by him and sometimes on our own.\n\nIndeed, I remember one time, one night. One guy, I believe it was Oliver Hill. ...He got to work on something, we all joined in. And we found out that in codifying the Code of the District of Columbia, they had just left out the Civil Rights Statute. So, since it didn't apply to anybody but us, they left it out. We eventually got through in court and got that straightened out. And we got to work on segregation. What are we going to do about that?\n\nI for one was very interested in it because I couldn't go to the University of Maryland. I had to ride the train everyday, twice a day. Back and forth. I didn't like that....\n\nWell, it ended up Bill Hastie (William H. Hastie, Dean of Howard University Law School, 19391946), went down to North Carolina and filed our first University case which we lost on a technicality. But Hastie laid the groundwork for the future.\n\nThen we had a criminal case dealing with a man named Crawford. We did more litigating, I guess, than any school I ever did.\n\nBut I emphasize that it was aimed at working in the community. The other thing that Charlie beat in our heads... I think that is very important. He says, \"You know when a doctor makes a mistake, he buries his mistake. When a lawyer makes a mistake, he makes it in front of God and everybody else.\" (Laughter).\nWhen you get in the courtroom you can't say please Mr. Court have mercy on me because I am a Negro. You are in competition with a welltrained white lawyer and you better be at least as good as he, and if you expect to win, you better be better. (Applause). If I give you five cases to read overnight, you read eight. And when I say eight, you read ten. You go that step further; and you might make it. And then you had all these other people, Charles H. Houston, William H. Hastie, George E.C. Hayes, Leon A. Ransom, Edward P. Lovett, James Nabrit, Spottswood W. Robinson, Ill.\n\nThen later you had Robert L. Carter, Constance Baker Motley, A.T. Walden in Atlanta, Arthur Shores in Birmingham, A.P. Tureaud, Sr., in New Orleans.\n\nThen on the other side you had a very good group of professors from other schools. Charles Black.... and others.\n\nThen we had a certain wild guy over there in Arkansas. (Laughter). I would just like to mention it at this point, because it is very important, I think, to realize that in those days, \"it was rough.\" And I think Wiley (Wiley A. Branton, Dean of Howard University School of Law) is an example of one part of it. I got the credit mostly. But I would go to those places, and I would get out on the fastest damn thing that moved. (Laughter). I couldn't wait for the plane. And then I couldn't wait for the jet. (Laughter). I am talking about ... He stayed there. He didn't go. He stayed right there. He had not once, but crosses were burned on his lawn. He had everything they could try. He laughed at them. He stayed there, and made them take it and like it. I mentioned that because it seems to me, that while we had this whole movement going along, we were beginning to touch it.\n\nThen we had those Damon (Damon J. Keith, Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit) was talking about. Those dry runs. We would have both of the Lawyers who were going to argue tomorrow's case before the Supreme Court, to come before a panel of judges in our old moot courtroom, when we were in the library down there on the campus. This went on all during the 1940's. The faculty members who set as members of the Court were deliberately urged to be rougher and excuse me, \"nastier than the judges would be.\" And you know, it worked well; I because once you got through with that slugging match with them, you didn't worry about anything the next day. It was like going to an ice cream party ... because the members of the court were so polite and nice to you. Well, I keep reminding you that this was done at Howard; all of it. How much it was necessary to the success of those cases, is left to anybody. And finally on that point, I want you to know, that starting with that research in the library of finding the Civil Rights Statute, through oil these cases in the Supreme Court, clean up to the present time, in the Bakke case, I will tell anybody, and I will dispute anybody who does not agree, that the brief filed by Herb Reid (Herbert 0. Reid, Sr., Charles Hamilton Houston, Distinguish Professor of Law at Howard University) was one of the best briefs. (Standing ovation.) He didn't pay me a nickel for it. (Laughter).\n\nNow, you know, Wiley integrated the University of Arkansas. He went back down in there; and cases that were mentioned, I know several other criminal cases that were just unbelievable. He went from there to Atlanta; and up here to Washington. I hate to get down into the gutter; but \"Wiley\" stands for, \"brains and guts.\" I know both of them; I have seen him in action. It seems to me, that what are we going to do now, other than, all of us to give our blessings to what I consider a perfect marriage; Branton and the Howard Law School. (Applause).\n\nThat's not enough because we have got to look to the future. They are still laying traps for us.\n\nI have just requested a book which I heard about. Believe it or not, somebody found out the Klan (Ku Klux Klan) is still around. I could have told them that. (Laughter). The Klan never died. They just stopped wearing the sheets, because the sheets cost too much. (Laughter). When I say they, I think we all know who they would include. We have them in every phase of American life. And as we dedicate this courtroom, as we launch Wiley on his road, we just have to continue that basic theory of practice; and not just theory. With these clinics that have been set up, you note we can give the poor people in the ghettoes for peanuts better legal protection than the millionaires get. If, we could just get them to bring their legal problems to the lawyer, before they sign them. That's how to stay out of trouble. And that can be done with clinics. And I think this law school I has to insist on that. And here I have a note which says all of this has to be done and it has to be done together.\n\nThere are people that tell us today, and there are movements that tell us, tell Negroes, \"Take it easy man. You made it. No more to worry about. Everything is easy.\" Again, I remind you about what Charlie Houston said, \"You have got to be better, boy. You better move better.\"\n\nBe careful of these people who say, \"You have made it. Take it easy; you don't need any more help.\" ...I would like to read ... for these people who tell you, 'to take it easy. Don't worry, etc.'\n\n\"The great enemy of truth  very often is not the lie; deliberate, contrived and dishonest; but the myth persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic.\"\nJohn F. Kennedy\n\nBe aware of that myth, that everything is going to be all right. Don't give in. I add that, because it seems to me, that what we need to do today is to refocus. Back in the 30's and 40's, we could go no place but to court. We knew then, the court was not the final solution. Many of us knew the final solution would have to be politics, if for no other reason, politics is cheaper than lawsuits. So now we have both. We have our legal arm, and we have our political arm. Let's use them both. And don't listen to this myth that it can be solved by either or that it has already been solved. Take it from me, it has not been solved.\n\nI will conclude if I may with a conclusion from another great American. The late Chief Justice Warren in his one book. And this is the conclusion of his book. And more important and as we move more in what I consider to be 'his new phase. He says,\n\n\"Those who won our independence believed that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people. That, public discussion is a political duty. That this should be a fundamental principle of the American government. They eschewed silence coerced by law.\"\n\nAnd then again, Chief Justice Warren,\n\n\"No., the democratic way of life is not easy. It conveys great privileges with constant vigilance  needed to preserve them. This vigilance must be maintained by those responsible for the government. And in our country those responsible are, we the people, no one else. Responsible citizenship is therefore the ... anchor of our republic. With it we can withstand the storm. Without it, we are helplessly at sea.\"\n\nIt is beyond question...\n\n...Benjamin Franklin had it in mind when he said;\n\n\"A republic if you can keep it.\"\n\nTo me, that means much. It's not a republic if we keep it. With me, \"It's a democracy, if we can keep it. And in order to keep it, you can't stand still. You must move, and if you don't move, they will run over you.\"\n\nThis law school has been in the front. It's been the bellwether. It's been the fulcrum of pressure.\n\nIn driving on, I am just as certain as I have ever been in my life, that under the leadership of Wiley Branton, it will not only continue: it will broaden, increase and continue to be the bulwark that we all can be proud of.\n\nThis is a great day. We are entering a great era. And let's do as many of us did back home. You know some people have been going home with the Roots business and all that. (Laughter). I have been going over these since the late 50's. When Kenya got its independence in 1963, and to see all those hundreds of thousands of people. When freedom was declared, ...in unison yelled, \"Harambee.\" (Meaning) \"Pull Together.\"\n\nWe could, and with Wiley and this school, we will continue to do it. Anything I can do to help, I will do, 'that is except raise money.' Because there are a couple of committees of the Judiciary that say, \"No.\" (Standing Ovation).Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1049994", "artist_names": "Barbara

grass grew so tall\nIn summer the lilacs would grow everywhere\nThe laughter of children would float in the air\nAs I grew older I had to roam\nFar from my family, far from my home\nInto the city, where lives can be spent\nLost in the shadows of tar and cement\nChorus:\nAnd every night I'd sit alone and learn\nWhat loneliness meant\nUp in my rented room above the world\nOf tar and cement\nEach day I'd wake up and look at the sky\nThink of the meadows where I used to lie\nThen I'd remember all of that's gone\nYou're in the city, you better push on\nGet what you came for, before it's too late\nGet what you came for, the meadows can wait\nRepeat Chorus\nMany years later, tired at last\nI headed for home to look for my past\nI looked for the meadows, there wasn't a trace\nSix lanes of

He kept on the fringe of his line, out of sight of his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet, feigning to run now and then. He felt his body small and weak amid the throng of the players and his eyes were weak and watery. Rody Kickham was not like that: he would be captain of the third line all the fellows said.\n\nRody Kickham was a decent fellow but Nasty Roche was a stink. Rody Kickham had greaves in his number and a hamper in the refectory. Nasty Roche had big hands. He called the Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket. And one day he had asked:\n\n\u2014What is your name?\n\nStephen had answered: Stephen Dedalus.\n\nThen Nasty Roche had said:\n\n\u2014What kind of a name is that?\n\nAnd when Stephen had not been able to answer Nasty Roche had asked:\n\u2014What is your father?\n\nStephen had answered:\n\n\u2014A gentleman.\n\nThen Nasty Roche had asked:\n\n\u2014Is he a magistrate?\n\nHe crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, making little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish with cold. He kept his hands in the side pockets of his belted grey suit. That was a belt round his pocket. And belt was also to give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow said to Cantwell:\n\n\u2014I'd give you such a belt in a second.\n\nCantwell had answered:\n\n\u2014Go and fight your match. Give Cecil Thunder a belt. I'd like to see you. He'd give you a toe in the rump for yourself.\n\nThat was not a nice expression. His mother had told him not to speak with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother! The first day in the hall of the castle when she had said goodbye she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him: and her nose and eyes were red. But he had pretended not to see that she was going to cry. She was a nice mother but she was not so nice when she cried. And his father had given him two five-shilling pieces for pocket money. And his father had told him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door of the castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and mother, his soutane fluttering in the breeze, and the car had driven off with his father and mother on it. They had cried to him from the car, waving their hands:\n\n\u2014Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye!\n\n\u2014Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye!\n\nHe was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fearful of the flashing eyes and muddy boots, bent down to look through the legs. The fellows were struggling and groaning and their legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping. Then Jack Lawton's yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other boots and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way and then stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going home for the holidays. After supper in the study hall he would change the number pasted up inside his desk from seventy-seven to seventy-six.\n\nIt would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the cold. The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the castle. He wondered from which window Hamilton Rowan had thrown his hat on the ha-ha and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows. One day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the soldiers' slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a book. Perhaps Leicester Abbey was like that. And there were nice sentences in Doctor Cornwell's Spelling Book. They were like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling from.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wolsey died in Leicester Abbey\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the abbots buried him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canker is a disease of plants,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cancer one of animals.\n\nIt would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. He shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin. That was mean of Wells to shoulder him into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuff box for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How cold and slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum. Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting for Brigid to bring in the tea. She had her feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell! Dante knew a lot of things. She had taught him where the Mozambique Channel was and what was the longest river in America and what was the name of the highest mountain in the moon. Father Arnall knew more than Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle Charles said that Dante was a clever woman and a well-read woman. And when Dante made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn.\n\nA voice cried far out on the playground:\n\n\u2014All in!\n\nThen other voices cried from the lower and third lines:\n\n\u2014All in! All in!\n\nThe players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went among them, glad to go in. Rody Kickham held the ball by its greasy lace. A fellow asked him to give it one last: but he walked on without even answering the fellow. Simon Moonan told him not to because the prefect was looking. The fellow turned to Simon Moonan and said:\n\n\u2014We all know why you speak. You are McGlade's suck.\n\nSuck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon Moonan that name because Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect's false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. Only louder.\n\nTo remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer thing.\n\nAnd the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and wettish. But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a light noise like a little song. Always the same: and when the fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it.\n\nIt was the hour for sums. Father Arnall wrote a hard sum on the board and then said:\n\n\u2014Now then, who will win? Go ahead, York! Go ahead, Lancaster!\n\nStephen tried his best, but the sum was too hard and he felt confused. The little silk badge with the white rose on it that was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was no good at sums, but he tried his best so that York might not lose. Father Arnall's face looked very black, but he was not in a wax: he was laughing. Then Jack Lawton cracked his fingers and Father Arnall looked at his copybook and said:\n\n\u2014Right. Bravo Lancaster! The red rose wins. Come on now, York! Forge ahead!\n\nJack Lawton looked over from his side. The little silk badge with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue sailor top on. Stephen felt his own face red too, thinking of all the bets about who would get first place in elements, Jack Lawton or he. Some weeks Jack Lawton got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first. His white silk badge fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard Father Arnall's voice. Then all his eagerness passed away and he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the sum but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those were beautiful colours to think of. And the cards for first place and second place and third place were beautiful colours too: pink and cream and lavender. Lavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about the wild rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not have a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could.\n\nThe bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not eat the damp bread. The tablecloth was damp and limp. But he drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion, girt with a white apron, poured into his cup. He wondered whether the scullion's apron was damp too or whether all white things were cold and damp. Nasty Roche and Saurin drank cocoa that their people sent them in tins. They said they could not drink the tea; that it was hogwash. Their fathers were magistrates, the fellows said.\n\nAll the boys seemed to him very strange. They had all fathers and mothers and different clothes and voices. He longed to be at home and lay his head on his mother's lap. But he could not: and so he longed for the play and study and prayers to be over and to be in bed.\n\nHe drank another cup of hot tea and Fleming said:\n\n\u2014What's up? Have you a pain or what's up with you?\n\n\u2014I don't know, Stephen said.\n\n\u2014Sick in your breadbasket, Fleming said, because your face looks white. It will go away.\n\n\u2014O yes, Stephen said.\n\nBut he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in his heart if you could be sick in that place. Fleming was very decent to ask him. He wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears. Then he heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps of his ears. It made a roar like a train at night. And when he closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a tunnel. That night at Dalkey the train had roared like that and then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He closed his eyes and the train went on, roaring and then stopping; roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop and then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop.\n\nThen the higher line fellows began to come down along the matting in the middle of the refectory, Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and the Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and the little Portuguese who wore the woolly cap. And then the lower line tables and the tables of the third line. And every single fellow had a different way of walking.\n\nHe sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a game of dominoes and once or twice he was able to hear for an instant the little song of the gas. The prefect was at the door with some boys and Simon Moonan was knotting his false sleeves. He was telling them something about Tullabeg.\n\nThen he went away from the door and Wells came over to Stephen and said:\n\n\u2014Tell us, Dedalus, do you kiss your mother before you go to bed?\n\nStephen answered:\n\n\u2014I do.\n\nWells turned to the other fellows and said:\n\n\u2014O, I say, here's a fellow says he kisses his mother every night before he goes to bed.\n\nThe other fellows stopped their game and turned round, laughing. Stephen blushed under their eyes and said:\n\n\u2014I do not.\n\nWells said:\n\n\u2014O, I say, here's a fellow says he doesn't kiss his mother before he goes to bed.\n\nThey all laughed again. Stephen tried to laugh with them. He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What was the right answer to the question? He had given two and still Wells laughed. But Wells must know the right answer for he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of Wells's mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to Wells's face. He did not like Wells's face. It was Wells who had shouldered him into the square ditch the day before because he would not swop his little snuff box for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it was. And how cold and slimy the water had been! And a fellow had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum.\n\nThe cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say good night and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?\n\nSitting in the study hall he opened the lid of his desk and changed the number pasted up inside from seventy-seven to seventy-six. But the Christmas vacation was very far away: but one time it would come because the earth moved round always.\n\nThere was a picture of the earth on the first page of his geography: a big ball in the middle of clouds. Fleming had a box of crayons and one night during free study he had coloured the earth green and the clouds maroon. That was like the two brushes in Dante's press, the brush with the green velvet back for Parnell and the brush with the maroon velvet back for Michael Davitt. But he had not told Fleming to colour them those colours. Fleming had done it himself.\n\nHe opened the geography to study the lesson; but he could not learn the names of places in America. Still they were all different places that had different names. They were all in different countries and the countries were in continents and the continents were in the world and the world was in the universe.\n\nHe turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he had written there: himself, his name and where he was.\n\nStephen Dedalus\nClass of Elements\nClongowes Wood College\nSallins\nCounty Kildare\nIreland\nEurope\nThe World\nThe Universe\n\nThat was in his writing: and Fleming one night for a cod had written on the opposite page:\n\nStephen Dedalus is my name,\nIreland is my nation.\nClongowes is my dwellingplace\nAnd heaven my expectation.\n\nHe read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry. Then he read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he came to his own name. That was he: and he read down the page again. What was after the universe?\n\nNothing. But was there anything round the universe to show where it stopped before the nothing place began?\n\nIt could not be a wall; but there could be a thin thin line there all round everything. It was very big to think about everything and everywhere. Only God could do that. He tried to think what a big thought that must be; but he could only think of God. God was God's name just as his name was Stephen. Dieu was the French for God and that was God's name too; and when anyone prayed to God and said Dieu then God knew at once that it was a French person that was praying. But, though there were different names for God in all the different languages in the world and God understood what all the people who prayed said in their different languages, still God remained always the same God and God's real name was God.\n\nIt made him very tired to think that way. It made him feel his head very big. He turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon clouds. He wondered which was right, to be for the green or for the maroon, because Dante had ripped the green velvet back off the brush that was for Parnell one day with her scissors and had told him that Parnell was a bad man. He wondered if they were arguing at home about that. That was called politics. There were two sides in it: Dante was on one side and his father and Mr Casey were on the other side but his mother and uncle Charles were on no side. Every day there was something in the paper about it.\n\nIt pained him that he did not know well what politics meant and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and then again another term and then again the vacation. It was like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think how cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over, ever so warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn.\n\nThe bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the study hall after the others and down the staircase and along the corridors to the chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the chapel was darkly lit. Soon all would be dark and sleeping. There was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were the colour the sea was at night. The sea was cold day and night: but it was colder at night. It was cold and dark under the seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would be on the hob to make punch.\n\nThe prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his memory knew the responses:\n\nO Lord open our lips\nAnd our mouths shall announce Thy praise.\nIncline unto our aid, O God!\nO Lord make haste to help us!\n\nThere was a cold night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy smell. It was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy peasants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they prayed. They lived in Clane, a fellow said: there were little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the half-door of a cottage with a child in her arms as the cars had come past from Sallins. It would be lovely to sleep for one night in that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the dark lit by the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of the peasants, air and rain and turf and corduroy. But O, the road there between the trees was dark! You would be lost in the dark. It made him afraid to think of how it was.\n\nHe heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last prayers. He prayed it too against the dark outside under the trees.\n\nVisit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and drive away from it all the snares of the enemy. May Thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace and may Thy blessing be always upon us through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.\n\nHis fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormitory. He told his fingers to hurry up. He had to undress and then kneel and say his own prayers and be in bed before the gas was lowered so that he might not go to hell when he died. He rolled his stockings off and put on his nightshirt quickly and knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his prayers quickly, fearing that the gas would go down. He felt his shoulders shaking as he murmured:\n\nGod bless my father and my mother and spare them to me!\nGod bless my little brothers and sisters and spare them to me!\nGod bless Dante and uncle Charles and spare them to me!\n\nHe blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself together under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling. But he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would stop. A voice bade the boys in the dormitory good night. He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. The light was lowered quietly.\n\nThe prefect's shoes went away. Where? Down the staircase and along the corridors or to his room at the end? He saw the dark. Was it true about the black dog that walked there at night with eyes as big as carriage-lamps? They said it was the ghost of a murderer. A long shiver of fear flowed over his body. He saw the dark entrance hall of the castle. Old servants in old dress were in the ironing-room above the staircase. It was long ago. The old servants were quiet. There was a fire there, but the hall was still dark. A figure came up the staircase from the hall. He wore the white cloak of a marshal; his face was pale and strange; he held his hand pressed to his side. He looked out of strange eyes at the old servants. They looked at him and saw their master's face and cloak and knew that he had received his death-wound. But only the dark was where they looked: only dark silent air. Their master had received his death-wound on the battlefield of Prague far away over the sea. He was standing on the field; his hand was pressed to his side; his face was pale and strange and he wore the white cloak of a marshal.\n\nO how cold and strange it was to think of that! All the dark was cold and strange. There were pale strange faces there, great eyes like carriage-lamps. They were the ghosts of murderers, the figures of marshals who had received their death-wound on battlefields far away over the sea. What did they wish to say that their faces were so strange?\n\nVisit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and drive away from it all...\n\n\nGoing home for the holidays! That would be lovely: the fellows had told him. Getting up on the cars in the early wintry morning outside the door of the castle. The cars were rolling on the gravel. Cheers for the rector!\n\nHurray! Hurray! Hurray!\n\nThe cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised. They drove merrily along the country roads. The drivers pointed with their whips to Bodenstown. The fellows cheered. They passed the farmhouse of the Jolly Farmer. Cheer after cheer after cheer. Through Clane they drove, cheering and cheered. The peasant women stood at the half-doors, the men stood here and there. The lovely smell there was in the wintry air: the smell of Clane: rain and wintry air and turf smouldering and corduroy.\n\nThe train was full of fellows: a long long chocolate train with cream facings. The guards went to and fro opening, closing, locking, unlocking the doors. They were men in dark blue and silver; they had silvery whistles and their keys made a quick music: click, click: click, click.\n\nAnd the train raced on over the flat lands and past the Hill of Allen. The telegraph poles were passing, passing. The train went on and on. It knew. There were lanterns in the hall of his father's house and ropes of green branches. There were holly and ivy round the pierglass and holly and ivy, green and red, twined round the chandeliers. There were red holly and green ivy round the old portraits on the walls. Holly and ivy for him and for Christmas.\n\nLovely...\n\nAll the people. Welcome home, Stephen! Noises of welcome. His mother kissed him. Was that right? His father was a marshal now: higher than a magistrate. Welcome home, Stephen!\n\nNoises...\n\nThere was a noise of curtain-rings running back along the rods, of water being splashed in the basins. There was a noise of rising and dressing and washing in the dormitory: a noise of clapping of hands as the prefect went up and down telling the fellows to look sharp. A pale sunlight showed the yellow curtains drawn back, the tossed beds. His bed was very hot and his face and body were very hot.\n\nHe got up and sat on the side of his bed. He was weak. He tried to pull on his stocking. It had a horrid rough feel. The sunlight was queer and cold.\n\nFleming said:\n\n\u2014Are you not well?\n\nHe did not know; and Fleming said:\n\n\u2014Get back into bed. I'll tell McGlade you're not well.\n\n\u2014He's sick.\n\n\u2014Who is?\n\n\u2014Tell McGlade.\n\n\u2014Get back into bed.\n\n\u2014Is he sick?\n\nA fellow held his arms while he loosened the stocking clinging to his foot and climbed back into the hot bed.\n\nHe crouched down between the sheets, glad of their tepid glow. He heard the fellows talk among themselves about him as they dressed for mass. It was a mean thing to do, to shoulder him into the square ditch, they were saying.\n\nThen their voices ceased; they had gone. A voice at his bed said:\n\n\u2014Dedalus, don't spy on us, sure you won't?\n\nWells's face was there. He looked at it and saw that Wells was afraid.\n\n\u2014I didn't mean to. Sure you won't?\n\nHis father had told him, whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow. He shook his head and answered no and felt glad.\n\nWells said:\n\n\u2014I didn't mean to, honour bright. It was only for cod. I'm sorry.\n\nThe face and the voice went away. Sorry because he was afraid. Afraid that it was some disease. Canker was a disease of plants and cancer one of animals: or another different. That was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening light, creeping from point to point on the fringe of his line, a heavy bird flying low through the grey light. Leicester Abbey lit up. Wolsey died there. The abbots buried him themselves.\n\nIt was not Wells's face, it was the prefect's. He was not foxing. No, no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he felt the prefect's hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead warm and damp against the prefect's cold damp hand. That was the way a rat felt, slimy and damp and cold. Every rat had two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet tucked up to jump, black slimy eyes to look out of. They could understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could not understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things.\n\nThe prefect was there again and it was his voice that was saying that he was to get up, that Father Minister had said he was to get up and dress and go to the infirmary. And while he was dressing himself as quickly as he could the prefect said:\n\n\u2014We must pack off to Brother Michael because we have the collywobbles!\n\nHe was very decent to say that. That was all to make him laugh. But he could not laugh because his cheeks and lips were all shivery: and then the prefect had to laugh by himself.\n\nThe prefect cried:\n\n\u2014Quick march! Hayfoot! Strawfoot!\n\nThey went together down the staircase and along the corridor and past the bath. As he passed the door he remembered with a vague fear the warm turf-coloured bogwater, the warm moist air, the noise of plunges, the smell of the towels, like medicine.\n\nBrother Michael was standing at the door of the infirmary and from the door of the dark cabinet on his right came a smell like medicine. That came from the bottles on the shelves. The prefect spoke to Brother Michael and Brother Michael answered and called the prefect sir. He had reddish hair mixed with grey and a queer look. It was queer that he would always be a brother. It was queer too that you could not call him sir because he was a brother and had a different kind of look. Was he not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others?\n\nThere were two beds in the room and in one bed there was a fellow: and when they went in he called out:\n\n\u2014Hello! It's young Dedalus! What's up?\n\n\u2014The sky is up, Brother Michael said.\n\nHe was a fellow out of the third of grammar and, while Stephen was undressing, he asked Brother Michael to bring him a round of buttered toast.\n\n\u2014Ah, do! he said.\n\n\u2014Butter you up! said Brother Michael. You'll get your walking papers in the morning when the doctor comes.\n\n\u2014Will I? the fellow said. I'm not well yet.\n\nBrother Michael repeated:\n\n\u2014You'll get your walking papers. I tell you.\n\nHe bent down to rake the fire. He had a long back like the long back of a tramhorse. He shook the poker gravely and nodded his head at the fellow out of third of grammar.\n\nThen Brother Michael went away and after a while the fellow out of third of grammar turned in towards the wall and fell asleep.\n\nThat was the infirmary. He was sick then. Had they written home to tell his mother and father? But it would be quicker for one of the priests to go himself to tell them. Or he would write a letter for the priest to bring.\n\nDear Mother,\n\nI am sick. I want to go home. Please come and take me home.\nI am in the infirmary.\n\nYour fond son,\nStephen\n\nHow far away they were! There was cold sunlight outside the window. He wondered if he would die. You could die just the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother came. Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the fellows had told him it was when Little had died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with sad faces. Wells too would be there but no fellow would look at him. The rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the catafalque. And they would carry the coffin out of the chapel slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes. And Wells would be sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll slowly.\n\nHe could hear the tolling. He said over to himself the song that Brigid had taught him.\n\nDingdong! The castle bell!\nFarewell, my mother!\nBury me in the old churchyard\nBeside my eldest brother.\nMy coffin shall be black,\nSix angels at my back,\nTwo to sing and two to pray\nAnd two to carry my soul away.\n\nHow beautiful and sad that was! How beautiful the words were where they said Bury me in the old churchyard! A tremor passed over his body. How sad and how beautiful! He wanted to cry quietly but not for himself: for the words, so beautiful and sad, like music. The bell! The bell! Farewell! O farewell!\n\nThe cold sunlight was weaker and Brother Michael was standing at his bedside with a bowl of beef-tea. He was glad for his mouth was hot and dry. He could hear them playing in the playgrounds. And the day was going on in the college just as if he were there.\n\nThen Brother Michael was going away and the fellow out of the third of grammar told him to be sure and come back and tell him all the news in the paper. He told Stephen that his name was Athy and that his father kept a lot of racehorses that were spiffing jumpers and that his father would give a good tip to Brother Michael any time he wanted it because Brother Michael was very decent and always told him the news out of the paper they got every day up in the castle. There was every kind of news in the paper: accidents, shipwrecks, sports, and politics.\n\n\u2014Now it is all about politics in the papers, he said. Do your people talk about that too?\n\n\u2014Yes, Stephen said.\n\n\u2014Mine too, he said.\n\nThen he thought for a moment and said:\n\n\u2014You have a queer name, Dedalus, and I have a queer name too, Athy. My name is the name of a town. Your name is like Latin.\n\nThen he asked:\n\n\u2014Are you good at riddles?\n\nStephen answered:\n\n\u2014Not very good.\n\nThen he said:\n\n\u2014Can you answer me this one? Why is the county of Kildare like the leg of a fellow's breeches?\n\nStephen thought what could be the answer and then said:\n\n\u2014I give it up.\n\n\u2014Because there is a thigh in it, he said. Do you see the joke? Athy is the town in the county Kildare and a thigh is the other thigh.\n\n\u2014Oh, I see, Stephen said.\n\n\u2014That's an old riddle, he said.\n\nAfter a moment he said:\n\n\u2014I say!\n\n\u2014What? asked Stephen.\n\n\u2014You know, he said, you can ask that riddle another way.\n\n\u2014Can you? said Stephen.\n\n\u2014The same riddle, he said. Do you know the other way to ask it?\n\n\u2014No, said Stephen.\n\n\u2014Can you not think of the other way? he said.\n\nHe looked at Stephen over the bedclothes as he spoke. Then he lay back on the pillow and said:\n\n\u2014There is another way but I won't tell you what it is.\n\nWhy did he not tell it? His father, who kept the racehorses, must be a magistrate too like Saurin's father and Nasty Roche's father. He thought of his own father, of how he sang songs while his mother played and of how he always gave him a shilling when he asked for sixpence and he felt sorry for him that he was not a magistrate like the other boys' fathers. Then why was he sent to that place with them? But his father had told him that he would be no stranger there because his granduncle had presented an address to the liberator there fifty years before. You could know the people of that time by their old dress. It seemed to him a solemn time: and he wondered if that was the time when the fellows in Clongowes wore blue coats with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats and caps of rabbitskin and drank beer like grown-up people and kept greyhounds of their own to course the hares with.\n\nHe looked at the window and saw that the daylight had grown weaker. There would be cloudy grey light over the playgrounds. There was no noise on the playgrounds. The class must be doing the themes or perhaps Father Arnall was reading out of the book.\n\nIt was queer that they had not given him any medicine. Perhaps Brother Michael would bring it back when he came. They said you got stinking stuff to drink when you were in the infirmary. But he felt better now than before. It would be nice getting better slowly. You could get a book then. There was a book in the library about Holland. There were lovely foreign names in it and pictures of strange looking cities and ships. It made you feel so happy.\n\nHow pale the light was at the window! But that was nice. The fire rose and fell on the wall. It was like waves. Someone had put coal on and he heard voices. They were talking. It was the noise of the waves. Or the waves were talking among themselves as they rose and fell.\n\nHe saw the sea of waves, long dark waves rising and falling, dark under the moonless night. A tiny light twinkled at the pierhead where the ship was entering: and he saw a multitude of people gathered by the waters' edge to see the ship that was entering their harbour. A tall man stood on the deck, looking out towards the flat dark land: and by the light at the pierhead he saw his face, the sorrowful face of Brother Michael.\n\nHe saw him lift his hand towards the people and heard him say in a loud voice of sorrow over the waters:\n\n\u2014He is dead. We saw him lying upon the catafalque. A wail of sorrow went up from the people.\n\n\u2014Parnell! Parnell! He is dead!\n\nThey fell upon their knees, moaning in sorrow.\n\nAnd he saw Dante in a maroon velvet dress and with a green velvet mantle hanging from her shoulders walking proudly and silently past the people who knelt by the water's edge.\n\n\nA great fire, banked high and red, flamed in the grate and under the ivy-twined branches of the chandelier the Christmas table was spread. They had come home a little late and still dinner was not ready: but it would be ready in a jiffy his mother had said. They were waiting for the door to open and for the servants to come in, holding the big dishes covered with their heavy metal covers.\n\nAll were waiting: uncle Charles, who sat far away in the shadow of the window, Dante and Mr Casey, who sat in the easy-chairs at either side of the hearth, Stephen, seated on a chair between them, his feet resting on the toasted boss. Mr Dedalus looked at himself in the pierglass above the mantelpiece, waxed out his moustache ends and then, parting his coat-tails, stood with his back to the glowing fire: and still from time to time he withdrew a hand from his coat-tail to wax out one of his moustache ends. Mr Casey leaned his head to one side and, smiling, tapped the gland of his neck with his fingers. And Stephen smiled too for he knew now that it was not true that Mr Casey had a purse of silver in his throat. He smiled to think how the silvery noise which Mr Casey used to make had deceived him. And when he had tried to open Mr Casey's hand to see if the purse of silver was hidden there he had seen that the fingers could not be straightened out: and Mr Casey had told him that he had got those three cramped fingers making a birthday present for Queen Victoria. Mr Casey tapped the gland of his neck and smiled at Stephen with sleepy eyes: and Mr Dedalus said to him:\n\n\u2014Yes. Well now, that's all right. O, we had a good walk, hadn't we, John? Yes... I wonder if there's any likelihood of dinner this evening. Yes... O, well now, we got a good breath of ozone round the Head today. Ay, bedad.\n\nHe turned to Dante and said:\n\n\u2014You didn't stir out at all, Mrs Riordan?\n\nDante frowned and said shortly:\n\n\u2014No.\n\nMr Dedalus dropped his coat-tails and went over to the sideboard. He brought forth a great stone jar of whisky from the locker and filled the decanter slowly, bending now and then to see how much he had poured in. Then replacing the jar in the locker he poured a little of the whisky into two glasses, added a little water and came back with them to the fireplace.\n\n\u2014A thimbleful, John, he said, just to whet your appetite.\n\nMr Casey took the glass, drank, and placed it near him on the mantelpiece. Then he said:\n\n\u2014Well, I can't help thinking of our friend Christopher manufacturing...\n\nHe broke into a fit of laughter and coughing and added:\n\n\u2014...manufacturing that champagne for those fellows.\n\nMr Dedalus laughed loudly.\n\n\u2014Is it Christy? he said. There's more cunning in one of those warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes.\n\nHe inclined his head, closed his eyes, and, licking his lips profusely, began to speak with the voice of the hotel keeper.\n\n\u2014And he has such a soft mouth when he's speaking to you, don't you know. He's very moist and watery about the dewlaps, God bless him.\n\nMr Casey was still struggling through his fit of coughing and laughter. Stephen, seeing and hearing the hotel keeper through his father's face and voice, laughed.\n\nMr Dedalus put up his eyeglass and, staring down at him, said quietly and kindly:\n\n\u2014What are you laughing at, you little puppy, you?\n\nThe servants entered and placed the dishes on the table. Mrs Dedalus followed and the places were arranged.\n\n\u2014Sit over, she said.\n\nMr Dedalus went to the end of the table and said:\n\n\u2014Now, Mrs Riordan, sit over. John, sit you down, my hearty.\n\nHe looked round to where uncle Charles sat and said:\n\n\u2014Now then, sir, there's a bird here waiting for you.\n\nWhen all had taken their seats he laid his hand on the cover and then said quickly, withdrawing it:\n\n\u2014Now, Stephen.\n\nStephen stood up in his place to say the grace before meals:\n\nBless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts which through Thy bounty we are about to receive through Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nAll blessed themselves and Mr Dedalus with a sigh of pleasure lifted from the dish the heavy cover pearled around the edge with glistening drops.\n\nStephen looked at the plump turkey which had lain, trussed and skewered, on the kitchen table. He knew that his father had paid a guinea for it in Dunn's of D'Olier Street and that the man had prodded it often at the breastbone to show how good it was: and he remembered the man's voice when he had said:\n\n\u2014Take that one, sir. That's the real Ally Daly.\n\nWhy did Mr Barrett in Clongowes call his pandybat a turkey? But Clongowes was far away: and the warm heavy smell of turkey and ham and celery rose from the plates and dishes and the great fire was banked high and red in the grate and the green ivy and red holly made you feel so happy and when dinner was ended the big plum pudding would be carried in, studded with peeled almonds and sprigs of holly, with bluish fire running around it and a little green flag flying from the top.\n\nIt was his first Christmas dinner and he thought of his little brothers and sisters who were waiting in the nursery, as he had often waited, till the pudding came. The deep low collar and the Eton jacket made him feel queer and oldish: and that morning when his mother had brought him down to the parlour, dressed for mass, his father had cried. That was because he was thinking of his own father. And uncle Charles had said so too.\n\nMr Dedalus covered the dish and began to eat hungrily. Then he said:\n\n\u2014Poor old Christy, he's nearly lopsided now with roguery.\n\n\u2014Simon, said Mrs Dedalus, you haven't given Mrs Riordan any sauce.\n\nMr Dedalus seized the sauceboat.\n\n\u2014Haven't I? he cried. Mrs Riordan, pity the poor blind. Dante covered her plate with her hands and said:\n\n\u2014No, thanks.\n\nMr Dedalus turned to uncle Charles.\n\n\u2014How are you off, sir?\n\n\u2014Right as the mail, Simon.\n\n\u2014You, John?\n\n\u2014I'm all right. Go on yourself.\n\n\u2014Mary? Here, Stephen, here's something to make your hair curl.\n\nHe poured sauce freely over Stephen's plate and set the boat again on the table. Then he asked uncle Charles was it tender. Uncle Charles could not speak because his mouth was full; but he nodded that it was.\n\n\u2014That was a good answer our friend made to the canon. What? said Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014I didn't think he had that much in him, said Mr Casey.\n\n\u2014I'll pay your dues, father, when you cease turning the house of God into a pollingbooth.\n\n\u2014A nice answer, said Dante, for any man calling himself a catholic to give to his priest.\n\n\u2014They have only themselves to blame, said Mr Dedalus suavely. If they took a fool's advice they would confine their attention to religion.\n\n\u2014It is religion, Dante said. They are doing their duty in warning the people.\n\n\u2014We go to the house of God, Mr Casey said, in all humility to pray to our Maker and not to hear election addresses.\n\n\u2014It is religion, Dante said again. They are right. They must direct their flocks.\n\n\u2014And preach politics from the altar, is it? asked Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014Certainly, said Dante. It is a question of public morality. A priest would not be a priest if he did not tell his flock what is right and what is wrong.\n\nMrs Dedalus laid down her knife and fork, saying:\n\n\u2014For pity sake and for pity sake let us have no political discussion on this day of all days in the year.\n\n\u2014Quite right, ma'am, said uncle Charles. Now, Simon, that's quite enough now. Not another word now.\n\n\u2014Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus quickly.\n\nHe uncovered the dish boldly and said:\n\n\u2014Now then, who's for more turkey?\n\nNobody answered. Dante said:\n\n\u2014Nice language for any catholic to use!\n\n\u2014Mrs Riordan, I appeal to you, said Mrs Dedalus, to let the matter drop now.\n\nDante turned on her and said:\n\n\u2014And am I to sit here and listen to the pastors of my church being flouted?\n\n\u2014Nobody is saying a word against them, said Mr Dedalus, so long as they don't meddle in politics.\n\n\u2014The bishops and priests of Ireland have spoken, said Dante, and they must be obeyed.\n\n\u2014Let them leave politics alone, said Mr Casey, or the people may leave their church alone.\n\n\u2014You hear? said Dante, turning to Mrs Dedalus.\n\n\u2014Mr Casey! Simon! said Mrs Dedalus, let it end now.\n\n\u2014Too bad! Too bad! said uncle Charles.\n\n\u2014What? cried Mr Dedalus. Were we to desert him at the bidding of the English people?\n\n\u2014He was no longer worthy to lead, said Dante. He was a public sinner.\n\n\u2014We are all sinners and black sinners, said Mr Casey coldly.\n\n\u2014Woe be to the man by whom the scandal cometh! said Mrs Riordan. It would be better for him that a millstone were tied about his neck and that he were cast into the depths of the sea rather than that he should scandalise one of these, my least little ones. That is the language of the Holy Ghost.\n\n\u2014And very bad language if you ask me, said Mr Dedalus coolly.\n\n\u2014Simon! Simon! said uncle Charles. The boy.\n\n\u2014Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus. I meant about the... I was thinking about the bad language of the railway porter. Well now, that's all right. Here, Stephen, show me your plate, old chap. Eat away now. Here.\n\nHe heaped up the food on Stephen's plate and served uncle Charles and Mr Casey to large pieces of turkey and splashes of sauce. Mrs Dedalus was eating little and Dante sat with her hands in her lap. She was red in the face. Mr Dedalus rooted with the carvers at the end of the dish and said:\n\n\u2014There's a tasty bit here we call the pope's nose. If any lady or gentleman...\n\nHe held a piece of fowl up on the prong of the carving fork. Nobody spoke. He put it on his own plate, saying:\n\n\u2014Well, you can't say but you were asked. I think I had better eat it myself because I'm not well in my health lately.\n\nHe winked at Stephen and, replacing the dish-cover, began to eat again.\n\nThere was a silence while he ate. Then he said:\n\n\u2014Well now, the day kept up fine after all. There were plenty of strangers down too.\n\nNobody spoke. He said again:\n\n\u2014I think there were more strangers down than last Christmas.\n\nHe looked round at the others whose faces were bent towards their plates and, receiving no reply, waited for a moment and said bitterly:\n\n\u2014Well, my Christmas dinner has been spoiled anyhow.\n\n\u2014There could be neither luck nor grace, Dante said, in a house where there is no respect for the pastors of the church.\n\nMr Dedalus threw his knife and fork noisily on his plate.\n\n\u2014Respect! he said. Is it for Billy with the lip or for the tub of guts up in Armagh? Respect!\n\n\u2014Princes of the church, said Mr Casey with slow scorn.\n\n\u2014Lord Leitrim's coachman, yes, said Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014They are the Lord's anointed, Dante said. They are an honour to their country.\n\n\u2014Tub of guts, said Mr Dedalus coarsely. He has a handsome face, mind you, in repose. You should see that fellow lapping up his bacon and cabbage of a cold winter's day. O Johnny!\n\nHe twisted his features into a grimace of heavy bestiality and made a lapping noise with his lips.\n\n\u2014Really, Simon, you should not speak that way before Stephen. It's not right.\n\n\u2014O, he'll remember all this when he grows up, said Dante hotly\u2014the language he heard against God and religion and priests in his own home.\n\n\u2014Let him remember too, cried Mr Casey to her from across the table, the language with which the priests and the priests' pawns broke Parnell's heart and hounded him into his grave. Let him remember that too when he grows up.\n\n\u2014Sons of bitches! cried Mr Dedalus. When he was down they turned on him to betray him and rend him like rats in a sewer. Low-lived dogs! And they look it! By Christ, they look it!\n\n\u2014They behaved rightly, cried Dante. They obeyed their bishops and their priests. Honour to them!\n\n\u2014Well, it is perfectly dreadful to say that not even for one day in the year, said Mrs Dedalus, can we be free from these dreadful disputes!\n\nUncle Charles raised his hands mildly and said:\n\n\u2014Come now, come now, come now! Can we not have our opinions whatever they are without this bad temper and this bad language? It is too bad surely.\n\nMrs Dedalus spoke to Dante in a low voice but Dante said loudly:\n\n\u2014I will not say nothing. I will defend my church and my religion when it is insulted and spit on by renegade catholics.\n\nMr Casey pushed his plate rudely into the middle of the table and, resting his elbows before him, said in a hoarse voice to his host:\n\n\u2014Tell me, did I tell you that story about a very famous spit?\n\n\u2014You did not, John, said Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014Why then, said Mr Casey, it is a most instructive story. It happened not long ago in the county Wicklow where we are now.\n\nHe broke off and, turning towards Dante, said with quiet indignation:\n\n\u2014And I may tell you, ma'am, that I, if you mean me, am no renegade catholic. I am a catholic as my father was and his father before him and his father before him again, when we gave up our lives rather than sell our faith.\n\n\u2014The more shame to you now, Dante said, to speak as you do.\n\n\u2014The story, John, said Mr Dedalus smiling. Let us have the story anyhow.\n\n\u2014Catholic indeed! repeated Dante ironically. The blackest protestant in the land would not speak the language I have heard this evening.\n\nMr Dedalus began to sway his head to and fro, crooning like a country singer.\n\n\u2014I am no protestant, I tell you again, said Mr Casey, flushing.\n\nMr Dedalus, still crooning and swaying his head, began to sing in a grunting nasal tone:\n\nO, come all you Roman catholics That never went to mass.\n\nHe took up his knife and fork again in good humour and set to eating, saying to Mr Casey:\n\n\u2014Let us have the story, John. It will help us to digest.\n\nStephen looked with affection at Mr Casey's face which stared across the table over his joined hands. He liked to sit near him at the fire, looking up at his dark fierce face. But his dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because Dante must be right then. But he had heard his father say that she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent in the Alleghanies when her brother had got the money from the savages for the trinkets and the chainies. Perhaps that made her severe against Parnell. And she did not like him to play with Eileen because Eileen was a protestant and when she was young she knew children that used to play with protestants and the protestants used to make fun of the litany of the Blessed Virgin. Tower of Ivory, they used to say, House of Gold! How could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold? Who was right then? And he remembered the evening in the infirmary in Clongowes, the dark waters, the light at the pierhead and the moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard.\n\nEileen had long white hands. One evening when playing tig she had put her hands over his eyes: long and white and thin and cold and soft. That was ivory: a cold white thing. That was the meaning of Tower of Ivory.\n\n\u2014The story is very short and sweet, Mr Casey said. It was one day down in Arklow, a cold bitter day, not long before the chief died. May God have mercy on him!\n\nHe closed his eyes wearily and paused. Mr Dedalus took a bone from his plate and tore some meat from it with his teeth, saying:\n\n\u2014Before he was killed, you mean.\n\nMr Casey opened his eyes, sighed and went on:\n\n\u2014It was down in Arklow one day. We were down there at a meeting and after the meeting was over we had to make our way to the railway station through the crowd. Such booing and baaing, man, you never heard. They called us all the names in the world. Well there was one old lady, and a drunken old harridan she was surely, that paid all her attention to me. She kept dancing along beside me in the mud bawling and screaming into my face: Priesthunter! The Paris Funds! Mr Fox! Kitty O'Shea!\n\n\u2014And what did you do, John? asked Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014I let her bawl away, said Mr Casey. It was a cold day and to keep up my heart I had (saving your presence, ma'am) a quid of Tullamore in my mouth and sure I couldn't say a word in any case because my mouth was full of tobacco juice.\n\n\u2014Well, John?\n\n\u2014Well. I let her bawl away, to her heart's content, Kitty O'Shea and the rest of it till at last she called that lady a name that I won't sully this Christmas board nor your ears, ma'am, nor my own lips by repeating.\n\nHe paused. Mr Dedalus, lifting his head from the bone, asked:\n\n\u2014And what did you do, John?\n\n\u2014Do! said Mr Casey. She stuck her ugly old face up at me when she said it and I had my mouth full of tobacco juice. I bent down to her and Phth! says I to her like that.\n\nHe turned aside and made the act of spitting.\n\n\u2014Phth! says I to her like that, right into her eye.\n\nHe clapped his hand to his eye and gave a hoarse scream of pain.\n\n\u2014O Jesus, Mary and Joseph! says she. I'm blinded! I'm blinded and drownded!\n\nHe stopped in a fit of coughing and laughter, repeating:\n\n\u2014I'm blinded entirely.\n\nMr Dedalus laughed loudly and lay back in his chair while uncle Charles swayed his head to and fro.\n\nDante looked terribly angry and repeated while they laughed:\n\n\u2014Very nice! Ha! Very nice!\n\nIt was not nice about the spit in the woman's eye.\n\nBut what was the name the woman had called Kitty O'Shea that Mr Casey would not repeat? He thought of Mr Casey walking through the crowds of people and making speeches from a wagonette. That was what he had been in prison for and he remembered that one night Sergeant O'Neill had come to the house and had stood in the hall, talking in a low voice with his father and chewing nervously at the chinstrap of his cap. And that night Mr Casey had not gone to Dublin by train but a car had come to the door and he had heard his father say something about the Cabinteely road.\n\nHe was for Ireland and Parnell and so was his father: and so was Dante too for one night at the band on the esplanade she had hit a gentleman on the head with her umbrella because he had taken off his hat when the band played God save the Queen at the end.\n\nMr Dedalus gave a snort of contempt.\n\n\u2014Ah, John, he said. It is true for them. We are an unfortunate priest-ridden race and always were and always will be till the end of the chapter.\n\nUncle Charles shook his head, saying:\n\n\u2014A bad business! A bad business!\n\nMr Dedalus repeated:\n\n\u2014A priest-ridden Godforsaken race!\n\nHe pointed to the portrait of his grandfather on the wall to his right.\n\n\u2014Do you see that old chap up there, John? he said. He was a good Irishman when there was no money in the job. He was condemned to death as a whiteboy. But he had a saying about our clerical friends, that he would never let one of them put his two feet under his mahogany.\n\nDante broke in angrily:\n\n\u2014If we are a priest-ridden race we ought to be proud of it! They are the apple of God's eye.  Touch them not, says Christ, for they are the apple of My eye.\n\n\u2014And can we not love our country then? asked Mr Casey. Are we not to follow the man that was born to lead us?\n\n\u2014A traitor to his country! replied Dante. A traitor, an adulterer! The priests were right to abandon him. The priests were always the true friends of Ireland.\n\n\u2014Were they, faith? said Mr Casey.\n\nHe threw his fist on the table and, frowning angrily, protruded one finger after another.\n\n\u2014Didn't the bishops of Ireland betray us in the time of the union when Bishop Lanigan presented an address of loyalty to the Marquess Cornwallis? Didn't the bishops and priests sell the aspirations of their country in 1829 in return for catholic emancipation? Didn't they denounce the fenian movement from the pulpit and in the confession box? And didn't they dishonour the ashes of Terence Bellew MacManus?\n\nHis face was glowing with anger and Stephen felt the glow rise to his own cheek as the spoken words thrilled him. Mr Dedalus uttered a guffaw of coarse scorn.\n\n\u2014O, by God, he cried, I forgot little old Paul Cullen! Another apple of God's eye!\n\nDante bent across the table and cried to Mr Casey:\n\n\u2014Right! Right! They were always right! God and morality and religion come first.\n\nMrs Dedalus, seeing her excitement, said to her:\n\n\u2014Mrs Riordan, don't excite yourself answering them.\n\n\u2014God and religion before everything! Dante cried. God and religion before the world.\n\nMr Casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down on the table with a crash.\n\n\u2014Very well then, he shouted hoarsely, if it comes to that, no God for Ireland!\n\n\u2014John! John! cried Mr Dedalus, seizing his guest by the coat sleeve.\n\nDante stared across the table, her cheeks shaking. Mr Casey struggled up from his chair and bent across the table towards her, scraping the air from before his eyes with one hand as though he were tearing aside a cobweb.\n\n\u2014No God for Ireland! he cried. We have had too much God In Ireland. Away with God!\n\n\u2014Blasphemer! Devil! screamed Dante, starting to her feet and almost spitting in his face.\n\nUncle Charles and Mr Dedalus pulled Mr Casey back into his chair again, talking to him from both sides reasonably. He stared before him out of his dark flaming eyes, repeating:\n\n\u2014Away with God, I say!\n\nDante shoved her chair violently aside and left the table, upsetting her napkin-ring which rolled slowly along the carpet and came to rest against the foot of an easy-chair. Mrs Dedalus rose quickly and followed her towards the door. At the door Dante turned round violently and shouted down the room, her cheeks flushed and quivering with rage:\n\n\u2014Devil out of hell! We won! We crushed him to death! Fiend!\n\nThe door slammed behind her.\n\nMr Casey, freeing his arms from his holders, suddenly bowed his head on his hands with a sob of pain.\n\n\u2014Poor Parnell! he cried loudly. My dead king!\n\nHe sobbed loudly and bitterly.\n\nStephen, raising his terror-stricken face, saw that his father's eyes were full of tears.\n\n\nThe fellows talked together in little groups.\n\nOne fellow said:\n\n\u2014They were caught near the Hill of Lyons.\n\n\u2014Who caught them?\n\n\u2014Mr Gleeson and the minister. They were on a car. The same fellow added:\n\n\u2014A fellow in the higher line told me.\n\nFleming asked:\n\n\u2014But why did they run away, tell us?\n\n\u2014I know why, Cecil Thunder said. Because they had fecked cash out of the rector's room.\n\n\u2014Who fecked it?\n\n\u2014Kickham's brother. And they all went shares in it.\n\n\u2014But that was stealing. How could they have done that?\n\n\u2014A fat lot you know about it, Thunder! Wells said. I know why they scut.\n\n\u2014Tell us why.\n\n\u2014I was told not to, Wells said.\n\n\u2014O, go on, Wells, all said. You might tell us. We won't let it out.\n\nStephen bent forward his head to hear. Wells looked round to see if anyone was coming. Then he said secretly:\n\n\u2014You know the altar wine they keep in the press in the sacristy?\n\n\u2014Yes.\n\n\u2014Well, they drank that and it was found out who did it by the smell. And that's why they ran away, if you want to know.\n\nAnd the fellow who had spoken first said:\n\n\u2014Yes, that's what I heard too from the fellow in the higher line.\n\nThe fellows all were silent. Stephen stood among them, afraid to speak, listening. A faint sickness of awe made him feel weak. How could they have done that? He thought of the dark silent sacristy. There were dark wooden presses there where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It was not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath. It was a holy place. He remembered the summer evening he had been there to be dressed as boatbearer, the evening of the Procession to the little altar in the wood. A strange and holy place. The boy that held the censer had swung it lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals lighting. That was called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as the fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell. And then when all were vested he had stood holding out the boat to the rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense in it and it had hissed on the red coals.\n\nThe fellows were talking together in little groups here and there on the playground. The fellows seemed to him to have grown smaller: that was because a sprinter had knocked him down the day before, a fellow out of second of grammar. He had been thrown by the fellow's machine lightly on the cinder path and his spectacles had been broken in three pieces and some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth.\n\nThat was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and farther away and the goalposts so thin and far and the soft grey sky so high up. But there was no play on the football grounds for cricket was coming: and some said that Barnes would be prof and some said it would be Flowers. And all over the playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling twisters and lobs. And from here and from there came the sounds of the cricket bats through the soft grey air. They said: pick, pack, pock, puck: little drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in the brimming bowl.\n\nAthy, who had been silent, said quietly:\n\n\u2014You are all wrong.\n\nAll turned towards him eagerly.\n\n\u2014Why?\n\n\u2014Do you know?\n\n\u2014Who told you?\n\n\u2014Tell us, Athy.\n\nAthy pointed across the playground to where Simon Moonan was walking by himself kicking a stone before him.\n\n\u2014Ask him, he said.\n\nThe fellows looked there and then said:\n\n\u2014Why him?\n\n\u2014Is he in it?\n\nAthy lowered his voice and said:\n\n\u2014Do you know why those fellows scut? I will tell you but you must not let on you know.\n\n\u2014Tell us, Athy. Go on. You might if you know.\n\nHe paused for a moment and then said mysteriously:\n\n\u2014They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle in the square one night.\n\nThe fellows looked at him and asked:\n\n\u2014Caught?\n\n\u2014What doing?\n\nAthy said:\n\n\u2014Smugging.\n\nAll the fellows were silent: and Athy said:\n\n\u2014And that's why.\n\nStephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all looking across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody about it. What did that mean about the smugging in the square? Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run away for that? It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he was at the door. It was the night of the match against the Bective Rangers; and the ball was made just like a red and green apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy sweets. And one day Boyle had said that an elephant had two tuskers instead of two tusks and that was why he was called Tusker Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because he was always at his nails, paring them.\n\nEileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a girl. They were like ivory; only soft. That was the meaning of Tower of Ivory but protestants could not understand it and made fun of it. One day he had stood beside her looking into the hotel grounds. A waiter was running up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering to and fro on the sunny lawn. She had put her hand into his pocket where his hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand was. She had said that pockets were funny things to have: and then all of a sudden she had broken away and had run laughing down the sloping curve of the path. Her fair hair had streamed out behind her like gold in the sun. Tower of Ivory. House of Gold. By thinking of things you could understand them.\n\nBut why in the square? You went there when you wanted to do something. It was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled all day out of tiny pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale water there. And behind the door of one of the closets there was a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a Roman dress with a brick in each hand and underneath was the name of the drawing:\n\nBalbus was building a wall.\n\nSome fellow had drawn it there for a cod. It had a funny face but it was very like a man with a beard. And on the wall of another closet there was written in backhand in beautiful writing:\n\nJulius Caesar wrote The Calico Belly.\n\nPerhaps that was why they were there because it was a place where some fellows wrote things for cod. But all the same it was queer what Athy said and the way he said it. It was not a cod because they had run away. He looked with the others across the playground and began to feel afraid.\n\nAt last Fleming said:\n\n\u2014And we are all to be punished for what other fellows did?\n\n\u2014I won't come back, see if I do, Cecil Thunder said. Three days' silence in the refectory and sending us up for six and eight every minute.\n\n\u2014Yes, said Wells. And old Barrett has a new way of twisting the note so that you can't open it and fold it again to see how many ferulae you are to get. I won't come back too.\n\n\u2014Yes, said Cecil Thunder, and the prefect of studies was in second of grammar this morning.\n\n\u2014Let us get up a rebellion, Fleming said. Will we?\n\nAll the fellows were silent. The air was very silent and you could hear the cricket bats but more slowly than before: pick, pock.\n\nWells asked:\n\n\u2014What is going to be done to them?\n\n\u2014Simon Moonan and Tusker are going to be flogged, Athy said, and the fellows in the higher line got their choice of flogging or being expelled.\n\n\u2014And which are they taking? asked the fellow who had spoken first.\n\n\u2014All are taking expulsion except Corrigan, Athy answered. He's going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson.\n\n\u2014I know why, Cecil Thunder said. He is right and the other fellows are wrong because a flogging wears off after a bit but a fellow that has been expelled from college is known all his life on account of it. Besides Gleeson won't flog him hard.\n\n\u2014It's best of his play not to, Fleming said.\n\n\u2014I wouldn't like to be Simon Moonan and Tusker Cecil Thunder said. But I don't believe they will be flogged. Perhaps they will be sent up for twice nine.\n\n\u2014No, no, said Athy. They'll both get it on the vital spot. Wells rubbed himself and said in a crying voice:\n\n\u2014Please, sir, let me off!\n\nAthy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket, saying:\n\nIt can't be helped;\nIt must be done.\nSo down with your breeches\nAnd out with your bum.\n\nThe fellows laughed; but he felt that they were a little afraid. In the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from here and from there: pock. That was a sound to hear but if you were hit then you would feel a pain. The pandybat made a sound too but not like that. The fellows said it was made of whalebone and leather with lead inside: and he wondered what was the pain like. There were different kinds of sounds. A long thin cane would have a high whistling sound and he wondered what was that pain like. It made him shivery to think of it and cold: and what Athy said too. But what was there to laugh at in it? It made him shivery: but that was because you always felt like a shiver when you let down your trousers. It was the same in the bath when you undressed yourself. He wondered who had to let them down, the master or the boy himself. O how could they laugh about it that way?\n\nHe looked at Athy's rolled-up sleeves and knuckly inky hands. He had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had round shiny cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish white hands and the nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he pared them too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed nails. So long and cruel they were, though the white fattish hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with cold and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish hands, clean and strong and gentle. And he thought of what Cecil Thunder had said: that Mr Gleeson would not flog Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it was best of his play not to. But that was not why\n\nA voice from far out on the playground cried:\n\n\u2014All in!\n\nAnd other voices cried:\n\n\u2014All in! All in!\n\nDuring the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded, listening to the slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford went to and fro making little signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting beside the boy to show him how to hold his pen. He had tried to spell out the headline for himself though he knew already what it was for it was the last of the book. Zeal without prudence is like a ship adrift. But the lines of the letters were like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his right eye tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make out the full curves of the capital.\n\nBut Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away with and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible sin, to go in there quietly at night, to open the dark press and steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it. But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the press and be found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had made his first holy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's breath after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. But the faint smell of the rector's breath had made him feel a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day of your first communion was the happiest day of your life. And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. But he said:\n\n\u2014Gentlemen, the happiest day of my life was the day on which I made my first holy communion.\n\nFather Arnall came in and the Latin lesson began and he remained still, leaning on the desk with his arms folded. Father Arnall gave out the theme-books and he said that they were scandalous and that they were all to be written out again with the corrections at once. But the worst of all was Fleming's theme because the pages were stuck together by a blot: and Father Arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an insult to any master to send him up such a theme. Then he asked Jack Lawton to decline the noun mare and Jack Lawton stopped at the ablative singular and could not go on with the plural.\n\n\u2014You should be ashamed of yourself, said Father Arnall sternly. You, the leader of the class!\n\nThen he asked the next boy and the next and the next. Nobody knew. Father Arnall became very quiet, more and more quiet as each boy tried to answer it and could not. But his face was black-looking and his eyes were staring though his voice was so quiet. Then he asked Fleming and Fleming said that the word had no plural. Father Arnall suddenly shut the book and shouted at him:\n\n\u2014Kneel out there in the middle of the class. You are one of the idlest boys I ever met. Copy out your themes again the rest of you.\n\nFleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between the two last benches. The other boys bent over their theme-books and began to write. A silence filled the classroom and Stephen, glancing timidly at Father Arnall's dark face, saw that it was a little red from the wax he was in.\n\nWas that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he allowed to get into a wax when the boys were idle because that made them study better or was he only letting on to be in a wax? It was because he was allowed, because a priest would know what a sin was and would not do it. But if he did it one time by mistake what would he do to go to confession? Perhaps he would go to confession to the minister. And if the minister did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the provincial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits. That was called the order: and he had heard his father say that they were all clever men. They could all have become high-up people in the world if they had not become jesuits. And he wondered what Father Arnall and Paddy Barrett would have become and what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson would have become if they had not become jesuits. It was hard to think what because you would have to think of them in a different way with different coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches and different kinds of hats.\n\nThe door opened quietly and closed. A quick whisper ran through the class: the prefect of studies. There was an instant of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the last desk. Stephen's heart leapt up in fear.\n\n\u2014Any boys want flogging here, Father Arnall? cried the prefect of studies. Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this class?\n\nHe came to the middle of the class and saw Fleming on his knees.\n\n\u2014Hoho! he cried. Who is this boy? Why is he on his knees? What is your name, boy?\n\n\u2014Fleming, sir.\n\n\u2014Hoho, Fleming! An idler of course. I can see it in your eye. Why is he on his knees, Father Arnall?\n\n\u2014He wrote a bad Latin theme, Father Arnall said, and he missed all the questions in grammar.\n\n\u2014Of course he did! cried the prefect of studies, of course he did! A born idler! I can see it in the corner of his eye.\n\nHe banged his pandybat down on the desk and cried:\n\n\u2014Up, Fleming! Up, my boy!\n\nFleming stood up slowly.\n\n\u2014Hold out! cried the prefect of studies.\n\nFleming held out his hand. The pandybat came down on it with a loud smacking sound: one, two, three, four, five, six.\n\n\u2014Other hand!\n\nThe pandybat came down again in six loud quick smacks.\n\n\u2014Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies.\n\nFleming knelt down, squeezing his hands under his armpits, his face contorted with pain; but Stephen knew how hard his hands were because Fleming was always rubbing rosin into them. But perhaps he was in great pain for the noise of the pandybat was terrible. Stephen's heart was beating and fluttering.\n\n\u2014At your work, all of you! shouted the prefect of studies. We want no lazy idle loafers here, lazy idle little schemers. At your work, I tell you. Father Dolan will be in to see you every day. Father Dolan will be in tomorrow.\n\nHe poked one of the boys in the side with his pandybat, saying:\n\n\u2014You, boy! When will Father Dolan be in again?\n\n\u2014Tomorrow, sir, said Tom Furlong's voice.\n\n\u2014Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, said the prefect of studies. Make up your minds for that. Every day Father Dolan. Write away. You, boy, who are you?\n\nStephen's heart jumped suddenly.\n\n\u2014Dedalus, sir.\n\n\u2014Why are you not writing like the others?\n\n\u2014I...my...\n\nHe could not speak with fright.\n\n\u2014Why is he not writing, Father Arnall?\n\n\u2014He broke his glasses, said Father Arnall, and I exempted him from work.\n\n\u2014Broke? What is this I hear? What is this your name is! said the prefect of studies.\n\n\u2014Dedalus, sir.\n\n\u2014Out here, Dedalus. Lazy little schemer. I see schemer in your face. Where did you break your glasses?\n\nStephen stumbled into the middle of the class, blinded by fear and haste.\n\n\u2014Where did you break your glasses? repeated the prefect of studies.\n\n\u2014The cinder-path, sir.\n\n\u2014Hoho! The cinder-path! cried the prefect of studies. I know that trick.\n\nStephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for a moment Father Dolan's white-grey not young face, his baldy white-grey head with fluff at the sides of it, the steel rims of his spectacles and his no-coloured eyes looking through the glasses. Why did he say he knew that trick?\n\n\u2014Lazy idle little loafer! cried the prefect of studies. Broke my glasses! An old schoolboy trick! Out with your hand this moment!\n\nStephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling hand with the palm upwards. He felt the prefect of studies touch it for a moment at the fingers to straighten it and then the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat was lifted to strike. A hot burning stinging tingling blow like the loud crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the pain scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf in the air. A cry sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let off. But though the tears scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with pain and fright he held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his throat.\n\n\u2014Other hand! shouted the prefect of studies.\n\nStephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and held out his left hand. The soutane sleeve swished again as the pandybat was lifted and a loud crashing sound and a fierce maddening tingling burning pain made his hand shrink together with the palms and fingers in a livid quivering mass. The scalding water burst forth from his eyes and, burning with shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry come from his throat and the scalding tears falling out of his eyes and down his flaming cheeks.\n\n\u2014Kneel down, cried the prefect of studies.\n\nStephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his sides. To think of them beaten and swollen with pain all in a moment made him feel so sorry for them as if they were not his own but someone else's that he felt sorry for. And as he knelt, calming the last sobs in his throat and feeling the burning tingling pain pressed into his sides, he thought of the hands which he had held out in the air with the palms up and of the firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied the shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of palm and fingers that shook helplessly in the air.\n\n\u2014Get at your work, all of you, cried the prefect of studies from the door. Father Dolan will be in every day to see if any boy, any lazy idle little loafer wants flogging. Every day. Every day.\n\nThe door closed behind him.\n\nThe hushed class continued to copy out the themes. Father Arnall rose from his seat and went among them, helping the boys with gentle words and telling them the mistakes they had made. His voice was very gentle and soft. Then he returned to his seat and said to Fleming and Stephen:\n\n\u2014You may return to your places, you two.\n\nFleming and Stephen rose and, walking to their seats, sat down. Stephen, scarlet with shame, opened a book quickly with one weak hand and bent down upon it, his face close to the page.\n\nIt was unfair and cruel because the doctor had told him not to read without glasses and he had written home to his father that morning to send him a new pair. And Father Arnall had said that he need not study till the new glasses came. Then to be called a schemer before the class and to be pandied when he always got the card for first or second and was the leader of the Yorkists! How could the prefect of studies know that it was a trick? He felt the touch of the prefect's fingers as they had steadied his hand and at first he had thought he was going to shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm: but then in an instant he had heard the swish of the soutane sleeve and the crash. It was cruel and unfair to make him kneel in the middle of the class then: and Father Arnall had told them both that they might return to their places without making any difference between them. He listened to Father Arnall's low and gentle voice as he corrected the themes. Perhaps he was sorry now and wanted to be decent. But it was unfair and cruel. The prefect of studies was a priest but that was cruel and unfair. And his white-grey face and the no-coloured eyes behind the steel-rimmed spectacles were cruel looking because he had steadied the hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to hit it better and louder.\n\n\u2014It's a stinking mean thing, that's what it is, said Fleming in the corridor as the classes were passing out in file to the refectory, to pandy a fellow for what is not his fault.\n\n\u2014You really broke your glasses by accident, didn't you? Nasty Roche asked.\n\nStephen felt his heart filled by Fleming's words and did not answer.\n\n\u2014Of course he did! said Fleming. I wouldn't stand it. I'd go up and tell the rector on him.\n\n\u2014Yes, said Cecil Thunder eagerly, and I saw him lift the pandy-bat over his shoulder and he's not allowed to do that.\n\n\u2014Did they hurt you much? Nasty Roche asked.\n\n\u2014Very much, Stephen said.\n\n\u2014I wouldn't stand it, Fleming repeated, from Baldyhead or any other Baldyhead. It's a stinking mean low trick, that's what it is. I'd go straight up to the rector and tell him about it after dinner.\n\n\u2014Yes, do. Yes, do, said Cecil Thunder.\n\n\u2014Yes, do. Yes, go up and tell the rector on him, Dedalus, said Nasty Roche, because he said that he'd come in tomorrow again and pandy you.\n\n\u2014Yes, yes. Tell the rector, all said.\n\nAnd there were some fellows out of second of grammar listening and one of them said:\n\n\u2014The senate and the Roman people declared that Dedalus had been wrongly punished.\n\nIt was wrong; it was unfair and cruel; and, as he sat in the refectory, he suffered time after time in memory the same humiliation until he began to wonder whether it might not really be that there was something in his face which made him look like a schemer and he wished he had a little mirror to see. But there could not be; and it was unjust and cruel and unfair.\n\nHe could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on Wednesdays in lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the spade in it. Yes, he would do what the fellows had told him. He would go up and tell the rector that he had been wrongly punished. A thing like that had been done before by somebody in history, by some great person whose head was in the books of history. And the rector would declare that he had been wrongly punished because the senate and the Roman people always declared that the men who did that had been wrongly punished. Those were the great men whose names were in Richmal Magnall's Questions. History was all about those men and what they did and that was what Peter Parley's Tales about Greece and Rome were all about. Peter Parley himself was on the first page in a picture. There was a road over a heath with grass at the side and little bushes: and Peter Parley had a broad hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and he was walking fast along the road to Greece and Rome.\n\nIt was easy what he had to do. All he had to do was when the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the right that led to the castle. He had nothing to do but that: to turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a minute he would be in the low dark narrow corridor that led through the castle to the rector's room. And every fellow had said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of grammar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people.\n\nWhat would happen?\n\nHe heard the fellows of the higher line stand up at the top of the refectory and heard their steps as they came down the matting: Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and the Spaniard and the Portuguese and the fifth was big Corrigan who was going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. That was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer and pandied him for nothing: and, straining his weak eyes, tired with the tears, he watched big Corrigan's broad shoulders and big hanging black head passing in the file. But he had done something and besides Mr Gleeson would not flog him hard: and he remembered how big Corrigan looked in the bath. He had skin the same colour as the turf-coloured bogwater in the shallow end of the bath and when he walked along the side his feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at every step his thighs shook a little because he was fat.\n\nThe refectory was half empty and the fellows were still passing out in file. He could go up the staircase because there was never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door. But he could not go. The rector would side with the prefect of studies and think it was a schoolboy trick and then the prefect of studies would come in every day the same, only it would be worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow going up to the rector about him. The fellows had told him to go but they would not go themselves. They had forgotten all about it. No, it was best to forget all about it and perhaps the prefect of studies had only said he would come in. No, it was best to hide out of the way because when you were small and young you could often escape that way.\n\nThe fellows at his table stood up. He stood up and passed out among them in the file. He had to decide. He was coming near the door. If he went on with the fellows he could never go up to the rector because he could not leave the playground for that. And if he went and was pandied all the same all the fellows would make fun and talk about young Dedalus going up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies.\n\nHe was walking down along the matting and he saw the door before him. It was impossible: he could not. He thought of the baldy head of the prefect of studies with the cruel no-coloured eyes looking at him and he heard the voice of the prefect of studies asking him twice what his name was. Why could he not remember the name when he was told the first time? Was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun out of the name? The great men in the history had names like that and nobody made fun of them. It was his own name that he should have made fun of if he wanted to make fun. Dolan: it was like the name of a woman who washed clothes.\n\nHe had reached the door and, turning quickly up to the right, walked up the stairs and, before he could make up his mind to come back, he had entered the low dark narrow corridor that led to the castle. And as he crossed the threshold of the door of the corridor he saw, without turning his head to look, that all the fellows were looking after him as they went filing by.\n\nHe passed along the narrow dark corridor, passing little doors that were the doors of the rooms of the community. He peered in front of him and right and left through the gloom and thought that those must be portraits. It was dark and silent and his eyes were weak and tired with tears so that he could not see. But he thought they were the portraits of the saints and great men of the order who were looking down on him silently as he passed: saint Ignatius Loyola holding an open book and pointing to the words Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam in it; saint Francis Xavier pointing to his chest; Lorenzo Ricci with his berretta on his head like one of the prefects of the lines, the three patrons of holy youth\u2014saint Stanislaus Kostka, saint Aloysius Gonzago, and Blessed John Berchmans, all with young faces because they died when they were young, and Father Peter Kenny sitting in a chair wrapped in a big cloak.\n\nHe came out on the landing above the entrance hall and looked about him. That was where Hamilton Rowan had passed and the marks of the soldiers' slugs were there. And it was there that the old servants had seen the ghost in the white cloak of a marshal.\n\nAn old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing. He asked him where was the rector's room and the old servant pointed to the door at the far end and looked after him as he went on to it and knocked.\n\nThere was no answer. He knocked again more loudly and his heart jumped when he heard a muffled voice say:\n\n\u2014Come in!\n\nHe turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for the handle of the green baize door inside. He found it and pushed it open and went in.\n\nHe saw the rector sitting at a desk writing. There was a skull on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old leather of chairs.\n\nHis heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place he was in and the silence of the room: and he looked at the skull and at the rector's kind-looking face.\n\n\u2014Well, my little man, said the rector, what is it?\n\nStephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and said:\n\n\u2014I broke my glasses, sir.\n\nThe rector opened his mouth and said:\n\n\u2014O!\n\nThen he smiled and said:\n\n\u2014Well, if we broke our glasses we must write home for a new pair.\n\n\u2014I wrote home, sir, said Stephen, and Father Arnall said I am not to study till they come.\n\n\u2014Quite right! said the rector.\n\nStephen swallowed down the thing again and tried to keep his legs and his voice from shaking.\n\n\u2014But, sir\u2014\n\n\u2014Yes?\n\n\u2014Father Dolan came in today and pandied me because I was not writing my theme.\n\nThe rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the blood rising to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes.\n\nThe rector said:\n\n\u2014Your name is Dedalus, isn't it?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir...\n\n\u2014And where did you break your glasses?\n\n\u2014On the cinder-path, sir. A fellow was coming out of the bicycle house and I fell and they got broken. I don't know the fellow's name.\n\nThe rector looked at him again in silence. Then he smiled and said:\n\n\u2014O, well, it was a mistake; I am sure Father Dolan did not know.\n\n\u2014But I told him I broke them, sir, and he pandied me.\n\n\u2014Did you tell him that you had written home for a new pair? the rector asked.\n\n\u2014No, sir.\n\n\u2014O well then, said the rector, Father Dolan did not understand. You can say that I excuse you from your lessons for a few days.\n\nStephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent him:\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, but Father Dolan said he will come in tomorrow to pandy me again for it.\n\n\u2014Very well, the rector said, it is a mistake and I shall speak to Father Dolan myself. Will that do now?\n\nStephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmured:\n\n\u2014O yes sir, thanks.\n\nThe rector held his hand across the side of the desk where the skull was and Stephen, placing his hand in it for a moment, felt a cool moist palm.\n\n\u2014Good day now, said the rector, withdrawing his hand and bowing.\n\n\u2014Good day, sir, said Stephen.\n\nHe bowed and walked quietly out of the room, closing the doors carefully and slowly.\n\nBut when he had passed the old servant on the landing and was again in the low narrow dark corridor he began to walk faster and faster. Faster and faster he hurried on through the gloom excitedly. He bumped his elbow against the door at the end and, hurrying down the staircase, walked quickly through the two corridors and out into the air.\n\nHe could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds. He broke into a run and, running quicker and quicker, ran across the cinderpath and reached the third line playground, panting.\n\nThe fellows had seen him running. They closed round him in a ring, pushing one against another to hear.\n\n\u2014Tell us! Tell us!\n\n\u2014What did he say?\n\n\u2014Did you go in?\n\n\u2014What did he say?\n\n\u2014Tell us! Tell us!\n\nHe told them what he had said and what the rector had said and, when he had told them, all the fellows flung their caps spinning up into the air and cried:\n\n\u2014Hurroo!\n\nThey caught their caps and sent them up again spinning sky-high and cried again:\n\n\u2014Hurroo! Hurroo!\n\nThey made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him up among them and carried him along till he struggled to get free. And when he had escaped from them they broke away in all directions, flinging their caps again into the air and whistling as they went spinning up and crying:\n\n\u2014Hurroo!\n\nAnd they gave three groans for Baldyhead Dolan and three cheers for Conmee and they said he was the decentest rector that was ever in Clongowes.\n\nThe cheers died away in the soft grey air. He was alone. He was happy and free; but he would not be anyway proud with Father Dolan. He would be very quiet and obedient: and he wished that he could do something kind for him to show him that he was not proud.\n\nThe air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming. There was the smell of evening in the air, the smell of the fields in the country where they digged up turnips to peel them and eat them when they went out for a walk to Major Barton's, the smell there was in the little wood beyond the pavilion where the gallnuts were.\n\nThe fellows were practising long shies and bowling lobs and slow twisters. In the soft grey silence he could hear the bump of the balls: and from here and from there through the quiet air the sound of the cricket bats: pick, pack, pock, puck: like drops of water in a fountain falling softly in the brimming bowl.17Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/948941", "artist_names": "Susan Christie", "full_title": "I Love Onions by\u00a0Susan\u00a0Christie", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "id": 948941, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429545271, "path": "/Susan-christie-i-love-onions-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Susan-christie-i-love-onions-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "song_art_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 8138}, "title": "I Love Onions", "title_with_featured": "I Love Onions", "updated_by_human_at": 1434118223, "url": "https://genius.com/Susan-christie-i-love-onions-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/371214", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669754445", "id": 371214, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669754445", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Susan Christie", "slug": "Susan-christie", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Susan-christie"}, "artist": "Susan Christie", "lyrics": "I Love Onions LyricsI don't like snails, or toads, or frogs\nOr strange things living under logs\nBut, mmm, I love onions\nI don't like dancin' with crazy Ted\nHe's always jumpin' on my head\nBut, mmm, I love onions\n\nOnions, onions, la la la.

cry\nSounds like a real bad case\nOf a girl who needs a guy\nI think I know the perfect jewel\nOne you ought to try\nTake a heart that's full of love\nOn this you can rely\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine\nAnd if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine\nAnd if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine\nI think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine\n[Verse 2]\nI may not be a doctor who can cure your ills\nGoodbye to all those different drugs and hard-swallowed pills\nMy remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill\nMy prescription is the kind you love to have refilled\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nOh, medicine won't cure you\nJust leave you at the most\nThe relief is only temporary\nPretty soon will go\nBut love can last a lifetime\nWhen two hearts are close\nTake as much as you want to\nThere is no overdoseYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1229574",

change my luck\nWith a chick named Nellie Bly\nI was Frankie's man but I was doing her wrong\n[Verse 3]\nYeah! Frankie came looking to find me\nYes, she wasn't looking for fun\nFor in her sweet loving hand\nShe was toting' a .44 gun\nTo shoot her man if he was doing' her wrong\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell Frankie looked into the bar room\nAnd right there in front of her eyes\nThere was her loving Johnny\nMaking love to that Nellie Bly\nI was her man, she caught me doing her wrong\n\n[Verse 5]\nFrankie, I beg, please don't shoot me\nWell they'll put you away in a cell\nYou know they'll put you where the cold wind blows\nFrom the hottest corner of hell\nI'm your man, I know I done you wrong\n\n[Verse 6]\nEasy roll me over, real easy\nEasy roll me over, real slow\nRoll me over real gently\nCause my wound hurts me so\nWell I was her man\nWell I done her wrong\nYou might also like[Verse 7]\nWell Frankie told

hot page\nI got five different beats, kill 'em five different ways\nMan, these kids make me laugh when they say they spit flames\nIt's a shame\n'Cause you ain't got what I got, bruh\nI am on top of all of these rappers\nThey are not tough\nEverybody thinks that they hot stuff\nLet me be the first one to tell you: you are not, cuz\nHuh!\nEverybody wanna spit the way that I do\nTreat a childish rapper like he Caillou\nI could write eleven fucking novels and a haiku\nIn the same time you'd take to write a single line, dude\nIt would take 21 savages to drop me\nAnd a whole boatful of Lil Yachtys\nAnd if you think that any garbage rapper in this game tops me\nYou been smoking too much broccoli (huh!)\nI've been really going hard: call me Tungsten\nRaising up the bar on you munchkins\nYeah, you be pulling up in cars at the function\nBut I been spitting bars at the function\nI'm a wizard on the mic: call me Dumbledore or Voldemort\nTatted all over like Baltimore rappercore\nHunting down these rappers like the kid was born on Mandalore\nI'm treating competition like Michael Vick with a Labrador\n[Verse 2]\nBut I could change it up like a switch hitter\nStomach full of mixed liquor, still I spit sicker than these other MCs\nYou ain't fucking with me, like a nun that you met on Tinder\nI'm Master Splinter, but rip a mic like Shredder\nI'm better than these rats only in it for the cheddar\nI'm a veteran\nY'all a bunch of squares like Tiananmen\nI'm eating young bucks like venison\nI'm clever when-\n-ever I spit with sharp, devilish wit\nMy bars are heaven-sent\nYou are essentially shit\nI flush 'em down, then I spray Febreze\nY'all best stay away from me\nI slay with these, I play for keeps\nI'm basically a raging beast\nServe rappers like a ma\u00eetre'd\nCall me DJ Khaled, got the major keys\nI'm top-shelf like grade-A beef\nY'all are softer than a mattress made of Tempur-Pedic foam\nEither step up to my throne, or leave me the hell alone\nI'm in my zone like Kanye, sipping on Bombay\nThey taking shots at me like Harambe\nI'm finna blow like Pompeii, so stay out of my way\n'Cause I'm a verbal giant like Andre\nI'm hotter than the sun's rays in the summer\nI was Lon Chaney's plumber\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nYou ain't fucking with the boy like a mean ex\nI spit sick: get the microphone a Kleenex\nI'mma be next\nFuck it, I'mma be best\nI bully rappers like the mean kid at recess\nYeah, I run the game like a PC\nAll of these rappers are cheesy\nAnd if you're on Twitter and see me, it'd be really sweet to hit me with the retweet\nWhoa, killing the flow\nColder than sticking your dick in six inches of snow\nI'm sicker than syphilis when I be spitting these writtens\nI'm slick with the syllables, bro\nWelcome to class: here's the syllabus, ho\nI'm giving the lesson, call me the Professor\nAct up and you get a detention\nI guess I should mention: I'm also the principal, ho!\nDo you like when I run it like

Now it's time for another fanschmabulous episode of... Itchy and Scratchy!\n\nThe episode is titled \"Why Do Fools Fall In Lava?\" Itchy makes Scratchy bungee jump into a volcano using his intestine. Scratchy dangles just above the lava, and Itchy pours gasoline into him until Scratchy goes up in flames. The Simpsons TV is turned on, displaying this episode, but with no one watching. Marge walks through the living room and notices.\n\nMARGE\nKids? Kids? (She finds her children eating cereal in the kitchen.) You're missing the Itchy & Scratchy Show. Don't you like it anymore?\nLISA\n(reading the back of a cereal box) Sure, we love it. But how can we watch TV when it's so beautiful out? (pointing out the window)\n\nBART\nWell, yeah, Mom. I mean, we love you and Dad too, but God knows we don't need to see you every day.\n\nMARGE\nAn occasional hug is all I ask. (hugs him)\n\nBART\nMom! You can hug me when I'm asleep.\n\nMARGE\nI do!\n\nBART\nAhhh!\n\nAt Krustylu studios, Roger Meyers Jr. comes to Krusty's office.\n\nMEYERS\nHey, Krusty, you look great. You get your teeth bleached?\n\nKRUSTY\nYeah, it's a new kind of polymer treatment... Hey, shut up! You're here 'cause your Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are stinking up my ratings. Look at this breakdown of yesterday's show. (He shows Meyers the ratings graph, with a huge dip in) Eh, eh, eh, KABOOM!\nMEYERS\nWhat happened here? Lightning hit the transmitter?\n\nKRUSTY\nSee, that's what I thought at first, but then... Hey, shut up! That crater is where you lousy cartoon crash landed. It's ratings poison.\n\nMEYERS\nBut Itchy & Scratchy is critically acclaimed!\n\nKRUSTY\nAcclaimed!? (spits) I oughta replace it right now with that Chinese cartoon where the robots that turn into... blingwads! (sits down in his chair) But I'm a lazy, lazy man, Roger. So I'll give you one more chance. Get out! Don't come back 'til you fixed \"Itchy & Scratchy\"!\n\nMeyers walks out, slamming Krusty's office door so hard that it comes of the hinges and falls to the floor. Sideshow Mel can be seen outside.\n\nSECRETARY\n(off screen) Okay Mel, you can go in now.\n\nSideshow Mel enters, holding a tin can.\n\nSIDESHOW MEL\nKrusty, I've come to solicit donations for the Rock 'N Roll museum, and... (Krusty stares at him) Uh... I'll come back later.\n\nAt Springfield Mall, Marge is shopping with the kids.\n\nMARGE\nI need to purchase a brassiere. You kids wait over here in the credit department.\nBART\nOh, can't we just wander around and meet you back here later?\n\nMARGE\nMmm...okay, just be careful.\n\nBart and Lisa run off. They run into a creepy-looking guy.\n\nMAN\nWould you kids like to come with me?\n\nBART\n(simultaneously with Lisa) Sounds good to me! Let's go!\n\nLISA\n(simultaneously with Bart) Okay! Guess so.\n\nBart & Lisa participate in a focus group, along with several other kids including Milhouse, Nelson and Ralph.\n\nMAN\nAlright, thanks for participating in our focus group, kids. Today, we're going to show you some Itchy & Scratchy cartoons.\n\nThe kids cheer in delight.\n\nNELSON\nCool!\n\nMAN\nWe want you to tell us what you think. And, be honest, because no one from the show is here spying on you. (chuckles)\n\nA sneezing sound comes from a large mirror on the wall.\n\nLISA\nWhy is that mirror sneezing?\n\nMAN\nAh, look, it's just an old, creaky mirror, y'know, sometimes it sounds a little like it's sneezing, or coughing, or talking softly.\n\nLISA\nHmm...\n\nThe man gives a thumbs-up to the mirror.\n\nMAN\nNow, you each have a knob in front of you. When you like what you see, turn the knob to the right. When you don't like what you see, turn it left.\n\nRALPH\n(with knob in mouth) My knob tastes funny.\n\nMAN\nPlease refrain from tasting the knob.\n\nFirst up, Itchy & Scratchy play pool. Itchy knocks out Scratchy's eyeballs with a cue ball and Scratchy replaces them with two pool balls. The kids laugh turn their knobs to the right. The next cartoon is set on an island. While Itchy & Scratchy sunbathe, a muscle-bound man in bikini trunks flexes in front of the camera. Nelson turns Milhouse's knob repeatedly to the right.\n\nMILHOUSE\nHey, quit it!\n\nFrom behind the mirror, Meyers and two other people watch on a monitor.\n\nMEYERS\nThey like Itchy, they like Scratchy, one kid seems to love the Speedo man... what more do they want?\n\nBack with the focus group.\n\nMAN\nOkay, how many of you kids would like Itchy & Scratchy to deal with real-life problems, like the ones you face every day? (the kids all cheer and agree) And who would like to see them do just the opposite - getting into far-out situations involving robots and magic powers? (more cheering) So, you want a realistic, down-to-earth show... that's completely off-the-wall and swarming with magic robots? (The kids agree)\n\nNELSON\nYeah, good.\n\nMILHOUSE\nAnd also, you should win things by watching!\n\nThe man sighs. The light is turned on in the observation booth, and Meyers appears at the mirror.\n\nMEYERS\nYou kids don't know what you want! That's why you're still kids: 'cause you're stupid! Just tell me what's wrong with the freakin' show!\n\nHe turns the lights out. Ralph starts crying and turns his knob to the left.\n\nRALPH\nMommy!\n\nLISA\n(talking to the mirror) Um, excuse me sir. The thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the Itchy & Scratchy show, it's as good as ever. But after so many years, the characters just can't have the same impact they once had.\n\nMeyers turns the light back on.\n\nMEYERS\nThat's it. That's it, little girl! You've saved Itchy & Scratchy!\n\nA lawyer enters the room, holding papers.\n\nLAWYER\nPlease sign these papers indicating that you did not save Itchy & Scratchy.\n\nAt Itchy & Scratchy, Intl., Meyers has called a meeting of the writers (who look strikingly similar to the real Simpsons writers) along with Krusty and a female network executive.\n\nMEYERS\nI have figured out how to rejuvenate the show. It's so simple, you egghead writers would've never thought of it! What we need is... a new character! One that today's kids can relate to!\n\nThe writers look at each other, uncertain.\n\nOAKLEY\nAre you absolutely sure that's wise, sir? I mean, I don't want to sound pretentious here, but Itchy and Scratchy comprise a dramaturgical dyad.\n\nKRUSTY\nHey, this ain't art, it's business! (to Meyers) Whaddya got in mind? Sexy broad? Gangster octopus?\n\nMEYERS\nNo, no. The animal chain of command goes mouse, cat, dog. (to the writers) D-O-G.\n\nWEINSTEIN\nUh, a dog? Isn't that a tad predictable?\n\nEXECUTIVE\nIn your dreams. We're talking the original dog from hell.\n\nOAKLEY\nYou mean Cerberus?\nEXECUTIVE\n(pause) We at the network want a dog with attitude. He's edgy, he's \"in your face.\" You've heard the expression \"let's get busy\"? Well, this is a dog who gets \"biz-zay!\" Consistently and thoroughly.\n\nKRUSTY\nSo he's proactive, huh?\n\nEXECUTIVE\nOh, God, yes. We're talking about a totally outrageous paradigm.\n\nMEYER\nExcuse me, but \"proactive\" and \"paradigm\"? Aren't these just buzzwords that dumb people use to sound important? Not that I'm accusing you of anything like that. I'm fired, aren't I?\n\nMEYERS\nOh, yes.\n\nMEYERS\nThe rest of you writers start thinking up a name for this funky dog; I dunno, something along the line of say... Poochie, only more proactive.\n\nKRUSTY\nYeah!\n\nMeyers, Krusty and the network executive leave.\n\nOAKLEY\nSo, Poochie okay with everybody?\n\nWRITERS\nYeah...\n\nAn animator, who looks like David Silverman, draws a sketch of a dog.\n\nMEYERS\nNo, no, no! He was supposed to have attitude.\n\nSILVERMAN\nUm... wh-what do you mean, exactly?\n\nMEYERS\nOh, you know, attitude, attitude! Uh... sunglasses!\n\nEXECUTIVE\nCan we put him in more of a \"hip-hop\" context?\n\nKRUSTY\nForget context, he's gotta be a surfer. Give me a nice shmear of surfer.\n\nEXECUTIVE\nI feel we should rastafy him by ... ten percent or so.\n\nSilverman redraws Poochie. They're still not totally satisfied.\n\nMEYERS\nHmm... I think he needs a little more attitude.\n\nSilverman blackens in Poochie's sunglasses.\n\nEXECUTIVE\nOh yeah, bingo. There it is, right there!\n\nKRUSTY\nYeah, that's it!\n\nMEYERS\nI love it!\n\nThe next morning, The Simpsons eat breakfast. Bart notices the headline in the newspaper Homer is reading: \"Funny Dog To Make Life Worthwhile\".\n\nBART\nHey, Lis, look! They're adding a new character to Itchy & Scratchy! Poochie the dog?!\n\nLISA\nAdding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings.\n\nA guy enters the kitchen.\n\nROY\nYo, yo! How's it hangin' everybody?\n\nMARGE\nMorning, Roy!\n\nHOMER\nYeah, hi, Roy. Hey, there having open casting for the voice of Poochie.\n\nLISA\nYou should try out, Dad. You have a funny voice.\n\nHOMER\nI do not!\n\nBART\nHaven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?\n\nHOMER\nI prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.\n\nBART\n(holding up a tape recorder) Well, here. Say something.\n\nHOMER\nHey, this is Homer Simpson saying howdy to all the girls out there in radio land. (Bart plays back the tape) Ah! I don't sound like that, do I? Oh... I don't like having such a hilarious voice.\n\nBART\nThat hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom.\n\nAt the auditions. First up is Otto.\n\nOTTO\n(reading script) Whoa! A talking dog! What were you guys smokin' when you came up with that?\n\nCOHEN\nWe were eating rotisserie chicken. Can you just read the line, please?\n\nOTTO\nRuff, ruff. I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog!\n\nMEYERS\nYou're perfect! In fact, you're better than perfect! Next to you, perfection is crap!\n\nTroy McClure is up next.\n\nMCCLURE\nRuff, ruff! I'm Poochie, the rocking dog! Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such cartoons as \"Christmas Ape\" and \"Christmas Ape Goes to Summer Camp\".\n\nMEYERS\nYou're even better than this guy! (to Otto) Take a hike, you bum.\n\nOtto moans and walks off. Next it's Homer.\n\nHOMER\n(clears throat) Ruff, ruff! I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog!\n\nMEYERS\nNow, that's just bad. You've got no attitude, you're barely outrageous, and I don't know what you're in, but it's not my face. Next!\n\nHOMER\n(angrily) Oh, no attitude, eh? Not in your face, huh? Well, you can cram it with walnuts, ugly!\n\nMEYERS\nThat's it! That's the Poochie attitude, do that again!\n\nHOMER\n(sheepishly) Huh? I can't, I don't remember what I did.\n\nMEYERS\nThen you don't get the job. Next!\n\nHOMER\n(sarcastically) Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well boo-hoo! I don't get to be a cartoon dog!\n\nMEYERS\nThat's it, you've got the job!\n\nHOMER\nOh, now I've got the job, huh? (realizing) Oh, thank you.\n\n\nACT TWO\n\nHomer attends the recording session at Itchy & Scratchy studios.\n\nSOUND GUY\nOkay, Homer. Let's get a level check on your voice.\n\nHOMER\nShe smells sheep smells by the sheet shtore. Wait, wait. Let me try it again.\n\nBELLAMY\nRelax Homer, you'll do fine. I'm June Bellamy. I do the voices of Itchy and Scratchy.\n\nHOMER\nYou? But you're a lady!\n\nBELLAMY\n(Itchy voice) She's a lady alright. (Scratchy voice) A beauuuuuutiful lady.\n\nHOMER\n(laughing) Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so good?\n\nBELLAMY\nOh, just experience I suppose. I started out as Roadrunner. (Roadrunner voice) Meep!\n\nHOMER\nYou mean \"meep-meep\"?\n\nBELLAMY\nNo, they only paid me to say it once, then they doubled it up on the soundtrack. Cheap bastards.\n\nMEYERS\n(handing them scripts) You folks ready to begin?\n\nHOMER\nUh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live?\n\nBELLAMY\nNo, Homer. Very few cartoons are broadcast live, it's a terrible strain on the animators' wrists.\n\nPoochie hype grips Springfield. Homer and June make an appearance at The Android's Dungeon, which is full of nerds (including Doug, Benjamin and Gary from Homer Goes To College).\n\nDOUG\nHi. Question for Ms. Bellamy. In episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib twice in succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to believe, that this is some sort of a... (sniggering) magic xylophone or something? Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.\n\nBELLAMY\nUh, well, uh...\n\nHOMER\nI'll field that one. Let me ask you a question. Why would a man whose shirt says \"Genius at Work\" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?\n\nDOUG\n(embarrassed) I withdraw my question. (eats a chocolate bar)\n\nDATABASE\nAh, excuse me Mr. Simpson. On the Itchy & Scratchy CD-ROM, is there a way to get out of the dungeon without using the wizard key?\n\nHOMER\nWhat the hell are you talking about?\n\nBELLAMY\nYou're a lifesaver, Homer, I can't deal with these hardcore fans!\n\nCOMIC BOOK GUY\nYour attention, please.\n\nFAN\nUh, in episode...\n\nCOMIC BOOK GUY\nYour attention, please! Mr. Simpson will now be autographing eight-by-ten glossies of Poochie, ONE per customer. Please form a line. There will be no cutting. I'm talking to you, Mr. Cutter.\n\nA few minutes later, CBG cuts through the crowd.\n\nCOMIC BOOK GUY\nPardon me, look out, pardon me, excuse me, hot soup... Hi. (puts down glossies) Kindly make one out to me, and three out to my friend of the same name.\n\nThe first episode with Poochie is about to air. The Simpsons' friends and family gather in their living room.\n\nMARGE\nI'm so glad you could join us for Homer's big premiere.\n\nBARNEY\n(in the background) You know, Poochie's based on me...\n\nJASPER\n(sitting down) Is this seat taken, little girl?\n\nBART\nI'm not a girl! Are you blind?\n\nJASPER\nYes.\n\nROY\nI am stoked, Mr. S.\n\nMARGE\nShh! Everybody it's coming on!\n\nKrusty appears on-screen, lit by a dim spotlight. Slides appear behind him.\n\nKRUSTY\nOnce in a great while, we are privileged to experience a television event so extraordinary, it becomes part of our shared heritage. (slide of an astronaut on the moon) 1969 - Man walks on the moon. (slide of astronaut playing golf on the moon) 1971 - Man walks on the moon... again. (no slide) Then, for a long time, nothing happened. Until tonight. Behold the future of Comedy: Poochie!!\n\nThe audience cheer and the cartoon starts, with altered theme music. Poochie's voice:\n\nTHEME\n(high voice) They fight, and bite... (low voice) and bark. (high voice) They fight they fight and bite... (low voice) and bark. (high voice) Fight fight fight (low voice) Woof woof woof. (high voice) The Itchy and Scratchy... and Poochie show!\n\nThe episode is titled \"The Beagle Has Landed.\" Itchy & Scratchy are driving together. They pass signs reading \"Fireworks Factory 2 Miles\", \"Fireworks Factory 1 Mile\", then \"Fireworks Factory \u00bd Mile\". They then spot Poochie at the side of the road.\n\nITCHY\nLook, Scratchy, it's our new friend, Poochie.\n\nSCRATCHY\nWhat's that name again? I forgot.\n\nPOOCHIE\n(rapping) The name's Poochie D, And I rock the telly, I'm half Joe Camel, And a third Fonzarelli. I'm the kung fu hippie, From gangsta city, I'm a rappin' surfer, You the fool I pity.\n\nSCRATCHY\nOoh, Poochie is one outrageous dude.\n\nITCHY\nHe's totally in my face.\n\nPOOCHIE\n(playing guitar) Wiggity wiggity, Word up? Rock on party!\n\nMILHOUSE\nWhen are they going to get to the fireworks factory? (crying)\n\nMOE\nCan somebody tell me what the hell is going on? Midge, help me out here.\n\nHOMER\nQuiet! You're missing the jokes!\n\nPoochie dribbles a basketball while riding a bike, slam dunks it and lands in Itchy & Scratchy's car.\n\nPOOCHIE\nCatch you on the flip side, dudemeisters. (holds out hand for high five, Scratchy extends his arm and Poochie withdraws his) Not!! (Homer's normal voice) Hey kids, always recycle... (as Poochie) to the extreme!! Bust it!\n\nPoochie drives off in Itchy & Scratchy's car. An awkward silence follows in The Simpsons' living room.\n\nNELSON\nAh, that stunk!\n\nHOMER\nSo, what did everybody think?\n\nNobody answers and they start leaving.\n\nNED\nHomer, I can honestly say that was the best episode of Impy & Chimpy I've ever seen!\n\nCARL\nYeah, you should be very proud, Homer, you, uh... got a beautiful home here.\n\nNelson punches Bart on his way out.\n\nHOMER\nSo, it was pretty okay, huh?\n\nBART\nMom, can we go to bed without dinner?\n\nMARGE\nYes we can. (They rush upstairs)\n\nHOMER\nWell, at least I liked it. Didn't I? (pan up to brain)\n\nBRAIN\nOh, you don't want to know what I really think. Now look sad and say \"D'oh\".\n\nHOMER\nD'oh...\n\n\nACT THREE\n\nThe next morning at breakfast.\n\nHOMER\nI'm the worst Poochie ever.\n\nLISA\nAh, it's not your fault, dad. You did fine. It's just that Poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking. You can't be cool just by spouting off a bunch of worn-out buzzwords.\n\nBART\nDon't have a cow, Lis.\n\nMARGE\nBart's right. Let's none of us have a cow. All that matters is that the fans of the show liked it.\n\nIn the Android's Dungeon...\n\nCOMIC BOOK GUY\nLast night's Itchy & Scratchy was, without a doubt, the worst episode ever! Rest assured that I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.\n\nBART\nHey, I know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain?\n\nCOMIC BOOK GUY\nAs a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me.\n\nBART\nWhat? They're giving you thousands of hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? I mean, If anything, you owe them.\n\nCOMIC BOOK GUY\n(pause) Worst episode ever.\n\nKent Brockman delivers the news.\n\nKENT BROCKMAN\nIt looks like the end of the venerable Itchy and Scratchy program. For years, TV critics, such as yours truly, Kent Brockman, have waited impatiently for cracks to appear in the show's hilarious facade. Yesterday, our prays were finally answered when Poochie the Dog made his howlingly unfunny debut. Far be it from me to gloat at another's downfall, but I have a feeling that no children are gonna be crying when this puppy is put to sleep.\n\nKrusty and the writers are watching the report.\n\nKRUSTY\nWhat the hell happened?!\n\nEXECUTIVE\nWell, I'd attribute the product failure to fundamental shifts in our key demographic, coupled with the overall crumminess of Poochie.\n\nKRUSTY\n(crying hysterically) You've got to stop this thing. Please, I'm getting egged on the street. Do something! Do something!!\n\nHomer enters.\n\nHOMER\nUh, hi, Mr. Meyers. I've been doing some thinking, and I've got some ideas to improve the show. I got it right here. (pulls out a piece of paper) One, Poochie needs to be louder, angrier, and have access to a time machine. Two, whenever Poochie's not onscreen, all the other characters should be asking \"Where's Poochie\"? Three--\n\nMEYERS\nGreat, great. Just leave them right there on the floor on your way out.\n\nHomer does so, but realizes something's wrong. He eavesdrops on the meeting from a closet next door.\n\nMEYERS\nListen guys, we've got to do something about Poochie.\n\nKRUSTY\nThere's only one thing we can do.\n\nHomer hears something and is shocked. At dinner, Homer tells his family what he heard.\n\nHOMER\nThen they said they were going to kill Poochie off!\n\nBART\n(joyful) Really?! (realizing) Oh, how terrible.\n\nLISA\n(trance-like) Yes. Terrible.\n\nMARGE\nIt's not your fault, Homer. It's those lousy writers. They make me madder than a... um... yak in heat!\n\nHOMER\nYou're right Marge. it's not my fault. I won't let them treat Poochie like dirt anymore just because he's the new guy.\n\nROY\nRight on, Mr. S!\n\nHOMER\nPut a sock in it, Roy.\n\nAt the recording studio.\n\nMEYERS\nOkay. So here is where Itchy lunges at Poochie with a rusty chainsaw. Cue sound effects. (Sound guy makes chainsaw sound) Rustier! (rustier chainsaw sound)\n\nBELLAMY\n(as Itchy) Are you prepared to die, Poochie?\n\nHOMER\nNo, I am not.\n\nMEYERS\nOh, cut, cut, cut, cut! You'll stick to the script as its written, Homer. You're supposed to say \"Please, cut off my head. I don't deserve to live.\"\n\nHOMER\nNever! (He tears the script in half,the writers gasp) You can't just kill of a classic TV character. Poochie could be bigger than curly fries. But first he has to win back the audience. That's why I'm going to read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands.\n\nMEYERS\nForget it Homer.

Action.\n\nBELLAMY\n(as Itchy) Hi, Poochie. You look like you've got something to say. Do you?\n\nHOMER\n(as Poochie) Yes, I certainly do! (normal voice) Hello there, Itchy. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away. I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog that nobody wanted, I know we can make them laugh and cry until we grow old together.\n\nMEYERS\n(impressed) ...and cut!\n\nJune claps. Then slowly everyone else begins to clap.\n\nBack at home, the new episode is about to air.\n\nHOMER\nNow kids, I know you loved the old Poochie, but the new one is going to be better than ten Super Bowls! I don't want to oversell it, judge for yourself.\n\nAt an ice sculpture contest, Itchy begins cutting into Scratchy with a chainsaw. Suddenly, Poochie wanders by.\n\nSCRATCHY\nHey, looks who's here.\n\nITCHY\nHi, Poochie. You look like you've got something to say. Do you?\n\nPOOCHIE\nYes, I certainly do! (Poochie's mouth stops moving and Meyers' voice is heard) I have to go now. My planet needs me.\n\nThe whole cel with Poochie on it is moved upwards. A screen shows some handwritten text: \"Note: Poochie died on the way back to his home planet\".\n\nBART\nWow, Poochie came from another planet?\n\nLISA\nUh, I guess...\n\nHOMER\nHey that wasn't supposed to happen. Those finks double-crossed me.\n\nKRUSTY\nPoochie's dead! (laughs) (kids in audience cheer) Well kids, we all know that sometimes when cartoon characters die, they're back again the very next week. That's why I'm presenting this sworn affidavit that Poochie will never, ever, ever return!\n\nLAWYER\nThis document conforms to all applicable laws and statutes.\n\nBART & LISA\nYeah! ...oh.\n\nBART\nTough break, Dad. I guess people just weren't ready for Poochie. Maybe in a few years.\n\nROY\nGood news, everybody. I'm moving into my own apartment with two sexy ladies.\n\nMARGE\nOh, then I guess this is goodbye, Roy. Maybe we'll see you in a few years. (she kisses him, and he leaves)\n\nHOMER\nWell, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing is, I lost creative control of the project. And I forgot to ask for any money. Well, live learn.\n\nLater, Bart & Lisa watch an Itchy & Scratchy episode, back in its original form. Itchy & Scratchy are doing a William Tell act. Itchy shoots a bow and arrow at Scratchy, and it hits the apple on Scratchy's head. He is relieved, but then realizes that the arrow pierced a tank of Carbolic Acid, which leaks out and dissolves Scratchy's flesh. Bart & Lisa laugh.\n\nBART\nIt's back to the basics, classic \"Itchy & Scratchy.\"\n\nLISA\nWe should thank our lucky stars that they're still putting on a program of this caliber after so many years.\n\nThey both stare blankly for a few seconds.\n\nBART\nWhat else is on?\n\nLisa changes the channel, screen goes to static and the credits roll.8Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count":

Bront\u00eb", "lyrics": "Shirley (Chap. 1) LyricsLevitical\n\nOf late years an abundant shower of curates has fallen upon the north of England: they lie very thick on the hills; every parish has one or more of them; they are young enough to be very active, and ought to be doing a great deal of good. But not of late years are we about to speak; we are going back to the beginning of this century: late years\u2014present years are dusty, sunburnt, hot, arid; we will evade the noon, forget it in siesta, pass the midday in slumber, and dream of dawn.\n\nIf you think, from this prelude, that anything like a romance is preparing for you, reader, you never were more mistaken. Do you anticipate sentiment, and poetry, and reverie? Do you expect passion, and stimulus, and melodrama? Calm your expectations; reduce them to a lowly standard. Something real, cool, and solid lies before you; something unromantic as Monday morning, when all who have work wake with the consciousness that they must rise and betake themselves thereto. It is not positively affirmed that you shall not have a taste of the exciting, perhaps towards the middle and close of the meal, but it is resolved that the first dish set upon the table shall be one that a Catholic\u2014ay, even an Anglo-Catholic\u2014might eat on Good Friday in Passion Week: it shall be cold lentils and vinegar without oil; it shall be unleavened bread with bitter herbs, and no roast lamb.\n\nOf late years, I say, an abundant shower of curates has fallen upon the north of England; but in eighteen-hundred-eleven-twelve that affluent rain had not descended. Curates were scarce then: there was no Pastoral Aid\u2014no Additional Curates' Society to stretch a helping hand to worn-out old rectors and incumbents, and give them the wherewithal to pay a vigorous young colleague from Oxford or Cambridge. The present successors of the apostles, disciples of Dr. Pusey and tools of the Propaganda, were at that time being hatched under cradle-blankets, or undergoing regeneration by nursery-baptism in wash-hand basins. You could not have guessed by looking at any one of them that the Italian-ironed double frills of its net-cap surrounded the brows of a preordained, specially-sanctified successor of St. Paul, St. Peter, or St. John; nor could you have foreseen in the folds of its long night-gown the white surplice in which it was hereafter cruelly to exercise the souls of its parishioners, and strangely to nonplus its old-fashioned vicar by flourishing aloft in a pulpit the shirt-like raiment which had never before waved higher than the reading-desk.\n\nYet even in those days of scarcity there were curates: the precious plant was rare, but it might be found. A certain favoured district in the West Riding of Yorkshire could boast three rods of Aaron blossoming within a circuit of twenty miles. You shall see them, reader. Step into this neat garden-house on the skirts of Whinbury, walk forward into the little parlour. There they are at dinner. Allow me to introduce them to you: Mr. Donne, curate of Whinbury; Mr. Malone, curate of Briarfield; Mr. Sweeting, curate of Nunnely. These are Mr. Donne's lodgings, being the habitation of one John Gale, a small clothier. Mr. Donne has kindly invited his brethren to regale with him. You and I will join the party, see what is to be seen, and hear what is to be heard. At present, however, they are only eating; and while they eat we will talk aside.\n\nThese gentlemen are in the bloom of youth; they possess all the activity of that interesting age\u2014an activity which their moping old vicars would fain turn into the channel of their pastoral duties, often expressing a wish to see it expended in a diligent superintendence of the schools, and in frequent visits to the sick of their respective parishes. But the youthful Levites feel this to be dull work; they prefer lavishing their energies on a course of proceeding which, though to other eyes it appear more heavy with ennui, more cursed with monotony, than the toil of the weaver at his loom, seems to yield them an unfailing supply of enjoyment and occupation.\nI allude to a rushing backwards and forwards, amongst themselves, to and from their respective lodgings\u2014not a round, but a triangle of visits, which they keep up all the year through, in winter, spring, summer, and autumn. Season and weather make no difference; with unintelligible zeal they dare snow and hail, wind and rain, mire and dust, to go and dine, or drink tea, or sup with each other. What attracts them it would be difficult to say. It is not friendship, for whenever they meet they quarrel. It is not religion\u2014the thing is never named amongst them; theology they may discuss occasionally, but piety\u2014never. It is not the love of eating and drinking: each might have as good a joint and pudding, tea as potent, and toast as succulent, at his own lodgings, as is served to him at his brother's. Mrs. Gale, Mrs. Hogg, and Mrs. Whipp\u2014their respective landladies\u2014affirm that \"it is just for naught else but to give folk trouble.\" By \"folk\" the good ladies of course mean themselves, for indeed they are kept in a continual \"fry\" by this system of mutual invasion.\n\nMr. Donne and his guests, as I have said, are at dinner; Mrs. Gale waits on them, but a spark of the hot kitchen fire is in her eye. She considers that the privilege of inviting a friend to a meal occasionally, without additional charge (a privilege included in the terms on which she lets her lodgings), has been quite sufficiently exercised of late. The present week is yet but at Thursday, and on Monday Mr. Malone, the curate of Briarfield, came to breakfast and stayed dinner; on Tuesday Mr. Malone and Mr. Sweeting of Nunnely came to tea, remained to supper, occupied the spare bed, and favoured her with their company to breakfast on Wednesday morning; now, on Thursday, they are both here at dinner, and she is almost certain they will stay all night. \"C'en est trop,\" she would say, if she could speak French.\n\nMr. Sweeting is mincing the slice of roast beef on his plate, and complaining that it is very tough; Mr. Donne says the beer is flat. Ay, that is the worst of it: if they would only be civil Mrs. Gale wouldn't mind it so much, if they would only seem satisfied with what they get she wouldn't care; but \"these young parsons is so high and so scornful, they set everybody beneath their 'fit.' They treat her with less than civility, just because she doesn't keep a servant, but does the work of the house herself, as her mother did afore her; then they are always speaking against Yorkshire ways and Yorkshire folk,\" and by that very token Mrs. Gale does not believe one of them to be a real gentleman, or come of gentle kin. \"The old parsons is worth the whole lump of college lads; they know what belongs to good manners, and is kind to high and low.\"\n\n\"More bread!\" cries Mr. Malone, in a tone which, though prolonged but to utter two syllables, proclaims him at once a native of the land of shamrocks and potatoes. Mrs. Gale hates Mr. Malone more than either of the other two; but she fears him also, for he is a tall, strongly-built personage, with real Irish legs and arms, and a face as genuinely national\u2014not the Milesian face, not Daniel O'Connell's style, but the high-featured, North-American-Indian sort of visage, which belongs to a certain class of the Irish gentry, and has a petrified and proud look, better suited to the owner of an estate of slaves than to the landlord of a free peasantry. Mr. Malone's father termed himself a gentleman: he was poor and in debt, and besottedly arrogant; and his son was like him.\n\nMrs. Gale offered the loaf.\n\n\"Cut it, woman,\" said her guest; and the \"woman\" cut it accordingly. Had she followed her inclinations, she would have cut the parson also; her Yorkshire soul revolted absolutely from his manner of command.\n\nThe curates had good appetites, and though the beef was \"tough,\" they ate a great deal of it. They swallowed, too, a tolerable allowance of the \"flat beer,\" while a dish of Yorkshire pudding, and two tureens of vegetables, disappeared like leaves before locusts. The cheese, too, received distinguished marks of their attention; and a \"spice-cake,\" which followed by way of dessert, vanished like a vision, and was no more found. Its elegy was chanted in the kitchen by Abraham, Mrs. Gale's son and heir, a youth of six summers; he had reckoned upon the reversion thereof, and when his mother brought down the empty platter, he lifted up his voice and wept sore.\n\nThe curates, meantime, sat and sipped their wine, a liquor of unpretending vintage, moderately enjoyed. Mr. Malone, indeed, would much rather have had whisky; but Mr. Donne, being an Englishman, did not keep the beverage. While they sipped they argued, not on politics, nor on philosophy, nor on literature\u2014these topics were now, as ever, totally without interest for them\u2014not even on theology, practical or doctrinal, but on minute points of ecclesiastical discipline, frivolities which seemed empty as bubbles to all save themselves. Mr. Malone, who contrived to secure two glasses of wine, when his brethren contented themselves with one, waxed by degrees hilarious after his fashion; that is, he grew a little insolent, said rude things in a hectoring tone, and laughed clamorously at his own brilliancy.\n\nEach of his companions became in turn his butt. Malone had a stock of jokes at their service, which he was accustomed to serve out regularly on convivial occasions like the present, seldom varying his wit; for which, indeed, there was no necessity, as he never appeared to consider himself monotonous, and did not at all care what others thought. Mr. Donne he favoured with hints about his extreme meagreness, allusions to his turned-up nose, cutting sarcasms on a certain threadbare chocolate surtout which that gentleman was accustomed to sport whenever it rained or seemed likely to rain, and criticisms on a choice set of cockney phrases and modes of pronunciation, Mr. Donne's own property, and certainly deserving of remark for the elegance and finish they communicated to his style.\n\nMr. Sweeting was bantered about his stature\u2014he was a little man, a mere boy in height and breadth compared with the athletic Malone; rallied on his musical accomplishments\u2014he played the flute and sang hymns like a seraph, some young ladies of his parish thought; sneered at as \"the ladies' pet;\" teased about his mamma and sisters, for whom poor Mr. Sweeting had some lingering regard, and of whom he was foolish enough now and then to speak in the presence of the priestly Paddy, from whose anatomy the bowels of natural affection had somehow been omitted.\n\nThe victims met these attacks each in his own way: Mr. Donne with a stilted self-complacency and half-sullen phlegm, the sole props of his otherwise somewhat rickety dignity; Mr. Sweeting with the indifference of a light, easy disposition, which never professed to have any dignity to maintain.\n\nWhen Malone's raillery became rather too offensive, which it soon did, they joined, in an attempt to turn the tables on him by asking him how many boys had shouted \"Irish Peter!\" after him as he came along the road that Malone); requesting to be informed whether it was the mode in Ireland for clergymen to carry loaded pistols in their pockets, and a shillelah in their hands, when they made pastoral visits; inquiring the signification of such words as vele, firrum, hellum, storrum (so Mr. Malone invariably pronounced veil, firm, helm, storm), and employing such other methods of retaliation as the innate refinement of their minds suggested.\n\nThis, of course, would not do. Malone, being neither good-natured nor phlegmatic, was presently in a towering passion. He vociferated, gesticulated; Donne and Sweeting laughed. He reviled them as Saxons and snobs at the very top pitch of his high Celtic voice; they taunted him with being the native of a conquered land. He menaced rebellion in the name of his \"counthry,\" vented bitter hatred against English rule; they spoke of rags, beggary, and pestilence. The little parlour was in an uproar; you would have thought a duel must follow such virulent abuse; it seemed a wonder that Mr. and Mrs. Gale did not take alarm at the noise, and send for a constable to keep the peace. But they were accustomed to such demonstrations; they well knew that the curates never dined or took tea together without a little exercise of the sort, and were quite easy as to consequences, knowing that these clerical quarrels were as harmless as they were noisy, that they resulted in nothing, and that, on whatever terms the curates might part to-night, they would be sure to meet the best friends in the world to-morrow morning.\nAs the worthy pair were sitting by their kitchen fire, listening to the repeated and sonorous contact of Malone's fist with the mahogany plane of the parlour table, and to the consequent start and jingle of decanters and glasses following each assault, to the mocking laughter of the allied English disputants, and the stuttering declamation of the isolated Hibernian\u2014as they thus sat, a foot was heard on the outer door-step, and the knocker quivered to a sharp appeal.\n\nMr. Gale went and opened.\n\n\"Whom have you upstairs in the parlour?\" asked a voice\u2014a rather remarkable voice, nasal in tone, abrupt in utterance.\n\n\"O Mr. Helstone, is it you, sir? I could hardly see you for the darkness; it is so soon dark now. Will you walk in, sir?\"\n\n\"I want to know first whether it is worth my while walking in. Whom have you upstairs?\"\n\n\"The curates, sir.\"\n\n\"What! all of them?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Been dining here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"That will do.\"\n\nWith these words a person entered\u2014a middle-aged man, in black. He walked straight across the kitchen to an inner door, opened it, inclined his head forward, and stood listening. There was something to listen to, for the noise above was just then louder than ever.\n\n\"Hey!\" he ejaculated to himself; then turning to Mr. Gale\u2014\"Have you often this sort of work?\"\nMr. Gale had been a churchwarden, and was indulgent to the clergy.\n\n\"They're young, you know, sir\u2014they're young,\" said he deprecatingly.\n\n\"Young! They want caning. Bad boys\u2014bad boys! And if you were a Dissenter, John Gale, instead of being a good Churchman, they'd do the like\u2014they'd expose themselves; but I'll\u2014\u2014\"\n\nBy way of finish to this sentence, he passed through the inner door, drew it after him, and mounted the stair. Again he listened a few minutes when he arrived at the upper room. Making entrance without warning, he stood before the curates.\n\nAnd they were silent; they were transfixed; and so was the invader. He\u2014a personage short of stature, but straight of port, and bearing on broad shoulders a hawk's head, beak, and eye, the whole surmounted by a Rehoboam, or shovel hat, which he did not seem to think it necessary to lift or remove before the presence in which he then stood\u2014he folded his arms on his chest and surveyed his young friends, if friends they were, much at his leisure.\n\n\"What!\" he began, delivering his words in a voice no longer nasal, but deep\u2014more than deep\u2014a voice made purposely hollow and cavernous\u2014\"what! has the miracle of Pentecost been renewed? Have the cloven tongues come down again? Where are they? The sound filled the whole house just now. I heard the seventeen languages in full action: Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes and Arabians; every one of these must have had its representative in this room two minutes since.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Helstone,\" began Mr. Donne; \"take a seat, pray, sir. Have a glass of wine?\"\n\nHis civilities received no answer. The falcon in the black coat proceeded,\u2014\n\n\"What do I talk about the gift of tongues? Gift, indeed! I mistook the chapter, and book, and Testament\u2014gospel for law, Acts for Genesis, the city of Jerusalem for the plain of Shinar. It was no gift but the confusion of tongues which has gabbled me deaf as a post. You, apostles? What! you three? Certainly not; three presumptuous Babylonish masons\u2014neither more nor less!\"\n\n\"I assure you, sir, we were only having a little chat together over a glass of wine after a friendly dinner\u2014settling the Dissenters!\"\n\n\"Oh! settling the Dissenters, were you? Was Malone settling the Dissenters? It sounded to me much more like settling his co-apostles. You were quarrelling together, making almost as much noise\u2014you three alone\u2014as Moses Barraclough, the preaching tailor, and all his hearers are making in the Methodist chapel down yonder, where they are in the thick of a revival. I know whose fault it is.\u2014It is yours, Malone.\"\n\n\"Mine, sir?\"\n\n\"Yours, sir. Donne and Sweeting were quiet before you came, and would be quiet if you were gone. I wish, when you crossed the Channel, you had left your Irish habits behind you. Dublin student ways won't do here. The proceedings which might pass unnoticed in a wild bog and mountain district in Connaught will, in a decent English parish, bring disgrace on those who indulge in them, and, what is far worse, on the sacred institution of which they are merely the humble appendages.\"\n\nThere was a certain dignity in the little elderly gentleman's manner of rebuking these youths, though it was not, perhaps, quite the dignity most appropriate to the occasion. Mr. Helstone, standing straight as a ramrod, looking keen as a kite, presented, despite his clerical hat, black coat, and gaiters, more the air of a veteran officer chiding his subalterns than of a venerable priest exhorting his sons in the faith. Gospel mildness, apostolic benignity, never seemed to have breathed their influence over that keen brown visage, but firmness had fixed the features, and sagacity had carved her own lines about them.\n\n\"I met Supplehough,\" he continued, \"plodding through the mud this wet night, going to preach at Milldean opposition shop. As I told you, I heard Barraclough bellowing in the midst of a conventicle like a possessed bull; and I find you, gentlemen, tarrying over your half-pint of muddy port wine, and scolding like angry old women. No wonder Supplehough should have dipped sixteen adult converts in a day\u2014which he did a fortnight since; no wonder Barraclough, scamp and hypocrite as he is, should attract all the weaver-girls in their flowers and ribbons, to witness how much harder are his knuckles than the wooden brim of his tub; as little wonder that you, when you are left to yourselves, without your rectors\u2014myself, and Hall, and Boultby\u2014to back you, should too often perform the holy service of our church to bare walls, and read your bit of a dry discourse to the clerk, and the organist, and the beadle. But enough of the subject. I came to see Malone.\u2014I have an errand unto thee, O captain!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" inquired Malone discontentedly. \"There can be no funeral to take at this time of day.\"\n\n\"Have you any arms about you?\"\n\n\"Arms, sir?\u2014yes, and legs.\" And he advanced the mighty members.\n\n\"Bah! weapons I mean.\"\n\n\"I have the pistols you gave me yourself. I never part with them. I lay them ready cocked on a chair by my bedside at night. I have my blackthorn.\"\n\n\"Very good. Will you go to Hollow's Mill?\"\n\n\"What is stirring at Hollow's Mill?\"\n\n\"Nothing as yet, nor perhaps will be; but Moore is alone there. He has sent all the workmen he can trust to Stilbro'; there are only two women left about the place. It would be a nice opportunity for any of his well-wishers to pay him a visit, if they knew how straight the path was made before them.\"\n\n\"I am none of his well-wishers, sir. I don't care for him.\"\n\n\"Soh! Malone, you are afraid.\"\n\n\"You know me better than that. If I really thought there was a chance of a row I would go: but Moore is a strange, shy man, whom I never pretend to understand; and for the sake of his sweet company only I would not stir a step.\"\n\n\"But there is a chance of a row; if a positive riot does not take place\u2014of which, indeed, I see no signs\u2014yet it is unlikely this night will pass quite tranquilly. You know Moore has resolved to have new machinery, and he expects two wagon-loads of frames and shears from Stilbro' this evening. Scott, the overlooker, and a few picked men are gone to fetch them.\"\n\n\"They will bring them in safely and quietly enough, sir.\"\n\n\"Moore says so, and affirms he wants nobody. Some one, however, he must have, if it were only to bear evidence in case anything should happen. I call him very careless. He sits in the counting-house with the shutters unclosed; he goes out here and there after dark, wanders right up the hollow, down Fieldhead Lane, among the plantations, just as if he were the darling of the neighbourhood, or\u2014being, as he is, its detestation\u2014bore a 'charmed life,' as they say in tale-books. He takes no warning from the fate of Pearson, nor from that of Armitage\u2014shot, one in his own house and the other on the moor.\"\n\n\"But he should take warning, sir, and use precautions too,\" interposed Mr. Sweeting; \"and I think he would if he heard what I heard the other day.\"\n\n\"What did you hear, Davy?\"\n\n\"You know Mike Hartley, sir?\"\n\n\"The Antinomian weaver? Yes.\"\n\n\"When Mike has been drinking for a few weeks together, he generally winds up by a visit to Nunnely vicarage, to tell Mr. Hall a piece of his mind about his sermons, to denounce the horrible tendency of his doctrine of works, and warn him that he and all his hearers are sitting in outer darkness.\"\n\n\"Well, that has nothing to do with Moore.\"\n\n\"Besides being an Antinomian, he is a violent Jacobin and leveller, sir.\"\n\n\"I know. When he is very drunk, his mind is always running on regicide. Mike is not unacquainted with history, and it is rich to hear him going over the list of tyrants of whom, as he says, 'the revenger of blood has obtained satisfaction.' The fellow exults strangely in murder done on crowned heads or on any head for political reasons. I have already heard it hinted that he seems to have a queer hankering after Moore. Is that what you allude to, Sweeting?\"\n\n\"You use the proper term, sir. Mr. Hall thinks Mike has no personal hatred of Moore. Mike says he even likes to talk to him and run after him, but he has a hankering that Moore should be made an example of. He was extolling him to Mr. Hall the other day as the mill-owner with the most brains in Yorkshire, and for that reason he affirms Moore should be chosen as a sacrifice, an oblation of a sweet savour. Is Mike Hartley in his right mind, do you think, sir?\" inquired Sweeting simply.\n\n\"Can't tell, Davy. He may be crazed, or he may be only crafty, or perhaps a little of both.\"\n\n\"He talks of seeing visions, sir.\"\n\n\"Ay! He is a very Ezekiel or Daniel for visions. He came just when I was going to bed last Friday night to describe one that had been revealed to him in Nunnely Park that very afternoon.\"\n\n\"Tell it, sir. What was it?\" urged Sweeting.\n\n\"Davy, thou hast an enormous organ of wonder in thy cranium. Malone, you see, has none. Neither murders nor visions interest him. See what a big vacant Saph he looks at this moment.\"\n\n\"Saph! Who was Saph, sir?\"\n\n\"I thought you would not know. You may find it out. It is biblical. I know nothing more of him than his name and race; but from a boy upwards I have always attached a personality to Saph. Depend on it he was honest, heavy, and luckless. He met his end at Gob by the hand of Sibbechai.\"\n\n\"But the vision, sir?\"\n\n\"Davy, thou shalt hear. Donne is biting his nails, and Malone yawning, so I will tell it but to thee. Mike is out of work, like many others, unfortunately. Mr. Grame, Sir Philip Nunnely's steward, gave him a job about the priory. According to his account, Mike was busy hedging rather late in the afternoon, but before dark, when he heard what he thought was a band at a distance\u2014bugles, fifes, and the sound of a trumpet; it came from the forest, and he wondered that there should be music there. He looked up. All amongst the trees he saw moving objects, red, like poppies, or white, like may-blossom. The wood was full of them; they poured out and filled the park. He then perceived they were soldiers\u2014thousands and tens of thousands; but they made no more noise than a swarm of midges on a summer evening. They formed in order, he affirmed, and marched, regiment after regiment, across the park. He followed them to Nunnely Common; the music still played soft and distant. On the common he watched them go through a number of evolutions. A man clothed in scarlet stood in the centre and directed them. They extended, he declared, over fifty acres. They were in sight half an hour; then they marched away quite silently. The whole time he heard neither voice nor tread\u2014nothing but the faint music playing a solemn march.\"\n\n\"Where did they go, sir?\"\n\n\"Towards Briarfield. Mike followed them. They seemed passing Fieldhead, when a column of smoke, such as might be vomited by a park of artillery, spread noiseless over the fields, the road, the common, and rolled, he said, blue and dim, to his very feet. As it cleared away he looked again for the soldiers, but they were vanished; he saw them no more. Mike, like a wise Daniel as he is, not only rehearsed the vision but gave the interpretation thereof. It signifies, he intimated, bloodshed and civil conflict.\"\n\n\"Do you credit it, sir?\" asked Sweeting.\n\n\"Do you, Davy?\u2014But come, Malone; why are you not off?\"\n\n\"I am rather surprised, sir, you did not stay with Moore yourself. You like this kind of thing.\"\n\n\"So I should have done, had I not unfortunately happened to engage Boultby to sup with me on his way home from the Bible Society meeting at Nunnely. I promised to send you as my substitute; for which, by-the-bye, he did not thank me. He would much rather have had me than you, Peter. Should there be any real need of help I shall join you. The mill-bell will give warning. Meantime, go\u2014unless (turning suddenly to Messrs. Sweeting and Donne)\u2014unless Davy Sweeting or Joseph Donne prefers going.\u2014What do you say, gentlemen? The commission is an honourable one, not without the seasoning of a little real peril; for the country is in a queer state, as you all know, and Moore and his mill and his machinery are held in sufficient odium. There are chivalric sentiments, there is high-beating courage, under those waistcoats of yours, I doubt not. Perhaps I am too partial to my favourite Peter. Little David shall be the champion, or spotless Joseph.\u2014Malone, you are but a great floundering Saul after all, good only to lend your armour. Out with your firearms; fetch your shillelah. It is there\u2014in the corner.\"\n\nWith a significant grin Malone produced his pistols, offering one to each of his brethren. They were not readily seized on. With graceful modesty each gentleman retired a step from the presented weapon.\n\n\"I never touch them. I never did touch anything of the kind,\" said Mr. Donne.\n\n\"I am almost a stranger to Mr. Moore,\" murmured Sweeting.\n\n\"If you never touched a pistol, try the feel of it now, great satrap of Egypt. As to the little minstrel, he probably prefers encountering the Philistines with no other weapon than his flute.\u2014Get their hats, Peter. They'll both of 'em go.\"\n\n\"No, sir; no, Mr. Helstone. My mother wouldn't like it,\" pleaded Sweeting.\n\n\"And I make it a rule never to get mixed up in affairs of the kind,\" observed Donne.\n\nHelstone smiled sardonically; Malone laughed a horse-laugh. He then replaced his arms, took his hat and cudgel, and saying that \"he never felt more in tune for a shindy in his life, and that he wished a score of greasy cloth-dressers might beat up Moore's quarters that night,\" he made his exit, clearing the stairs at a stride or two, and making the house shake with the bang of the front-door behind him.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 8,

"Malcolm Gladwell", "lyrics": "Chapter 1 LyricsThe Theory of Thin Slices: How a Little Bit of Knowledge Goes a Long Way\n\nSome years ago, a young couple came to the University of Washington to visit the laboratory of a psychologist named John Gottman. They were in their twenties, blond and blue-eyed with stylish tousled haircuts and funky glasses. Later, some of the people who worked in the lab would say they were the kind of couple that is easy to like-intelligent and attractive and funny in a droll, ironic kind of way-and that much is immediately obvious from the videotape Gottman made of their visit. The husband, whom I'll call Bill, had an endearingly playful manner. His wife, Susan, had a sharp, deadpan wit.\n\nThey were led into a small room on the second floor of the nondescript two-story building that housed Gottman's operations, and they sat down about five feet apart on two office chairs mounted on raised platforms. They both had electrodes and sensors clipped to their fingers and ears, which measured things like their heart rate, how much they were sweating, and the temperature of their skin. Under their chairs, a \"jiggle-o-meter\" on the platform measured how much each of them moved around. Two video cameras, one aimed at each person, recorded everything they said and did. For fifteen minutes, they were left alone with the cameras rolling, with instructions to discuss any topic from their marriage that had become a point of contention. For Bill and Sue it was their dog. They lived in a small apartment and had just gotten a very large puppy. Bill didn't like the dog; Sue did. For fifteen minutes, they discussed what they ought to do about it.\n\nThe videotape of Bill and Sue's discussion seems, at least at first, to be a random sample of a very ordinary kind of conversation that couples have all the time. No one gets angry. There are no scenes, no breakdowns, no epiphanies. \"I'm just not a dog person\" is how Bill starts things off, in a perfectly reasonable tone of voice. He complains a little bit-but about the dog, not about Susan. SHe complains, too, but there are also moments when they simply forget that they are supposed to be arguing. When the subject of whether the dog smells comes up, for example, Bill and Sue banter back and forth happily, both with a half smile on their lips.\n\nSue: Sweetie! She's no smelly... Bill: Did you smell her today? Sue: I smelled her. She smelled good. I petted her, and my hands didn't stink or feel oily. Your hands have never smelled oily. Bill: Yes, sir. Sue: I've never let my dog get oily. Bill: Yes, sir. She's a dog. Sue: My dog has never gotten oily. You'd better be careful. Bill: No, you'd better be careful. Sue: No, you\u2019d better be careful...Don\u2019t call my dog oily, boy.\n\n1. The Love Lab\nHow much do you think can be learned about Sue and Bill's marriage by watching that fifteen-minute videotape? Can we tell if their relationship is healthy or unhealthy? I suspect that most of us would say that Bill and Sue's dog talk doesn't tell us much. It's much too short. Marriages are buffeted by more important things, like money and sex and children and jobs and in-laws, in constantly changing combinations. Sometimes couples are very happy together. Some days they fight. Sometimes they feel as though they could almost kill each other, but then they go on vacation and come back sounding like newlyweds. In order to \"know\" a couple, we feel as though we have to observe them over many weeks and months and see them in every state-happy, tired, angry, irritated, delighted, having a nervous breakdown, and so on-and not just in the relaxed and chatty mode that Bill and Sue seemed to be in. To make an accurate prediction about something as serious as the future of a marriage-indeen, to make a prediction of any sort-it seems that we would have to gather a lot of information and in as many differed contexts as possible.\n\nBut John Gottman has proven that we don't have to do that at all. Since the 1980s, Gottman has brought more than three thousand married couples-just like Bill and Sue-into that small room in his \"love lab\" near the University of Washington campus. Each couple has been videotapes, and the results have been analyzed according to something Gottman dubbed SPAFF (for specific affect), a coding system that has twenty separate categories corresponding to every conceivable emotion that a married couple might express during a conversation. Disgust, for example is 1, contempt is 2, anger is 7, defensiveness is 10, whining is 11, sadness is 12, stonewalling is 13, neutral is 14, and so on. Gottman has taught his staff how to read every emotional nuance in people's facial expressions and how to interpret seemingly ambiguous bits of dialogue. When they watch a marriage videotape, they assgin a SPAFF code to every second of the couple's interaction, so that a fifteen-minute conflict discussion ends up being translated into a row of eighteen hundred numbers-nine hundred for the husband and nine hundred for the wife. The notation \"7, 7, 14, 10, 11, 11,\" for instance, means that in one six-second stretch, one member of the couple was briefly angry, then neutral, had a moment of defensiveness, and then began whining. Then the data from the electrodes and sensors is factored in, so that the coders know, for example, when the husband's or the wife's heart was pounding or when his or her temperature was rising or when either of them was jiggling in his or her seat, and all of that information is fed into a complex equation.\n\nOn the basis of those calculations, Gottman has proven something remarkable. If he analyzes an hour of a husband and wife talking, he can predict with 95 percent accuracy whether that couple will still be married fifteen years later. If he watches a couple for fifteen minutes, his success rate is around 90 percent. Recently, a professor who works with Gottman named Sybil Carr\u00e8re, who was playing around with some of the videotapes, trying to design a new study, discovered that if they looked at only three minutes of a couple talking, they could still predict with fairly impressive accuracy who was going to get divorced and who was going to make it. The truth of a marriage can be understood in a much shorter time than anyone ever imagined.\n\nJohn Gottman is a middle-aged man with owl-like eyes, silver hair, and a neatly trimmed beard. He is short and very charming, and when he talks about something that excites him-which is nearly all the time-his eyes light up and open even wider. During the Vietnam War, he was a conscientous objector, and there is still something of the '60s hippie about him, like the Mao cap he sometimes wears over his braided yarmulke. He is a psychologist by training, but he also studied mathematics at MIT, and the rigor and precision of mathematics clearly moves him as much as anything else. When I met Gottman, he had just published his most ambitious book, a dense five-hundred-page treatise called The Mathematics of Divorce, and he attempted to give me a sense of his argument, scribbling equations and impromptu graphs on a paper napkin until my head began to swim.\n\nGottman may seem to be an odd example in a book about the thoughts and decisions that bubble up from our unconscious. There\u2019s nothing instinctive about his approach. He\u2019s not making snap judgments. He\u2019s sitting down with his computer and painstakingly analyzing videotapes, second by second. His work is a classic example of conscious and deliberate thinking. But Gottman, it turns out, can teach us a great deal about a critical part of rapid cognition known as thin-slicing. \u201cThin-slicing\u201d refers to the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience. When Evelyn Harrison looked at the kouros and blurted out, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d she was thin-slicing; so were the Iowa gamblers when they had a stress reaction to the red decks after just ten cards.\n\nThin-slicing is part of what makes the unconscious so dazzling. But it\u2019s also what we find most problematic about rapid cognition. How is it possible to gather the necessary information for a sophisticated judgment in such a short time? The answer is that when our unconscious engages in thin-slicing, what we are doing is an automated, accelerated unconscious version of what Gottman does with his videotapes and equations. Can a marriage really be understood in one sitting? Yes it can, and so can lots of other seemingly complex situations. What Gottman has done is to show us how.\n\n2. Marriage and Morse Code\n\nI watched the videotape of Bill and Sue with Amber Tabares, a\ngraduate student in Gottman\u2019s lab who is a trained SPAFF coder. We sat in the same room that Bill and Sue used, watching their interaction on a monitor. The conversation began with Bill. He liked their old dog, he said. He just didn\u2019t like their new dog. He didn\u2019t speak angrily or with any hostility. It seemed like he genuinely just wanted to explain his feelings.\n\nIf we listened closely, Tabares pointed out, it was clear that Bill was being very defensive. In the language of SPAFF, he was cross-complaining and engaging in \u201cyes-but\u201d tactics-appearing to agree but then taking it back. Bill was coded as defensive, as it turned out, for forty of the first sixty-six seconds of their conversation. As for Sue, while Bill was talking, on more than one occasion she rolled her eyes very quickly, which is a classic sign of contempt. Bill then began to talk about his objection to the pen where the dog lives. Sue replied by closing her eyes and then assuming a patronizing lecturing voice. Bill went on to say that he didn\u2019t want a fence in the living room. Sue said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue about that,\u201d and rolled her eyes-another indication of contempt. \u201cLook at that,\u201d Tabares said. \u201cMore contempt. We\u2019ve barely started and we\u2019ve seen him be defensive for almost the whole time, and she has rolled her eyes several times.\u201d\n\nAt no time as the conversation continued did either of them show any overt signs of hostility. Only subtle things popped up for a second or two, prompting Tabares to stop the tape and point them out. Some couples, when they fight, fight. But these two were a lot less obvious. Bill complained that the dog cut into their social life, since they always had to come home early for fear of what the dog might do to their apartment. Sue responded that that wasn\u2019t true, arguing, \u201cIf she\u2019s going to chew anything, she\u2019s going to do it in the first fifteen minutes that we\u2019re gone.\u201d Bill seemed to agree with that. He nodded lightly and said, \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d and then added, \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s rational. I just don\u2019t want to have a dog.\u201d\n\nTabares pointed at the videotape. \"He started out with 'Yeah, I know.' Bit it's a yes-but. Even though he started to validate her, he went on to say that he didn't like the dog. He's really being defensive. I kept thinking, He's so nice. He's doing all this validation. But then I realized he was doing the yes-but. It's easy to be fooled by them.\"\n\nBill went on: \"I'm getting way better. You've got to admit it. I'm better this week than last week, and the week before and the week before.\"\n\nTabares jumped in again. \u201cIn one study, we were watching newlyweds, and what often happened with the couples who ended up in divorce is that when one partner would ask for credit, the other spouse wouldn\u2019t give it. And with the happier couples, the spouse would hear it and say, \u2018You\u2019re right.\u2019 That stood out. When you nod and say \u2018uh-huh\u2019 or \u2018yeah,\u2019 you are doing that as a sign of support, and here she never does it, not once in the entire session, which none of us had realized until we did the coding.\"\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d she went on. \u201cYou don\u2019t get the sense that they are an unhappy couple when they come in. And when they were finished, they were instructed to watch their own discussion, and they thought the whole thing was hilarious. They seem fine, in a way. But I don\u2019t know. They haven\u2019t been married that long. They\u2019re still in the glowy phase. But the fact is that she\u2019s completely inflexible. They are arguing about dogs, but it\u2019s really about how whenever they have a disagreement, she\u2019s completely inflexible. It\u2019s one of those things that could cause a lot of longterm harm. I wonder if they\u2019ll hit the seven-year wall. Is there enough positive emotion there? Because what seems positive isn\u2019t actually positive at all.\u201d\n\nWhat was Tabares looking for in the couple? On a technical level, she was measuring the amount of positive and negative emotion, because one of Gottma's finding is that for a marriage to survive, the ratio of positive to negative emotion in a given encounter has to be at least five to one. On a simpler level, though, what Tabares was looking for in that short discussion was a pattern in Bill and Sue\u2019s marriage, because a central argument in Gottman\u2019s work is that all marriages have a distinctive pattern, a kind of marital DNA, that surfaces in any kind of meaningful interaction. This is why Gottman asks couples to tell the story of how they met, because he has found that when a husband and wife recount the most important episode in their relationship, that pattern shows up right away.\n\n\"It's so easy to tell,\" Gottman says. \"I just looked at this tape yesterday. The woman says, 'We met as a ski weekend, and he was there with a bunch of his friends, and I kind of liked him and we made a date to be together. But then he drank too much, and he went home and went to sleep, and I was waiting for him for three hours. I woke him up, and I said I don't appreciate being treated this way. You're really not a nice person. And he said, yeah, hey, I really had a lot to drink.'\" There was a troubling pattern in their first interaction, and the sad truth was that that pattern persisted throughout their relationship. \"It's not that hard,\" Gottman went on. \"When I first started doing these interviews, I thought maybe we were getting these people on a crappy day. But the prediction levels are just so high, and if you do it again, you get the same pattern over and over again.\"\n\nOne way to understand what Gottman is saying about marriages is to use the analogy of what people in the world of Morse code call a fist. Morse code is made up of dots and dashes, each of which has its own prescribed length. But no one ever replicates those prescribed lengths perfectly. When operators send a message- particularly using the old manual machines known as the straight key or the bug-they vary the spacing or stretch out the dots and dashes or combine dots and dashes and spaces in a particular rhythm. Morse code is like speech. Everyone has a different voice.\n\nIn the Second World War, the British assembled thousands of so-called interceptors-mostly women- whose job it was to tune in every day and night to the radio broadcasts of the various divisions of the German military. The Germans were, of course, broadcasting in code, so-at least in the early part of the war-the British couldn\u2019t understand what was being said. But that didn\u2019t necessarily matter, because before long, just by listening to the cadence of the transmission, the interceptors began to pick up on the individual fists of the German operators, and by doing so, they knew something nearly as important, which was who was doing the sending. \u201cIf you listened to the same call signs over a certain period, you would begin to recognize that there were, say, three or four different operators in that unit, working on a shift system, each with his own characteristics,\u201d says Nigel West, a British military historian. \u201cAnd invariably, quite apart from the text, there would be the preambles, and the illicit exchanges. How are you today? How\u2019s the girlfriend? What\u2019s the weather like in Munich? So you fill out a little card, on which you write down all that kind of information, and pretty soon you have a kind of relationship with that person.\u201d\n\nThe interceptors came up with descriptions of the fists and styles of the operators they were following. They assigned them names and assembled elaborate profiles of their personalities. After they identified the person who was sending the message, the interceptors would then locate their signal. So now they knew something more. They knew who was where. West goes on: \u201cThe interceptors had such a good handle on the transmitting characteristics of the German radio operators that they could literally follow them around Europe-wherever they were. That was extraordinarily valuable in constructing an order of battle, which is a diagram of what the individual military units in the field are doing and what their location is. If a particular radio operator was with a particular unit and transmitting from Florence, and then three weeks later you recognized that same operator, only this time he was in Linz, then you could assume that that particular unit had moved from northern Italy to the eastern front. Or you would know that a particular operator was with a tank repair unit and he always came up on the air every day at twelve o\u2019clock. But now, after a big battle, he\u2019s coming up at twelve, four in the afternoon, and seven in the evening, so you can assume that unit has a lot of work going on. And in a moment of crisis, when someone very high up asks, \u2018Can you really be absolutely certain that this particular Luftwaffe Fliegerkorps [German air force squadron] is outside of Tobruk and not in Italy?\u2019 you can answer, \u2018Yes, that was Oscar, we are absolutely sure.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe key thing about fists is that they emerge naturally. Radio operators don\u2019t deliberately try to sound distinctive. They simply end up sounding distinctive, because some part of their personality appears to express itself automatically and unconsciously in the way they work the Morse code keys. We have to listen to only a few characters to pick out an individual\u2019s pattern. It doesn\u2019t change or disappear for stretches or show up only in certain words or phrases. That\u2019s why the British interceptors could listen to just a few bursts and say, with absolute certainty, \u201cIt\u2019s Oscar, which means that yes, his unit is now definitely outside of Tobruk.\u201d An operator\u2019s fist is stable.\n\nWhat Gottman is saying is that a relationship between two people has a fist as well: a distinctive signature that arises naturally and automatically. That is why a marriage can be read and decoded so easily, because some key part of human activity-whether it is something as simple as pounding out a Morse code message or as complex as being married to someone-has an identifiable and stable pattern. Predicting divorce, like tracking Morse Code operators, is pattern recognition.\n\nPeople are in one of two states in a relationship,\u201d Gottman went on. \u201cThe first is what I call\npositive sentiment override, where positive emotion overrides irritability. It\u2019s like a buffer. Their spouse will do something bad, and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s just in a crummy mood.\u2019 Or they can be in negative sentiment override, so that even a relatively neutral thing that a partner says gets perceived as negative. In the negative sentiment override state, people draw lasting conclusions about each other. If their spouse does something positive, it\u2019s a selfish person doing a positive thing. It\u2019s really hard to change those states, and those states determine whether when one party tries to repair things, the other party sees that as repair or hostile manipulation. For example, I\u2019m talking with my wife, and she says, \u2018Will you shut up and let me finish?\u2019 In positive sentiment override, I say, \u2018Sorry, go ahead.\u2019 I\u2019m not very happy, but I recognize the repair. In negative sentiment override, I say, \u2018To hell with you, I\u2019m not getting a chance to finish either. You\u2019re such a bitch, you remind me of your mother.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs he was talking, Gottman drew a graph on a piece of paper that looked a lot like a chart of\nthe ups and downs of the stock market over the course of a typical day. What he does, he\nexplains, is track the ups and downs of a couple\u2019s level of positive and negative emotion, and he\u2019s found that it doesn\u2019t take very long to figure out which way the line on the graph is going. \u201cSome go up, some go down,\u201d he says. \u201cBut once they start going down, toward negative emotion, ninety-four percent will continue going down. They start on a bad course and they can\u2019t correct it. I don\u2019t think of this as just a slice in time. It\u2019s an indication of how they view their whole relationship.\u201d\n\n3. The Importance of Contempt\n\nLet\u2019s dig a little deeper into the secret of Gottman\u2019s success rate. Gottman has discovered that marriages have distinctive signatures, and we can find that signature by collecting very detailed emotional information from the interaction of a couple. But there\u2019s something else that is very interesting about Gottman\u2019s system, and that is the way in which he manages to simplify the task of prediction. I hadn\u2019t realized how much of an issue this was until I tried thin-slicing couples myself. I got one of Gottman\u2019s tapes, which had on it ten three-minute clips of different couples talking. Half the couples, I was told, split up at some point in the fifteen years after their discussion was filmed. Half were still together. Could I guess which\nwas which? I was pretty confident I could. But I was wrong. I was terrible at it. I answered five correctly, which is to say that I would have done just as well by flipping a coin.\nMy difficulty arose from the fact that the clips were utterly overwhelming. The husband would say something guarded. The wife would respond quietly. Some fleeting emotion would flash across her face. He would start to say something and then stop. She would scowl. He would laugh. Someone would mutter something. Someone would frown. I would rewind the tape and look at it again, and I would get still more information. I\u2019d see a little trace of a smile, or I\u2019d pick up on a slight change in tone. It was all too much. In my head, I was frantically trying to determine the ratios of positive emotion to negative emotion. But what counted as positive, and what counted as negative? I knew from Susan and Bill that a lot of what looked positive was actually negative. And I also knew that there were no fewer than twenty separate emotional states on the SPAFF chart. Have you ever tried to keep track of twenty different emotions simultaneously? Now, granted, I\u2019m not a marriage counselor. But that same tape has been given to almost two hundred marital therapists, marital researchers, pastoral counselors, and graduate students in clinical psychology, as well as newlyweds, people who were recently divorced, and people who have been happily married for a long time-in other words, almost two hundred people who know a good deal more about marriage than I do-and none of them was any better than I was. The group as a whole guessed right 53.8 percent of the time, which is just above chance. The fact that there was a pattern didn\u2019t much matter. There were so many other things going on so quickly in those three minutes that we couldn\u2019t find the pattern.\n\nGottman, however, doesn\u2019t have this problem. He\u2019s gotten so good at thin-slicing marriages that he says he can be in a restaurant and eavesdrop on the couple one table over and get a pretty good sense of whether they need to start thinking about hiring lawyers and dividing up custody of the children. How does he do it? He has figured out that he doesn\u2019t need to pay attention to everything that happens. I was overwhelmed by the task of counting negativity, because everywhere I looked, I saw negative emotions. Gottman is far more selective. He has found that he can find out much of what he needs to know just by focusing on what he calls the Four Horsemen: defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism, and contempt. Even within the Four Horsemen, in fact, there is one emotion that he considers the most important of all: contempt. If Gottman observes one or both partners in a marriage showing contempt toward the other, he considers it the single most important sign that the marriage is in trouble.\n\n\u201cYou would think that criticism would be the worst,\u201d Gottman says, \u201cbecause criticism is a global condemnation of a person\u2019s character. Yet contempt is qualitatively different from criticism. With criticism I might say to my wife, \u2018You never listen, you are really selfish and insensitive.\u2019 Well, she\u2019s going to respond defensively to that. That\u2019s not very good for our problem solving and interaction. But if I speak from a superior plane, that\u2019s far more damaging, and contempt is any statement made from a higher level. A lot of the time it\u2019s an insult: \u2018You are a bitch. You\u2019re scum.\u2019 It\u2019s trying to put that person on a lower plane than you. It\u2019s hierarchical.\u201d\n\nGottman has found, in fact, that the presence of contempt in a marriage can even predict such things as how many colds a husband or a wife gets; in other words, having someone you love express contempt toward you is so stressful that it begins to affect the functioning of your immune system. \u201cContempt is closely related to disgust, and what disgust and contempt are about is completely rejecting and excluding someone from the community. The big gender difference with negative emotions is that women are more critical, and men are more likely to stonewall. We find that women start talking about a problem, the men get irritated and turn away, and the women get more critical, and it becomes a circle. But there isn\u2019t any gender difference when it comes to contempt. Not at all.\u201d Contempt is special. If you can measure contempt, then all of a sudden you don\u2019t need to know every detail of the couple\u2019s relationship.\n\nI think that this is the way that our unconscious works. When we leap to a decision or have a hunch, our unconscious is doing what John Gottman does. It\u2019s sifting through the situation in front of us, throwing out all that is irrelevant while we zero in on what really matters. And the truth is that our unconscious is really good at this, to the point where thin-slicing often delivers a better answer than more deliberate and exhaustive ways of thinking.\n\n4. The Secrets of the Bedroom\n\nImagine that you are considering me for a job. You\u2019ve seen my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and think I have the necessary credentials. But you want to know whether I am the right fit for your organization. Am I a hard worker? Am I honest? Am I open to new ideas? In order to answer those questions about my personality, your boss gives you two options. The first is to meet with me twice a week for a year-to have lunch or dinner or go to a movie with me-to the point where you become one of my closest friends. (Your boss is quite demanding.) The second option is to drop by my house when I\u2019m not there and spend half an hour or so looking around. Which would you choose?\n\nThe seemingly obvious answer is that you should take the first option: the thick slice. The more time you spend with me and the more information you gather, the better off you are. Right? I hope by now that you are at least a little bit skeptical of that approach. Sure enough, as the psychologist Samuel Gosling has shown, judging people\u2019s personalities is a really good example of how surprisingly effective thin-slicing can be.\n\nGosling began his experiment by doing a personality workup on eighty college students. For this, he used what is called the Big Five Inventory, a highly respected, multi-item questionnaire that measures people across five dimensions:\n\n1. Extraversion Are you sociable or retiring? Fun-loving or reserved?\n\n2. Agreeableness. Are you trusting or suspicious? Helpful or uncooperative?\n\n3. Conscientiousness. Are you organized or disorganized? Self-disciplined or weak willed?\n\n4. Emotional stability. Are you worried or calm? Insecure or secure?\n\n5. Openness to new experiences. Are you imaginative or down-to-earth? Independent or conforming?\n\nThen Gosling had close friends of those eighty students fill out the same questionnaire.\n\nWhen our friends rank us on the Big Five, Gosling wanted to know, how closely do they come to the truth? The answer is, not surprisingly, that our friends can describe us fairly accurately. They have a thick slice of experience with us, and that translates to a real sense of who we are. Then Gosling repeated the process, but this time he didn\u2019t call on close friends. He used total strangers who had never even met the students they were judging. All they saw were their dorm rooms. He gave his raters clipboards and told them they had fifteen minutes to look around and answer a series of very basic questions about the occupant of the room: On a scale of 1 to 5, does the inhabitant of this room seem to be the kind of person who is talkative? Tends to find fault with others? Does a thorough job? Is original? Is reserved? Is helpful and unselfish with others? And so on. \u201cI was trying to study everyday impressions,\u201d Gosling says. \u201cSo I was quite careful not to tell my subjects what to do. I just said, \u2018Here is your questionnaire. Go into the room and drink it in.\u2019 I was just trying to look at intuitive judgment processes.\u201d\n\nHow did they do? The dorm room observers weren\u2019t nearly as good as friends in measuring extraversion. If you want to know how animated and talkative and outgoing someone is, clearly, you have to meet him or her in person. The friends also did slightly better than the dorm room visitors at accurately estimating agreeableness- how helpful and trusting someone is. I think that also makes sense. But on the remaining three traits of the Big Five, the strangers with the clipboards came out on top. They were more accurate at measuring conscientiousness, and they were much more accurate at predicting both the students\u2019 emotional stability and their openness to new experiences. On balance, then, the strangers ended up doing a much better job. What this suggests is that it is quite possible for people who have never met us and who have spent only twenty minutes thinking about us to come to a better understanding of who we are than people who have known us for years. Forget the endless \u201cgetting to know\u201d meetings and lunches, then. If you want to get a good idea of whether I\u2019d make a good employee, drop by my house one day and take a look around.\n\nIf you are like most people, I imagine that you find Gosling\u2019s conclusions quite incredible. But the truth is that they shouldn\u2019t be, not after the lessons of John Gottman. This is just another example of thin-slicing. The observers were looking at the students\u2019 most personal belongings, and our personal belongings contain a wealth of very telling information. Gosling says, for example, that a person\u2019s bedroom gives three kinds of clues to his or her personality. There are, first of all, identity claims, which are deliberate expressions about how we would like to be seen by the world: a framed copy of a magna cum laude degree from Harvard, for example. Then there is behavioral residue, which is defined as the inadvertent clues we leave behind: dirty laundry on the floor, for instance, or an alphabetized CD collection. Finally, there are thoughts and feelings regulators, which are changes we make to our most personal spaces to affect the way we feel when we inhabit them: a scented candle in the corner, for example, or a pile of artfully placed decorative pillows on the bed. If you see alphabetized CDs, a Harvard diploma on the wall, incense on a side table, and laundry neatly stacked in a hamper, you know certain aspects about that individual\u2019s personality instantly, in a way that you may not be able to grasp if all you ever do is spend time with him or her directly. Anyone who has ever scanned the bookshelves of a new girlfriend or boyfriend-or peeked inside his or her medicine cabinetunderstands this implicitly: you can learn as much-or more-from one glance at a private space as you can from hours of exposure to a public face.\n\nJust as important, though, is the information you don\u2019t have when you look through someone\u2019s belongings. What you avoid when you don\u2019t meet someone face-to-face are all the confusing and complicated and ultimately irrelevant pieces of information that can serve to screw up your judgment. Most of us have difficulty believing that a 275-pound football lineman could have a lively and discerning intellect. We just can\u2019t get past the stereotype of the dumb jock. But if all we saw of that person was his bookshelf or the art on his walls, we wouldn\u2019t have that same problem.\n\nWhat people say about themselves can also be very confusing, for the simple reason that most of us aren\u2019t very objective about ourselves. That\u2019s why, when we measure personality, we don\u2019t just ask people point-blank what they think they are like. We give them a questionnaire, like the blank questions about the state of their marriage. They might lie or feel awkward or, more important, they might not know the truth. They may be so deeply mired-or so happily ensconced-in their relationship that they have no perspective on how it works. \u201cCouples simply aren\u2019t aware of how they sound,\u201d says Sybil Carr\u00e8re. \u201cThey have this discussion, which we videotape and then play back to them. In one of the studies we did recently, we interviewed couples about what they learned from the study, and a remarkable number of them-I would say a majority of them-said they were surprised to find either what they looked like during the conflict discussion or what they communicated during the conflict discussion. We had one woman whom we thought of as extremely emotional, but she said that she had no idea that she was so emotional. She said that she thought she was stoic and gave nothing away. A lot of people are like that. They think they are more forthcoming than they actually are, or more negative than they actually are. It was only when they were watching the tape that they realized they were wrong about what they were communicating.\u201d\n\nIf couples aren\u2019t aware of how they sound, how much value can there be in asking them direct questions? Not much, and this is why Gottman has couples talk about something involving their marriage-like their pets-without being about their marriage. He looks closely at indirect measures of how the couple is doing: the telling traces of emotion that flit across one person\u2019s face; the hint of stress picked up in the sweat glands of the palm; a sudden surge in heart rate; a subtle tone that creeps into an exchange. Gottman comes at the issue sideways, which, he has found, can be a lot quicker and a more efficient path to the truth than coming at it head-on.\n\nWhat those observers of dorm rooms were doing was simply a layperson\u2019s version of John Gottman\u2019s analysis. They were looking for the \u201cfist\u201d of those college students. They gave themselves fifteen minutes to drink things in and get a hunch about the person. They came at the question sideways, using the indirect evidence of the students\u2019 dorm rooms, and their decision-making process was simplified: they weren\u2019t distracted at all by the kind of confusing, irrelevant information that comes from a face-to-face encounter. They thin-sliced. And what happened? The same thing that happened with Gottman: those people with the clipboards were really good at making predictions.\n\n5. Listening to Doctors\n\nLet\u2019s take the concept of thin-slicing one step further. Imagine you work for an insurance company that sells doctors medical malpractice protection. Your boss asks you to figure out for accounting reasons who, among all the physicians covered by the company, is most likely to be sued. Once again, you are given two choices. The first is to examine the physicians\u2019 training and credentials and then analyze their records to see how many errors they\u2019ve made over the past few years. The other option is to listen in on very brief snippets of conversation between each doctor and his or her patients.\n\nBy now you are expecting me to say the second option is the best one. You\u2019re right, and here\u2019s why. Believe it or not, the risk of being sued for malpractice has very little to do with how many mistakes a doctor makes. Analyses of malpractice lawsuits show that there are highly skilled doctors who get sued a lot and doctors who make lots of mistakes and never get sued. At the same time, the overwhelming number of people who suffer an injury due to the negligence of a doctor never file a malpractice suit at all. In other words, patients don\u2019t file lawsuits because they\u2019ve been harmed by shoddy medical care. Patients file lawsuits because they\u2019ve been harmed by shoddy medical care and something else happens to them.\n\nWhat is that something else? It\u2019s how they were treated, on a personal level, by their doctor. What comes up again and again in malpractice cases is that patients say they were rushed or ignored or treated poorly. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t sue doctors they like,\u201d is how Alice Burkin, a leading medical malpractice lawyer, puts it. \u201cIn all the years I\u2019ve been in this business, I\u2019ve never had a potential client walk in and say, \u2018I really like this doctor, and I feel terrible about doing it, but I want to sue him.\u2019 We\u2019ve had people come in saying they want to sue some specialist, and we\u2019ll say, \u2018We don\u2019t think that doctor was negligent. We think it\u2019s your primary care doctor who was at fault.\u2019 And the client will say, \u2018I don\u2019t care what she did. I love her, and I\u2019m not suing her.\u2019\u201d\n\nBurkin once had a client who had a breast tumor that wasn\u2019t spotted until it had metastasized, and she wanted to sue her internist for the delayed diagnosis. In fact, it was her radiologist who was potentially at fault. But the client was adamant. She wanted to sue the internist. \u201cIn our first meeting, she told me she hated this doctor because she never took the time to talk to her and never asked about her other symptoms,\u201d Burkin said. \u201c\u2018She never looked at me as a whole person,\u2019 the patient told us. . . . When a patient has a bad medical result, the doctor has to take the time to explain what happened, and to answer the patient\u2019s questions-to treat him like a human being. The doctors who don\u2019t are the ones who get sued.\u201d It isn\u2019t necessary, then, to know much about how a surgeon operates in order to know his likelihood of being sued. What you need to understand is the relationship between that doctor and his patients.\n\nRecently the medical researcher Wendy Levinson recorded hundreds of conversations between a group of physicians and their patients. Roughly half of the doctors had never been sued. The other half had been sued at least twice, and Levinson found that just on the basis of those conversations, she could find clear differences between the two groups. The surgeons who had never been sued spent more than three minutes longer with each patient than those who had been sued did (18.3 minutes versus 15 minutes). They were more likely to make \u201corienting\u201d comments, such as \u201cFirst I\u2019ll examine you, and then we will talk the problem over\u201d or \u201cI will leave time for your questions\u201d-which help patients get a sense of what the visit is supposed to accomplish and when they ought to ask questions. They were more likely to engage in active listening, saying such things as \u201cGo on, tell me more about that,\u201d and they were far more likely to laugh and be funny during the visit. Interestingly, there was no difference in the amount or quality of information they gave their patients; they didn\u2019t provide more details about medication or the patient\u2019s condition. The difference was entirely in how they talked to their patients.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, in fact, to take this analysis even further. The psychologist Nalini Ambady listened to Levinson\u2019s tapes, zeroing in on the conversations that had been recorded between just surgeons and their patients. For each surgeon, she picked two patient conversations. Then, from each conversation, she selected two ten-second clips of the doctor talking, so her slice was a total of forty seconds. Finally, she \u201ccontentfiltered\u201d the slices, which means she removed the high-frequency sounds from speech that enable us to recognize individual words. What\u2019s left after content-filtering is a kind of garble that preserves intonation, pitch, and rhythm but erases content. Using that slice-and that slice alone-Ambady did a Gottman-style analysis. She had judges rate the slices of garble for such qualities as warmth, hostility, dominance, and anxiousness, and she found that by using only those ratings, she could predict which surgeons got sued and which ones didn\u2019t.\n\nAmbady says that she and her colleagues were \u201ctotally stunned by the results,\u201d and it\u2019s not hard to understand why. The judges knew nothing about the skill level of the surgeons. They didn\u2019t know how experienced they were, what kind of training they had, or what kind of procedures they tended to do. They didn\u2019t even know what the doctors were saying to their patients. All they were using for their prediction was their analysis of the surgeon\u2019s tone of voice. In fact, it was even more basic than that: if the surgeon\u2019s voice was judged to sound dominant, the surgeon tended to be in the sued group. If the voice sounded less dominant and more concerned, the surgeon tended to be in the non-sued group. Could there be a thinner slice? Malpractice sounds like one of those infinitely complicated and multidimensional problems. But in the end it comes down to a matter of respect, and the simplest way that respect is communicated is through tone of voice, and the most corrosive tone of voice that a doctor can assume is a dominant tone. Did Ambady need to sample the entire history of a patient and doctor to pick up on that tone? No, because a medical consultation is a lot like one of Gottman\u2019s conflict discussions or a student\u2019s dorm room. It\u2019s one of those situations where the signature comes through loud and clear.\n\nNext time you meet a doctor, and you sit down in his office and he starts to talk, if you have the sense that he isn\u2019t listening to you, that he\u2019s talking down to you, and that he isn\u2019t treating you with respect, listen to that feeling. You have thin-sliced him and found him wanting.\n\n6. The Power of the Glance\n\nThin-slicing is not an exotic gift. It is a central part of what it means to be human. We thin-slice whenever we meet a new person or have to make sense of something quickly or encounter a novel situation. We thin-slice because we have to, and we come to rely on that ability because there are lots of hidden fists out there, lots of situations where careful attention to the details of a very thin slice, even for no more than a second or two, can tell us an awful lot.\n\nIt is striking, for instance, how many different professions and disciplines have a word to describe the particular gift of reading deeply into the narrowest slivers of experience. In basketball, the player who can take in and comprehend all that is happening around him or her is said to have \u201ccourt sense.\u201d In the military, brilliant generals are said to possess \u201ccoup d\u2019oeil\u201d-which, translated from the French, means \u201cpower of the glance\u201d: the ability to immediately see and make sense of the battlefield. Napoleon had coup d\u2019oeil. So did Patton. The ornithologist David Sibley says that in Cape May, New Jersey, he once spotted a bird in flight from two hundred yards away and knew, instantly, that it was a ruff, a rare sandpiper. He had never seen a ruff in flight before; nor was the moment long enough for him to make a careful identification. But he was able to capture what bird-watchers call the bird\u2019s \u201cgiss\u201d-its essence-and that was enough. particular gift of reading deeply into the narrowest slivers of experience. In basketball, the player who can take in and comprehend all that is happening around him or her is said to have \u201ccourt sense.\u201d In the military, brilliant generals are said to possess \u201ccoup d\u2019oeil\u201d-which, translated from the French, means \u201cpower of the glance\u201d: the ability to immediately see and make sense of the battlefield.

But he was able to capture what bird-watchers call the bird\u2019s \u201cgiss\u201d-its essence-and that was enough.\n\n\u201cMost of bird identification is based on a sort of subjective impression-the way a bird moves and little instantaneous appearances at different angles and sequences of different appearances, and as it turns its head and as it flies and as it turns around, you see sequences of different shapes and angles,\u201d Sibley says. \u201cAll that combines to create a unique impression of a bird that can\u2019t really be taken apart and described in words. When it comes down to being in the field and looking at a bird, you don\u2019t take the time to analyze it and say it shows this, this, and this; therefore it must be this species. It\u2019s more natural and instinctive. After a lot of practice, you look at the bird, and it triggers little switches in your brain. It looks right. You know what it is at a glance.\u201d\n\nThe Hollywood producer Brian Grazer, who has produced many of the biggest hit movies of the past twenty years, uses almost exactly the same language to describe the first time he met the actor Tom Hanks. It was in 1983. Hanks was then a virtual unknown. All he had done was the now (justly) forgotten TV show called Bosom Buddies. \u201cHe came in and read for the movie Splash, and right there, in the moment, I can tell you just what I saw,\u201d Grazer says. In that first instant, he knew Hanks was special. \u201cWe read hundreds of people for that part, and other people were funnier than him. But they weren\u2019t as likable as him. I felt like I could live inside of him. I felt like his problems were problems I could relate to. You know, in order to make somebody laugh, you have to be interesting, and in order to be interesting, you have to do things that are mean. Comedy comes out of anger, and interesting comes out of angry; otherwise there is no conflict. But he was able to be mean and you forgave him, and you have to be able to forgive somebody, because at the end of the day, you still have to be with him, even after he\u2019s dumped the girl or made some choices that you don\u2019t agree with. All of this wasn\u2019t thought out in words at the time. It was an intuitive conclusion that only later I could deconstruct.\u201d\n\nMy guess is that many of you have the same impression of Tom Hanks. If I asked you what he was like, you would say that he is decent and trustworthy and down-to-earth and funny. But you don\u2019t know him. You\u2019re not friends with him. You\u2019ve only seen him in the movies, playing a wide range of different characters. Nonetheless, you\u2019ve managed to extract something very meaningful about him from those thin slices of experience, and that impression has a powerful effect on how you experience Tom Hanks\u2019s movies. \u201cEverybody said that they couldn\u2019t see Tom Hanks as an astronaut,\u201d Grazer says of his decision to cast Hanks in the hit movie Apollo 13. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know whether Tom Hanks was an astronaut. But I saw this as a movie about a spacecraft in jeopardy. And who does the world want to get back the most? Who does America want to save? Tom Hanks. We don\u2019t want to see him die. We like him too much.\u201d\n\n\nIf we couldn\u2019t thin-slice-if you really had to know someone for months and months to get at their true selves-then Apollo 13 would be robbed of its drama and Splash would not be funny. And if we could not make sense of complicated situations in a flash, basketball would be chaotic, and bird-watchers would be helpless. Not long ago, a group of psychologists reworked the divorce prediction test that I found so overwhelming. They took a number of Gottman\u2019s couples videos and showed them to nonexperts-only this time, they provided the raters with a little help. They gave them a list of emotions to look for. They broke the tapes into thirty-second segments and allowed everyone to look at each segment twice, once to focus on the man and once to focus on the woman. And what happened? This time around, the observers\u2019 ratings predicted with better than 80 percent accuracy which marriages were going to make it. That\u2019s not quite as good as Gottman. But it\u2019s pretty impressive-and that shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. We\u2019re old hands at thin-slicing.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/435767", "artist_names": "The Beach Boys", "full_title": "The Little Girl I Once Knew

another\nI know he loved me at the start\nThrough the years his memory will haunt me\nAnd all because of you, oh jealous heart\n\nAnd all because of you, oh jealous heartYou might also likeEmbed"},

Hobbes I was there when he wrote Leviathan/\nGuard my noble causes/\nA fighter for virtue and love/\nPursuit of peace and charm/\nReady to love you down and put you to sleep but I\u2019m not the song/\nHitting bongs rioting for endearing sins with efficacy and conviction/\nForced luck automatically becomes bad luck/\nFor the industry to become healthy it goes from sicken dispositions/\nStrident students of erudition on the path to perdition I\u2019m far from the avenue of loose intentions/\nAre you ready player one?/\nYes I am are you coming to planet earth to get an underhanded curse/\nCrush anybody in my way to attain this immovable and unstoppable grace/\nSetting the pace to relay information on unacknowledged subject/\nBrowsing traces of unnamed files to learn about chemical imbalances that was found inside tombs where they see malice\u2019s/\nMiraculous paintings touched by angels of will verified and identified by tactless deals\nLet me enclose this verse of perfection smothered in positive dope to smoke/\nFear of the unknown clones and I\u2019m closer to death/\nIn the desert of dreams thirsty for a drink I sprint now/\nA vessel of truth to embody and share with the masses /\nMaking level headed decisions of how I am going to reconcile opposite offers:\nI\u2019m the prince and the pauper/\nI am ever lasting like the gob stopper/\nPop her locker well I never been to Harlem but I\u2019m her Globetrotter/\nNot my name but I felt like win the Oscar/\nLet me be the champion of this cause so win this round in my boxer going looney Hippity Hopper/\nPractice what you preach and teach I\u2019m here to exist you just cease/\nI\u2019m an artist at a western rodeo ready to draw my hand/\nFinishing touches on my endgame/\nDisappear and reappear my madness is magic/\nHold on tight I\u2019m ready to think write speak poetically upgraded and about to graduate/\nLet essay this over the turntables/\nScouting for talent this non violent is once in a lifetime what Aliyah said/\n\nI don\u2019t care who you are or where your from/\nI see high society they\u2019re healthy wealthy and dumb like the stooges so I\u2019m numb/\nHow could I be so cumbersome/\nLet me essay my target and depict me the assailant/\nI nailed it didn\u2019t fail it just flailed it/\nI\u2019m a vivid detailed picture that you can see so be amused/\nWhen I spit this Cyborg dyslexic cypher playing with a rubiks cube /\nNever addicted to no nicotine on a neon street with a cyber security leak /\nNext to a quirky shrink who shrieks havoc/\nI\u2019m doing fantastic like mr. so thanks for asking/\nA repetitive cross over from every genre relaxing my feet up in the Ramada formulating cures for my aching and aging sagas in Romania/\nSinister projects without much chit chat only to be stewed in Virginia witchcraft/\nBackwoods thinking got me outside looking at the box thinking/\nFor a moment my patience was on a tight rope so let me spin my sonnets/\nA din won an award once they laced a genius on it/\nThey Gunn a swarm like a thousand hornets for my performance/\nEnhance my space big house nice pool some tunes to groove on let the melody play so I can be like a camera lens and zoom in/\nYou might also like\nMore romantic than the three languages Spanish French and Italian/\nMy suburban living is heroic giving my troop uplifting divid ends I\u2019m splendid kid in a German sense/\nA Japan hut with a Jamaican quiet queens touch/\nEating shrimp scamp a major mage genie lamp watch lady n the tramp/\nPrague and niece I\u2019m on the way and get to the Eritrean I\u2019m soon be seeing/\nEverything I say is hypnotizing and continues to be conflicted constricted righteous and rigid exposed on contingent in lay mans terms/\nMy pseudonym is my nickname big the old soul yo we can go blow for blow/\nSee you on death row for trying to pawn off and plagiarize my lyrics as your own a fake dr writing prescriptions like Mario/\nScribbling down ideas on my trek was an epic one to recount seeing this epidemic get faster as I drummed up this epiphany to have a destiny and a fetishized wordplay/\nThis chiseled quartz looks real but it is secretly ersatz/\nMade it this far at my point of eureka you reek of sorrow see you tomorrow /\nI feel bad for the euphemism and the youth in asia(euthanasia)/\nLet be here for the clarity of the sport then become evanescent/\nHere we go I\u2019m moving like a turtle on the beach to slow so I won\u2019t get arrested by this ex officio/\nYou just excoriated my heroic entrance /\nThem charges were excruciating but now the judge exculpated all of them/\n\n\nYour can not stay here now you are expatriated/\nCrimes committed were heinous dangerous and extemporaneous to say the least /\nMedical medieval dark ages kept my soul in agonizing pain when I left/\nNow there is none like Agatha Christie\u2019s novel/\nYeah I see a thief run in a Jeep tired in deep mud seeking his Fiefdoms/\nI\u2019m just an apparent figment of your imagination when I display figurative rhymes/\nBefore college elders would give me an acknowledged head nod a simple sign of foreknowledge /\nKatanas strike fear in those fools who shake like maracas and always ignite some damn fracas/\nLook is in an aura or a wave of frisson/\nI can\u2019t see my rival he might become fugacious/\nRead a few pages of biblical scriptures on my furlough from work/\nToo many gaps and gaffs when start to possess my raps issue them on waxing walls /\nLet me fix this with some gaiety and recover this gainsay/\nThis gamut stretches video games to Shakespearean Hamlet so I gambol those pamphlets/\nThink sinking motion pockets empty and my trade of work to finance my bills was garroted/\nWith my pencil made out of England steel my manners stern mixed with a knighting hood of genteel/\nI\u2019m waiting patient to endure this forthcoming gradation to my admiration/\nAin\u2019t nothing like your mom and ain\u2019t\nGrappling with uncertainty haunts me at night when searching for grandiose solutions/\nI made it to the top of my rank I feel so harangue/\nI\u2019m a genius within a heterogeneous fit in this world perplexed by the media\u2019s contusion and rallying up for s revolution of mind body and soul /\nCommence to hew then resew the chapters of our lives delicately/\nLet me address this social in media res before I expose fearless antagonists/\nIn essence the raps I display are full of vivid vindictive images and incandescent/\nAll my ally\u2019s turned to enemies feel fiendish and try to upset us but I won\u2019t let us dissolve/\nI\u2019m tiresome from guessing along with gyrating about homeless problems/\nMy frustration was communicated to my comrades by liaison/\nMy plans digressed and fell backwards got hassled then began to ramshackle/\nBackfiring my telepathic dreams inserting computerized and fixed signals on temples/\nThose clothes were the zeitgeist in the Great Depression I\u2019m late for my blessings/\nA needle in a haystack rewind my playback for this wheedle/\nGrant me the space so it can vouchsafed/\nScrew a motive to carry out bosses orders is my votive/\nI need some logos on my boat lift oh shit/\nIt flatters me cause sometimes I\u2019m broke in my scene it\u2019s vogue but for show and tell my shoes are brogue/\n\nI play the game not the rappers name but I\u2019ll twist a (twist ya) sista and watch you undress your soul through a vista/\nViscid places and distant faces/\nLook at this facade in the mirage it\u2019s kind of odd looking at her visage not eating sausage/\nI love the arts my nickname should have been Virtu I never meant to hurt you/\nBe careful what you wish for it\u2019s somber going from filthy rich to piss poor/\nIndivisible my birth rights undeniable your just a bunch of bull jam packed/\nIm not even vincible/\nD like a school kids lunch able/\nI brought to the party a maiden of truth when she was sagacious in her youth/\nTo swallow your pride and humble yourself you will need a tablespoon/\nDon\u2019t sweat my unique technique as you read this vignette/\nThis gambit in the pit let it enervate it\u2019s speech/\nA definite classic remorseful and resourceful as it gets/\nWhy lie cause these colors don\u2019t die/dye so by cause you can\u2019t vie/\nAnd I remain an explicit dude real rude mouth full of vicissitudes/\nBehave child and be a nice boy cause here comes the Viceroy/\n\nMy love send letters are prestige indeed they cling to shingles that are now vestige/\nBest believe when I walk into a room I come in peace/\nWho\u2019s next to go up this vertex in present context/\nShow me my acting cue because I\u2019m set all this questions they asked me I gave me back in verisimilitude/\nBack in denial the skies of my dreams red and blue but now I\u2019m in venial/\nMind altering substances making my mentality vendible and bendable/\nA velvet night I said it once don\u2019t make it twice/\nUrchin looks leave to capsize my adventure with urgent crooks/\nHot like the smogs from the pyro in the nostrils of Spyro don\u2019t be mad I\u2019m just a Tyro/\nEat my own flow like a gyro I don\u2019t know so I\u2019m about to blow up Egypt I\u2019m thinking Cairo with some high flow on a oops that was a typo baby I\u2019m a psycho from Ohio/\nMy heart and brain have gave out doctors and surgeons trying to revive me/\nLike Christmas it\u2019s a cheerful spirit when I kick this verse with ya nurse /\nMet a fake replica of a man named Erica who was not from America/\nOn my list I have to usher out this gist I solemnly swear to spit as I sear and swelter raps before my tryst /\nThrowing a tantrum that\u2019s tantamount to a child won\u2019t help you either/\nCrisp fresh brew a hint of apple cider/\nFacial expression truculent and my meal was far from succulent /\nI am but my my Spider-Man senses and mood changes all the time/\nI need a love of my own but now I ain\u2019t a average white band\nAll in ample time sipping some maple syrup within the confines of my soul as I attempt victorious strides/\nI\u2019m going back to the old me since we ain\u2019t on good termagant terms again/\nReciting and inciting hot lines on my lawn at my chateau beside the tableau/\n\nA jar of of greed and a pot for my need /\nI want what I want so stunt my back has no front/\nI like to see a battle of wits Donald trump vs forest gump vs chuck norris sun/\nLet me get the message straight so it won\u2019t be fixed for fusion then get knocked by a fissure then I put the binary back into a fission as I\u2019m fishing then she likes math class cause I\u2019m here long division/\nA notorious rap performance coming with cosmic weapons that\u2019s my squad rep pin/\nOfficial scholars of adversity find my flow hard to answer like a mystery suicidal murder/\nI\u2019m just a kid enchanted by your magic in an incubus related to Icarus /\nSee you later Roy I\u2019m not a toy I\u2019m fully focused my route I want my Paperboy/\nHotter than a cup of java don\u2019t Botha in Turkey sweet tooth someone pass me the Baklava/\nMy Servants are loyal I\u2019m polished with the finest oil and if must wear my crown to be royal/\nWanna place ya bets I\u2019m a gift in real rare form from the French my new name is Lafayette/\nPlay me turn up the radio cause I wanna know what\u2019s on my cassette eject don\u2019t flex come correct I abject now spit into the mic and read the alphabet/\nDrinking from the front finest winery separating my fake and truth in my refinery/\n\nMy depression state reclines and unwinds for the given time/\nMy anxiety takes over my Central nervous system/\nI\u2019m part paralyzed and am getttti nag uh speech impediment/\nNo more schizophrenia now I\u2019m eating a lot more than I chew/\nTied to my inner sick narcissistic self mirroring my reality/\nMy thoughts are graphical then go skinny like I\u2019m entering anorexia/\nBars scattered all over the mixed up could be early signs of dyslexia/\nPlease park your breaks pumping don\u2019t let these naysayers get the best of ya/\nI\u2019m young generating Alzheimer\u2019s on documented papers so I sign there/\nThis flow is mine in a neat form I\u2019m ocd for sure this too neat/\nLook no Aspergers in my 16 bars unless there\u2019s some form of autism in my bars/\nThis separation anxiety is upon on trial awaiting its notoriety/\nCan\u2019t keep focused the picture foggy ADHD symptoms triggering my career/\nCan\u2019t hope it won\u2019t be quoted just be heroic and stoic pleas not protozoic/\nMy style range is simple I\u2019m can go from being on a street corner/\nSuited down 3 pc on live tv talking to a fox republican news reporter/\n\nI\u2019m from Maryland my state 301 is where I\u2019m recording /\nAnd I have big dreams to the hip hop version with expressions like Ed Norton/\nMy jewels are bright but my flight out of orbit we abortin/\nYou get extorted for not being able to afford it/\nLet me aboard the ship and distort this flick/\nGo to the judge and report this snitch/\nIn the walk of fame I\u2019m a star now let support my hit/\nMy flow hotter in the streets than on stage shucks my bars hotter than a battle like Cassidy vs Eminem/\nToo much to bicker and noisy banter/\nI\u2019m cool jack laid back legs up with glasses on and some black glasses on playing the theme from pink panther /\nCut the product and middleman in the store out so I could it it straight no whole sale/\nNull and void when it makes the mail/\nUnder pressure I\u2019m good at conspiracy theories you won\u2019t see traces of me in the sky like chem trails/\nDosing off on the side line seeking some thick tails/\nI\u2019m a brag about you put a post on my book then snap a pic about you/\nWords on tablets from cavemen every sentence I meant it set in stone now I carry my statue/\n\nMy lines my bars are hand written and I\u2019m loud when I tip toe around the live show/\nYou can get super hard like that scene where that native radishes his eye brow you know Apacalypto/\nPaid in full but I\u2019m not big money Mitch/\nFull of comedy delivering 16s in nine months like babies I\u2019m a dr call me Kosevich/\nWhen I was down and out my baby momma took care of me/\nMy own family and friends hated on me they was like the Pharisees/\nOn my own way to stardom reaching success I\u2019m a rare breed/\nLook closer then pick the stems out the weed cause if you don\u2019t then you got ripped off indeed/\nI\u2019m something big the mayor need to see/\nPlayer please I been around you just didn\u2019t know me since we graduated Cooley High/\nHutches over scratching my head making a hunch about this/\nOn a run depicted as a fugitive really grasping life on its terms/\nSince you don\u2019t want beef I guess your a vegetarian/\nBut you gotta knuckle up like The Warriors or your body is the casket you get buried in/\nI don\u2019t try to fit or stand out I just do me/\nBecause a man that\u2019s spits like big Jim is not going drive an 2018 yellow Audi/\n\nDo your own thing a different avenue can get you that different cash/\nHigh School and college was something I did pass/\nFocused on me not worrying about what them other dudes do/\nShit I tell em just do you cause /\nThey gonna hate on you when you cruise that 2018 BMW/\nAvoiding all the losers games jail kids you can\u2019t take of and drugs/\nEating my money up giving into bs/\nNext time I put sixteens down paper I need a bank to verify and co sign my rhymes/\nFelt like I read this on that mag high times/\nI\u2019m on shore but I think I could hang glide/\nCause if it is a scheme and it\u2019s cut short/\nThen we express mail your corpse with a fee of course/\nIt\u2019d me tighten my axel wow wait my flow is on fire like the hair of the clown on twisted metal no specters/\nLeft my adversaries confused when they get swirled and twirled on sand/\nThis is real life my ex girl took the lyrical gun and got em blown like Kirby s Dream Land/\nA ball of confusion too much temptations/\n\nYou a Simpson simpleton I\u2019m on a trek ask Homer/\nWent to court for my sex scene she wanted in Latin so I gave her a pro boner/\nYou count my cards like you count my bars fraud/\nI love my soup my special brand of cream of broccoli/\nYou collapse when I spit verses giving out life sentences like court cases easily/\nIts a shame you have to diss people just to get your views up/\nBar x bar pound for pound for pound I astound the crowd when it cheers/\nImaginary players vs extraordinary pimps/\nWe as real and raw as they come out my vendor/\nI\u2019m so advanced I even was signed to Mensa/\nI\u2019m teaching my girl the tricks where\u2019s\nShirley temple she calls me Bojangles/\nYou don\u2019t have to be in the eat but I\u2019m a dish sense my steam on this et tu fe/\nIt\u2019s all just a game playing with words so my last name is smith/\nHustle flows on my tapes a beautiful mind I\u2019m in my Russell Crowe/\nEject the elects now I direct when I dissect my butterfly see its effect/\nEnd of story i paid alimony for testimony your baloney get clowned like homey then quote my allegory/\n\nI\u2019m insane in my asylum I maintain/\nA war hero for hip hop rip to John McCain/\nMy initials are not AK/\nI\u2019m up high like the soul plane/\nOh my god what an omen/\nStay wiser than Yoda saying yahoo/\nMy ladies are circus freaks showing you taboo/\nStuck on me like an artists tatoo/\nThey want the green I appear out of thin air The great gazoo/\nDo it when you die so I put a halo over you/\nIn my radius they play us/\nLet me stretch my arms out Goro vs dr Octavia\u2019s in the sky my ship Gradius/\nA lot of liquor and great ideas/\nMonster madness riding out on a grounder mustang/\nLike Chinese stickers im stick when you pull me apart/\nIt\u2019s too hot in the summer time to spit something cool I think/\nYou made a killing no guns Just my pens wielding I sit high putting in work like 1930s Manhattan construction workers on buildings/\n\nTrump is our president/\nMaryland is my residence/\nMy family was heaven sent/\nWhen I leave for a long time I\u2019m home sick/\nOutside roasting marshmallows on an open fire/\nIce cold winds and razor sharp flies whistle/\nBody aches metal plates commence to whittle/\nSheets of loose leaf paper I write my diary on/\nApron on big Jim marinate and serenade the juices when they burst/\n16 bars in mansion haunted watch out for the ghost/\nA rumor that ain\u2019t real it was just a hoax/\nIt is spiteful to be you cause your arrogance will over turn/\nI play for keeps you take the losses/\nGreat things comes those who wait patiently/\nWhen you rush the adrenaline rises my blood pressure levels/\nMy name ain\u2019t Melvin second round I want helpings and your my family but no Cosby show like Elvin/\n\nYou can be rich or poor/\nYou can want peace or war/\nYou can\u2019t get your time back but you can but everything in the store/\nTime goes on we let bygones go and change our perspective at the door/\nListen up I could have died fighting/\nBut god chose me for a different course/\nI could have chose the drug route but instead I used my mind to find my fountain of youth/\nI\u2019m a genius when I\u2019m on the mic/\nIf it\u2019s good for me to utilize than I want it plain and simple/\nI got one liners that strike fast like the ice climbers/\nThem hits take you back to the past did you use a pipe to smoke/\nI\u2019m on shore rapping with straight bars I\u2019m a dead toad/\nThese wanna be\u2019s are flops that just croak/\nPoof I\u2019m gone whodini in the land of Miami fine exotic ladies in many mini bikinis/\nGoing to my hardship carrying a soft chip on my shoulder eating a starfish/\nWatch out I got a fever and I\u2019m ready to explode at at a marksman/\n\nThe only thing I dread is the judge I\u2019m about to see so like the board game it\u2019s in the Risk/\nDrink my flow up it\u2019s brisk/\nReturn of the Jedi in my brothers Levi we fly high against the sith/\nDominate the landscape rise to the occasion I brought my ape/\nA grizzly bear on the loose about to chew you to smithereens/\nI\u2019m on live tv screen hitting you around the cypher but I\u2019m not butter bean/\nBe you in your rhymes find your own style don\u2019t try to be like some else/\nImitating demonstrating and elevating off their lives was not wise/\nI\u2019m a child so I\u2019m always learning to adjust to this maladaptive environment/\nMy mom name is penny and dad name is Trent/\nNever been to France but I can understand their accent when they need the rent/\nOn a Gondola passing to go see the magnificent works of art the country reproduced/\nFour more times I fight for my champion belt/\nA stampede roaring in causing some wobbling welts/\nTo each is his or her own/\nLights off when I kill these two idiots with idioms using one stone my skills are hone/\n\nI don\u2019t care I\u2019m the new mayor/\nTo be the boss you got to pay the fare so on act lasseiz you hear/\nLife comes with a price for most of us it ain\u2019t fair/\nMy hustle is rare so cross me I double dare/\nYo I\u2019m a clown having sex on my birthday I\u2019m Jack Napier/\nGod please forgive me for all my sin/\nMy guilty conscious brings them back to life bright like the hat on the Gortons fisherman/\nSupport my supply and demand principal/\nI\u2019m the one they call official but I ain\u2019t a school principle/\nAll on point feeding my family in my municipal/\nYou can tell I\u2019m real not fake by the way I was created look at the visual/\nJimmy Mack tell them you\u2019ll be back so just relax facts take off tax/\nA glitch in the system another matrix computer hack/\nIn my card game it\u2019s this gambit now I love to be the winner jack/\nHigher than the kite Franklin flew/\nOldies but goodies some Aretha tunes/\nNever met drake but I\u2019ll still his views/\n\nMy style is a one knockout piece hitter quitter/-\nThe tables turned like a do scratching when we last met/\nI\u2019m not a street fighter or a general like bison/\nBut I\u2019m stuck in space talking about physics Neil Degrasse tyson/\nMy bank account is broke but after the show I hope to see some ones/\nIt\u2019s all fun and games till it happens to you/\nI stay in programs to perfect my craft even after school/\nI\u2019m smart like a fish I need to eat my mackerel hear my mouth start to crackle/\nLounge in my own thoughts and zoning in my own mind/\nI made an offer you can\u2019t refuse/\nI\u2019m not amused by you comical stupid dudes/\nTell the truth I\u2019m tired of these bills and over repeated flukes/\nI don\u2019t smoke for free and I don\u2019t sell bars/\nYou want some I cook em for you then get you the wholesale/\nFresh out my oven you can smell and inhale the scent of oatmeal:/\nLemon colored car seats and golden plated rims is what I\u2019m on/\n\nBefore you can back out I stand firm in my conviction/\nYou ain\u2019t got a PhD like dr Mario fraud but you say you sorry though/\nBig Jim my other alias should have been collage/\nI\u2019m all over the place painting many ideas from an art class in college/\nThis a Herculean cyclops in the eye of the storm mixed with a cyclone/\nI always hung around the older crew cause if I hang with the younger dudes I might lose/\nLife can bring you psi. Or joy so I\u2019ll pick joy/\nJust dint get upset if your batteries die out like a gameboy/\nNo more acting a role like the new 007 with an English accent Idris Elba/\nGerman women going angry in public Hey Arnold vs Helga/\nIn the south I\u2019m watching a movie turn on Selma/\nWhat\u2019s Louise without Thelma/\nA genius mind always finding hints go jinkies I\u2019m Velma/\nI keep a green hat on my head and a sword but I\u2019m not Zelda/\nThis new era might be the death of me/\nAlways ask questions never take what they tell you/\n\nBig jim the Collage\n\nMy comedies are corrupted in my bars not a Shakespeare scholar but I can go measure for measure/\nI\u2019m going to past all the tests of time/\nI been around since sonic was on secs genesis and since Hercules ride on his horse Pegasus/\nI\u2019m trying to move a million plus units on my album release date/\nI want pockets full of money cholesterol and a pinch of lime cheesecake/\nI want so my much money my knees and back ache/\nLike when a kid gets in trouble you make that sarcastic gee just great face/\nA mythical creature about to get your chest torn in on point with this beat I\u2019m a unicorn/\nTurn around it gets scary so make a wish then poof you I got a fairy/\nI know what I think I saw you iron ship sink in the desert right behind a sphinx wearing a mink that\u2019s pink/\nIf my skin dries I put on aloe Vera my flow from the Sahara I take all animals I even own a chimera/\nI\u2019m flyer than a griffin so don\u2019t test me/\nOr come meet my inner beast a Yeti/\nDriving you mad in my car I\u2019m half man half beast like a centaur or come with bull strength I\u2019m a centaur/\nIn office like I\u2019m running for senator/\nEvery word and verse I wrote I mean this/\nI keep three dope bars with their own heads like a cerebrus/\nWings of a winter Phoenix or I might fight ya like I\u2019m a hydra so hide ya kids/\n\nI hop on the mic to speak something tactical practical and factual/\nBut you just fly by passing your history class like some prehistoric Pterodactyl/\nDon\u2019t get brainwashed by the medi critics or the hype/\nThey use their conditions as scapegoats and recycle the same gloomy quotes/\nLike a student in class I\u2019m taking taking down advanced notes/\nI\u2019m sharp in the mind I should be hosting wedding receptions/\nOr presiding over general presidential elections/\nInvest in me you will see guaranteed results I can sell and tell you/\nLife is a trail we all must travel to get to our location/\nI\u2019m in my mood changing modes in my PlayStation/\nDon\u2019t know the next spot but I planned my vacation/\nI got something on my mind someone say they can see it in my eyes/\nWhy fight back when I can give back to the mess I lived in/\nThe joke is not on me it\u2019s on you/\nNightlife I skate pass my nephews curfew/\nJohn Doe no name everybody is saying who are you I\u2019m like I\u2019m just me fool/\n\nI got an idea let\u2019s play this like a scene from Madea /\nI\u2019m cooking up bars serving my fiends in the lunch cafeteria/\nI\u2019m more like Patrick Ewing who are you suing you look clueless/\nYou need a q tip in your ear to remove the ear wigs/\nBe careful kids cause this is an auto didactic manual reaction/\nI\u2019m afraid of getting hurt again I stay away from dirty dancing at clubs biker Gangs ripped jeans and pool sticks/\nDon\u2019t get caught up in the hustle like you riding fast on a motorcycle/\nIn school I was never the most popular/\nBut I created my own style something afar you need a to see with a pair of binoculars/\n\nI got the Briefcase deal or no deal like I\u2019m Howie Mandel/\nThe steam on my plate of food is very hot I can sense extreme pressure/\nYou are fresher but my mentality is way better how clever/\nPull you back in to the game again so I broke the factory lever/\nEvery line stitched tightly and bar on the track is treasure/\nBesides why would I want to give my trash if you don\u2019t see the gold in front of you?/\nTonight there\u2019s just good vibes all love and no fights about stress or strife/\nPrepare for the prevention of premonition ms of your first day/\nAnd the clairvoyance I seen as I play my flute it puked or flunked/\nBut my xylophone and harmonica are figuratively synced/Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

so good\n\n[Chorus]\nThough she hasn't got a dime\nI'm so proud that she's all mine\n'Cause to me she's a princess in rags\n[Verse 2]\nNow her dad, he's a worn-out man\nPrayin' if he can make enough to eat\nAnd her mom cleans for everyone\n'Til the day is done just to make ends meet\n\n[Chorus]\nAll her wealth is in her charms\nAnd the sweetness of her arms\nHow I love my poor princess in rags\n\n[Bridge]\nI know some day I'll find a way\nTo take her out of this old place\nI'll work and slave, scrimp and save\nTo change her rags to silk and lace\n\n[Verse 3]\nThough it hurts and my body aches\nFrom the pain it takes just to set things right\nBut for now, I must be content\nWith each moment spent in her arms each night\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's the only girl for me\nAnd someday it's gotta be\nJust me and my princess in rags\nShe's the only girl for me\nAnd someday it's gotta be\nJust me and my princess in rags\nYou might also like[Outro]\nShe's the only girl for me\nAnd someday

Ghostface Killah ft. AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams \"The Battlefield\"\"The Battlefield\" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99. Apollo Brown & Rass Kass ft. Pharoahe Monch & Rakaa Iriscience \"H20\"98. Travi$ Scott ft. Big Sean \"Don't Play\"97. Mac Miller ft. Vince Staples \"Rain\"96. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA \"West Savannah\"95. Vic Mensa\t\"Feel That\"Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year\u2019s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger \"Feel That\". The song breaks away from Vic\u2019s reputation as a \u201clyrical\u201d rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic\u2019s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins\tft Joey Bada$$ \"Jerome\"93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q \"2 On\"92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens \"Better In Tune With The Infinite\"91. Big K.R.I.T. \"King Of The South\"90. PRyhme \"Courtesy\" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino \"Sober\"88. NehruvianDOOM \"OM\"87. Drake\t\"How About Now\"86. Statik Selektah ft Action Bronson, Royce da 5'9 & Black Thought \"The Imperial\"85. O.T Genasis\t\"CoCo\"BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?84. Vince Staples ft James Fauntleroy \"Nate\"83. Lupe Fiasco ft Ty Dolla $ign \"Deliver\"82. Theophilus London ft Kanye West \"Can't Stop\"81. Future ft. Andre 3000 \"Benz Friends (Whatchutola)\"80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z \"We Made It Freestyle\" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy\u2019s 2013 New Year anthem \u201cWe Made It\u201d. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: \u201cSorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought\u201d79. Beyonce ft. Nicki Minaj \"***Flawless Remix\"78. ScHoolboy Q \"Prescription/Oxymoron\"77. Travis Scott ft Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Mamacita\"76. YG ft. Jay Rock & ScHoolboy Q \"I Just Wanna Party\"75. Dej Loaf\t\"Try Me\"From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS\u2019 \u201cTry Me\u201d beat creeps in, Dej commands the year\u2019s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam\u2019ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf\u2019s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs \"Old English\"73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX \"Gotti\"72. Mick Jenkins \"The Waters\"71. Game \"Bigger Than Me\"70. Childish Gambino \"Candler Road\"Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song \u201cTelegraph Ave.\u201d The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan \"Ruckus In B Minor\"68. Kendrick Lamar \"Untitled\"67. OG Maco \"U Guessed It\"66. Drake \"Draft Day\"65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods\t\"Sunday Candy\"The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago \u201csymphony\u201d, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it\u2019s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper\u2019s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q \"Hoover Street\"63. Common ft. Vince Staples \"Kingdom\"62. Jay Rock \"Parental Advisory\"61. Freddie Gibbs \"Shitsville\"60. Action Bronson \"Easy Rider\"The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like \u201cI had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin\u201d are classic Bam Bam. \"Easy Rider\" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem\t\"Shady XV\"58. Nicki Minaj \"Anaconda\"57. J.Cole \"January 28th\"56. Run The Jewels ft. boots \"Early\"55. Mac Miller \"Diablo\"Mac hit us with \u201cDiablo\u201d  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like \u201cContemplating suicide like it\u2019s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it\u2019s a prison homie leave me be\u201d. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs \"Harold's\"53. Slaughterhouse \"Y'all Ready Know\"52. Logic \"Nikki\"51. Yelawolf \"Till It's Gone\"50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought \"Rapid Eye Movement\"From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. \"My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga\" starts us off with a bang. \"Rapid Eye Movement\" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake \"Recognize\"48. Vic Mensa \"Down On My Luck\"47. PRyhme\t\"PRyhme\"46. Vince Staples \"Blue Suede\"45. Rae Sremmurd\t\"No Flex Zone\"Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne \"Only\" 43. Joey Bada$$\t\"Big Dusty\"42. Run The Jewels \"Blockbuster Night Pt. 1\"41. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Cadillactica\"40. Pusha T \"Lunch Money\"What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push\u2019s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like \u201cWhat's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef\u201d. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013\u2019s MNIMN, he won\u2019t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake \"Who Do You Love\"38. Freddie Gibbs \"Deeper\"37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt \"New Faces V2\"36. Rae Sremmurd \"No Type\"35. Isaiah Rashad \"Heavenly Father\"Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa \"We Dem Boyz\"33. J.Cole \"No Role Modelz\"32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T \"Move That Dope\"31. Logic \"Soul Food\"30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick \"Detroit Vs Everybody\" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em\u2019s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar \"Pay For It\"28. Nas \"The Season\"27. Bad Meets Evil \"Vegas\"26. Logic \"Gang Related\"25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown \"High\"Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug \"About The Money\"23. Drake \"6 God\"22. Eminem ft. Sia \"Guts Over Fear\"21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  \"Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)\"20. Mick Jenkins \"Jazz\" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z \"Seen It All\"Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West \"Sanctified\"Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, \"Sanctified\" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith.\n\nNot only did \"Sanctified\" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake \"Tuesday (Remix)\"I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto \u201cTuesday\u201d and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole \t\"Wet Dreamz\"Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake \"Believe Me\" The release of \"Believe Me\"  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion\n\nOne of the more underrated aspects of \"Believe Me\"  is its versatility. You can bump it while you\u2019re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q \"Break tHe Bank\"Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J \"Multiply\"After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in \"Multiply.\" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn\u2019t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP\u2019s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year\u2019s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar \"Never Catch Me\"Like a psychedelic rat race, \u201cNever Catch Me\u201d  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick\u2019s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - \u201cbitch, you\u2019re dead!\u201d11. Joey Bada$$ \"Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)\"With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey\u2019s ability and shows he ain\u2019t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won\u2019t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels \"Oh My Darling Don't Cry\" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to \u201crun backwards through a field of dicks\u201d as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Lifestyle\" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan\u2019s \u201cone-hit wonder status\u201d and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid \"Studio\"ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole \"Fire Squad\"If shock factor was what Cole was after with \"Fire Squad\" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda \"Hot Nigga\"The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn\u2019t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic \"Under Pressure\"The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic\u2019s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track\u2019s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 \"I Don't Fuck With You\"Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with \u201cParadise\u201d, \u201c4th Quarter\u201d, and \u201cJit/Juke\" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples \u201cSay You Love Me\u201d, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not \"down with\" and is reminiscent of \u201cI Don\u2019t Give A Fuck\u201d from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still\u2026.Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Mt. Olympus\"Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. \"Mt. Olympus\" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, \"Is he rap, is he snap?\". \"Is he bass, is he drank?\" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake \"0-100/The Catch Up\"If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. \"Started from the bottom, now we here\" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but \"0 to 100 nigga, real quick\" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release\n\nThe two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes \"0 to 100/The Catch Up\" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar \"i\"Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple \"I love myself\"\n\nSimilar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's \"New Slaves\", every facet of the song\u2019s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move. Whether it be the record, the music video, or the buzz - each element illustrates the message crystal clear. An anthem isn't created overnight, this song has been in Kendrick all his life. They can lock ya body, they can\u2019t trap ya mind.\n\n163Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1651265", "artist_names": "We Five", "full_title": "Let's Get Together
