moments\nShe still believes in miracles while others cry in vain\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's all about soul\nIt's all about faith and a deeper devotion\nIt's all about soul\n'Cause under the love is a stronger emotion\nShe's got to be strong\n'Cause so many things getting out of control\nShould drive her away\nSo why does she stay?\nIt's all about soul\n[Verse 2]\nShe turns to me sometimes and she asks me what I'm dreaming\nAnd I realize I must have gone a million miles away\nAnd I ask her how she knew to reach out for me at that moment\nAnd she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's all about soul\nIt's all about knowing what someone is feeling\nThe woman's got soul\nThe power of love and the power of healing\nThis life isn't fair\nIt's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold\nYou've got to get tough, but that ain't enough\nIt's all about soul\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere are people who have lost every trace of human kindness\nThere are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive\nShe comes to me at night and she tells me her desires\nAnd she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's all about soul\nIt's all about joy that comes out of sorrow\nIt's all about soul\nWho's standing now and who's standing tomorrow\nYou've got to be hard\nHard as the rock in that old rock 'n roll\nBut that's only part, you know in your heart\nIt's all about soulSee Billy Joel LiveGet tickets as low as $92You might also like1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 30, "api_path": "/songs/826", "artist_names": "2Pac",

something for my godson Elijah\nAnd a little girl named Corin\n[Verse 1: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]\nSome say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nI say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots (Oh)\nI give a holla to my sisters on welfare\n2Pac cares if don't nobody else care (Oh)\nAnd, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot\nWhen you come around the block, brothers clown a lot\nBut please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up\nForgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up\nAnd when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him\nAnd if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him\n'Cause, sister, you don't need him\nAnd I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)\nYou know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)\nWhen brothers make babies\nAnd leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAnd since we all came from a woman\nGot our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)\nI wonder why we take from our women\nWhy we rape our women, do we hate our women?\n(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)\nI think it's time to kill for our women\nTime to heal our women, be real to our women\nAnd if we don't, we'll have a race of babies\nThat will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)\nAnd since a man can't make one\nHe has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one\nSo will the real men get up?\nI know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up\n[Chorus: Dave Hollister]\n(Keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things are gonna get easier\n(Keep-keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things'll get brighter\n(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things are gonna get easier\n(Keep-keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things'll get brighter\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]\nAyo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me\nHe had me feelin' like black was the thing to be\nAnd suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough\nAnd though we had it rough, we always had enough\nI huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules\nRan with the local crew and had a smoke or two\nI realize Mama really paid the price\nShe nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)\nAnd all I had to give her was my pipe dream\nOf how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen\nI'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents\nIt's hard to be legit and still pay your rent\nAnd in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'\nI try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind\nLast night, my buddy lost his whole family\nIt's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)\nIt seems the rain'll never let up\nI try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh\nYou know, it's funny, when it rains it pours\nThey got money for wars, but can't feed the poor\nSaid it ain't no hope for the youth\nAnd the truth is it ain't no hope for the future\nAnd then they wonder why we crazy, huh\nI blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby\nWe ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up\nAnd even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up\nYou might also like[Chorus: Dave Hollister]\n(Keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things are gonna get easier\n(Keep-keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things'll get

havin' babies on they own\nI know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone\nDaddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome\nThank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em\n'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure\nAnd if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)\n'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son\nWants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'\nYou can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand\nWithout a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)\nBecause there's too many things for you to deal with\nDyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless\nWhile the tears is rollin' down your cheeks\nYou're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)\n'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)\nAnd don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)\nAnd now my son's gettin' older and older\nAnd cold from havin' the world on his shoulders\nWhile the rich kids is drivin' Benz\nI'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)\nAnd it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up\nBut, huh, please, you got to keep your head up206Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

Come fight me!\nI'll hit ya with the \"Wa-psh-psh-psh-psh-psh!\" See, see?\nI get dirty after dark\nI'll treat you like Spielberg, you'll get your ass kicked in in a park (Ooh!)\nYou don't believe me? The proof is in the puddin'\nBeen a boy in the hood way before Cuba Gooding\nI flip scripts with the mad pa-style, freeze\n(Shhh) Music, please!\nI dribble rhymes like Basketball-em's\nPeople call me E.T. (What's that, Shaq man?), Extra-Tallem's\nYou better than Shaq-tack, fool, shut up, liar!\nI lean on the Statue of Liberty when I get tired\nThan I'll punch you in the stomach, I don't give a heck\n(Hey yo, why you booger hook like that?) Yo, she breath on my neck!\nPeople walk around like, yo, they got charged!\nBut I'm big like Gorilla, 6'7 ain't large!\nI kick rhymes like Moo Duk Kwan Do\nI smoke-smoke the mic-mic like Cheech and Chong do\nYou don't like Shaq? Frankly, I don't give a damn\nI know I got skills man, I know I got skills man\n[Verse 2: Def Jef]\nSurprise, look who's back, not a prize from a Cracker Jack\nLook at that, it's Def Jef with the Shaq Attack\nFlexin', I'll be crackin your back with the boom-boom bap\nPass that mic over here, you ain't gon' want it back\nEverybody say I got fat, yep, but so did my wallet\nStill ripping rhymes and dropping bombs like Khalid Muhammad\nDo yourself a solid, don't flex, you go sex\nYou know the time, get the high-hat, the Rolex\nThe way I see, if I was wack like you, I'd be at me\nThe way I hold it down, you'd swear my name was Gravity\nDef Jef with the funk, Def Jef don't front, you know how the name is spelt\nI'm making it vital, and jackin' the title, fool, break yourself\nAttack the track like Shaq on a whack broad\nComing up with the hits, and I'm coming down with the backboard\nDon't fake the funk, just make the sound's up from the trunk\nThe reason your tape ain't hit the deck is because your hits don't bump\nSo get back, ain't no hassle, cause you ain't holding nothin'\nKeep sticking around, you get beat down like you stole something\nSleep on me and the Shaq and jump your own hand\nCause I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man\n\n[Ad-lib]\nAh yeah, yeah, y'all don't know nothing about this\nThe Shaq Man and The Arsenal\nWhat's up like that?\nDouble XL in the nine-ohs kid\nSkills to make mills\nBig up, Flava Unit, Funky Town pros, upstate, yeah ??? ya large\nSo check this out Shaq man, we gon' let this beat play right here, let all\nThe brothers and sister know.....\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Shaq Diesel]\nNah, nah, let me continue\nI'm a be like Pete Rock and see what's next on the menu\nMic-checka, the rim and rhyme wrecka, rocks from here to Mecca\n(Boom!) Boom shack-a-lack-a-lack-a\nI got a hand that'll rock ya cradle\nCream you like cheese, spread you on my bagel\nMy Ford Explorer boomin' with the trunk of funk\nAll you jealous punks can't stop my dunks\nThe brand new like Heavy, built like Chevy, Impala\nBut Shaq's a smooth balla\n(Yeah, but what about rhymin'?) I can hold my own\nKnick-knack, Shaq-attack, give a dog a bone\nRhymin is like hoopin', I'm already a legend\nBack in the days in the food stamp section\nUsed to kick rhymes like, \"Baby, baby, baby!\"\n\"Every once, every twice, three times a lady\"\nIs what I listened to, ridin' with my moms\nHow you like me now? I drop bombs!\nWhen you see me, please tap my hands\nI know I got skills man, I know I got skills man\n\n[Outro: Shaq]\nI'd like to give a shout-out to my boy Uzi, Def Jef, Little Swany, Meech\nRon Mac, and my other cousin Ron\nThis is another rough shot from the arsenal\nAnd you know what?

The sky sank down before dawn, muddy, flat, immovable. The air is thick, clammy with the breath of crowded human beings. It stifles me. I open the window, and, looking out, can scarcely see through the rain the grocer's shop opposite, where a crowd of drunken Irishmen are puffing Lynchburg tobacco in their pipes. I can detect the scent through all the foul smells ranging loose in the air.\n\nThe idiosyncrasy of this town is smoke. It rolls sullenly in slow folds from the great chimneys of the iron-foundries, and settles down in black, slimy pools on the muddy streets. Smoke on the wharves, smoke on the dingy boats, on the yellow river,\u2014clinging in a coating of greasy soot to the house-front, the two faded poplars, the faces of the passers-by. The long train of mules, dragging masses of pig-iron through the narrow street, have a foul vapor hanging to their reeking sides. Here, inside, is a little broken figure of an angel pointing upward from the mantel-shelf; but even its wings are covered with smoke, clotted and black. Smoke everywhere! A dirty canary chirps desolately in a cage beside me. Its dream of green fields and sunshine is a very old dream,\u2014almost worn out, I think.\nFrom the back-window I can see a narrow brick-yard sloping down to the river-side, strewed with rain-butts and tubs. The river, dull and tawny-colored, (la belle riviere!) drags itself sluggishly along, tired of the heavy weight of boats and coal-barges. What wonder? When I was a child, I used to fancy a look of weary, dumb appeal upon the face of the negro-like river slavishly bearing its burden day after day. Something of the same idle notion comes to me to-day, when from the street-window I look on the slow stream of human life creeping past, night and morning, to the great mills. Masses of men, with dull, besotted faces bent to the ground, sharpened here and there by pain or cunning; skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes; stooping all night over boiling caldrons of metal, laired by day in dens of drunkenness and infamy; breathing from infancy to death an air saturated with fog and grease and soot, vileness for soul and body. What do you make of a case like that, amateur psychologist? You call it an altogether serious thing to be alive: to these men it is a drunken jest, a joke,\u2014horrible to angels perhaps, to them commonplace enough. My fancy about the river was an idle one: it is no type of such a life. What if it be stagnant and slimy here? It knows that beyond there waits for it odorous sunlight, quaint old gardens, dusky with soft, green foliage of apple-trees, and flushing crimson with roses,\u2014air, and fields, and mountains. The future of the Welsh puddler passing just now is not so pleasant. To be stowed away, after his grimy work is done, in a hole in the muddy graveyard, and after that, not air, nor green fields, nor curious roses.\nCan you see how foggy the day is? As I stand here, idly tapping the windowpane, and looking out through the rain at the dirty back-yard and the coalboats below, fragments of an old story float up before me,\u2014a story of this house into which I happened to come to-day. You may think it a tiresome story enough, as foggy as the day, sharpened by no sudden flashes of pain or pleasure.\u2014I know: only the outline of a dull life, that long since, with thousands of dull lives like its own, was vainly lived and lost: thousands of them, massed, vile, slimy lives, like those of the torpid lizards in yonder stagnant water-butt.\u2014Lost? There is a curious point for you to settle, my friend, who study psychology in a lazy, dilettante way. Stop a moment. I am going to be honest. This is what I want you to do. I want you to hide your disgust, take no heed to your clean clothes, and come right down with me,\u2014here, into the thickest of the fog and mud and foul effluvia. I want you to hear this story. There is a secret down here, in this nightmare fog, that has lain dumb for centuries: I want to make it a real thing to you. You, Egoist, or Pantheist, or Arminian, busy in making straight paths for your feet on the hills, do not see it clearly,\u2014this terrible question which men here have gone mad and died trying to answer. I dare not put this secret into words. I told you it was dumb. These men, going by with drunken faces and brains full of unawakened power, do not ask it of Society or of God. Their lives ask it; their deaths ask it. There is no reply. I will tell you plainly that I have a great hope; and I bring it to you to be tested. It is this: that this terrible dumb question is its own reply; that it is not the sentence of death we think it, but, from the very extremity of its darkness, the most solemn prophecy which the world has known of the Hope to come. I dare make my meaning no clearer, but will only tell my story. It will, perhaps, seem to you as foul and dark as this thick vapor about us, and as pregnant with death; but if your eyes are free as mine are to look deeper, no perfume-tinted dawn will be so fair with promise of the day that shall surely come.\n\nMy story is very simple,\u2014Only what I remember of the life of one of these men,\u2014a furnace-tender in one of Kirby & John's rolling-mills,\u2014Hugh Wolfe. You know the mills? They took the great order for the lower Virginia railroads there last winter; run usually with about a thousand men. I cannot tell why I choose the half-forgotten story of this Wolfe more than that of myriads of these furnace-hands. Perhaps because there is a secret, underlying sympathy between that story and this day with its impure fog and thwarted sunshine,\u2014or perhaps simply for the reason that this house is the one where the Wolfes lived. There were the father and son,\u2014both hands, as I said, in one of Kirby & John's mills for making railroad-iron,\u2014and Deborah, their cousin, a picker in some of the cotton-mills. The house was rented then to half a dozen families. The Wolfes had two of the cellar-rooms. The old man, like many of the puddlers and feeders of the mills, was Welsh,\u2014had spent half of his life in the Cornish tin-mines. You may pick the Welsh emigrants, Cornish miners, out of the throng passing the windows, any day. They are a trifle more filthy; their muscles are not so brawny; they stoop more. When they are drunk, they neither yell, nor shout, nor stagger, but skulk along like beaten hounds. A pure, unmixed blood, I fancy: shows itself in the slight angular bodies and sharply-cut facial lines. It is nearly thirty years since the Wolfes lived here. Their lives were like those of their class: incessant labor, sleeping in kennel-like rooms, eating rank pork and molasses, drinking\u2014God and the distillers only know what; with an occasional night in jail, to atone for some drunken excess. Is that all of their lives?\u2014of the portion given to them and these their duplicates swarming the streets to-day?\u2014nothing beneath?\u2014all? So many a political reformer will tell you,\u2014and many a private reformer, too, who has gone among them with a heart tender with Christ's charity, and come out outraged, hardened.\n\nOne rainy night, about eleven o'clock, a crowd of half-clothed women stopped outside of the cellar-door. They were going home from the cotton-mill.\n\"Good-night, Deb,\" said one, a mulatto, steadying herself against the gas-post. She needed the post to steady her. So did more than one of them.\n\"Dah's a ball to Miss Potts' to-night. Ye'd best come.\"\n\"Inteet, Deb, if hur'll come, hur'll hef fun,\" said a shrill Welsh voice in the crowd.\nTwo or three dirty hands were thrust out to catch the gown of the woman, who was groping for the latch of the door.\n\"No.\"\n\"No? Where's Kit Small, then?\"\n\"Begorra! on the spools. Alleys behint, though we helped her, we dud. An wid ye! Let Deb alone! It's ondacent frettin' a quite body. Be the powers, an we'll have a night of it! there'll be lashin's o' drink,\u2014the Vargent be blessed and praised for't!\"\nThey went on, the mulatto inclining for a moment to show fight, and drag the woman Wolfe off with them; but, being pacified, she staggered away.\n\nDeborah groped her way into the cellar, and, after considerable stumbling, kindled a match, and lighted a tallow dip, that sent a yellow glimmer over the room. It was low, damp,\u2014the earthen floor covered with a green, slimy moss,\u2014a fetid air smothering the breath. Old Wolfe lay asleep on a heap of straw, wrapped in a torn horse-blanket. He was a pale, meek little man, with a white face and red rabbit-eyes. The woman Deborah was like him; only her face was even more ghastly, her lips bluer, her eyes more watery. She wore a faded cotton gown and a slouching bonnet. When she walked, one could see that she was deformed, almost a hunchback. She trod softly, so as not to waken him, and went through into the room beyond. There she found by the half-extinguished fire an iron saucepan filled with cold boiled potatoes, which she put upon a broken chair with a pint-cup of ale. Placing the old candlestick beside this dainty repast, she untied her bonnet, which hung limp and wet over her face, and prepared to eat her supper. It was the first food that had touched her lips since morning. There was enough of it, however: there is not always. She was hungry,\u2014one could see that easily enough,\u2014and not drunk, as most of her companions would have been found at this hour. She did not drink, this woman,\u2014her face told that, too,\u2014nothing stronger than ale. Perhaps the weak, flaccid wretch had some stimulant in her pale life to keep her up,\u2014some love or hope, it might be, or urgent need. When that stimulant was gone, she would take to whiskey. Man cannot live by work alone. While she was skinning the potatoes, and munching them, a noise behind her made her stop.\n\n\"Janey!\" she called, lifting the candle and peering into the darkness. \"Janey, are you there?\"\nA heap of ragged coats was heaved up, and the face of a young girl emerged, staring sleepily at the woman.\n\"Deborah,\" she said, at last, \"I'm here the night.\"\n\"Yes, child. Hur's welcome,\" she said, quietly eating on.\nThe girl's face was haggard and sickly; her eyes were heavy with sleep and hunger: real Milesian eyes they were, dark, delicate blue, glooming out from black shadows with a pitiful fright.\n\"I was alone,\" she said, timidly.\n\"Where's the father?\" asked Deborah, holding out a potato, which the girl greedily seized.\n\"He's beyant,\u2014wid Haley,\u2014in the stone house.\" (Did you ever hear the word tail from an Irish mouth?) \"I came here. Hugh told me never to stay me-lone.\"\n\"Hugh?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nA vexed frown crossed her face. The girl saw it, and added quickly,\u2014\n\"I have not seen Hugh the day, Deb. The old man says his watch lasts till the mornin'.\"\nThe woman sprang up, and hastily began to arrange some bread and flitch in a tin pail, and to pour her own measure of ale into a bottle. Tying on her bonnet, she blew out the candle.\n\"Lay ye down, Janey dear,\" she said, gently, covering her with the old rags. \"Hur can eat the potatoes, if hur's hungry.\n\"Where are ye goin', Deb? The rain's sharp.\"\n\"To the mill, with Hugh's supper.\"\n\"Let him bide till th' morn. Sit ye down.\"\n\"No, no,\"\u2014sharply pushing her off. \"The boy'll starve.\"\nShe hurried from the cellar, while the child wearily coiled herself up for sleep. The rain was falling heavily, as the woman, pail in hand, emerged from the mouth of the alley, and turned down the narrow street, that stretched out, long and black, miles before her. Here and there a flicker of gas lighted an uncertain space of muddy footwalk and gutter; the long rows of houses, except an occasional lager-bier shop, were closed; now and then she met a band of millhands skulking to or from their work.\n\nNot many even of the inhabitants of a manufacturing town know the vast machinery of system by which the bodies of workmen are governed, that goes on unceasingly from year to year. The hands of each mill are divided into watches that relieve each other as regularly as the sentinels of an army. By night and day the work goes on, the unsleeping engines groan and shriek, the fiery pools of metal boil and surge. Only for a day in the week, in half-courtesy to public censure, the fires are partially veiled; but as soon as the clock strikes midnight, the great furnaces break forth with renewed fury, the clamor begins with fresh, breathless vigor, the engines sob and shriek like \"gods in pain.\"\n\nAs Deborah hurried down through the heavy rain, the noise of these thousand engines sounded through the sleep and shadow of the city like far-off thunder. The mill to which she was going lay on the river, a mile below the city-limits. It was far, and she was weak, aching from standing twelve hours at the spools. Yet it was her almost nightly walk to take this man his supper, though at every square she sat down to rest, and she knew she should receive small word of thanks.\n\nPerhaps, if she had possessed an artist's eye, the picturesque oddity of the scene might have made her step stagger less, and the path seem shorter; but to her the mills were only \"summat deilish to look at by night.\"\n\nThe road leading to the mills had been quarried from the solid rock, which rose abrupt and bare on one side of the cinder-covered road, while the river, sluggish and black, crept past on the other. The mills for rolling iron are simply immense tent-like roofs, covering acres of ground, open on every side. Beneath these roofs Deborah looked in on a city of fires, that burned hot and fiercely in the night. Fire in every horrible form: pits of flame waving in the wind; liquid metal-flames writhing in tortuous streams through the sand; wide caldrons filled with boiling fire, over which bent ghastly wretches stirring the strange brewing; and through all, crowds of half-clad men, looking like revengeful ghosts in the red light, hurried, throwing masses of glittering fire. It was like a street in Hell. Even Deborah muttered, as she crept through, \"looks like t' Devil's place!\" It did,\u2014in more ways than one.\n\nShe found the man she was looking for, at last, heaping coal on a furnace. He had not time to eat his supper; so she went behind the furnace, and waited. Only a few men were with him, and they noticed her only by a \"Hyur comes t'hunchback, Wolfe.\"\n\nDeborah was stupid with sleep; her back pained her sharply; and her teeth chattered with cold, with the rain that soaked her clothes and dripped from her at every step. She stood, however, patiently holding the pail, and waiting.\n\n\"Hout, woman! ye look like a drowned cat. Come near to the fire,\"\u2014said one of the men, approaching to scrape away the ashes.\nShe shook her head. Wolfe had forgotten her. He turned, hearing the man, and came closer.\n\"I did no' think; gi' me my supper, woman.\"\nShe watched him eat with a painful eagerness. With a woman's quick instinct, she saw that he was not hungry,\u2014was eating to please her. Her pale, watery eyes began to gather a strange light.\n\"Is't good, Hugh? T' ale was a bit sour, I feared.\"\n\"No, good enough.\" He hesitated a moment. \"Ye're tired, poor lass! Bide here till I go. Lay down there on that heap of ash, and go to sleep.\"\nHe threw her an old coat for a pillow, and turned to his work. The heap was the refuse of the burnt iron, and was not a hard bed; the half-smothered warmth, too, penetrated her limbs, dulling their pain and cold shiver.\n\nMiserable enough she looked, lying there on the ashes like a limp, dirty rag,\u2014yet not an unfitting figure to crown the scene of hopeless discomfort and veiled crime: more fitting, if one looked deeper into the heart of things, at her thwarted woman's form, her colorless life, her waking stupor that smothered pain and hunger,\u2014even more fit to be a type of her class. Deeper yet if one could look, was there nothing worth reading in this wet, faded thing, halfcovered with ashes? no story of a soul filled with groping passionate love, heroic unselfishness, fierce jealousy? of years of weary trying to please the one human being whom she loved, to gain one look of real heart-kindness from him? If anything like this were hidden beneath the pale, bleared eyes, and dull, washed-out-looking face, no one had ever taken the trouble to read its faint signs: not the half-clothed furnace-tender, Wolfe, certainly. Yet he was kind to her: it was his nature to be kind, even to the very rats that swarmed in the cellar: kind to her in just the same way. She knew that. And it might be that very knowledge had given to her face its apathy and vacancy more than her low, torpid life. One sees that dead, vacant look steal sometimes over the rarest, finest of women's faces,\u2014in the very midst, it may be, of their warmest summer's day; and then one can guess at the secret of intolerable solitude that lies hid beneath the delicate laces and brilliant smile. There was no warmth, no brilliancy, no summer for this woman; so the stupor and vacancy had time to gnaw into her face perpetually. She was young, too, though no one guessed it; so the gnawing was the fiercer.\n\nShe lay quiet in the dark corner, listening, through the monotonous din and uncertain glare of the works, to the dull plash of the rain in the far distance, shrinking back whenever the man Wolfe happened to look towards her. She knew, in spite of all his kindness, that there was that in her face and form which made him loathe the sight of her. She felt by instinct, although she could not comprehend it, the finer nature of the man, which made him among his fellow-workmen something unique, set apart. She knew, that, down under all the vileness and coarseness of his life, there was a groping passion for whatever was beautiful and pure, that his soul sickened with disgust at her deformity, even when his words were kindest. Through this dull consciousness, which never left her, came, like a sting, the recollection of the dark blue eyes and lithe figure of the little Irish girl she had left in the cellar. The recollection struck through even her stupid intellect with a vivid glow of beauty and of grace. Little Janey, timid, helpless, clinging to Hugh as her only friend: that was the sharp thought, the bitter thought, that drove into the glazed eyes a fierce light of pain. You laugh at it? Are pain and jealousy less savage realities down here in this place I am taking you to than in your own house or your own heart,\u2014your heart, which they clutch at sometimes? The note is the same, I fancy, be the octave high or low.\nIf you could go into this mill where Deborah lay, and drag out from the hearts of these men the terrible tragedy of their lives, taking it as a symptom of the disease of their class, no ghost Horror would terrify you more. A reality of soul-starvation, of living death, that meets you every day under the besotted faces on the street,\u2014I can paint nothing of this, only give you the outside outlines of a night, a crisis in the life of one man: whatever muddy depth of soul-history lies beneath you can read according to the eyes God has given you.\nWolfe, while Deborah watched him as a spaniel its master, bent over the furnace with his iron pole, unconscious of her scrutiny, only stopping to receive orders. Physically, Nature had promised the man but little. He had already lost the strength and instinct vigor of a man, his muscles were thin, his nerves weak, his face ( a meek, woman's face) haggard, yellow with consumption. In the mill he was known as one of the girl-men: \"Molly Wolfe\" was his sobriquet. He was never seen in the cockpit, did not own a terrier, drank but seldom; when he did, desperately. He fought sometimes, but was always thrashed, pommelled to a jelly. The man was game enough, when his blood was up: but he was no favorite in the mill; he had the taint of school-learning on him,\u2014not to a dangerous extent, only a quarter or so in the free-school in fact, but enough to ruin him as a good hand in a fight.\nFor other reasons, too, he was not popular. Not one of themselves, they felt that, though outwardly as filthy and ash-covered; silent, with foreign thoughts and longings breaking out through his quietness in innumerable curious ways: this one, for instance. In the neighboring furnace-buildings lay great heaps of the refuse from the ore after the pig-metal is run. Korl we call it here: a light, porous substance, of a delicate, waxen, flesh-colored tinge. Out of the blocks of this korl, Wolfe, in his off-hours from the furnace, had a habit of chipping and moulding figures,\u2014hideous, fantastic enough, but sometimes strangely beautiful: even the mill-men saw that, while they jeered at him. It was a curious fancy in the man, almost a passion. The few hours for rest he spent hewing and hacking with his blunt knife, never speaking, until his watch came again,\u2014working at one figure for months, and, when it was finished, breaking it to pieces perhaps, in a fit of disappointment. A morbid, gloomy man, untaught, unled, left to feed his soul in grossness and crime, and hard, grinding labor.\nI want you to come down and look at this Wolfe, standing there among the lowest of his kind, and see him just as he is, that you may judge him justly when you hear the story of this night. I want you to look back, as he does every day, at his birth in vice, his starved infancy; to remember the heavy years he has groped through as boy and man,\u2014the slow, heavy years of constant, hot work. So long ago he began, that he thinks sometimes he has worked there for ages. There is no hope that it will ever end. Think that God put into this man's soul a fierce thirst for beauty,\u2014to know it, to create it; to be\u2014something, he knows not what,\u2014other than he is. There are moments when a passing cloud, the sun glinting on the purple thistles, a kindly smile, a child's face, will rouse him to a passion of pain,\u2014when his nature starts up with a mad cry of rage against God, man, whoever it is that has forced this vile, slimy life upon him. With all this groping, this mad desire, a great blind intellect stumbling through wrong, a loving poet's heart, the man was by habit only a coarse, vulgar laborer, familiar with sights and words you would blush to name. Be just: when I tell you about this night, see him as he is. Be just,\u2014not like man's law, which seizes on one isolated fact, but like God's judging angel, whose clear, sad eye saw all the countless cankering days of this man's life, all the countless nights, when, sick with starving, his soul fainted in him, before it judged him for this night, the saddest of all.\nI called this night the crisis of his life. If it was, it stole on him unawares. These great turning-days of life cast no shadow before, slip by unconsciously. Only a trifle, a little turn of the rudder, and the ship goes to heaven or hell.\nWolfe, while Deborah watched him, dug into the furnace of melting iron with his pole, dully thinking only how many rails the lump would yield. It was late,\u2014nearly Sunday morning; another hour, and the heavy work would be done, only the furnaces to replenish and cover for the next day. The workmen were growing more noisy, shouting, as they had to do, to be heard over the deep clamor of the mills. Suddenly they grew less boisterous,\u2014at the far end, entirely silent. Something unusual had happened. After a moment, the silence came nearer; the men stopped their jeers and drunken choruses. Deborah, stupidly lifting up her head, saw the cause of the quiet. A group of five or six men were slowly approaching, stopping to examine each furnace as they came. Visitors often came to see the mills after night: except by growing less noisy, the men took no notice of them. The furnace where Wolfe worked was near the bounds of the works; they halted there hot and tired: a walk over one of these great foundries is no trifling task. The woman, drawing out of sight, turned over to sleep. Wolfe, seeing them stop, suddenly roused from his indifferent stupor, and watched them keenly. He knew some of them: the overseer, Clarke,\u2014a son of Kirby, one of the mill-owners,\u2014and a Doctor May, one of the town-physicians. The other two were strangers. Wolfe came closer. He seized eagerly every chance that brought him into contact with this mysterious class that shone down on him perpetually with the glamour of another order of being. What made the difference between them? That was the mystery of his life. He had a vague notion that perhaps to-night he could find it out. One of the strangers sat down on a pile of bricks, and beckoned young Kirby to his side.\n\"This is hot, with a vengeance. A match, please?\"\u2014lighting his cigar. \"But the walk is worth the trouble. If it were not that you must have heard it so often, Kirby, I would tell you that your works look like Dante's Inferno.\"\nKirby laughed.\n\"Yes. Yonder is Farinata himself in the burning tomb,\"\u2014pointing to some figure in the shimmering shadows.\n\"Judging from some of the faces of your men,\" said the other, \"they bid fair to try the reality of Dante's vision, some day.\"\nYoung Kirby looked curiously around, as if seeing the faces of his hands for the first time.\n\"They're bad enough, that's true. A desperate set, I fancy. Eh, Clarke?\"\nThe overseer did not hear him. He was talking of net profits just then,\u2014giving, in fact, a schedule of the annual business of the firm to a sharp peering little Yankee, who jotted down notes on a paper laid on the crown of his hat: a reporter for one of the city-papers, getting up a series of reviews of the leading manufactories. The other gentlemen had accompanied them merely for amusement. They were silent until the notes were finished, drying their feet at the furnaces, and sheltering their faces from the intolerable heat. At last the overseer concluded with\u2014\n\"I believe that is a pretty fair estimate, Captain.\"\n\"Here, some of you men!\" said Kirby, \"bring up those boards. We may as well sit down, gentlemen, until the rain is over. It cannot last much longer at this rate.\"\n\"Pig-metal,\"\u2014mumbled the reporter,\u2014\"um! coal facilities,\u2014um! hands employed, twelve hundred,\u2014bitumen,\u2014um!\u2014all right, I believe, Mr. Clarke;\u2014sinking-fund,\u2014what did you say was your sinking-fund?\"\n\"Twelve hundred hands?\" said the stranger, the young man who had first spoken. \"Do you control their votes, Kirby?\"\n\"Control? No.\" The young man smiled complacently. \"But my father brought seven hundred votes to the polls for his candidate last November. No force-work, you understand,\u2014only a speech or two, a hint to form themselves into a society, and a bit of red and blue bunting to make them a flag. The Invincible Roughs,\u2014I believe that is their name. I forget the motto: 'Our country's hope,' I think.\"\nThere was a laugh. The young man talking to Kirby sat with an amused light in his cool gray eye, surveying critically the half-clothed figures of the puddlers, and the slow swing of their brawny muscles. He was a stranger in the city,\u2014spending a couple of months in the borders of a Slave State, to study the institutions of the South,\u2014a brother-in-law of Kirby's,\u2014Mitchell. He was an amateur gymnast,\u2014hence his anatomical eye; a patron, in a blase' way, of the prize-ring; a man who sucked the essence out of a science or philosophy in an indifferent, gentlemanly way; who took Kant, Novalis, Humboldt, for what they were worth in his own scales; accepting all, despising nothing, in heaven, earth, or hell, but one-idead men; with a temper yielding and brilliant as summer water, until his Self was touched, when it was ice, though brilliant still. Such men are not rare in the States.\nAs he knocked the ashes from his cigar, Wolfe caught with a quick pleasure the contour of the white hand, the blood-glow of a red ring he wore. His voice, too, and that of Kirby's, touched him like music,\u2014low, even, with chording cadences. About this man Mitchell hung the impalpable atmosphere belonging to the thoroughbred gentleman, Wolfe, scraping away the ashes beside him, was conscious of it, did obeisance to it with his artist sense, unconscious that he did so.\nThe rain did not cease. Clarke and the reporter left the mills; the others, comfortably seated near the furnace, lingered, smoking and talking in a desultory way. Greek would not have been more unintelligible to the furnace-tenders, whose presence they soon forgot entirely. Kirby drew out a newspaper from his pocket and read aloud some article, which they discussed eagerly. At every sentence, Wolfe listened more and more like a dumb, hopeless animal, with a duller, more stolid look creeping over his face, glancing now and then at Mitchell, marking acutely every smallest sign of refinement, then back to himself, seeing as in a mirror his filthy body, his more stained soul.\nNever! He had no words for such a thought, but he knew now, in all the sharpness of the bitter certainty, that between them there was a great gulf never to be passed. Never!\nThe bell of the mills rang for midnight. Sunday morning had dawned. Whatever hidden message lay in the tolling bells floated past these men unknown. Yet it was there. Veiled in the solemn music ushering the risen Saviour was a key-note to solve the darkest secrets of a world gone wrong,\u2014even this social riddle which the brain of the grimy puddler grappled with madly to-night.\nThe men began to withdraw the metal from the caldrons. The mills were deserted on Sundays, except by the hands who fed the fires, and those who had no lodgings and slept usually on the ash-heaps. The three strangers sat still during the next hour, watching the men cover the furnaces, laughing now and then at some jest of Kirby's.\n\"Do you know,\" said Mitchell, \"I like this view of the works better than when the glare was fiercest? These heavy shadows and the amphitheatre of smothered fires are ghostly, unreal. One could fancy these red smouldering lights to be the half-shut eyes of wild beasts, and the spectral figures their victims in the den.\"\nKirby laughed. \"You are fanciful. Come, let us get out of the den. The spectral figures, as you call them, are a little too real for me to fancy a close proximity in the darkness,\u2014unarmed, too.\"\nThe others rose, buttoning their overcoats, and lighting cigars.\n\"Raining, still,\" said Doctor May, \"and hard. Where did we leave the coach, Mitchell?\"\n\"At the other side of the works.\u2014Kirby, what's that?\"\nMitchell started back, half-frightened, as, suddenly turning a corner, the white figure of a woman faced him in the darkness,\u2014a woman, white, of giant proportions, crouching on the ground, her arms flung out in some wild gesture of warning.\n\"Stop! Make that fire burn there!\" cried Kirby, stopping short.\nThe flame burst out, flashing the gaunt figure into bold relief.\nMitchell drew a long breath.\n\"I thought it was alive,\" he said, going up curiously.\nThe others followed.\n\"Not marble, eh?\" asked Kirby, touching it.\nOne of the lower overseers stopped.\n\"Korl, Sir.\"\n\"Who did it?\"\n\"Can't say. Some of the hands; chipped it out in off-hours.\"\n\"Chipped to some purpose, I should say. What a flesh-tint the stuff has! Do you see, Mitchell?\"\n\"I see.\"\nHe had stepped aside where the light fell boldest on the figure, looking at it in silence. There was not one line of beauty or grace in it: a nude woman's form, muscular, grown coarse with labor, the powerful limbs instinct with some one poignant longing. One idea: there it was in the tense, rigid muscles, the clutching hands, the wild, eager face, like that of a starving wolf's. Kirby and Doctor May walked around it, critical, curious. Mitchell stood aloof, silent. The figure touched him strangely.\n\"Not badly done,\" said Doctor May, \"Where did the fellow learn that sweep of the muscles in the arm and hand? Look at them! They are groping, do you see?\u2014clutching: the peculiar action of a man dying of thirst.\"\n\"They have ample facilities for studying anatomy,\" sneered Kirby, glancing at the half-naked figures.\n\"Look,\" continued the Doctor, \"at this bony wrist, and the strained sinews of the instep! A working-woman,\u2014the very type of her class.\"\n\"God forbid!\" muttered Mitchell.\n\"Why?\" demanded May, \"What does the fellow intend by the figure? I cannot catch the meaning.\"\n\"Ask him,\" said the other, dryly, \"There he stands,\"\u2014pointing to Wolfe, who stood with a group of men, leaning on his ash-rake.\nThe Doctor beckoned him with the affable smile which kind-hearted men put on, when talking to these people.\n\"Mr. Mitchell has picked you out as the man who did this,\u2014I'm sure I don't know why. But what did you mean by it?\"\n\"She be hungry.\"\nWolfe's eyes answered Mitchell, not the Doctor.\n\"Oh-h! But what a mistake you have made, my fine fellow! You have given no sign of starvation to the body. It is strong,\u2014terribly strong. It has the mad, half-despairing gesture of drowning.\"\nWolfe stammered, glanced appealingly at Mitchell, who saw the soul of the thing, he knew. But the cool, probing eyes were turned on himself now,\u2014mocking, cruel, relentless.\n\"Not hungry for meat,\" the furnace-tender said at last.\n\"What then? Whiskey?\" jeered Kirby, with a coarse laugh.\nWolfe was silent a moment, thinking.\n\"I dunno,\" he said, with a bewildered look. \"It mebbe. Summat to make her live, I think,\u2014like you. Whiskey ull do it, in a way.\"\nThe young man laughed again. Mitchell flashed a look of disgust somewhere,\u2014not at Wolfe.\n\"May,\" he broke out impatiently, \"are you blind? Look at that woman's face! It asks questions of God, and says, 'I have a right to know,' Good God, how hungry it is!\"\nThey looked a moment; then May turned to the mill-owner:\u2014\n\"Have you many such hands as this? What are you going to do with them? Keep them at puddling iron?\"\nKirby shrugged his shoulders. Mitchell's look had irritated him.\n\"Ce n'est pas mon affaire. I have no fancy for nursing infant geniuses. I suppose there are some stray gleams of mind and soul among these wretches. The Lord will take care of his own; or else they can work out their own salvation. I have heard you call our American system a ladder which any man can scale. Do you doubt it? Or perhaps you want to banish all social ladders, and put us all on a flat table-land,\u2014eh, May?\"\nThe Doctor looked vexed, puzzled. Some terrible problem lay hid in this woman's face, and troubled these men. Kirby waited for an answer, and, receiving none, went on, warming with his subject.\n\"I tell you, there's something wrong that no talk of 'Liberte' or 'Egalite' will do away. If I had the making of men, these men who do the lowest part of the world's work should be machines,\u2014nothing more,\u2014hands. It would be kindness. God help them! What are taste, reason, to creatures who must live such lives as that?\" He pointed to Deborah, sleeping on the ash-heap. \"So many nerves to sting them to pain. What if God had put your brain, with all its agony of touch, into your fingers, and bid you work and strike with that?\"\n\"You think you could govern the world better?\" laughed the Doctor.\n\"I do not think at all.\"\n\"That is true philosophy. Drift with the stream, because you cannot dive deep enough to find bottom, eh?\"\n\"Exactly,\" rejoined Kirby. \"I do not think. I wash my hands of all social problems,\u2014slavery, caste, white or black. My duty to my operatives has a narrow limit,\u2014the pay-hour on Saturday night. Outside of that, if they cut korl, or cut each other's throats, (the more popular amusement of the two,) I am not responsible.\"\nThe Doctor sighed,\u2014a good honest sigh, from the depths of his stomach.\n\"God help us! Who is responsible?\"\n\"Not I, I tell you,\" said Kirby, testily. \"What has the man who pays them money to do with their souls' concerns, more than the grocer or butcher who takes it?\"\n\"And yet,\" said Mitchell's cynical voice, \"look at her! How hungry she is!\"\nKirby tapped his boot with his cane. No one spoke. Only the dumb face of the rough image looking into their faces with the awful question, \"What shall we do to be saved?\" Only Wolfe's face, with its heavy weight of brain, its weak, uncertain mouth, its desperate eyes, out of which looked the soul of his class,\u2014only Wolfe's face turned towards Kirby's. Mitchell laughed,\u2014a cool, musical laugh.\n\"Money has spoken!\" he said, seating himself lightly on a stone with the air of an amused spectator at a play. \"Are you answered?\"\u2014turning to Wolfe his clear, magnetic face.\nBright and deep and cold as Arctic air, the soul of the man lay tranquil beneath. He looked at the furnace-tender as he had looked at a rare mosaic in the morning; only the man was the more amusing study of the two.\n\"Are you answered? Why, May, look at him! 'De profundis clamavi.' Or, to quote in English, 'Hungry and thirsty, his soul faints in him.' And so Money sends back its answer into the depths through you, Kirby! Very clear the answer, too!\u2014I think I remember reading the same words somewhere: washing your hands in Eau de Cologne, and saying, 'I am innocent of the blood of this man. See ye to it!'\"\nKirby flushed angrily.\n\"You quote Scripture freely.\"\n\"Do I not quote correctly? I think I remember another line, which may amend my meaning? 'Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these, ye did it unto me.' Deist? Bless you, man, I was raised on the milk of the Word. Now, Doctor, the pocket of the world having uttered its voice, what has the heart to say? You are a philanthropist, in a small Way,\u2014n'est ce pas? Here, boy, this gentleman can show you how to cut korl better,\u2014or your destiny. Go on, May!\"\n\"I think a mocking devil possesses you to-night,\" rejoined the Doctor, seriously.\nHe went to Wolfe and put his hand kindly on his arm. Something of a vague idea possessed the Doctor's brain that much good was to be done here by a friendly word or two: a latent genius to be warmed into life by a waited-for sunbeam. Here it was: he had brought it. So he went on complacently:\n\"Do you know, boy, you have it in you to be a great sculptor, a great man? do you understand?\" (talking down to the capacity of his hearer: it is a way people have with children, and men like Wolfe,)\u2014\"to live a better, stronger life than I, or Mr. Kirby here? A man may make himself anything he chooses. God has given you stronger powers than many men,\u2014me, for instance.\"\nMay stopped, heated, glowing with his own magnanimity. And it was magnanimous. The puddler had drunk in every word, looking through the Doctor's flurry, and generous heat, and self-approval, into his will, with those slow, absorbing eyes of his.\n\"Make yourself what you will. It is your right.\n\"I know,\" quietly. \"Will you help me?\"\nMitchell laughed again. The Doctor turned now, in a passion,\u2014\n\"You know, Mitchell, I have not the means. You know, if I had, it is in my heart to take this boy and educate him for\"\u2014\n\"The glory of God, and the glory of John May.\"\nMay did not speak for a moment; then, controlled, he said,\u2014\n\"Why should one be raised, when myriads are left?\u2014I have not the money, boy,\" to Wolfe, shortly.\n\"Money?\" He said it over slowly, as one repeats the guessed answer to a riddle, doubtfully. \"That is it? Money?\"\n\"Yes, money,\u2014that is it,\" said Mitchell, rising, and drawing his furred coat about him. \"You've found the cure for all the world's diseases.\u2014Come, May, find your good-humor, and come home. This damp wind chills my very bones. Come and preach your Saint-Simonian doctrines' to-morrow to Kirby's hands. Let them have a clear idea of the rights of the soul, and I'll venture next week they'll strike for higher wages. That will be the end of it.\"\n\"Will you send the coach-driver to this side of the mills?\" asked Kirby, turning to Wolfe.\nHe spoke kindly: it was his habit to do so. Deborah, seeing the puddler go, crept after him. The three men waited outside. Doctor May walked up and down, chafed. Suddenly he stopped.\n\"Go back, Mitchell! You say the pocket and the heart of the world speak without meaning to these people. What has its head to say? Taste, culture, refinement? Go!\"\nMitchell was leaning against a brick wall. He turned his head indolently, and looked into the mills. There hung about the place a thick, unclean odor. The slightest motion of his hand marked that he perceived it, and his insufferable disgust. That was all. May said nothing, only quickened his angry tramp.\n\"Besides,\" added Mitchell, giving a corollary to his answer, \"it would be of no use. I am not one of them.\"\n\"You do not mean\"\u2014said May, facing him.\n\"Yes, I mean just that. Reform is born of need, not pity. No vital movement of the people's has worked down, for good or evil; fermented, instead, carried up the heaving, cloggy mass. Think back through history, and you will know it. What will this lowest deep\u2014thieves, Magdalens, negroes\u2014do with the light filtered through ponderous Church creeds, Baconian theories, Goethe schemes? Some day, out of their bitter need will be thrown up their own light-bringer,\u2014their Jean Paul, their Cromwell, their Messiah.\"\n\"Bah!\" was the Doctor's inward criticism. However, in practice, he adopted the theory; for, when, night and morning, afterwards, he prayed that power might be given these degraded souls to rise, he glowed at heart, recognizing an accomplished duty.\nWolfe and the woman had stood in the shadow of the works as the coach drove off. The Doctor had held out his hand in a frank, generous way, telling him to \"take care of himself, and to remember it was his right to rise.\" Mitchell had simply touched his hat, as to an equal, with a quiet look of thorough recognition. Kirby had thrown Deborah some money, which she found, and clutched eagerly enough. They were gone now, all of them. The man sat down on the cinder-road, looking up into the murky sky.\n\"'T be late, Hugh. Wunnot hur come?\"\nHe shook his head doggedly, and the woman crouched out of his sight against the wall. Do you remember rare moments when a sudden light flashed over yourself, your world, God? when you stood on a mountain-peak, seeing your life as it might have been, as it is? one quick instant, when custom lost its force and every-day usage? when your friend, wife, brother, stood in a new light? your soul was bared, and the grave,\u2014a foretaste of the nakedness of the Judgment-Day? So it came before him, his life, that night. The slow tides of pain he had borne gathered themselves up and surged against his soul. His squalid daily life, the brutal coarseness eating into his brain, as the ashes into his skin: before, these things had been a dull aching into his consciousness; to-night, they were reality. He griped the filthy red shirt that clung, stiff with soot, about him, and tore it savagely from his arm. The flesh beneath was muddy with grease and ashes,\u2014and the heart beneath that! And the soul? God knows.\nThen flashed before his vivid poetic sense the man who had left him,\u2014the pure face, the delicate, sinewy limbs, in harmony with all he knew of beauty or truth. In his cloudy fancy he had pictured a Something like this. He had found it in this Mitchell, even when he idly scoffed at his pain: a Man all-knowing, all-seeing, crowned by Nature, reigning,\u2014the keen glance of his eye falling like a sceptre on other men. And yet his instinct taught him that he too\u2014He! He looked at himself with sudden loathing, sick, wrung his hands With a cry, and then was silent. With all the phantoms of his heated, ignorant fancy, Wolfe had not been vague in his ambitions. They were practical, slowly built up before him out of his knowledge of what he could do. Through years he had day by day made this hope a real thing to himself,\u2014a clear, projected figure of himself, as he might become.\nAble to speak, to know what was best, to raise these men and women working at his side up with him: sometimes he forgot this defined hope in the frantic anguish to escape, only to escape,\u2014out of the wet, the pain, the ashes, somewhere, anywhere,\u2014only for one moment of free air on a hill-side, to lie down and let his sick soul throb itself out in the sunshine. But to-night he panted for life. The savage strength of his nature was roused; his cry was fierce to God for justice.\n\"Look at me!\" he said to Deborah, with a low, bitter laugh, striking his puny chest savagely. \"What am I worth, Deb? Is it my fault that I am no better? My fault? My fault?\"\nHe stopped, stung with a sudden remorse, seeing her hunchback shape writhing with sobs. For Deborah was crying thankless tears, according to the fashion of women.\n\"God forgi' me, woman! Things go harder Wi' you nor me. It's a worse share.\"\nHe got up and helped her to rise; and they went doggedly down the muddy street, side by side.\n\"It's all wrong,\" he muttered, slowly,\u2014\"all wrong! I dunnot understan'. But it'll end some day.\"\n\"Come home, Hugh!\" she said, coaxingly; for he had stopped, looking around bewildered.\n\"Home,\u2014and back to the mill!\" He went on saying this over to himself, as if he would mutter down every pain in this dull despair.\nShe followed him through the fog, her blue lips chattering with cold. They reached the cellar at last. Old Wolfe had been drinking since she went out, and had crept nearer the door. The girl Janey slept heavily in the corner. He went up to her, touching softly the worn white arm with his fingers. Some bitterer thought stung him, as he stood there. He wiped the drops from his forehead, and went into the room beyond, livid, trembling. A hope, trifling, perhaps, but very dear, had died just then out of the poor puddler's life, as he looked at the sleeping, innocent girl,\u2014some plan for the future, in which she had borne a part. He gave it up that moment, then and forever. Only a trifle, perhaps, to us: his face grew a shade paler,\u2014that was all. But, somehow, the man's soul, as God and the angels looked down on it, never was the same afterwards.\nDeborah followed him into the inner room. She carried a candle, which she placed on the floor, closing the door after her. She had seen the look on his face, as he turned away: her own grew deadly. Yet, as she came up to him, her eyes glowed. He was seated on an old chest, quiet, holding his face in his hands.\n\"Hugh!\" she said, softly.\nHe did not speak.\n\"Hugh, did hur hear what the man said,\u2014him with the clear voice? Did hur hear? Money, money,\u2014that it wud do all?\"\nHe pushed her away,\u2014gently, but he was worn out; her rasping tone fretted him.\n\"Hugh!\"\nThe candle flared a pale yellow light over the cobwebbed brick walls, and the woman standing there. He looked at her. She was young, in deadly earnest; her faded eyes, and wet, ragged figure caught from their frantic eagerness a power akin to beauty.\n\"Hugh, it is true! Money ull do it! Oh, Hugh, boy, listen till me! He said it true! It is money!\"\n\"I know. Go back! I do not want you here.\"\n\"Hugh, it is t' last time. I'll never worrit hur again.\"\nThere were tears in her voice now, but she choked them back:\n\"Hear till me only to-night! If one of t' witch people wud come, them we heard oft' home, and gif hur all hur wants, what then? Say, Hugh!\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I mean money.\"\nHer whisper shrilled through his brain.\n\"If one oft' witch dwarfs wud come from t' lane moors to-night, and gif hur money, to go out,\u2014OUT, I say,\u2014out, lad, where t' sun shines, and t' heath grows, and t' ladies walk in silken gownds, and God stays all t' time,\u2014where t'man lives that talked to us to-night, Hugh knows,\u2014Hugh could walk there like a king!\"\nHe thought the woman mad, tried to check her, but she went on, fierce in her eager haste.\n\"If I were t' witch dwarf, if I had t' money, wud hur thank me? Wud hur take me out o' this place wid hur and Janey? I wud not come into the gran' house hur wud build, to vex hur wid t' hunch,\u2014only at night, when t' shadows were dark, stand far off to see hur.\"\nMad? Yes! Are many of us mad in this way?\n\"Poor Deb! poor Deb!\" he said, soothingly.\n\"It is here,\" she said, suddenly, jerking into his hand a small roll. \"I took it! I did it! Me, me!\u2014not hur! I shall be hanged, I shall be burnt in hell, if anybody knows I took it! Out of his pocket, as he leaned against t' bricks. Hur knows?\"\nShe thrust it into his hand, and then, her errand done, began to gather chips together to make a fire, choking down hysteric sobs.\n\"Has it come to this?\"\nThat was all he said. The Welsh Wolfe blood was honest. The roll was a small green pocket-book containing one or two gold pieces, and a check for an incredible amount, as it seemed to the poor puddler. He laid it down, hiding his face again in his hands.\n\"Hugh, don't be angry wud me! It's only poor Deb,\u2014hur knows?\"\nHe took the long skinny fingers kindly in his.\n\"Angry? God help me, no! Let me sleep. I am tired.\"\nHe threw himself heavily down on the wooden bench, stunned with pain and weariness. She brought some old rags to cover him.\nIt was late on Sunday evening before he awoke. I tell God's truth, when I say he had then no thought of keeping this money. Deborah had hid it in his pocket. He found it there. She watched him eagerly, as he took it out.\n\"I must gif it to him,\" he said, reading her face.\n\"Hur knows,\" she said with a bitter sigh of disappointment. \"But it is hur right to keep it.\"\nHis right! The word struck him. Doctor May had used the same. He washed himself, and went out to find this man Mitchell. His right! Why did this chance word cling to him so obstinately? Do you hear the fierce devils whisper in his ear, as he went slowly down the darkening street?\nThe evening came on, slow and calm. He seated himself at the end of an alley leading into one of the larger streets. His brain was clear to-night, keen, intent, mastering. It would not start back, cowardly, from any hellish temptation, but meet it face to face. Therefore the great temptation of his life came to him veiled by no sophistry, but bold, defiant, owning its own vile name, trusting to one bold blow for victory.\nHe did not deceive himself. Theft! That was it. At first the word sickened him; then he grappled with it. Sitting there on a broken cart-wheel, the fading day, the noisy groups, the church-bells' tolling passed before him like a panorama, while the sharp struggle went on within. This money! He took it out, and looked at it. If he gave it back, what then? He was going to be cool about it.\nPeople going by to church saw only a sickly mill-boy watching them quietly at the alley's mouth. They did not know that he was mad, or they would not have gone by so quietly: mad with hunger; stretching out his hands to the world, that had given so much to them, for leave to live the life God meant him to live. His soul within him was smothering to death; he wanted so much, thought so much, and knew\u2014nothing. There was nothing of which he was certain, except the mill and things there. Of God and heaven he had heard so little, that they were to him what fairy-land is to a child: something real, but not here; very far off. His brain, greedy, dwarfed, full of thwarted energy and unused powers, questioned these men and women going by, coldly, bitterly, that night. Was it not his right to live as they,\u2014a pure life, a good, true-hearted life, full of beauty and kind words? He only wanted to know how to use the strength within him. His heart warmed, as he thought of it. He suffered himself to think of it longer. If he took the money?\nThen he saw himself as he might be, strong, helpful, kindly. The night crept on, as this one image slowly evolved itself from the crowd of other thoughts and stood triumphant. He looked at it. As he might be! What wonder, if it blinded him to delirium,\u2014the madness that underlies all revolution, all progress, and all fall?\nYou laugh at the shallow temptation? You see the error underlying its argument so clearly,\u2014that to him a true life was one of full development rather than self-restraint? that he was deaf to the higher tone in a cry of voluntary suffering for truth's sake than in the fullest flow of spontaneous harmony? I do not plead his cause. I only want to show you the mote in my brother's eye: then you can see clearly to take it out.\nThe money,\u2014there it lay on his knee, a little blotted slip of paper, nothing in itself; used to raise him out of the pit, something straight from God's hand. A thief! Well, what was it to be a thief? He met the question at last, face to face, wiping the clammy drops of sweat from his forehead. God made this money\u2014the fresh air, too\u2014for his children's use. He never made the difference between poor and rich. The Something who looked down on him that moment through the cool gray sky had a kindly face, he knew,\u2014loved his children alike. Oh, he knew that!\nThere were times when the soft floods of color in the crimson and purple flames, or the clear depth of amber in the water below the bridge, had somehow given him a glimpse of another world than this,\u2014of an infinite depth of beauty and of quiet somewhere,\u2014somewhere, a depth of quiet and rest and love. Looking up now, it became strangely real. The sun had sunk quite below the hills, but his last rays struck upward, touching the zenith. The fog had risen, and the town and river were steeped in its thick, gray damp; but overhead, the sun-touched smoke-clouds opened like a cleft ocean,\u2014shifting, rolling seas of crimson mist, waves of billowy silver veined with blood-scarlet, inner depths unfathomable of glancing light. Wolfe's artist-eye grew drunk with color. The gates of that other world! Fading, flashing before him now! What, in that world of Beauty, Content, and Right, were the petty laws, the mine and thine, of mill-owners and mill hands?\nA consciousness of power stirred within him. He stood up. A man,\u2014he thought, stretching out his hands,\u2014free to work, to live, to love! Free! His right! He folded the scrap of paper in his hand. As his nervous fingers took it in, limp and blotted, so his soul took in the mean temptation, lapped it in fancied rights, in dreams of improved existences, drifting and endless as the cloud-seas of color. Clutching it, as if the tightness of his hold would strengthen his sense of possession, he went aimlessly down the street. It was his watch at the mill. He need not go, need never go again, thank God!\u2014shaking off the thought with unspeakable loathing.\nShall I go over the history of the hours of that night? how the man wandered from one to another of his old haunts, with a half-consciousness of bidding them farewell,\u2014lanes and alleys and back-yards where the mill-hands lodged,\u2014noting, with a new eagerness, the filth and drunkenness, the pig-pens, the ash-heaps covered with potato-skins, the bloated, pimpled women at the doors, with a new disgust, a new sense of sudden triumph, and, under all, a new, vague dread, unknown before, smothered down, kept under, but still there? It left him but once during the night, when, for the second time in his life, he entered a church. It was a sombre Gothic pile, where the stained light lost itself in far-retreating arches; built to meet the requirements and sympathies of a far other class than Wolfe's. Yet it touched, moved him uncontrollably. The distances, the shadows, the still, marble figures, the mass of silent kneeling worshippers, the mysterious music, thrilled, lifted his soul with a wonderful pain. Wolfe forgot himself, forgot the new life he was going to live, the mean terror gnawing underneath. The voice of the speaker strengthened the charm; it was clear, feeling, full, strong. An old man, who had lived much, suffered much; whose brain was keenly alive, dominant; whose heart was summer-warm with charity. He taught it to-night. He held up Humanity in its grand total; showed the great world-cancer to his people. Who could show it better? He was a Christian reformer; he had studied the age thoroughly; his outlook at man had been free, world-wide, over all time. His faith stood sublime upon the Rock of Ages; his fiery zeal guided vast schemes by which the Gospel was to be preached to all nations. How did he preach it to-night? In burning, light-laden words he painted Jesus, the incarnate Life, Love, the universal Man: words that became reality in the lives of these people,\u2014that lived again in beautiful words and actions, trifling, but heroic. Sin, as he defined it, was a real foe to them; their trials, temptations, were his. His words passed far over the furnace-tender's grasp, toned to suit another class of culture; they sounded in his ears a very pleasant song in an unknown tongue. He meant to cure this world-cancer with a steady eye that had never glared with hunger, and a hand that neither poverty nor strychnine-whiskey had taught to shake. In this morbid, distorted heart of the Welsh puddler he had failed.\nEighteen centuries ago, the Master of this man tried reform in the streets of a city as crowded and vile as this, and did not fail. His disciple, showing Him to-night to cultured hearers, showing the clearness of the God-power acting through Him, shrank back from one coarse fact; that in birth and habit the man Christ was thrown up from the lowest of the people: his flesh, their flesh; their blood, his blood; tempted like them, to brutalize day by day; to lie, to steal: the actual slime and want of their hourly life, and the wine-press he trod alone.\nYet, is there no meaning in this perpetually covered truth? If the son of the carpenter had stood in the church that night, as he stood with the fishermen and harlots by the sea of Galilee, before His Father and their Father, despised and rejected of men, without a place to lay His head, wounded for their iniquities, bruised for their transgressions, would not that hungry mill-boy at least, in the back seat, have \"known the man\"? That Jesus did not stand there.\nWolfe rose at last, and turned from the church down the street. He looked up; the night had come on foggy, damp; the golden mists had vanished, and the sky lay dull and ash-colored. He wandered again aimlessly down the street, idly wondering what had become of the cloud-sea of crimson and scarlet. The trial-day of this man's life was over, and he had lost the victory. What followed was mere drifting circumstance,\u2014a quicker walking over the path,\u2014that was all. Do you want to hear the end of it? You wish me to make a tragic story out of it? Why, in the police-reports of the morning paper you can find a dozen such tragedies: hints of shipwrecks unlike any that ever befell on the high seas; hints that here a power was lost to heaven,\u2014that there a soul went down where no tide can ebb or flow. Commonplace enough the hints are,\u2014jocose sometimes, done up in rhyme.\nDoctor May a month after the night I have told you of, was reading to his wife at breakfast from this fourth column of the morning-paper: an unusual thing,\u2014these police-reports not being, in general, choice reading for ladies; but it was only one item he read.\n\"Oh, my dear! You remember that man I told you of, that we saw at Kirby's mill?\u2014that was arrested for robbing Mitchell? Here he is; just listen:\u2014'Circuit Court. Judge Day. Hugh Wolfe, operative in Kirby & John's Loudon Mills. Charge, grand larceny. Sentence, nineteen years hard labor in penitentiary. Scoundrel! Serves him right! After all our kindness that night! Picking Mitchell's pocket at the very time!\"\nHis wife said something about the ingratitude of that kind of people, and then they began to talk of something else.\nNineteen years! How easy that was to read! What a simple word for Judge Day to utter! Nineteen years! Half a lifetime!\nHugh Wolfe sat on the window-ledge of his cell, looking out. His ankles Were ironed. Not usual in such cases; but he had made two desperate efforts to escape. \"Well,\" as Haley, the jailer, said, \"small blame to him! Nineteen years' imprisonment was not a pleasant thing to look forward to.\" Haley was very good-natured about it, though Wolfe had fought him savagely.\n\"When he was first caught,\" the jailer said afterwards, in telling the story, \"before the trial, the fellow was cut down at once,\u2014laid there on that pallet like a dead man, with his hands over his eyes. Never saw a man so cut down in my life. Time of the trial, too, came the queerest dodge of any customer I ever had. Would choose no lawyer. Judge gave him one, of course. Gibson it Was. He tried to prove the fellow crazy; but it wouldn't go. Thing was plain as daylight: money found on him. 'T was a hard sentence,\u2014all the law allows; but it was for 'xample's sake. These mill-hands are gettin' onbearable. When the sentence was read, he just looked up, and said the money was his by rights, and that all the world had gone wrong. That night, after the trial, a gentleman came to see him here, name of Mitchell,\u2014him as he stole from. Talked to him for an hour. Thought he came for curiosity, like. After he was gone, thought Wolfe was remarkable quiet, and went into his cell. Found him very low; bed all bloody. Doctor said he had been bleeding at the lungs. He was as weak as a cat; yet if ye'll b'lieve me, he tried to get a-past me and get out. I just carried him like a baby, and threw him on the pallet. Three days after, he tried it again: that time reached the wall. Lord help you! he fought like a tiger,\u2014giv' some terrible blows. Fightin' for life, you see; for he can't live long, shut up in the stone crib down yonder. Got a death-cough now. 'T took two of us to bring him down that day; so I just put the irons on his feet. There he sits, in there. Goin' to-morrow, with a batch more of 'em. That woman, hunchback, tried with him,\u2014you remember?\u2014she's only got three years. 'Complice. But she's a woman, you know. He's been quiet ever since I put on irons: giv' up, I suppose. Looks white, sick-lookin'. It acts different on 'em, bein' sentenced. Most of 'em gets reckless, devilish-like. Some prays awful, and sings them vile songs of the mills, all in a breath. That woman, now, she's desper't'. Been beggin' to see Hugh, as she calls him, for three days. I'm a-goin' to let her in. She don't go with him. Here she is in this next cell. I'm a-goin' now to let her in.\"\nHe let her in. Wolfe did not see her. She crept into a corner of the cell, and stood watching him. He was scratching the iron bars of the window with a piece of tin which he had picked up, with an idle, uncertain, vacant stare, just as a child or idiot would do.\n\"Tryin' to get out, old boy?\" laughed Haley. \"Them irons will need a crow-bar beside your tin, before you can open 'em.\"\nWolfe laughed, too, in a senseless way.\n\"I think I'll get out,\" he said.\n\"I believe his brain's touched,\" said Haley, when he came out.\nThe puddler scraped away with the tin for half an hour. Still Deborah did not speak. At last she ventured nearer, and touched his arm.\n\"Blood?\" she said, looking at some spots on his coat with a shudder.\nHe looked up at her, \"Why, Deb!\" he said, smiling,\u2014such a bright, boyish smile, that it Went to poor Deborah's heart directly, and she sobbed and cried out loud.\n\"Oh, Hugh, lad! Hugh! dunnot look at me, when it wur my fault! To think I brought hur to it! And I loved hur so! Oh lad, I dud!\"\nThe confession, even In this wretch, came with the woman's blush through the sharp cry.\nHe did not seem to hear her,\u2014scraping away diligently at the bars with the bit of tin.\nWas he going mad? She peered closely into his face. Something she saw there made her draw suddenly back,\u2014something which Haley had not seen, that lay beneath the pinched, vacant look it had caught since the trial, or the curious gray shadow that rested on it. That gray shadow,\u2014yes, she knew what that meant. She had often seen it creeping over women's faces for months, who died at last of slow hunger or consumption. That meant death, distant, lingering: but this\u2014Whatever it was the woman saw, or thought she saw, used as she was to crime and misery, seemed to make her sick with a new horror. Forgetting her fear of him, she caught his shoulders, and looked keenly, steadily, into his eyes.\n\"Hugh!\" she cried, in a desperate whisper,\u2014\"oh, boy, not that! for God's sake, not that!\"\nThe vacant laugh went off his face, and he answered her in a muttered word or two that drove her away. Yet the words were kindly enough. Sitting there on his pallet, she cried silently a hopeless sort of tears, but did not speak again. The man looked up furtively at her now and then. Whatever his own trouble was, her distress vexed him with a momentary sting.\nIt was market-day. The narrow window of the jail looked down directly on the carts and wagons drawn up in a long line, where they had unloaded. He could see, too, and hear distinctly the clink of money as it changed hands, the busy crowd of whites and blacks shoving, pushing one another, and the chaffering and swearing at the stalls. Somehow, the sound, more than anything else had done, wakened him up,\u2014made the whole real to him. He was done with the world and the business of it. He let the tin fall, and looked out, pressing his face close to the rusty bars. How they crowded and pushed! And he,\u2014he should never walk that pavement again! There came Neff Sanders, one of the feeders at the mill, with a basket on his arm. Sure enough, Nyeff was married the other week. He whistled, hoping he would look up; but he did not. He wondered if Neff remembered he was there,\u2014if any of the boys thought of him up there, and thought that he never was to go down that old cinder-road again. Never again! He had not quite understood it before; but now he did. Not for days or years, but never!\u2014that was it.\nHow clear the light fell on that stall in front of the market! and how like a picture it was, the dark-green heaps of corn, and the crimson beets, and golden melons! There was another with game: how the light flickered on that pheasant's breast, with the purplish blood dripping over the brown feathers! He could see the red shining of the drops, it was so near. In one minute he could be down there. It was just a step. So easy, as it seemed, so natural to go! Yet it could never be\u2014not in all the thousands of years to come\u2014that he should put his foot on that street again! He thought of himself with a sorrowful pity, as of some one else. There was a dog down in the market, walking after his master with such a stately, grave look!\u2014only a dog, yet he could go backwards and forwards just as he pleased: he had good luck! Why, the very vilest cur, yelping there in the gutter, had not lived his life, had been free to act out whatever thought God had put into his brain; while he\u2014No, he would not think of that! He tried to put the thought away, and to listen to a dispute between a countryman and a woman about some meat; but it would come back. He, what had he done to bear this?\nThen came the sudden picture of what might have been, and now. He knew what it was to be in the penitentiary, how it went with men there. He knew how in these long years he should slowly die, but not until soul and body had become corrupt and rotten,\u2014how, when he came out, if he lived to come, even the lowest of the mill-hands would jeer him,\u2014how his hands would be weak, and his brain senseless and stupid. He believed he was almost that now. He put his hand to his head, with a puzzled, weary look. It ached, his head, with thinking. He tried to quiet himself. It was only right, perhaps; he had done wrong. But was there right or wrong for such as he? What was right? And who had ever taught him? He thrust the whole matter away. A dark, cold quiet crept through his brain. It was all wrong; but let it be! It was nothing to him more than the others. Let it be!\nThe door grated, as Haley opened it.\n\"Come, my woman! Must lock up for t' night. Come, stir yerself!\"\nShe went up and took Hugh's hand.\n\"Good-night, Deb,\" he said, carelessly.\nShe had not hoped he would say more; but the tired pain on her mouth just then was bitterer than death. She took his passive hand and kissed it.\n\"Hur'll never see Deb again!\" she ventured, her lips growing colder and more bloodless.\nWhat did she say that for? Did he not know it? Yet he would not be impatient with poor old Deb. She had trouble of her own, as well as he.\n\"No, never again,\" he said, trying to be cheerful.\nShe stood just a moment, looking at him. Do you laugh at her, standing there, with her hunchback, her rags, her bleared, withered face, and the great despised love tugging at her heart?\n\"Come, you!\" called Haley, impatiently.\nShe did not move.\n\"Hugh!\" she whispered.\nIt was to be her last word. What was it?\n\"Hugh, boy, not THAT!\"\nHe did not answer. She wrung her hands, trying to be silent, looking in his face in an agony of entreaty. He smiled again, kindly.\n\"It is best, Deb. I cannot bear to be hurted any more.\n\"Hur knows,\" she said, humbly.\n\"Tell my father good-bye; and\u2014and kiss little Janey.\"\nShe nodded, saying nothing, looked in his face again, and went out of the door. As she went, she staggered.\n\"Drinkin' to-day?\" broke out Haley, pushing her before him. \"Where the Devil did you get it? Here, in with ye!\" and he shoved her into her cell, next to Wolfe's, and shut the door.\nAlong the wall of her cell there was a crack low down by the floor, through which she could see the light from Wolfe's. She had discovered it days before. She hurried in now, and, kneeling down by it, listened, hoping to hear some sound. Nothing but the rasping of the tin on the bars. He was at his old amusement again. Something in the noise jarred on her ear, for she shivered as she heard it. Hugh rasped away at the bars. A dull old bit of tin, not fit to cut korl with.\nHe looked out of the window again. People were leaving the market now. A tall mulatto girl, following her mistress, her basket on her head, crossed the street just below, and looked up. She was laughing; but, when she caught sight of the haggard face peering out through the bars, suddenly grew grave, and hurried by. A free, firm step, a clear-cut olive face, with a scarlet turban tied on one side, dark, shining eyes, and on the head the basket poised, filled with fruit and flowers, under which the scarlet turban and bright eyes looked out half-shadowed. The picture caught his eye. It was good to see a face like that. He would try to-morrow, and cut one like it. To-morrow! He threw down the tin, trembling, and covered his face with his hands. When he looked up again, the daylight was gone.\nDeborah, crouching near by on the other side of the wall, heard no noise. He sat on the side of the low pallet, thinking. Whatever was the mystery which the woman had seen on his face, it came out now slowly, in the dark there, and became fixed,\u2014a something never seen on his face before. The evening was darkening fast. The market had been over for an hour; the rumbling of the carts over the pavement grew more infrequent: he listened to each, as it passed, because he thought it was to be for the last time. For the same reason, it was, I suppose, that he strained his eyes to catch a glimpse of each passer-by, wondering who they were, what kind of homes they were going to, if they had children,\u2014listening eagerly to every chance word in the street, as if\u2014(God be merciful to the man! what strange fancy was this?)\u2014as if he never should hear human voices again.\nIt was quite dark at last. The street was a lonely one. The last passenger, he thought, was gone. No,\u2014there was a quick step: Joe Hill, lighting the lamps. Joe was a good old chap; never passed a fellow without some joke or other. He remembered once seeing the place where he lived with his wife. \"Granny Hill\" the boys called her. Bedridden she Was; but so kind as Joe was to her! kept the room so clean!\u2014and the old woman, when he was there, was laughing at some of \"t' lad's foolishness.\" The step was far down the street; but he could see him place the ladder, run up, and light the gas. A longing seized him to be spoken to once more.\n\"Joe!\" he called, out of the grating. \"Good-bye, Joe!\"\nThe old man stopped a moment, listening uncertainly; then hurried on. The prisoner thrust his hand out of the window, and called again, louder; but Joe was too far down the street. It was a little thing; but it hurt him,\u2014this disappointment.\n\"Good-bye, Joe!\" he called, sorrowfully enough.\n\"Be quiet!\" said one of the jailers, passing the door, striking on it with his club.\nOh, that was the last, was it?\nThere was an inexpressible bitterness on his face, as he lay down on the bed, taking the bit of tin, which he had rasped to a tolerable degree of sharpness, in his hand,\u2014to play with, it may be. He bared his arms, looking intently at their corded veins and sinews. Deborah, listening in the next cell, heard a slight clicking sound, often repeated. She shut her lips tightly, that she might not scream; the cold drops of sweat broke over her, in her dumb agony.\n\"Hur knows best,\" she muttered at last, fiercely clutching the boards where she lay.\nIf she could have seen Wolfe, there was nothing about him to frighten her. He lay quite still, his arms outstretched, looking at the pearly stream of moonlight coming into the window. I think in that one hour that came then he lived back over all the years that had gone before. I think that all the low, vile life, all his wrongs, all his starved hopes, came then, and stung him with a farewell poison that made him sick unto death. He made neither moan nor cry, only turned his worn face now and then to the pure light, that seemed so far off, as one that said, \"How long, O Lord? how long?\"\nThe hour was over at last. The moon, passing over her nightly path, slowly came nearer, and threw the light across his bed on his feet. He watched it steadily, as it crept up, inch by inch, slowly. It seemed to him to carry with it a great silence. He had been so hot and tired there always in the mills! The years had been so fierce and cruel! There was coming now quiet and coolness and sleep. His tense limbs relaxed, and settled in a calm languor. The blood ran fainter and slow from his heart. He did not think now with a savage anger of what might be and was not; he was conscious only of deep stillness creeping over him. At first he saw a sea of faces: the mill-men,\u2014women he had known, drunken and bloated,\u2014Janey's timid and pitiful-poor old Debs: then they floated together like a mist, and faded away, leaving only the clear, pearly moonlight.\nWhether, as the pure light crept up the stretched-out figure, it brought with It calm and peace, who shall say? His dumb soul was alone with God in judgment. A Voice may have spoken for it from far-off Calvary, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!\" Who dare say? Fainter and fainter the heart rose and fell, slower and slower the moon floated from behind a cloud, until, when at last its full tide of white splendor swept over the cell, it seemed to wrap and fold into a deeper stillness the dead figure that never should move again. Silence deeper than the Night! Nothing that moved, save the black, nauseous stream of blood dripping slowly from the pallet to the floor!\nThere was outcry and crowd enough in the cell the next day. The coroner and his jury, the local editors, Kirby himself, and boys with their hands thrust knowingly into their pockets and heads on one side, jammed into the corners. Coming and going all day. Only one woman. She came late, and outstayed them all. A Quaker, or Friend, as they call themselves. I think this woman Was known by that name in heaven. A homely body, coarsely dressed in gray and white. Deborah (for Haley had let her in) took notice of her. She watched them all\u2014sitting on the end of the pallet, holding his head in her arms with the ferocity of a watch-dog, if any of them touched the body. There was no meekness, no sorrow, in her face; the stuff out of which murderers are made, instead. All the time Haley and the woman were laying straight the limbs and cleaning the cell, Deborah sat still, keenly watching the Quaker's face. Of all the crowd there that day, this woman alone had not spoken to her,\u2014only once or twice had put some cordial to her lips. After they all were gone, the woman, in the same still, gentle way, brought a vase of wood-leaves and berries, and placed it by the pallet, then opened the narrow window. The fresh air blew in, and swept the woody fragrance over the dead face, Deborah looked up with a quick wonder.\n\"Did hur know my boy wud like it? Did hur know Hugh?\"\n\"I know Hugh now.\"\nThe white fingers passed in a slow, pitiful way over the dead, worn face. There was a heavy shadow in the quiet eyes.\n\"Did hur know where they'll bury Hugh?\" said Deborah in a shrill tone, catching her arm.\nThis had been the question hanging on her lips all day.\n\"In t' town-yard? Under t' mud and ash? T' lad'll smother, woman! He wur born in t' lane moor, where t' air is frick and strong. Take hur out, for God's sake, take hur out where t' air blows!\"\nThe Quaker hesitated, but only for a moment. She put her strong arm around Deborah and led her to the window.\n\"Thee sees the hills, friend, over the river? Thee sees how the light lies warm there, and the winds of God blow all the day? I live there,\u2014where the blue smoke is, by the trees. Look at me,\" She turned Deborah's face to her own, clear and earnest, \"Thee will believe me? I will take Hugh and bury him there to-morrow.\"\nDeborah did not doubt her. As the evening wore on, she leaned against the iron bars, looking at the hills that rose far off, through the thick sodden clouds, like a bright, unattainable calm. As she looked, a shadow of their solemn repose fell on her face; its fierce discontent faded into a pitiful, humble quiet. Slow, solemn tears gathered in her eyes: the poor weak eyes turned so hopelessly to the place where Hugh was to rest, the grave heights looking higher and brighter and more solemn than ever before. The Quaker watched her keenly. She came to her at last, and touched her arm.\n\"When thee comes back,\" she said, in a low, sorrowful tone, like one who speaks from a strong heart deeply moved with remorse or pity, \"thee shall begin thy life again,\u2014there on the hills. I came too late; but not for thee,\u2014by God's help, it may be.\"\nNot too late. Three years after, the Quaker began her work. I end my story here. At evening-time it was light. There is no need to tire you with the long years of sunshine, and fresh air, and slow, patient Christ-love, needed to make healthy and hopeful this impure body and soul. There is a homely pine house, on one of these hills, whose windows overlook broad, wooded slopes and clover-crimsoned meadows,\u2014niched into the very place where the light is warmest, the air freest. It is the Friends' meeting-house. Once a week they sit there, in their grave, earnest way, waiting for the Spirit of Love to speak, opening their simple hearts to receive His words. There is a woman, old, deformed, who takes a humble place among them: waiting like them: in her gray dress, her worn face, pure and meek, turned now and then to the sky. A woman much loved by these silent, restful people; more silent than they, more humble, more loving. Waiting: with her eyes turned to hills higher and purer than these on which she lives, dim and far off now, but to be reached some day. There may be in her heart some latent hope to meet there the love denied her here,\u2014that she shall find him whom she lost, and that then she will not be all-unworthy. Who blames her? Something is lost in the passage of every soul from one eternity to the other,\u2014something pure and beautiful, which might have been and was not: a hope, a talent, a love, over which the soul mourns, like Esau deprived of his birthright. What blame to the meek Quaker, if she took her lost hope to make the hills of heaven more fair?\nNothing remains to tell that the poor Welsh puddler once lived, but this figure of the mill-woman cut in korl. I have it here in a corner of my library. I keep it hid behind a curtain,\u2014it is such a rough, ungainly thing. Yet there are about it touches, grand sweeps of outline, that show a master's hand. Sometimes,\u2014to-night, for instance,\u2014the curtain is accidentally drawn back, and I see a bare arm stretched out imploringly in the darkness, and an eager, wolfish face watching mine: a wan, woful face, through which the spirit of the dead korl-cutter looks out, with its thwarted life, its mighty hunger, its unfinished work. Its pale, vague lips seem to tremble with a terrible question. \"Is this the End?\" they say,\u2014\"nothing beyond? no more?\" Why, you tell me you have seen that look in the eyes of dumb brutes,\u2014horses dying under the lash. I know.\nThe deep of the night is passing while I write. The gas-light wakens from the shadows here and there the objects which lie scattered through the room: only faintly, though; for they belong to the open sunlight. As I glance at them, they each recall some task or pleasure of the coming day. A half-moulded child's head; Aphrodite; a bough of forest-leaves; music; work; homely fragments, in which lie the secrets of all eternal truth and beauty. Prophetic all! Only this dumb, woeful face seems to belong to and end with the night. I turn to look at it. Has the power of its desperate need commanded the darkness away? While the room is yet steeped in heavy shadow, a cool, gray light suddenly touches its head like a blessing hand, and its groping arm points through the broken cloud to the far East, where, in the flickering, nebulous crimson, God has set the promise of the Dawn.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/713545", "artist_names": "Slayer (Ft.

This one hurt\nTo anyone who came of age in the mid Eighties wearing a denim jacket and studded wristband, Slayer was their introduction to aggressive speed metal, with riffs that cut like a buzzsaw blade and dark lyrical themes that often crossed into objectionable territory\u2014and Hanneman was the primary force behind it\n\n\u201cBy all accounts, he was the band,\u201d says Slayer frontman and bassist Tom Araya\n\nFor those who had spent a lifetime in a perpetual state of whiplash from headbanging to such Hanneman-penned Slayer anthems as \u201cAngel of Death,\u201d \u201cSouth of Heaven,\u201d \u201cChemical Warfare\u201d and \u201cRaining Blood,\u201d the reason he meant so much to so many was simple: because you could always count on Jeff to be Jeff, in the same way you could always count on Slayer to be Slayer\n\nHe didn\u2019t say much, but he didn't have to. He wrote the lion\u2019s share of the band\u2019s most beloved songs and lived to come out from behind a wall of Marshalls every time the band took the stage, raise his fist triumphantly to the rafters, and destroy. For nearly three decades, Jeff Hanneman was a fixture of that stage\u2014a blonde symbol of young headbangers who fell in love with satanic-infused heavy metal aggression and never looked back well into their adulthood\n\n\u201cI\u2019m amazed at how many people he touched,\u201d Araya says. \u201cThey hardly knew him, but he affected a lot of people. And he didn\u2019t even realize it.\u201d\n\nBut for all the love the heavy metal community had for Jeff Hanneman, there was a dark side to the guitarist that confused many of those who came into contact with him. Unlike, say, Dimebag Darrell, Jeff wasn\u2019t everybody\u2019s \u201cbro.\u201d He didn\u2019t pose happily for pictures, glad-hand his way across the NAMM convention floor every January or help needy children. He had no love for the media\n\nHe also had a morbid fascination with Nazi Germany and derived a perverse sense of joy from proudly\u2014and controversially\u2014displaying Nazi iconography on his guitars. And he drank. A lot\n\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t like you, he wouldn\u2019t be hanging with you,\u201d says Araya from his family farmstead in Buffalo, Texas. \u201cHe could pick at you and make you feel like crap. But if you tolerated it and stuck it out and showed that you could deal with the bullshit, then that\u2019s how you became friends with him.\u201d\n\nSlayer\u2019s origins date back to 1981 in the South Gate and Huntington Park areas of Los Angeles. King and Hanneman met at a warehouse complex after King had gone there to investigate a band that was holding auditions for a guitar player\n\n\u201cAs I was leaving, I saw Jeff just kinda standing around playing guitar, and he was playing stuff that I was into, like Def Leppard\u2019s \u2018Wasted\u2019 and AC/DC and Priest. So I started talking to him and just said, \u2018Hey, you want to start a band?\u2019 I already knew Dave [Lombardo, drummer] and we had been playing together in his parents\u2019 garage a bit, and so I brought Jeff in, then went to Tom [Araya, vocalist/bassist], who I was playing with in another band, and said, \u2018Hey man, I have a different band if you\u2019re interested.\u2019 And that was it.\u201d\n\nLombardo remembers the first time he met Hanneman: \u201cKerry brought him to rehearsal in the garage one day. He had a small Fender Twin and the black Les Paul that\u2019s on the back of Show No Mercy, and he was kinda quiet\n\nJeff hadn\u2019t been playing for very long at that point, and everything he did know he basically taught himself. But something about it just felt right from the get-go. It worked.\u201d\n\nThis fearsome foursome was now a unit, hell-bent on fusing elements of Iron Maiden, Mot\u00f6rhead, Dead Kennedys and Venom into an aggressive style of thrash metal that would ultimately alter the course of music. They were four youngsters with a shared vision, though Hanneman did stand apart from his cohorts in one respect: he didn\u2019t drive\nYou might also likeSo while everyone else was able to get to and from rehearsal via their own wheels, Hanneman\u2014who, depending on whom you ask, either never had a driver\u2019s license or lost it early on after various DUI infractions\u2014needed to be shuttled back and forth whenever the band got together\n\n\u201cWhen we started the band, Kerry would pick him up from his house in Long Beach and I would drop him off after rehearsal,\u201d Araya says. \u201cThat was the trade-off. So we spent a lot of time in the car together, usually drinking beer. I would drop him off, and sometimes I\u2019d hang with him at his house with his parents.\u201d\n\nIt was around this time\u2014April-May 1983 to be exact, nine months before the release of the band\u2019s debut album, Show No Mercy\u2014that Hanneman met a girl named Kathryn. They hooked up as teenagers\u2014he 19, she 15\u2014and stuck together like glue for the remainder of Jeff\u2019s life, up until the day he died. It\u2019s safe to say their fate as a couple was sealed by the bizarre circumstances of their introduction\n\n\u201cMy girlfriend and I were getting tired of going to the movies every weekend, so we decided to go see this band called Slayer at a little club in Buena Park called the Woodstock,\u201d says Kathryn, who is now 46, from her home in southern California. \u201cThey were playing with a band called Leatherwolf. I begged my father to let us go to the show, knowing that I would be home later than my 10 o\u2019clock curfew, and he was okay with that. There may have been 15 or 20 people at the show, so I was able to stand up front against the stage, on Jeff\u2019s side. And before I knew it, he kneeled down, grabbed me by the hair, and started making out with me. I was blown away, and that was how we met.\u201d\n\nHad Hanneman attempted this act of onstage molestation with a different girl that night, he may have found himself in the back of a squad car. Instead, he found himself getting messages from the band\u2019s manager that Kathryn\u2014who had reached out to management to share photos she had taken that night\u2014wanted Jeff to call her\n\n\u201cI asked the manager if he could have Jeff call me, and he told me Jeff was in Vegas visiting his grandmother,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought that was so sweet. About three weeks later, I was at home and my phone rang one night, and I picked it up and the voice on the other end said, \u2018Hi, Kathy, this is Jeff from Slayer.\u2019 And my heart started racing. I asked him how his grandmother was, and he said to me, \u2018I wasn\u2019t visiting my grandmother. I went to Vegas to break up with my girlfriend.\u2019 And that was what I loved about Jeff\u2014he was honest from the get-go.\u201d\n\nJeff and Kathryn\u2019s relationship continued to grow as Slayer gained traction within the underground metal community\u2014that is, as long they could figure out a way to travel the 20 or so miles between her home in Buena Park and his in Long Beach\n\n\u201cSince neither of us drove we either had to rely on Tom to pick me up and drive me to rehearsal to see Jeff or get my mom to drive me to Long Beach to see him,\u201d Kathryn says. \u201cAnd whenever Jeff could, he would take a bus to come see me. That\u2019s how our relationship started, and eventually we just never separated unless he was on the road. We spent as much time together as we possibly could\n\n\u201cAt first my dad was a little nervous when this guy showed up at our house wearing a leather jacket with black makeup around his eyes, but it didn\u2019t take long before they were all getting along great. My parents loved him. All my girlfriends fell in love with him too. And they were always quick to say so.\u201d\n\nWhile Kathryn has always taken careful steps to shield herself from the spotlight, she did play a key role in Slayer\u2019s early Eighties reputation as a group parents abhorred when she agreed to pose in an early band promotional photo as a bloodied, lingerie-clad corpse\n\n\u201cI was around 16 at the time,\u201d she says. \u201cJeff called me one evening and said they were about to do this photo shoot and that the girl they were going to use broke her toe and had to cancel, so he asked if I would fill in. And that I needed to bring some sort of black lingerie. I told him I had to get permission from my parents but that I\u2019d be happy to do it. And since neither of us had driver\u2019s licenses, Tom came out and picked me up and we went to the garage at Tom\u2019s parents\u2019 house, which is where they would rehearse, and we did the shoot. I was very shy and conservative in those days, but it was the least I could do. I was honored that they chose me.\u201d\n\nContrary to internet reports of them marrying in 1997, Jeff and Kathryn wed in Las Vegas in 1989 in a simple ceremony consisting of the happy heavy metal couple and the bride\u2019s parents. The decision to marry wasn\u2019t difficult for either Jeff or Kathryn, as they learned over a mid-afternoon breakfast at a local Denny\u2019s a few weeks before heading to Vegas\n\n\u201cWe ordered breakfast and we each ordered a beer, and Jeff was just very quiet,\u201d Kathryn says. \u201cI looked at him and just said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking\u2014but whatever you ask me, I\u2019ll say yes to.\u2019 He waited, and then he looked up at me and said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s just fucking do it.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s just fucking do what?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Let\u2019s just take off and get married.\u2019 I said okay and asked him if he was sure, and he said, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m sure. I marry you, I marry you for life.\u2019 \u201d\nHanneman\u2019s official cause of death was alcohol-related cirrhosis, a result of a lifetime of drinking. \u201cJeff was always a drinker,\u201d says Lombardo, who left the band (for the third time at least) earlier this year. \u201cHe always had a Coors Light tall can in his hand. Always.\u201d\n\u201cJeff and I always drank,\u201d King adds. \u201cThey called Steven Tyler and Joe Perry the Toxic Twins. We were the Drunk Brothers.\u201d He laughs. \u201cThe difference being that I don\u2019t wake up in the morning and need a beer. Jeff didn\u2019t know how not to drink.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe partied and we partied hard,\u201d says Exodus founder\u2014and current Slayer touring guitarist\u2014Gary Holt, who became friends with Hanneman in the early Eighties. \u201cI have a million photos of us back in the day, just hanging out and drinking, beers in hand in the middle of the day at load-in.\u201d\n\nFor Kathryn, memories of Jeff and her father bonding over martinis in the evening are still vivid. \u201cAbout a year or so after we met, Jeff moved in with me and my parents, and my dad would always love to come home and have a couple martinis. And he would offer Jeff a drink and they would sit and have their martinis and play video games. So I have known Jeff to drink from the day that I met him. I never really understood it, but drinking was always very much a part of Jeff\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nHanneman\u2019s reliance on alcohol was obvious to anyone who spent enough time with him. However, he did manage to stay away from hard drugs for most of his life, except for a few years in the mid Eighties when cocaine use became a common activity for Jeff and Tom\n\n\u201cYou start making a little money, and the next thing you know, it\u2019s there,\u201d Araya says. \u201cIt\u2019s readily available and people are eager to provide it. After a weekend binge, you find yourself driving down the 405 at six in the morning\u2014I\u2019m driving, Jeff\u2019s feeding my nose, he\u2019s feeding his nose. And you suddenly realize how easily this could have turned bad. I remember stopping, looking all around us\u2014nobody else on the highway\u2014and I looked at Jeff and said, \u2018Man, this is fucking crazy. Look at us. We can\u2019t be doing this.\u2019 And we stopped, threw what we had out the window and never touched it again. He stuck with his alcohol and I stuck with my \u2018greenery,\u2019 and we went about our existence\n\n\u201cWe had our vices, but we didn\u2019t let them control our lives like you see with a lot of other bands that are just starting out. That was the one thing that I thought was really cool about us\u2014we didn\u2019t let those things destroy us. We had control of ourselves to some extent.\u201d\n\nThe extent to which Hanneman had control of his alcohol intake became questionable in the mid Nineties, when it started becoming more apparent to his wife and bandmates that Jeff was no longer just a hard-partying goofball metalhead from L.A. but a serious adult drinker\n\n\u201cI would express my concern, and he would back off for a few months\u2014but then he would go right back to drinking,\u201d Kathryn says. \u201cA few years before his dad died in 2008, I did notice that Jeff was relying on alcohol to start off his day. But I couldn\u2019t say much at that point, because I just knew we\u2019d wind up in a verbal confrontation about it. And I\u2019m not going to say I didn\u2019t drink with him\u2014I did drink with him, sometimes quite heavily. I figured if I couldn\u2019t beat him, join him. But eventually I realized that I couldn\u2019t go on like that, and that if I stopped I might be able to help him get away from it too. But I couldn\u2019t. He just relied on it too much to get him through the day.\u201d\n\nHis bandmates are quick to point out that Hanneman\u2019s drinking rarely became an issue within the group, though it did creep in on occasion\n\n\u201cThe only thing that comes to mind,\u201d says King, \u201cwas when we were on the Divine Intervention tour [in 1994/95], when Paul [Bostaph] was with us, and we wanted to play \u2018Sex. Murder. Art.\u2019 live. But on that album I pretty much played everything in the studio, so I don\u2019t think Jeff had ever played that song. And he was just too messed up all the time to learn it, so Paul, Tom and I just did it as a three-piece because Jeff would not come onstage and play it. After that, we said, \u2018Listen dude, like it or not, you\u2019re a part of this band, and if we decide to play a song, you gotta play that fucking song.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn the road, particularly in later years, Jeff spent most of his time on the tour bus after gigs by himself, watching the History Channel or reading a book about World War II. \u201cJeff was super intelligent about history\u2014World War II became his thing,\u201d says King\n\nHanneman, whose German-American father fought as an American soldier in World War II and brought home medals from dead Nazi soldiers that he gave to his son, was morbidly fascinated by the Second World War and Nazi Germany, collecting dozens of German soldier action figures and naming his various dogs and cats after Nazi officials and elements of WWII-era Germany. His own wedding ring was a collectable replica of a skull-emblazoned band worn by high-ranking Nazi official Reinhard Heydrich. While objects connected to this time in history are understandably offensive to many, to Jeff they were just symbols of the same darkness that energizes metal\u2019s imagery\n\n\u201cJeff wrote what he wrote,\u201d says Araya. \u201cAnd people would analyze it and come up with their own conclusions\u2014but to Jeff it was just a song about this or that. There was no deep meaning behind anything. And a lot of the stuff he did, he knew that it would cause a reaction\u2014he knew it would get a response. And if you\u2019re going to make a big stink about it, that\u2019s your problem\u2014that was his attitude about it.\u201d\n\nAs the \u201cquiet one\u201d in Slayer, the guitarist never made socializing with fans a top priority\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d stay on the bus for a long time after a show,\u201d Araya says. \u201cAnd then when the crowds would thin out and all the VIPs were gone\u2014all the wannabes who were hanging out and partying\u2014once they dissipated, he would make his way out and see who was still hanging out. There are people who want to hang out just because it\u2019s cool, but Jeff didn\u2019t want to hang out with those people, so he would wait. If he didn\u2019t like you, he wouldn\u2019t hang with you.\u201d\n\nAnd when it came to sightseeing, \u201cJeff pretty much only went to war museums, as you can imagine,\u201d King says. \u201cI remember the first time we went to Moscow, maybe around 1998. His whole thing was going to one of the Moscow war museums, so I was like, \u2018Hey, that sounds cool,\u2019 so I went with him. And it was just windy and cold as fuck there. But Jeff loved that stuff.\u201d\n\nFor Kathryn, who preferred to remain at home when Jeff went on tour, all she could do was count the days until he returned. \u201cIt was extremely hard for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe first tour they did was a three-week tour from southern California up to San Francisco, and in those days there were no cell phones or internet, and it was difficult for him to stay in touch with me. And at first I just thought, Oh my god, I\u2019m gonna die. When the band finally started touring Europe, he made sure to send me letters and postcards almost every day, and that was the only thing that kept me going, because I really didn\u2019t know when I would talk to him again.\u201d\n\nAs the years wore on, returning home from tour usually meant the rest of the band had seen the last of Hanneman for a while. \u201cHe would just go home and detach,\u201d King says. \u201cHe might have lived only 45 minutes away, but unless you were part of his inner circle, it was hard to stay in touch with him. And it took me a few years to understand that. For a while I was just like, \u2018Why isn\u2019t this guy calling me back?\u2019 But as I got older I just realized that that was who Jeff was\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Jeff and I were ever best friends,\u201d continues King. \u201cI think we were probably the closest in the band, but never best friends. To put it in a way that everyone could understand, Jeff and I were like business partners. Was he my friend? Of course he was my friend. But we didn\u2019t really act like that. The last time I was at Jeff\u2019s house was January 2003. We went to his place to watch the Raiders in the playoffs. And it sounds horrible, but it wasn\u2019t horrible. That was just how it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Jeff was home, Jeff liked to be home and stay home,\u201d Kathryn says. \u201cHe was over it\u2014over the road, over people, over everything. He just wanted to hibernate for a while, and I always respected that. When he was home he liked to sleep in and just kick back during the day. Sometimes he\u2019d get an idea for a song and run down to his music room and start working on music\n\nAnd video games\u2014Jeff was a huge video game buff. It started around 1983 with Intellivision, and after that it was Sega and Nintendo and everything else. If any new system came out, we went out and got it immediately. First-person shooters were his thing. He kept up to date on all of them\n\n\u201cThe TV was always on Seinfeld, Frasier, Cheers, Scrubs. And of course football or hockey. Sometimes all the TVs in the house would be on, and we\u2019d be watching different games in every room.\u201d\n\nPets, football, Seinfeld, video games, music\u2014yes, home life for Jeff and Kathryn Hanneman was almost surprisingly wholesome, particularly around the holidays\n\n\u201cChristmas was his absolute favorite holiday,\u201d Kathryn says. \u201cHe loved giving gifts, and he would always get me quite a few gifts. He started me on a German nutcracker collection and a bear collection, so he was always buying me new pieces for those. For Jeff, the bigger the tree, the better. Our house has 24-foot-high cathedral ceilings, and I remember one year him coming home with a tree that was 22 feet high! [laughs] And of course I would be the one climbing up and down the ladder decorating it. Jeff liked to just sit back and watch me decorate the tree.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to playing guitar and writing songs at home, Jeff never had any kind of set structure. He would go long stretches without picking up a guitar when the band wasn\u2019t active, and songwriting was done on the spur of the moment, whenever inspiration struck\n\n\u201cHe would never ever say, \u2018I need to go and write a song,\u2019 \u201d Kathryn says. \u201cIt would just hit him out of nowhere. He never planned it or was preoccupied with it. If we were at a restaurant, he would ask me if I had the recorder with me, and I\u2019d pull it out and he\u2019d basically hum the riff or speak the lyric into the recorder. And if we were home in the middle of watching TV, he\u2019d get up and run down to the music room and start laying out the drums. That\u2019s how many of his Slayer songs came about.\u201d\n\nHanneman established himself as Slayer\u2019s principal songwriter early on. By the late Eighties and early Nineties, he had formed a close working relationship with Araya, who handled lyrics for many of Hanneman\u2019s most iconic songs, including \u201cSouth of Heaven,\u201d \u201cWar Ensemble\u201d and \u201cSeasons in the Abyss.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seemed to connect on ideas and themes,\u201d Araya says. \u201cHe would have an idea that was half-written, and I\u2019d read it and work on it and disappear and put thoughts together and then I\u2019d say, \u2018What do you think?\u2019 and he\u2019d say, \u2018This is great. This is exactly what I was hoping you\u2019d come up with.\u2019 He was very encouraging about me putting my ideas down and the two of us working together. I always liked working with Jeff because he allowed me to do things that came naturally. There was a lot of freedom between the two of us when we wrote music and created songs. I think I\u2019m really going to miss that\n\n\u201cOf all the songs that we\u2019ve ever written as a band, the two songs that ended up getting Grammys\u2014\u2018Eyes of the Insane\u2019 and \u2018Final Six\u2019\u2014were songs that Jeff and I worked on together. That\u2019s something I\u2019m really proud of and something I always tried to make him proud of. I would say, \u2018Look, you wrote two Grammy-winning songs. You can\u2019t get any better than that. That\u2019s a milestone.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLombardo, too, had great respect for Hanneman as a songwriter and admired the fact that Jeff would present his songs with a basic drum-machine beat already in place. \u201cSo many guitar players can\u2019t program a drum machine or play along with their own songs,\u201d says Lombardo, who is currently performing and writing with his band, Philm. \u201cDoing it the way he did takes a lot more talent because you\u2019re thinking of all the instrumentation in a song rather than relying on other people. He heard everything in his mind before anyone else did\n\n\u201cThe \u2018vibey\u2019 quality of Jeff\u2019s songs allowed me to create these crescendos and decrescendos, making the song dynamically louder or bringing it back down with the drums. His songs were never just a constant roar of guitar playing\u2014they were dynamic, and it gave me the opportunity to decorate the songs a little more in a form that made sense.\u201d\n\nWhile news of Hanneman\u2019s death in May came as a shock to all but his closest friends and family\u2014\u201cWas I surprised by how he died? No,\u201d King says. \u201cWas it a surprise that it was that quick? Yes.\u201d\u2014there were events that occurred in the previous few years that could be viewed as contributing factors in the guitarist\u2019s downward spiral. One was the death of his father in 2008\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when things really started to go downhill for him,\u201d Kathryn says. \u201cIt was probably the hardest thing he ever had to face in his entire life. When I met Jeff he didn\u2019t have all that great of a relationship with his father. But as time went on they became very close. So that took a toll on him. He was never quite the same after that. I just don\u2019t think he cared anymore.\u201d\n\nIt was also around this time that Jeff was quietly battling an arthritic condition that had been progressing over many years and was now beginning to worsen to the point of interfering with his playing. \u201cHis ability to play was slowly deteriorating,\u201d Araya says, \u201cbut he didn\u2019t let anybody know that. We could just tell that things were going wrong. It was becoming hard to get stuff out of him. He was very proud and didn\u2019t want to make anyone worry about anything. Jeff would show up and play, and he didn\u2019t want anyone to know or worry about what else was going on with him. He tried to be really strong and sometimes that can weigh you down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would notice it in his hands and a little bit in his walk,\u201d Lombardo says. \u201cIt seemed like he was struggling with his playing\u2014it wasn\u2019t fluid. You could hear it in the leads. His playing just wasn\u2019t as tight as it could have been.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kathryn, uric acid buildup from alcohol consumption no doubt contributed to Jeff\u2019s arthritis, but there wasn\u2019t much she could do about either problem that was plaguing the guitarist. \u201cWe took him to a specialist and got him diagnosed,\u201d she says. \u201cBut as you can imagine, Jeff didn\u2019t want to deal with any medication to help the problem. Jeff wasn\u2019t a pill popper. When I would see him take an Aleve, I would know that he was in extreme pain from the arthritis and the Aleve would help him get through rehearsal or whatever he had to do. He dealt with that for many, many years\n\n\u201cDoctors wanted him to stay away from three of his favorite things\u2014beer, red meat and peanut butter\u2014but Jeff was going to do this his way, and he would just deal with the pain on his own terms.\u201d\n\nIn January 2011, an incident occurred that many would later assume was the cause of his death but wasn\u2019t. Jeff was bitten on his right arm an insect that was carrying a flesh-eating disease called necrotizing fasciitis. Reports circulated that it was a spider that bit Jeff, but that was never confirmed. Whatever bit him, it was enough send the guitarist\u2019s life into a tailspin\n\n\u201cJeff had been visiting a friend in the L.A. area,\u201d Kathryn says. \u201cHe was in the Jacuzzi one night relaxing, and he had his arm over the side, and he felt something, like a bite or a prick. But of course he didn\u2019t think anything of it. He came home about a week later, and he was pretty well lit when he came through the front door. He wasn\u2019t feeling well, and he just wanted to go upstairs and go to sleep. Before he did he said, \u2018Kath, I need to show you something, even though I really don\u2019t want to.\u2019\n\n\"And he took off his shirt, and I just freaked out when I saw his arm. It was bright red and three times the normal size. I said, \u2018Jeff, we need to go now. We need to get you to the ER.\u2019 But all he wanted to do was go to bed and sleep, and I knew that I was trying to rationalize with a very intoxicated person. So there was nothing I could do that night. But the next morning I convinced him to let me take him in. He didn\u2019t have a lot of strength, but I was able to get him into the car\n\n\u201cWhen we got to the hospital in Loma Linda, they took one look at him and they immediate knew what it was, so they took him right in. Jeff told me to go home because we both knew he\u2019d be there for hours and neither of us thought it would be a life-or-death situation. About three or four hours later, Jeff called me and said, \u2018Kath, it\u2019s not good. They may have to amputate. I think you need to come back here.\u2019\n\n\"When I got there, Jeff was on the stretcher waiting to go into surgery, and the doctor put it in perspective for me. He said, \u2018I need you to see your husband. He may not make it.\u2019 The doctor looked at Jeff and told him, \u2018First I\u2019m going to try to save your life. Then I\u2019m going to try to save your arm. Then I\u2019m going to try to save your career.\u2019 And looking at Jeff on that stretcher and possibly saying goodbye, knowing that I may never see him again\u2026\u201d\u2014she pauses\u2014\u201c\u2026was one of the hardest moments of my life.\u201d\n\nThe next few days for the Hannemans could only be described as nerve-wracking. Jeff was in the ICU in an induced coma after the initial surgery and breathing through a tube, his arm, for the most part, intact. Doctors attempted to remove the breathing tube at one point, but Jeff was unable to breathe on his own. Finally, after about the fourth day, the tube was removed and Jeff was breathing again. Her husband was alive, but as soon as they removed the bandages from Jeff\u2019s arm, Kathryn knew the road to recovery would be long\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget it\u2014I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAll I could do was look up at the doctor and say, \u2018How the hell do you fix this?\u2019 And he said, \u2018You know, Mrs. Hanneman, you\u2019d be very surprised.\u2019 And at that moment I had all the faith in the world that this doctor could fix his arm.\u201d\n\nBack home soon afterward, Jeff could begin the process of rehabilitating his arm in the hopes of regaining his ability to play guitar. The next few weeks saw more surgeries, staples and multiple grafts using skin from his left thigh. Wound-care suction devices were on hand to draw out the infection and help the skin grafts take. Physically, Jeff\u2019s arm was on the mend. Emotionally, however, he was struggling. Depression was setting in\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get Jeff to go to rehab or therapy,\u201d Kathryn says. \u201cI think he was letting the visual of his arm get to his emotions, and it was messing with his mind. It was hard to keep him upbeat at that point\n\n\u201cI think he thought he could do this on his own\u2014that he would just to go rehearsal and play, and that that would be his rehab. But I think he started to learn, once he tried rehearsing, that he wasn\u2019t playing up to his ability and that he wasn\u2019t able to play guitar at the speed he was used to. And I think that really hit him hard, and he started to lose hope.\u201d\n\nThe incident with Jeff\u2019s arm couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for the band. A European tour was booked for March and April 2011, and the legendary Big 4 tour, which saw Slayer sharing a stage with fellow thrash pioneers Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax, was on the schedule between April and September. These shows were immensely important for the band, but it was becoming increasingly obvious that Jeff wouldn\u2019t be able to participate\n\n\u201cFor me it was really difficult to make the decision to go on without Jeff,\u201d Araya says. \u201cThey started naming names to take his place, and I\u2019m like, How can you guys even think about this? We can\u2019t do this without Jeff. But we had to do something. Slayer, aside from being band members and really tight-knit, we are a business. Those are aspects of what we do that fans have a tough time understanding. So we had to make decisions because we were obligated to do these tours.\u201d\n\nOf all the possible replacements for Hanneman being bandied about, everyone was most comfortable with Exodus mainstay Gary Holt, a longtime friend of the band\u2019s\n\n\u201cI remember when the tour came up, Jeff said to me, \u2018No. No. There\u2019s no way in hell this band is going out without me,\u2019 \u201d Kathryn says. \u201cHe was definitely hurt by the fact that, for the first time ever, the band had to go on without him, but eventually he became okay with it, and a lot of that was because it was his friend Gary that was going to fill in for him. He knew the band had to go on.\u201d\n\u201cGary was a friend, he wasn\u2019t an outsider,\u201d Araya says. \u201cWe\u2019ve known him for 30 years and he was a good friend of Jeff\u2019s. When we first met Exodus, he and Jeff were inseparable.\u201d\n\nFans were hopeful that Hanneman was well on his way to a full recovery when the guitarist joined his bandmates onstage for two songs\u2014\u201cAngel of Death\u201d and \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d\u2014at the Big 4 show in Indio, California, on April 23, 2011, four months after the bite on his arm. Behind the scenes, however, a different story was emerging\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t at his best that night, but he was able to come out and do those two songs,\u201d Araya says. \u201cIt was after that that I think he realized that he could only play for a little bit and then had to stop. He would come in to rehearse and he would jam out some parts and then he\u2019d stop and just kind of fiddle with his guitar. He did that a few times, but then he just stop coming to rehearsal\n\n\u201cWe told him, \u2018Listen, we understand that you\u2019re having a tough time playing your guitar, having a tough time coming back 100 percent, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t be a part of what we do, which is write songs. You are still Slayer, you are a big part of this band, you can still write music and you can still put ideas together. Sit in the studio and work with us, make us what we are.\u2019 He was a big part of this band. I knew it and realized it a long time ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were holding out hope until the day he died,\u201d King says. \u201cIf he ever came to us and said, \u2018Okay, I can do this,\u2019 there was no question. This was his gig. Now, did I think that would actually happen? No, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think part of him knew that he wasn\u2019t going to be back in the band,\u201d Kathryn adds\n\nAs the realism about his situation began to set in, Jeff was forced to accept the fact that his livelihood was being stripped away, no doubt fueling his alcohol-induced decline over the next year and a half. Factor in Hanneman\u2019s uncommunicative, reclusive nature, and there wasn\u2019t much his bandmates could do but carry on\n\n\u201cPeople have to make their own decisions about how they want to live their lives,\u201d Araya says. \u201cYou can\u2019t start dictating to people how they should live because it just pushes them away. It doesn\u2019t help anything. It wasn\u2019t easy but it\u2019s not like we were blind to what was going on. We knew. And there were points that we tried to help and encourage him to come back\u2014tell him he could still be a part of what we do, even if it wasn\u2019t full time\n\n\u201cBut I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that he didn\u2019t want to let us down. He didn\u2019t want to disappoint us. He was very prideful and wanted to make sure he could come back at 100 percent. I think when he was having real difficulty over that last year, he just didn\u2019t want us to know about it. He kept saying that he needed more time. And the isolation didn\u2019t help much either. I think that no matter how things would have worked out, the end result would have been the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt eats you up because you think, Why can\u2019t I fix this guy?\u201d King says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t want to be fixed. I mean, he didn\u2019t want to die. But he also couldn\u2019t help himself before it was too late.\u201d\n\nOn May 2, 2013, the sudden news took the metal community by storm: Jeff Hanneman had died. Araya recalls his final communications with his longtime friend and bandmate: \u201cI had been texting with him, and he even sent me a song that he had been working on. So it seemed like he was doing okay. But when I got the call that he was back in intensive care, I became concerned. Eventually he stopped responding to my texts. It was like a one-sided conversation\n\n\u201cI was home with my family when I found out he had died. The phone rang and my wife answered it, and she had this look of dread on her face. She handed me the phone and didn\u2019t say anything, and it was our manager, Rick [Sales], and he told me. I hung up the phone and went to my room and I cried\n\n\u201cIt hit my family hard, because they really liked Jeff, they knew him really well. My mother was really upset, my sisters really loved Jeff, and my brother too\u2014he was Jeff\u2019s tech for a long time. Everyone in my family knew him and loved him a lot.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the future of Slayer is uncertain. Upcoming short tours of Europe and South America will go on as planned, but what happens after that is anyone\u2019s guess\n\n\u201cI plan on continuing,\u201d King says. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should throw in the towel just because Jeff\u2019s not here.\u201d\n\nAs for Lombardo, even though his split from the band a few months ago was publicly acrimonious, he says his door is open for any future discussions with his former bandmates. \u201cIf they want to talk, I\u2019m here. I don\u2019t want any kind of animosity between us. Life is too short and we\u2019re too old for that shit. I\u2019m ready and willing, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nAraya, on the other hand, has no idea what the future holds for this band. And it\u2019s a decision he\u2019s currently struggling with\n\n\u201cAfter 30 years, it would literally be like starting over,\u201d he says. \u201cTo move forward without Jeff just wouldn\u2019t be the same, and I\u2019m not sure the fans would be so accepting of that drastic a change. Especially when you consider how much he contributed to the band musically. And you can have someone sit in for him, but there\u2019s no one on this planet that can do what Jeff did\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no replacing him.\u201d1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count":

the time to tell me how you feel\nWhen you listen to my words\nAnd I knew you've heard, I know it's real\nRain is what this thunder brings\nFor the first time I can hear my heart sing\nCall me a fool but I know I'm not\nI'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top\n'Til I feel your\n\n[Chorus]\nRain, feel it on my finger tips\nHear it on my window pane\nYour love's coming down like\nRain, wash away my sorrow\nTake away my pain\nYour love's coming down like rain\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you looked into my eyes and you said goodbye\nCould you see my tears?\nWhen I turned the other way\nDid you hear me say\nI'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky?\nYou promised me when you said goodbye\nThat you'd return when the storm was done\nAnd now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun\n'Til I feel your\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nRain, feel it on my finger tips\nHear it on the window pane\nYour love's coming down like\nRain, wash away my sorrow\nTake away my pain\nYour

I believe in you)\n(I feel like I've known you before)\n(In the dream of you)\n(And I want to understand you)\n(With all my heart and all my soul)\n(More and more and more)\n(That by sheer force of will I will raise you from the ground)\n(When I'm with you I feel like a magical child)\n(And without a sound, you'll appear)\n(Everything strange)\n(And surrender to me)\n(Everything wild)\n(To love)\n[Verse 3]\nRain is what the thunder brings\nFor the first time I can hear my heart sing\nCall me a fool but I know I'm not\nI'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top\n'Til I feel

Rocka, Chief Rocka\nChief Rocka, Chief Rocka\n\n[Verse 1: Mr. Funke]\nBoom shaka laka, yo, here comes the Chief Rocka\nRock it down, so jump up off the tip you're not my nucca\nFor sharper type to battle make the people say \"Ooh ahh\"\nThink I won't curse, I'll break down and say puta\nHey, madrigon, sesa me bichafi mi chocha?\nSay what I want because I'm that type of guy\nNow fam-a-lam, I'll be damned, slam jams the weak\nCould it be the skunk weed that makes us oh so funky?\nNow hold it, let me choose, could it be the booze?\nNo it's the shoes (the shoes?) It's gotta be the shoes!\n'Cause girlies, they clock, they stand around and jock\nSo I say boom shaka lak, grab the microphone then rock\nTo tell you the truth, when on the mic\nI'll say anything that sounds good\nLike \"Drum pan, a drum pan sound over some uuuuh\"\nThe Cat in the Hat and the mouse ran up the stairs\n\"That doesn't make no sense!\"\nC'mon who cares?\nSee even without the gift there's yours so don't be tryin' to knock me\nI say what I want to say, as long it sounds funky\nSome MC's wanted to buy me, so they try to take stands\nBut they don't understand\nI'm the motherfuckin man\nI amaze and astound, rhythm up and down\nSmack a group of them around\nLet them know who wears the crown\nWho's-the-tip-of-the-top, the-cream-of-the-crop, the-best-under-the-sun\nI'm the Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Mr. Funke\n[Chorus]\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\u200b\n\n[Verse 2: DoItAll]\nWell umm, boom, shak-a-lak, I got the fragrance, the funk\nWhew, and it's smellin' up the hip-hop\nA little bit of this, a little bit of that\nMixed a, little of this, and now I gotta rap\nI'm the, Chief Rocka so I guess I am in charge\nI freak it with a twist so you'll boom it in your cars\nI'm the, one with the flow and the grip like G.I. Joe\nI snatch, I grab, and then I grab the dough\nSee, if I was an Indian I'd still be the chief\nThe only other difference\u2014I'd smoke weed in a leaf\nTo the hip, the hop, to the hibby, to the hibbidy\nHip-hop, oh no, I don't wanna go pop\nI got, too much soul, rhythm and blues\nR&B, ya see, all that's cool\nBut, hip-hop and rap, yeah, that's where my heart's at\nEven back when, I used to break on a box\nBackspins for backspin, even while I'm rappin'\nBefore I had a record, I always kept 'em clappin'\nFreestylin' on the block, now I Chief Rock\nI always entertain, by diggin' in my crux\nMy brain, so if it's gonna rain let it rain\nI spook you with the hit\nMake you Jump like House of Pain\nBoogaloo boogaloo, shake and jump\nAnd remember, remember, Chief Rock I won't front\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\n\n[Verse 3: DoItAll, Mr. Funke, Both]\nAy Mr. Funke\nWhassup?\nCan I get assistance?\nFor what?\nFor what? Yo Jazz, flex a cut\nWell back is the backer, I'm chillin' with my nucca\nAnd if ya got beef, then you can live with Jimmy Hoffa like\nWhat goes up, must come down\nBut not me clown\nI cut 'em, crack a speaker when I'm pumpin'\nSo jump in, and watch your ears start hummin'\nThrough the block, and don't forget to boom shak, shak-a-lak\n\n[Verse 4: Mr. Funke]\nWell damn DoItAll can I rock?\nI hear a beat I grab the mic, and then I start this workin'\nThe kids around the way used to think that I was buggin'\nBut they don't understand how I feel about the funk\nI walk with the funk, I talk with the funk\nI eat with the funk, I sleep with the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nSo now what do they say, when I'm walkin' up the block?\nBoom-shaka-laka there goes the Chief Rocka\n[Chorus]\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka\nThe Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief

trying hard to find your dreams\nWithout someone to share it with?\nTell me, what does it mean?\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna run to you\nI wanna run to you\nWon't you hold me in your arms\nAnd keep me safe from harm?\nI wanna run to you\nBut if I come to you\nTell me, will you stay\nOr will you run away?\nRun away\n\n[Bridge]\nI need you here\nI need you here to wipe away my tears\nTo kiss away my fears, no\nIf you only knew\nHow much\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI wanna run to you\nI wanna run to you\nWon't you hold me in your arms\nAnd keep me safe from harm?\nI'll run to you\nBut if I come

(annotated) LyricsW.I.P\n\n[Intro: Mad Skillz]\nNo Doubt, Mad Skillz, Eon\nN.Y to V.A, Every day, all day, no doubt\nYo, any ya'll niggas want it, you can get it\nAnybody, thats my word\n\n[Verse 1: Mad Skillz]\nRappers pose and act like they wild\nBut I can look at a rapper once and make that fool lose control of his bowels, dead raw!\nI'm verbally sick to the core, bloody metaphors leave the whole room with a red floor\nI cram to make ya lifespan shorter (what?) i think too fast, if ya tape me its on a CD recorder\nSlaughter, rappers get near it, if my name slide out ya mouth suck it back in before I hear it\nI slit a rappers throat in one session, and get a compliment from 'em fore' that fool return to the essence\nWack niggas got blueprints and plans for me, cause me makin' you wanna stop rappin, that shit is mandatory\nI battle a female emcee, impregnate her with a son so she's forever reminded of me\nAs far as rap go, it be the illest brother, and be the first and only emcee to try to take his own mother\n[Hook: Mr. Eon & Mad Skillz]\nHip-Hop icons, not rap pawns\nGet it on, word is bond, way beyond Sam one\nWe own stocks in bonds, you morons\nThink that you can fuck with Shaquan and Eon?\n\nHip-Hop icons, not rap pawns\nGet it on, word is bond, way beyond Sam one\nWe own stocks in bonds, you morons\nThink that you can fuck with Shaquan and Eon?\n\n[Verse 2: Mr. Eon]\nElementally speakin', my mental be creepin', your fifteen minutes of fame is fuckin' fleetin'\nOn the prowl, plus i snatch all of thou screamin' \"A E I O U a rap style\"\nForget the Moet, i make my microphone mo' wet, slicker and slippery than any ho get\nAdd E to the ten plays, when my snippet tape rapes ya whole mastering plate\nYou know took two emcees, ya take two of me, fuck open mic night i wreck the karaokes\n(unfinished)\n\n[Verse 3: Mad Skillz]\nI take any guy on, Skillz get his rise on, i be the sickest emcee that you never laid eyes on\nA rapper look in my direction and the next morning that nigga wakin' up under the witness protection\nProgram, any pros can get slammed, I'm scared of one rapper and his first name is no man\nLast name from nowhere, watch what you say, the way i play rappers nigga i need to be a DJ\n\n[Verse 4: Mr. Eon]\nI'll do shows in south park, kill Kenny with my mic, date a sweatshop girl just to get some free Nikes\nThis rap hybrid, over tracks that Mi did, rocks fifty nights Brooklyn and the tri-bridge\nMake it hot, pyromaniac on attack, I'm crazy illustrated call me animaniac\nCatch Eric on Fox TV with wildest rhyme videos and scary verse number three\nYou might also like[Hook: Mr. Eon & Mad Skillz]\nHip-Hop icons, not rap pawns\nGet it on, word is bond, way beyond Sam one\nWe own stocks in bonds, you morons\nThink that you can

I\u2019m cheating\nNow everybody wanna sound grimey (yeah I know)\nI\u2019ma show ya how, come on: \"all in together now\"\nYeah oh yeah yeah that\u2019s how it gotta be\nSo stop trying to be loud as me 'cause you can't do that\nThink about it, playing Russian roulette with an automatic\nI bet my ass against the line the last bullet\u2019s first on line\nStab and step and repping and run, packing a weapon is wild\nPeace to the brothers on Rikers Isle\nTough enough and trembling, blend in like a chameleon\nBuck, bye tough guy, oh my god I\u2019m so high\n'Cause they say I rhyme, they say I look like a gremlin\nBut what does it take to make a kid make a million children SLAM\n[Chorus: Onyx]\nSlam, da duh duh, da duh duh\nLet the boys be boys\nSlam, da duh duh, da duh duh\nMake noise

gassing\nStrictly swift blast of the raspy-rasp fashion\nThat I provide, I abide the U.S.G\nBesides the ghetto vibe, make me flip like Jekyll and Hyde\nOf course, I come across with the pure for sure unadulterated uncut raw\nDisgusted, busted, you wanna touch it, too hot\nYou forgot, you\u2019re not ready, your head could get ruptured\nHit between the eyes, I plan to vandalize\nI supply the static, I run with the bad guys\nThe villains, crooks, highlighters and the fighters\nSee the big black picture if you look inside of my mind\nIt\u2019s graphic, expressed it drastic\nSo kill the copycat act kid, it's all mastered\nDirected it, when y'all least expected it\nAnd thought it was safe, Onyx hit you in the face so SLAM\nYou might also like[Chorus: Onyx]\nSlam, da duh duh, da duh

Fingaz]\nI'm a b-boy, standing in my b-boy stance\nHurry up and give me the microphone before I bust in my pants\nThe mad author of anguish, my language polluted\nOnyx is heavyweight (and still undisputed!)\nYou took the words right out my mouth, now walk a mile in my shoes\nI paid so many dues, I feel used and abused and I\u2019m so confused\nExcuse me, for example I\u2019m an inspiration of a whole generation\nAnd unless you got ten sticky fingers it\u2019s an imitation\nA figment of your imagination\nBu-bu-bu-but wait it gets worse\nI\u2019m not watered down so I\u2019m dying of thirst\nComing through with a scam, foolproof plan\nB-boys make some noise, and just, just SLAM\n\n[Chorus: Onyx]\nSlam, da duh duh, da duh duh\nLet the boys be boys\nSlam, da duh duh, da duh

Lyrics[Intro]\nAs days go by in a rush\nYou've forgotten why you exist\nAnd you are unaware of\u2005the\u2005problems\nYou've caused\nYou want\u2005to laugh\nYou want to have fun\nLife\u2005is tough as is\nThat's why\nYou want music to entertain you\nTo whisk you away from reality\nBut we believe that music can bring about change\nCome with us\nShall we begin?\n[Verse 1: Fuat] (Nature)\nAt the time of Genghis Khan the price of washin' your hands in a river was death\nWe migrated and decayed spewing trash we've ended up fuckin' up our three seas\nThe unpredictable ruffian he breathes exhaust gas and he's now having a barbecue!\nForests on fire\nMother Nature weeping blood\nArrogance at an all time high!\nFactory chimneys belch smoke\nNuclear reactors, hazardous waste\n\"Electro smoke\" is always on the go\nThe biggest parasite is man just look at the planet!\nMan isn't even as capable as animals\nHe changed things up, then couldn't adapt\nThe bill is for the next generation to pay\nDoomsday's upon us, watch like an imbecile!\n\n[Verse 2: Ados] (Drought)\nDon't do it!\nDon't toss cigarette butts in the sea\nYou can't take it back\nThere'll come a day when that trash-filled sea\nWill be missed, but it won't be there!\nNot long before we go barren like Africa\nChildren growing up without water\nBecause we destroyed our lakes, rivers, streams, everything!\nNo mercy?\nI can't believe it\nWe've taken it all for granted\nAnimals have their stomachs filled with plastic\nDoesn't it break your heart?\nRetweeting isn't enough\nSomething must be done\nDo not pollute the water!\nLet my land be serene like water\nDon't inject no poison into its veins!\nYou might also like[Chorus: \u015ean\u0131\u015fer]\nCome\nThere will come a day\nWhen these guilty words will be imprisoned\nDefeated I'll disappear they won't notice\nI won't stay silent\nI can't stay silent\n\nDon't be afraid come\nThere will come a day\nWhen these guilty words will be imprisoned\nDefeated I'll disappear they won't notic\nI won't stay silent\nI can't stay silent\n\n[Verse 3: \u015ean\u0131\u015fer] (Law)\nI am a \"White Turk\"\nMy laws are Anglo-Saxon but my mind is Middle-Eastern\nI grew up apolitical\nI never voted\nI've cared about holidays, traveling and debts\nJustice is dead\nI stayed silent and participated until it was me\nNow I'm too scared to send a tweet\nI've come to fear my own country's police\nSorry to say, but this hopeless generation is your creation\nThe unhappy faction is your creation and this gunfire!\nInnocent men rotting in jail without even knowing why\nIt's all you!\nThis horrifying picture is your creation this tired voice of mine\nIdiot MPs, corrupt leeches, building their wealth on the back of the poor, using their taxes\nIt's all you!\nYou've never encountered death, never once lost your breath\nA coffee expert, always a cup in your hand\nAll you care about is your wannabe \"Startup\"\nNow, the justice that was supposed to protect you will come knocking, will break down your door!\nYou've acquitted child-killers just because they are cops you didn't say a word, which means you're guilty!\nBecause you mourned for two days, and moved on\nYou forgot the name of the judge\nWho released Tugce and Busra's killers!\nIf something happens to you, will you rely on the law?\nIf they falsely arrest you one night, no single journalist can report it because they're all locked up!\nThe lives taken by released killers (They won't come back)\nWasted years in prison on a false charge (They won't come back)\nYou stayed silent\nYou were overpowered because you were quiet\nThey took away your rights and they won't give them back voluntarily!\n[Verse 4: Hayki] (Justice)\nJustice is supposedly the pillar of a country\nIt's turned a deaf ear, won't listen to you\nTraditions, morals, customs\nIf the one before was bad, tell me, is the incumbent any better?\nIs this civilized?\nWe can't even afford what your dog won't eat\nYour police can't pull out his gun and shoot whoever he wants in broad daylight!\nMedia, press, law, military they all work for you\nYoung boys are out there at the crack of dawn putting their lives on the line\nHate is your weapon!\nThese aren't even our sins to pay for\nYour plan is all nice!\nI don't know who buys this\nBut I do know this\nOur weapon are our words!\n\n[Verse 5: Server Uraz] (Law)\nI'm the voice of the lost generation\nI can't be censored in a flawed picture\nTo get my team out of this grave I always slept with one eye open\nSticks, knives, they're all ineffective!\nA sharp mind is my prime objective\nAs patience devoured my brain the ones who rained down on me, I set aflame!\nAll I did was make music!\nThe police took offense and took me in\nI'm at another hearing while you go to your gig\nWearing the same old suit for the past ten years\nThe day someone tells me all is not for nothing will be the day I'll give my heart and my soul\nThe judiciary comes and collects its dues\nIn hell I'm living, my body is burning\n\n[Verse 6: Beta] (Turkey)\nHello Turkey (3B)\nI have an ID (T.C.)\nWe're trying to get by without getting in harm's way\nThe charlatan on TV, always a fanatic devotee!\nMaliciousness is an epidemic, continues to manipulate!\nThis is all a charade!\nWe're flying into turbulence!\nSyria was our neighbor, now are they our citizens? (Fellow countrymen?)\nEven the dead aren't at peace, we're cursed by them\n\"Hurriyet\" was just a newspaper\nYou go be as free as you can be!\n\n[Verse 7: Asil Slang & Zen-G] (Istanbul)\nSwallows us whole in a single bite\nAll-devouring Istanbul!\nChipping away at the best of times\nIt's an elusive mystery!\nIts streets are paved with gold\nYou gave your hand, it grabbed your arm (get 'em!)\nTransport, education, judiciary (help!)\nThe devil's spread his poison!\nMoney is a must or having contacts is a must\nThe big guys having your number is a must\nHaving an insider in Aksaray is a must\nWe never owned a yacht, a flat or a mansion\nOur piggy banks were never full\nI wasn't born rich\nYou must have a purpose in the big city\nYou didn't produce anything, yet you burned down forests!\nYou've become an animal in the concrete jungle\nYou've got dark circles under your eyes again\nDinosaurs are in power\nThere's a role for everyone in this jungle\n\"Stay silent and you will be next\"\n\"Bright minds are facing a dark future next!\"\n\n[Verse 8: Sokrat St] (Education)\nI will graduate!\nI'll give you cash, you give me a diploma\nNo money, I must work up a sweat\nEqual opportunity in education is what I exploit as a college student\nI graduated\nI'm a drifter because of the system you created\nI graduated\nI'll be a cashier or I'll be your usher at the movies!\nUniversities everywhere but village schools are in dire need\nWhatever ideology the higher-ups have is what is taught in class\nRich, poor separated favored according to their money or backing\nEducation is an industry the same as making illegal profit from construction!\nOne doesn't have money for books\nA budding teacher who doesn't know \"the right people\"\nYou know an MP? Wow!\nYou'll never get me if that's how you roll!\nAt least help out a village school\nChaos everywhere\nYou should fight too!\nThe kid barely slept tonight\nHe will go to school build him a road!\n[Verse 9: Ozbi] (Curiosity)\nWhy this sky?\nThese stars, these galaxies, the planets...\nWhy?\nWhat makes this universe?\nWhat makes the Earth?\nWhy me? Why you? Why us? Ask!\nFirst of all, ask \"Why do I exist?\n\"Where did I come from and why am I human?\nHow did I? How did we? How does everything?\nHow did we add meaning? How do we learn?\nWhat does life favor? Who gets the grace?\n\"Who gets to eat?\"\nTo understand, to explain and comprehend?\nIs it forbidden to understand?\nCould be, but there isn't one answer!\nThere are many, go seek them out!\nChase it, make sure to look for proof!\nFeed your soul, keep looking for fuel!\nProtect your heart and find a witness\nTake a breath and pursue art!\nAsk, ask about the atoms\nThink of the speed of light and go get yourself wings\nAnd then... Fly!\nFly as high as you can!\nFly as high as you can fly!\nLet yourself go!\n\n[Verse 10: Deniz Tekin] (Women's Rights)\nI wouldn't know\nI've never had to defend myself\nI wouldn't know, I've never had to worry about a child\nI've never been forced to marry\nThere was no abuse in my home\nIn my own home I've never been imprisoned in my room\nI've never been indoctrinated\nI've never been displaced\nI've never been burned with hatred\nI was never burned to death\nI never had siblings\nI've never been afraid of my older brother\nI've never been pulled out of school\nI've never been murdered!\n\n[Verse 11: Yeis Sensura & Sehabe] (Violence Against Women)\nYou never lay your hands on a woman, you idiot!\nYou're a sorry excuse for a human being!\nShe deserves the best\nSay \"No to violence against women!\"\nWhy are the males at the top of the pyramid?\nIn traffic, at home or in public transportation?\nThe harassments never end\nA slap on the wrist doesn't cut it\nUh, ah, are these moneybags your idea of a \"Man\"?\nSlapped her five times in Be\u015fikta\u015f, nasty\nPockets full of money, heart worthless\nWhere's your head at? Are you even human?\nSecondhand embarrassment! Are you even human?\nAre you even human?\nHow do you even get to this point? How?\n\n[Bridge: Aspova] (World)\nLet this world spin like my head is spinning\nAs I lose my mind\nA dream\nMy breath, my inner voice\nI fall into the deep\n\nLet this world spin like my head is spinning\nAs I lose my mind\nA dream\nMy breath, my inner voice\nI fall into the deep\n\n[Verse 12: Defkhan] (Foreign Lands)\nThey banged my head against a wall\nThey put out cigarettes on my skin instead of protecting me\nThey made me get up\nThe smell of burnt skin and smoke\nBastinado, \"motherfucker\"\nIs that the due process here?\nAccording to which rule?\nI'm ready for battle, there will be chaos\nThis is what is taught, loving violence and fanning the flames\nGermany is as cold as ice, let me tell you\nMost of the youth are on Amphetamines Tilidine\" or \"Weed\", \"Cocaine\" or \"Speed\", \"Crack\"\nYou might like it but it's not my cup of tea\nNot my cup of tea!\nWalk as you please! Step on a mine and die\nAnd for what cost?\nHow much is it?\nStop rolling around like a wheel\nJust be my friend\nIf you're talking, be honest!\n\n[Verse 13: \u015ean\u0131\u015fer] (Animal Rights)\nA bowl of water, is that too much to ask?\nHave a conscience, damn it!\nYou don't want to understand but their lives are entrusted to you and me\nThink for once!\n\"You're living alone, outside, in the cold, in winter\nNobody speaks your language\nDanger everywhere\nAlways disaster, always calamity!\"\nThey can't win, they are the wounded\nWhatever they do, it's never enough for you\nIt's about compassion, not money!\nAbandoning them in the woods is not the answer!\nThey're not wolves, they can't survive on their own there\nProtect them\nThey can't fight for their own rights\nThe shelters are full\nThe territory is harsh\nIts sky is dark\nThe punishment is money for raping and torturing stray animals\n\"Major immorality requires major imbeciles\"\nNot all humans are guilty but all animals are innocent!\n\n[Chorus: \u015ean\u0131\u015fer]\nCome\nThere will come a day\nWhen these guilty words will be imprisoned\nDefeated I'll disappear they won't notic\nI won't stay silent\nI can't stay silent\n\nDon't be afraid come\nThere will come a day\nWhen these guilty words will be imprisoned\nDefeated I'll disappear they won't notic\nI won't stay silent\nI can't stay silent\n\n[Verse 15: Sokrat St] (Suicide)\nDon't go! (Don't go)\nThere's still a lot we can change in this life\nDon't be stubborn!\nWe all gave up at some point in time\nNow clench your fist\nPut an end to your silence\nRemember how strong you stood when you blew a fuse!\nHate inside, hate outside\nCome!\nLove life the most\nI can't create a world for you but I will definitely hold your hand\nDon't leave the world even if everyone leaves you\nI'm not judging you\nI will never fully understand your pain\nI know\nIf it's too heavy, I leave it behind I walk down my own path\nPlease look at the mirror say \"I love you\"\n\n[Verse 16: Aga B] (Fascism)\nEy! What is fascism?\nTo put it roughly, we will be deceived\nAll of us, together\nAll you know is \"you\"\nMany accidents caused by overambition\nThis ambition is an everlasting emotion\nSnap at your wife at home\nCrisis on the street\nShh!\nKick a dog, not the purebred, but the mutt, brainless!\nEy! A thief who steals from himself\nFear the police, ey!\nThe \"System\" wants you to be a nobody, a raw, and shallow, individual\nKnow what is what and know us\nWe're the generation that looks dirty but has clean hands\nYou are the seat of the bike while we are the wheels and the handlebars\nEy! Naturally, we want a generation like ours\nEy! This is our main goal, respect is all\nGrandchild, be a mirror!\nAnxiety galore but this is our road\nDrown or be born\nSo many wrongs, as many rights\nSo be it, grandchild\nRespect is all!\n\n[Verse 17: Mira\u00e7] (Street)\nI can't look you in the eyes, my face falls\nBarefoot but dreams in their eyes\nTimid but he still puts in the work\nHe's spent\nLook! Every day is an exile!\nHe can't escape, bullies chase him\nThey look for a helping hand\nBurn the big shot's money and go knock that fuckin' ego out\nDon't name streets after ministers, but after the poor and the orphans\nDon't interfere with the street vendors, send the officers to the skyscrapers\n\n[Bridge 2: Mert \u015eenel]\nI'm a branch broken off by the storm\nBeen around a lot and fraying\nSo much goes on inside me\nThere are no words if I tried to explain\nSometimes I'm the story of a homeless child\n\nI'm a branch broken off by the storm\nBeen around a lot and fraying\nSo much goes on inside me\nThere are no words if I tried to explain\nSometimes I'm the story of a homeless child\n\n[Verse 18: Kamufle] (Traffic)\nA death trap\nHighways are death traps\n365 days at risk\nCountless ruffians with no conscience\nPay hush money\nA car accident overshadow the holidays\nBroken hearts, so much pain\nA requiem rings in their ears, the wound never heals\nAlcohol, violence, and speed cause terror\nKids driving expensive sports cars have no fear\nSafety first, leniency next\nPatience, peace, man needs these\nThe smallest of mistakes can ruin everything\nBelieve me, there's no return!3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/111195", "artist_names": "Aerosmith", "full_title": "Livin' on the Edge by\u00a0Aerosmith",

hip\nHe spent most of his days, just a dreamin of the city\nAnd then one day, he bought a guitar\nHe moved to Hollywood, to become a star\nBut, living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city\nBuilt his house out of straw, what a pity\nAnd then one day, jammin on some chords\nAlong came the wolf, knocking on his door\n[Chorus:]\nLittle Pig, Little Pig, let me in\nNot by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!!\nLittle Pig, Little Pig, let me in\nNot by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!!\nWell I'm huffin, I'm puffin, I'll blow your house in\nHuffin, puffin, blow your house in\nHuffin, puffin, blow your house in\nHuffin and a puffin and I'll blow your house in!!!\n\nWell the second little piggy, well he was kinda stoked\nHe spent most of his time just a ganga smokin\nHuffin and a puffin down on Venice Beach\nGetting paid money for religious speech\nHe built his shelter from what he garbage picked\nMostly made up of old cans and sticks\nThen one day he was cranking out Bob Marley\nAnd along came the Wolf on his big bad Harley\n\n[Chorus:]\nWell the third little piggy, the grade A student\nHis daddy was a rock star, named Pig Nugent\nEarned his Masters Degree, from Harvard College\nBuilt his house from his architect knowledge\nA tri-level mansion, Hollywood Hills\nDaddy's rock stardom, paid for the bills\nAnd then one day came the old house smasher\nThe big bad wolf the little piggy slasher\nYou might also like[Chorus:]\nWell the big bad Wolf\nWell he huffed, and he puffed, all that he could\nAnd low and behold the little piggy's house stood\n\"IT'S MADE OUT OF CONCRETE!\" the little piggy shouted\nThe wolf just frowned, as he pouted\nSo they called nine-eleven, like any piggy would\nThe sent out Rambo, just as fast, as they could\n\n(Rambo)\n\"YO, WOLF-FACE, I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE, YOUR ASS IS MINE!!!\"\n\n(gunshots)\n\nWell the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see\nSo that's to end the story, for you and me\nIf you still give a listen, you just may, here a big wolf or little piggy\nSay\n\n(Chorus [a little different])\n\" And the moral of the story is, ' A band with no talent can easily amuse\nIdiots, with a stupid, puppet show.

God\nI don't know, but today seems kinda odd\nNo barking from the dog, no smog\nAnd Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog\nI got my grub on, but didn't pig out\nFinally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out\nHooked it up for later as I hit the door\nThinkin', \"Will I live another twenty-four?\"\nI gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top\nAnd if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop\nHad to stop at a red light\nLookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight\nAnd everything is alright\nI got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night\nCalled up the homies and I'm askin' y'all\n\"Which park are y'all playin' basketball?\"\nGet me on the court and I'm trouble\nLast week, fucked around and got a triple double\nFreakin' niggas every way, like MJ\nI can't believe today was a good day\n[Verse 2]\nDrove to the pad and hit the showers\nDidn't even get no static from the cowards\n'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me\nSaw the police and they rolled right past me\nNo flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction\nAs I ran the intersection\nWent to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps\nWhat's the haps on the craps?\nShake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em\nRoll 'em in a circle of niggas\nAnd watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11\n7, even back door Little Joe\nI picked up the cash flow\nThen we played bones, and I'm yellin': \"Domino!\"\nPlus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA\nToday was a good day\n\n[Verse 3]\nLeft my nigga's house paid\nPicked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade\nIt's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic\nThe Lakers beat the Supersonics\nI felt on the big fat fanny\nPulled out the jammy and killed the punani\nAnd my dick runs deep, so deep\nSo deep put her ass to sleep\nWoke her up around one\nShe didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun\nDrove her to the pad and I'm coastin'\nTook another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion\nI was glad everything had worked out\nDropped her ass off and then chirped out\nToday was like one of those fly dreams\nDidn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams\nNo helicopter lookin' for a murder\nTwo in the morning, got the Fatburger\nEven saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp\nAnd it read \"Ice Cube's a Pimp\" (Yeah)\nDrunk as hell, but no throwin' up\nHalfway home and my pager still blowin' up\nToday I didn't even have to use my AK\nI gotta say, it was a good day\nSee Ice Cube LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also like[Outro]\nHey, wait, wait a minute!\nPooh, stop this shit!\nWhat the fuck am I thinkin' about?210Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1705749", "artist_names":

shorty tap the forty O smash\nTo a pass, if ya crash make a dash to the trash\nTap the cap, have a lot and not a lot, not a little\nDon't grade upon the label take a guzzle, don't dribble\nI got the supercalafragileisticexpialadou-cious\nYou're comin too close a to this, I get fero-cious\nCoax this rhyme, smoke this rhyme hype\nWhen we rockin upon the mic, we rock the mic right\nPass the funnel to the tunnel, I get busy till I'm dizzy\nNever pass it to get fizzy cause the god gets busy, who is he?\nDamn just pass it cold the cipher\nWhen I hit the dread spot I buy a can of Red Stripe, so\nChorus (Repeat 1x)\n\nWell I be comin' around the mountain with my ho Suzanna\nI'm peelin off the caps like the hicks in Alabama\nCheck the grammar and the stamina I'm tootin' on my horn\nTimberland boot stompin' forty drinkin born\nMalt liquor chug a filter let me rip it then I kick it\nTap it once for my brothers sip it then I sip it\nSo xerox the zip code, I'm in the mode, perfecto\nHallelujah here I go, watch me flow and let go\nTrouble shooter smoke the buddah rule like a dictator\nUsed to hit the fader now I play the commentator\nSo let me swing it from the rhyme to the concrete jungle\nWith the King Areis Mackin, rulin' over knuckle\nHeads to the bed, cause Right Said Fred\nLock em up with the beeswax, kick it to em dread\nYo, pass the peas please party trooper, party stop\n64 will give ya more if ya scammin on the block\nRed top, red top, bust open krill's dope\nBut if you're drinkin too slow you might kiss the steel toe\nJust keep the cypher movin' everything's be fine\nAnd the forty's stops here till I finish my rhyme\n\nChorus (Repeat 2x)\n\nBalance on the beam, here we go team, hype!\nPass the mic down the line, on time, drop the rhyme\nI rope a rope-a-dope smokin with the red beam scopin'\nPull a magnum body back and leave a back bone broken\nSo was a bend a trend I'm sendin and I'm cruisin' for a hit\nWhen I'm just sittin' in the outhouse droppin mad shhhhhhhh\nQuiet on the set while the crew be gettin' wrecked\nAnd if your stunned by the bunch I have a hunch you should step\nSo pass me the crazy straw and let me do the Q-Tip\nWhat is a forty if I can't take a sip?\nSometimes I drive slow sometimes I drive fast\nSometimes I'm on E sometimes I get gas\nSo check the stress sure to step to the left\nWith an OE tap on the top, pass it back\nGive a tap to the child, pass it, sorry, keep it goin\nDown my throat I keep it flowin, styles keep growin'\nWe don't brown bag it, the label be showin'\nAnd we don't give a

still lodged in my head\nAnd some blonde gave me nightmares\nI think that she's still in my bed\nAs I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead\n\n[Verse 2]\nWith an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning\nWhile some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking\nAbout all of the things that I long to believe\nAbout love and the truth and what you mean to me\nAnd the truth is baby you're all that I need\n[Chorus]\nI want to lay you down in a bed of roses\nFor tonight I sleep on a bed of nails\nOh I wanna be just as close as\nThe Holy Ghost is\nAnd lay you down\nOn a bed of roses\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell I'm so far away, that each step that I take is on my way home\nA king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone\nStill I run out of time or it's hard to get through\nTill the bird on the wire flies me back to you\nI'll just close my eyes and whisper\nBaby, blind love is true\n\n[Chorus]\nI want to lay you down in a bed of roses\nFor tonight I sleep on a bed of nails\nOh I want to be just as close as\nThe Holy Ghost is\nAnd lay you down\nOn a bed of roses\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, this hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry\nThe barkeeper's wig's crooked\nAnd she's giving me the eye\nI might have said yeah\nBut I laughed so hard I think I died\nOoh yeah\nYou might also like[Guitar solo]\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow as you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you\nWhile my mistress she calls me\nTo stand in her spotlight again\nTonight, I won't be alone\nBut you know that don't mean I'm not lonely\nI've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend\n\n[Chorus]\nI want to lay you down in a bed of roses\nFor tonight I sleep on a bed of nails\nOh I want to be just as close as\nThe Holy Ghost is\nAnd lay you down\n\n[Chorus]\nI want to lay you down in a bed of roses\nFor tonight I sleep on a bed of nails\nI want to be just as close as\nThe Holy Ghost is\nAnd lay you down\nOn a bed of roses9Embed"},

1]\nThere's a place in your heart\nAnd I know that it is love\nAnd this place could be much brighter than tomorrow\nAnd if you really try\nYou'll find there's no need to cry\nIn this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nThere are ways to get there\nIf you care enough for the living\nMake a little space\nMake a better place\n\n[Chorus]\nHeal the world\nMake it a better

love that cannot lie\nLove is strong, it only cares for joyful giving\nIf we try, we shall see\nIn this bliss, we cannot feel\nFear or dread, we stop existing and start living\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nThen it feels that always\nLove's enough for us growing\nMake a better world\nTo make a better world\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nHeal the world\nMake it a better place\nFor you and for me and the entire

we once believed in will shine again in grace\nThen why do we keep strangling life?\nWould this Earth crucify its soul?\nThough it's plain to see, this world is heavenly\nBe God's glow\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe could fly so high\nLet our spirits never die\nIn my heart, I feel you are all my brothers\nCreate a world with no fear\nTogether, we'll cry happy tears\nSee the nations turn their swords into

everything's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright\nLet the music take control of your body tonight\nFather break it down\n\n(Father MC)\nWell I begin the weekend with a groove\nRoll about eight deep now what's my next move\nWaitin to nightfall so I can enjoy\nSystem pumped by four Jeeps, runnin like a convoy\nRoll to the park, kinda crowded, what a scene\nPullin up with Jodeci blastin out the fifteen\nSo I park my ride, girls see my gearin\nNotice my grill that cause the pointin' and starin\n(Chorus-Jodeci)\nEverything's gonna be alright\nLet the music take control of your body tonight\nOoh, everything's gonna be alright\nLet the music take control of your body tonight\n\n(Father MC)\nNow I sign a couple autographs, take a few flicks\nOrder Don Perionne and lay back with my chicks\nMichael's on the left of me, Smooth is flippin\nTricky on my way on to the dance floor rippin\nTrick is for the cutie, the key I'm tryna' find her\nTim is in the front and Mobat is right behind him\nAnd me, I'm just layin on the prowl\nGot' say what's up as the girls cry out\nShe grabbed her man, I think she tried to play him\nMy only thought, was to step to the A-M\nCause I came to have a good time\nAnd at the end of the night, no doubt, I'm gonna get mine\nCause I don't have to raise my voice to be seen\nI maintain, if you know what I mean\nUnderstand I'm not conceeded, Father's just mellow\nI'm a smooth-talk Romeo, freak kinda fellow\n\n(Chorus)\nYou might also like(Father MC)\nDo that dance, do that dance, baby\nDo that dance, let's work it out\n(Both) Do that

that dance, let's work it out\n\n(Father MC)\nLoungin on the DL, this type of night is rare\nI glanced to the right, oh who do we have here\nPuffin Sweet, gettin ripped, what the hell\nI see Mr. Uptown, it's Andre Farwell\nConversatin with his boys\nI say stop and barge straight through the crowd\nIt's time to get charged\nIt's kinda mellow so I leap\nTo the center where the soul's rollin five deep\nMark Currey, Aaron Sorkin and LQ\nDoin the wild thing cause the soul is true\nAnd everytime I see bodies gettin biz'\nGirls are gettin wild cause Father's known for his\nAnd everytime ya hear the music thumpity-thump\nAnd all the girls gettin bumped right in ya rump\nSo everybody who feel the mood is right\nGet on the dance floor tonight\n(Chorus) 2x\n\n(Jodeci)\nEverybody dance with me, ohh yeah\nEverybody move with me, everybody\nEverybody dance with me\nEverybody move with me\nEverything's gonna be alright\nLet the music take control of your body tonight1Embed"}, {"_type":

with broken dreams\nThat never quite came true\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen all of my hopes were dyin'\nHer love kept me tryin'\nBut she does her best to hide\nThe pain that she's been through\n[Chorus]\nWhen she cries at night\nAnd she doesn't think that I can hear her\nShe tries to hide\nAll the fears she feels inside\nSo I pray this time\nI can be the man that she deserves\n'Cause I die a little each time\nWhen she cries\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe's always been there for me\nWhenever I've fallen\nWhen nobody else believes\nShe'll be there by my side\n\n[Verse 4]\nI don't know how she takes it\nJust once, I'd like to make it\nThen there'll be tears of joy\nThat fill her lovin' eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen she cries at night\nAnd she doesn't think that I can hear her\nShe tries to hide\nAll the fear she feels inside\nSo I pray this time\nI can be the man that she deserves\n'Cause I die a little each time\nWhen she cries\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSo I pray this time\nI can be the man that she

Braxton\u2019s 25 Best Songs: Critic\u2019s Picks LyricsOften when discussing the elite pack of divas who ruled the '90s and early aughts, Toni Braxton is cast aside.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be the case \u2014 there\u2019s way more to her story than \u201dUn-Break My Heart.\u201d\n\nKnown for her sultry, low-ranging contralto voice, Braxton -- who turns 50 this Saturday, Oct. 7 -- provided the R&B, pop, and adult contemporary hemispheres with a slew of signature classics.\n\nThe dramatic flare of these songs, matched with her film noir aesthetic and style, convincingly sold Braxton\u2019s extensive discography centered on the raging emotions of love and heartbreak. The smoothness and mature sophistication in her sound offered a lighter (and calmer) shading to the early waves of hip-hop soul and alternative-R&B that reigned supreme in the '90s.\n\nWell into the early aughts, Braxton would find herself pairing quiet storm vibes with hip-hop undertones.\n\nAfter an unfortunate dip in mainstream appeal maligned by label issues and personal matters in the mid-00\u2019s (although that period would bring notable deep cuts and plenty more \u201cwhat could have beens\u201d), Braxton regained her place in the spotlight with a Dancing With The Stars stint, a successful reality TV show alongside her sisters, and a critically-acclaimed reunion album with her mentor Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds.\nNow the legend prepares to release her ninth studio album, slated to be released next year, including her current single \u201cDeadwood.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the songstress' milestone birthday, Billboard ranks the 25 best Toni Braxton songs, including singles and deep cuts.\n\n#25. \"You Mean The World To Me\" (1993)\n\nAfter departing from her all-sisters quintet, The Braxtons, the eldest of the girl group embarked on a successful solo career.\n\n1993 saw the arrival of Toni Braxton, a self-titled debut that topped both the Billboard 200 and R&B Albums charts for multiple weeks. As the fourth lead single on the LP, \u201cYou Mean The World\u201d reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1994, thanks to the soulful swing of the hook dedicated to a cherished lover.\n\n#24. \"Why Should I Care\" (1996)\n\nFollowing up her debut with Secrets, Braxton reinvigorated the sound and format of quiet storm with arguably her best album to date.\n\nFull of ballads centered on dealing with an unfaithful soulmate, Secrets cemented the legacy of Braxton\u2019s signature blend of mature-R&B with breezy adult contemporary. In this deep cut, the crooner questions why she should care about said partner over a psychedelic guitar riff and synth reminiscent of The Isley Brothers.\n\n#23. \"Spanish Guitar\" (2000)\n\nMost legends can\u2019t say that their international single became a soundtrack staple for a Brazilian soap opera. La\u00e7os de Fam\u00edlia would help Braxton\u2019s Latin pop ballad become a mass success in its home country -- and ultimately a primary example of Latin music\u2019s influence on mainstream culture.\n\n#22. \"The Heat\" (2000)\n\n\u201cSpanish Guitar\u201d aptly oozed a sweltering mystique fitting enough for Braxton\u2019s third studio album, The Heat. Also incorporating that magic is the album\u2019s title track, a subtle jaunt working in the sounds of a tropical summer and a light, jazzy groove. No wonder why the ending question is \u201cdoes anyone want some ice cream?\u201d\n\n#21. \"Hit The Freeway\" feat. Loon (2002)\nEntering the new millennium, Braxton gained more artistic control from LaFace. She also felt a need to strip away some of her balladry and embrace her love of hip-hop \u00e1 la Mariah Carey\u2019s Butterfly. Braxton\u2019s first LPs of the aughts -- The Heat and More Than A Woman -- also embraced a sexier, borderline controversial side of the songstress.\n\nAs the lone single from More Than A Woman, \u201cFreeway\u201d joins a list of notable bangers produced by Pharrell\u2019s launching pad, The Neptunes. And thanks to its Loon co-sign, it also has a Bad Boys Records stamp of approval.\n\n#20. \"Trippin' (That's The Way Love Works)\" (2005)\n\nAfter leaving LaFace Records in 2003, Braxton signed to the record label abyss known as Blackground Records. If you're familiar with the label\u2019s nightmare stories revolving around Aaliyah and JoJo, it goes without saying that Braxton\u2019s first (and only) album under the label, Libra, didn\u2019t fare well commercially.\n\nThat being said, the LP contains the singer\u2019s peak unreleased singles and barely-existent promos. The highlight of this particular cut: A comparison of spousal conflict with \u201c12 rounds up inside the [Madison Square] Garden.\u201d\n\n#19. \"Talking In His Sleep\" (1996)\n\n\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d asks the diva throughout the epicenter track of Secrets. Here, she\u2019s confronted by her adulterous lover who accidentally spills his dirty laundry while snoozing.\n\nAfflicted by a 70s noir-jazz riff, \u201cTalking\u201d takes a page from Madonna\u2019s \u201cJustify My Love,\u201d balancing a scandalous spoken word narrative with a seductive hook.\n\n#18. \"Yesterday\" feat. Trey Songz (2009)\n\nIt\u2019d take five years after Libra -- and a release from Blackground Records -- for Braxton to deliver her next studio album. Serving as the first single from Pulse, the singer gets over her ex (played by Trey Songz on deluxe versions) by labeling him a day of the past. \u201cYesterday\u201d served as a testament to how Braxton manages to maintain her signature blend of genre formats years after her higher charting moments.\n\n#17. \"Hurt You\" feat. Babyface (2014)\n\nWhen Braxton started her singing career in 1989, Babyface became an integral component of her artistry. After going through separate divorces, the duo partnered up for the Grammy-winning concept album Love, Marriage, and Divorce, featuring this apology ballad that topped the Adult R&B Songs chart.\n\n#16. \"Midnite\" (2005)\nThis cut from Libra perfectly captures Braxton\u2019s ability to cruise along with the stripped melodic structuring of her songs. Her ad-libs and riffs shine throughout \u201cMidnite,\u201d making it a pleasant earworm in her deeper catalogue.\n\n#15. \"Love Shoulda Brought You Home\" (1992)\n\nAlthough \u201cGive U My Heart\u201d -- a duet with Babyface -- is credited as Braxton\u2019s official single debut, \u201cLove\u201d receives the honor of her first solo effort. Both songs appeared on the Eddie Murphy rom-com Boomerang, but \u201cLove\u201d would be regarded as the favorite thanks to Braxton\u2019s powerhouse vocal control and dexterity.\n\n#14. \"How Many Ways\" (1993)\n\nReleased as a single in 1994, \u201cHow Many Ways\u201d adequately reflects the finalization of new jack swing and the emerging popularity of its brethren, hip-hop soul.\n\nThe soulful declaration -- co-written and produced by Tamar\u2019s future husband Vincent Hubert -- sees Braxton recounting various ways she loves her man. The single served opposite to its double-A side, the Whitney Houston-esque \u201cI Belong To You.\u201d\n\n#13. \u201cSeven Whole Days\u201d (1993)\n\nRegarded as one of Braxton\u2019s iconic singles, the songstress recalls not knowing her lover\u2019s whereabouts for more than a week.\n\nWritten and produced by her dream team of Babyface and Darryl Simmons, Braxton\u2019s runs are what impressed listeners the most. She would later revisit the song\u2019s idea, slyly mentioning \u201cgoing seven whole days without hearing from you,\u201d on \u201cFinally,\u201d Libra's semi-mash-up of her most famous lyrics.\n\n#12. \u201cJust Be A Man About It\u201d (2000)\n\nSince The Heat was meant to embrace the more progressive sounds of contemporary R&B, Braxton also incorporated a little electro-hop on the album\u2019s second single.\n\nWith the support of a stormy atmosphere and womanizing voicemail delivered by Dr. Dre, the singer\u2019s hurt vocals shine in yet another convincing performance.\n\n#11. \u201cThere\u2019s No Me Without You\u201d (1996)\n\nThis deep cut earnestly emotes despair and a feeling of defeat after a break-up.\n\nHelped by backing vocals of the songwriter, Babyface, this Toni Braxton song\u2019s hook glides with a country twang --  the singer adopting the vocal patterns of the genre with a pristine R&B palette.\n\n#10. \"Take This Ring\" (2005)\n\nImma let you finish Beyonc\u00e9, but Toni Braxton had one of the best \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d of all time.\n\nThree years before we\u2019d receive an official dance and a Spandex-driven anthem from Bey, Braxton released a club banger echoing a similar sentiment. Fortified by a rocking go-go beat -- produced by \u201cCrazy In Love\u201d and \u201c1 Thing\u201d hitmaker Rich Harrison -- this dose of playboy-repellent serves as a faint reminder of a music moment somewhat ahead of its time.\n\n#9. \"Sposed To Be\" (2005)\n\nOn Libra, \u201cTake This Ring\u201d was the upbeat single deserving more; \u201cSposed To Be\u201d was the slow jam that could have been more.\n\nA great candidate for quiet storm or lovemaking playlists, this deep cut radiates an intergalactic tranquility -- and infectious bridge -- highlighting the finesse of Braxton\u2019s later discography.\n\n#8. \"Hands Tied\" (2010)\n\nThe second single of Pulse came as another one of Braxton\u2019s sultrier career moments.\n\nWith an urgent vocal performance, the allure of \u201cHands Tied\u201d exists in its zephyrous keyboard chords. The song also provided a glimpse into the softer side of Warren \u201cOak\u201d Felder, who\u2019d go on to produce for Rihanna and Demi Lovato.\n\n#7. \"Another Sad Love Song\" (1993)\n\nFrom its opening \u201coh\u2019s\u201d and \u201cwoah\u2019s\u201d over a slinky melody, the first official single from Toni Braxton played on R&B\u2019s knack for providing radio with sad tunes.\n\nWith an addictive hook \u201cracking [people\u2019s] brains like crazy,\u201d the song reached No. 7 on the Hot 100 and earned a Grammy for \u201cBest R&B Vocal Performance, Female.\u201d\n\n#6. \"I Love Me Some Him\" (1996)\n\nIf R&B radio is unanimously consistent with playing one Toni Braxton single since its release, \u201cI Love Me Some Him\u201d would hold that title for sure.\n\nRegarded as one of her signatures, the song was released as a double-A side single to the R. Kelly-penned \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To.\u201d The best part exists at the end of this cosmopolitan ode -- Braxton\u2019s vocal harmonizing with the instrumental stealing the show.\n\n#5. \"Find Me A Man\" (1996)\n\nToday, Secrets remains without a skippable track. It also contains the singer\u2019s best deep cut.\n\nIn terms of essential Toni Braxton, \u201cFind Me A Man\u201d shows the singer\u2019s ability to draw listeners into her raw emotion over a cerebral melody. Here heartbreak reigns as the songstress finds herself tired of being alone, dreaming up the irresistible qualities of her Prince Charming.\n\n#4. \"Un-Break My Heart\" (1996)\n\nStanding as one of the greatest power ballads to ever exist, this Hot 100 chart-topper is the central song of Braxton\u2019s career. Vibrant in grandiose-theatrics and a heart-wrenching chorus in the midst of vocal acrobatics, \u201cUn-Break My Heart\u201d would sit at the summit for 11 weeks.\n\n#3. \"Breathe Again\" (1993)\n\nAs these Toni Braxton songs age, this single from her debut still finds its way on R&B rotation today. Sparkling in Sade-centric balladry and Diane Warren lyrics, the breathy chorus and stagnant verses displayed by Braxton execute the song\u2019s intended moodiness.\n\n\u201cBreathe Again\u201d would become a No. 3 hit and earn the singer\u2019s second Grammy win for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female.\n\n#2. \"He Wasn\u2019t Man Enough For Me\" (2000)\n\nThe new millennium might have seen a new look and sound from the diva, but her anthemic spirit remained fervent. In the league of \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d and \u201cIndependent Women, Pt. 1,\u201d this song holds its own rightful spot.\n\nProduced by Rodney \u201cDarkchild\u201d Jerkins, this signature dance bop was blocked from the Hot 100\u2019s top spot by the stronghold of Carlos Santana and The Product G&B\u2019s \u201cMaria Maria.\u201d Today, it\u2019s revisited by those realizing a past flame couldn\u2019t handle it all.\n\n#1. \"Let It Flow\" (1996)\n\nPaired alongside \u201cYou\u2019re Makin\u2019 Me High,\u201d this double A-side single peaked at No. 1 on the Hot 100. Unlike its partnered uptempo jaunt, \u201cLet It Flow\u201d drifts like a slow-running stream guided by the presence of a hypnotizing guitar.\n\nStaying in line with the anthems Braxton has provided prior to and after \u201cLet It Flow,\u201d the song became a mainstay on radio, the Waiting To Exhale Soundtrack, and most importantly Braxton\u2019s performance catalogue.\n\nSimply put, \u201cLet It Flow\u201d could have been done by none other than the superstar herself -- particularly the mesmerizing ending.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/941976", "artist_names": "Lo-Key?
