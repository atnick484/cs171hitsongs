impossible\nImpossible, impossible\n\n[Verse 2]\nFalling out of love is hard\nFalling for betrayal is worse\nBroken trust and broken hearts, I know, I know\nThinking all you need is there\nBuilding

feel a little frisky\nBack roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck\nWe hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town\nStart washing all our worries down the drain\nRain is a good thing\n[Verse 2]\nAren\u2019t nothing like a kiss out back in the barn\nRinging out our soaking clothes, riding out a thunderstorm\nWhen tin roof gets to talking, that's the best love we made\nYeah

this is lycanthropy\nThe moon's awake now, with eyes wide open\nMy body's craving, so feed the hungry\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nI've been devoting myself to you\nMonday to Monday and Friday to Friday\nNot getting enough retribution\nOr decent incentives to keep me at it\nI'm starting to feel just a little abused\nLike a coffee machine in an office (Uh)\nSo I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover\nAnd tell you about it\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a she-wolf in the closet\nOpen up and set it free (Ah-ooh)\nThere's a she-wolf in your closet\nLet it out so it can breathe\n\n[Verse 2]\nSitting across a bar, staring right at her prey\nIt's going well so far, she's gonna get her way\nNocturnal creatures are not so prudent\nThe moon's my teacher and I'm her student\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nTo locate the single men, I got on me a special radar\nAnd the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later\nNot looking for cute little divos or rich city guys\nI just want to enjoy (Uh)\nBy having a very good time\nAnd behave very bad in the arms of a boy\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThere's a she-wolf in the closet\nOpen up and set it free (Ah-ooh)\nThere's a she-wolf in your closet\nLet it out

feelin'\nWhen I kick a bar I'm outside of the strip club belligerent drunk\nKickin' the bricks on the buildin', uh\nYou ain't seen no sicker, no iller chump\nFly girl magnet, I'm infectious; if I have it, your girl has it\nThis verse is Earv Magic\nNobody cares about you swervin' your Mercedes and your OG's\nWho used to do some murders in the 80's\nMy will is the bark, well\nMy will is barking chicks\nI turn around like my wheel is parallel parking\nAside from liquor I don't got many habits\nSo you should tell your American girl\nTo stay away from me like Lenny Kravitz\nY'all either falling off or barely hanging on\nMy chicks pants looks like Shawty Lo's hairline: painted on\nIf you don't like me, so what, I could fight, what\nThat ain't no punchline, I can fight\nTo all the sucker punching this is a sucker punch\nI snuff you from behind, punk, uff you frontin' Thank me later\nIf there's war on my block call me Tim \"The Tool Man\" Taylor\n'Cause you won\u2019t see the face of my neighbor\nHousegang, Shady, we ain't Wu-Tang\nThis is the player circle, and I'm wearing two chains\nGo against me, oppose God\nThis snub barrel lookin' like the .357 just got a nose job\nDetroit, the world feel us\nWe call the murder appeal ya\nWe call the burner a thriller\nWe call tequila quitila, steal you like a B&E\nEvery rapper claim to be a mixture of BIG and Pac; I'm a mixture of me & me\nMy EMG reads GV and TNT\nAnd you can find me twisted on E and E on TMZ\nOr passed out the couch on Media Takeout\nNot carin' what y\u2019all sayin'\nLettin' my balls hang\n[Joe Budden]\nSome dudes drink away the pain, I think of ways to gain\nAnd it happens so naturally you think it's preordained\nStraight from Lyor's Reign, escape from that ball and chain\nCouldn't tell if I was in it for the long haul or fame, wait\nSee, I'm layin' low on the island\nI been learned that saying no is a talent\nJokers want beef but keepin' up is a challenge\nCan't tell if I'm tryna get even or find a balance\nBut I'm much closer, I won't front\nBroads love it, so sober but so blunt\nA charming asshole, want him all the same\nTell him I feel the ice as its forming in my veins\nChasin' the high so much that we both hurtin'\nTo the point it ain't even about the other person\nSo we even, I'm in love with her rear and where I would be\nAnd she in love with the idea of what I could be\nOn top of the world but desire to fall\nBut what's the point of dreamin' big if you acquired it all\nBut if lyricism is back, we helped it spearhead\nIf we orderin' CL's make mine a year ahead\nI skip the club line and don't get turned around\nSo girls come at a high volume I don't turn them down\nNo pregnant broads and no minors, A1 bars with Em as a co-signer\nI hit jeweler without checking the cost yet\nI ain't rich my dude, but peep the way I offset\nDon't be confused by the Bentleys and the Corvettes\nGot stories from my hood that'll rival those of war vets\nJersey City helped 'em mold to what I amounted to\nMy only beef is that they don't hold itself accountable so\nA few resent me, but I'm cool with it\nThey handed me the city before I knew what to do with it\nYou might also like[Crooked I]\nMy strap spark at exact targets\nI'm snatchin' up black markets\nYou whack artists should target your rap argot\nI keep my ice chunky, condos in wine country\nYou know my spine hungry, that mean I'm back starvin'\nBack with the tax-fraudin'\nIllegal stash in the backyard\nAnd I'm plantin' my cash garden while the crack harden\nI might creep through your quiet house\nI'll tie your spouse down by the couch pullin' the iron out\nWhile she hidin' out, she don\u2019t know where the money's hidin' out\nGimme the money before I put this iron snout in your lyin' mouth\nI am out my mind when it come to filling up my accounts with fly amounts\nMight buy an ounce, flip it to get it\n'Cause I am bout that life my G\nMy gun unload, I live by another code\nMy desire, run the globe\nYou thinkin' that you born to be the ish\n'Cause you fell out your mother's other hole\nHail Mother, uh uh, no\nYou don't think that Crooked I's hot\nWhy not, is it cause my Maybach's in your blind spot\nI sleep with one eye open like an insomnia-stricken Cyclops\n'Cause I could rest in that pine box\nI'm on so many drinks don't even count em\nSo high I fall up some stairs instead of down 'em\nSo high call that American Airline\nFlex put us on to tear up his airtime\nYou not a legend like John, move back like his embarrassing hairline\nLet the heir to the chair shine\nThroughout ugliness, the Slaughter's there with me\nIt's all Lovie Smith, my team Bear with me\nStill I'm feeling like an organ donor\nSo many people dying to get a part of me\nLike I was born with a rare kidney\nBut come and get me, I leave you down under somewhere in Sydney\nA different kind of chopper, I'm still airlifting\nSee my momma named me Dominick\nThat\u2019s synonymous with ominous\nI'm in this game to show you what drama is\nI'm in this game to conquer it\nGenghis Khan in this monstrous entourage\nWhat challenger can dodge my barrage\nLook at the DuPont registry: that's my garage\nConvertible Beamer paint blacker than Amistad\nHear the engine noise, I\u2019m ballin' with different toys and\nStill I rap like Kool G when he was spittin' poison\nMy pen game is sick: call it penicillin\nSince sky's the limit, this the flow that could kill a ceiling\nYou guys are gimmicks, hide your women\nCrooked's into Virginia drillin'\nThe realest women they feel the villain\nI'm fill 'em with big pimpin', even virgins\nI lose a leg: I throw a shoe on my third one\nLook how easy the words come\nI'm the West Coast savior\nWhy you think they yellin' church when the verse done?\nSpeakin' of church, I'm from the city where sinners dwell\nSinister LBC, I came to give \u2018em Hell\nI'm judgin' day, I'm judgin' all you infidels\nSippin' Zinfandel, my liquor be off the Richter Scale\nI'm here to intercept mics like I gotta pick from Vick in the NFL\nLive Flamboyant until I'm Big as L\nAnd on that T.R.H.O\u2026 ahhhhh\n[Joell Ortiz]\nNew York you have now tuned in to the four illest\nLyricist on the planet moving for-ward\nI foresee our forthcoming album less than four months\nYou been forewarned so make room on the forefront\nAnd me I'm the YAOWA of the wrecking crew\nSpeak to your feet if I'm who you thinking 'bout stepping to\n'Cause I ain't only nice with the flow\nI'm nice toe to toe blood'll fly out your nose\nIf you wonder why your ho looking\nLike a seamstress from Bed-Stuy I'm sew Brooklyn\nShe like the way I lace up the macs\nThe sag on the trues and shake through the snaps\nAnd if I ever scrape it's a wrap\nShe'll be dripping like a fountain no mountain just breaking her back\nSpeaking of beating I'm a ape on the track\nYou in the jungle with bananas placed on your hat\nIf you rhyme it ain't safe for you scrap\nUnless it's an old Biggie verse don't put Faith in your raps\nI'm in the spot doing my hammer dance\nLike New York's Mom on Flavor of Love you don't stand a chance\nEverybody with me be waiting to dump\nYour homie imitating Flex they faking the funk\nCooper Projects what up y'all\nYeah I'll be at the next poker game with a buck y'all\nDamn right I still be's in the trenches\nI'm hood I can fall asleep on the benches\nI'm not a rap dude I'm a dude who rap\nBefore this man, y'all saw the cypher\nWhole awards was hyper\nI'm just looking at the game is bad\n'Cause I'm board and I'm running out of ways to brag\nHow many times I said I'm nicer than\nOr I'm better than much harder or way more clever than\nArmed and sick I'm such a veteran\nMan I'm about to make ringtone rap and watch my cheddar spin\n'Cause when you're too nice you're underground\nThat's funny cause Eminem gave me money for not dumbing down\nDummies bet you dumb-out off our dumb sales\nOr how the name spread like dum-dum shells\nAnd if you wanna know why hating is dumb, well\nFor one thing I'm underneath 110 dumbbells\nShorty I'll knock your head off your collar bone\nSnap your spine play your ribs like a xylophone\nDon't mind me I'm just on one\nNot drugs I mean a mic and when I'm on this I'm gone son\nI don't know where I go but I am not here\nShorty giving me Chewbacca I'm rubbing her Spock ears\nBeam me up like a good blast; spaced out we come back y'all in hood class\nPay attention it's an A if you thoro\nBe real with your click\nDon't let me C you with the D's cause that's a F if you snitch\nWanna graduate with honors cock back and spray\nThe llama at your drama\nLet your hard work slap your baby mamma\nIn the face, in the face of defeat yo\nI always find a way to win I'm Tim Tebow\nI can't quit I'm too proud with a big ego\nRoyce told me I'ma go Hollywood\nHe right, cause I'm gon' see all the nonbelievers and be like\nHaha vroom vroom vroom goodnight\nAnd pull off in a sick (Fe)rrari All you see is paper plates like a kid's party\nAnd a thick Barbie\nI'm one quarter of the Slaughterhouse\nBut all alone I'm four quarters of New York and what its all about\nIf you on the Island bang on your cell\nIf you want the streets wildin' dog you bang for Joell\nY A O W A I'ma tell everybody in the world the proper way it gets spelled\nI ain't going no where so get use to me\nIf you can't stomach me cool go ahead and puke from me\nI don't give a fuck though truthfully\nI'm so stuck being a booth bully\nPolo tucked under my Guc' hoodie\nWe all God's kids, but I'm a chosen one\nHe took his time with me he said \"I'm almost done\"\nI just wanna make his brain murder\nAnd add a little more down there\nSo when he stroke he can go way further\nShe bonin' me cause you can't hurt her\nYou ain't got nathan on my frankfurter\nI'm a good MC might go to Guitar Center cop a good MP\nAnd find a good loop\nHit the drum pad\nAnd rhyme as hard as my biological son's dad\nWow, SMH-LMAO\nY'all gotta be JK do I say what I say yo\nI can miracley whip up a hundred like Mayo\nWhen I'm just trying to shoot for 50 Tony Yayo\n\n[Royce Da 5\u20199\"]\nNow Ryan's wit is electric like appliances\nNow let the iron fist wreck ya, I insist\nI'm here to tap some draws, tap some jaws\nBallin', as for y'all I'm here to palm the whole globe like a basketball\nThey told me I was gold; I ain't react at all\nI'm staying hungry like Em while these ho's act in awe\nF money but tell the government give me some since they print it\nI'ma schizophrenic, mental clinic, pencil penning\nPimp lieutenant living the life in which if you flinch you in it\nQuit your pretending you here to be saved I'm simple-y sent to be sinnin'\nYour minds on bitter your vibes on Twitter\nCheck my file my resume is verified on Twitter\nYour jeans got a coochie under it\nI'll hang up sign that says your place\nWith a arrow pointin' down and put you under it\nI been a vet reppin' since Eminem's test record\nAnd it was better then any of our enemy's best efforts\nAnd it was just us then, we been the best bet den\nWe stay on top of our green like vinaigrette dressing\nI gotta right hand, it's Debo cold\nRun into me playin' and end up with Steve-O's nose\nI will leave you where you riffin' at, yelling take that\nWhile I click-and-clack two guns that I nicknamed This and That\nI play the tune of violence for hours with the same gun\nThat Nas used in I Gave You Power, Rewind - listen back\nThe damn drum'll leave you in the can with your Samsung\nCan put a foot in your mouth, without a damn tongue\nYou plus one on the list at the club\nWith your boy don't give you the right to challenge a pro, you And1\nI don't got no story\nAll I know is I'm quick to pop and put that boy\nIn a hole turn his body to a suppository\nWhile y'all hard I'm rolling alone\nI get your broad pregnant then I pay to abort it with a card over the phone\n\n[Joe Budden]\nI predict the top MC's taking a dive this year\nWhen that album drop how they gon' survive this year\nSee New York and New Jersey being live this year\nWith my Knicks beating Miami in five this year\nI be thinking bout how far dude came sitting court side\nBeat trial with my Co-D on the court side\nPorsche fly tell the naysayers let the thought die\nHat low bloggers tend to watch him with a hawk eye\nSpit from the heart and the listeners incline\nTo believe that I can't be one of a kind\n'Cause to say that would insist this kind of realness existed before my time\nSo the circumstance is different for this prisoner of the mind\nWhere there's corrupt CO's barely touch C-Notes\nCuffs and keyholes inflating voluptuous egos\nBars can't hold me and the judge can't control me\nUnlimited tobacco now who got the rollies\nGet froggy but I'm not the guy at all\nIt'll be occupy the funeral occupy the morgue\nCatch him off guard he sleep when a killer walk in\n2 shots mussled by feathers now he pillow talking\nBrave move tryin' test my resolve with no grind\nCome Showtime I'm like Dexter to y'all\nJust based off what I'm hearing from the rest of New York\nQuite honestly I should be the best by default\nBut rappers are sensitive so the tension is felt\nThey let me list on the shelf I'm supposed to mention myself\nSo all I think about while I'm inching to wealth\nIs how's Tyler, The Creator when I keep reinventing myself\nKeep my name outta rumors I really use to hear a lot\nLeft a model got models trying to get near the spot\nBut I treat girls like gang members, think I care or not\nIf she got no body, I don't wanna see a tear drop\nNo Barbie's just Jessica Rabbits\nGave her the best pipe ever and she deaded her Rabbit\nDon't care that she's anti social\nMy Darren Sproiles boo she do what the last Bush was supposed to\nThey don't like me 'cause I be where the dykes be\nI ain't with the game so I catch em on a bye week\nGet it more bars more torture\nThe game needed change so Em gave em 4 quarters\nWatch how we generate watch who you implicate\nDissing me is only gon' instigate goons that would love to let the Inf spray\nPut them young boys in your bathroom\nBe mindful of what your Penn State\nHe should know he got no wins beefing\nNo hype for his career he got no ends meeting\nTruck is a 0 12 I ain't low end speeding\nExterior's eggnog Joey so in season\nCopy collect weapons as a hobby, in your lobby they gon' probably\nThink I'm crazy if I end up with a body\nThink I'm off course cause standing over the corpse\nWithout cause screaming \"This was only supposed to be a robbery\"\nYeah Joey, undisputed man in Jers'\nIf you understand words with talent you can't curb\nBut come and see him if you looking for that tan work\nKnow about my prices out in Denver even Sam Hurd\nJoey, Jersey what up\n\n[Crooked I]\nYou never picture me clicking with Brooklyn's merge\nIn the Murder Mitten when you heard him spittin'\nYou didn't know that the world was getting an introduction to pure destruction\nA circle with murderous verbal written's or serving

down\nMan there's so many times\nI don't know what I'm doin'\nLike I don't know now\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nAnd by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes\nSays it's funny how the night can make you blind\nI can just imagine (imagine)\nAnd I don't know what I'm supposed to do\nBut if she feels bad then I do too\nSo I let her be\n[Chorus]\nAnd she says 'ooh\nI can't take no more'\nHer tears like diamonds on the floor\nAnd her diamonds bring me down\nCause I can't help her now\nShe's down in it\nShe tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard\nTo see them on the ground\nHer diamonds falling down\nWay down (way down)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell she sits down and stares into the distance\nAnd it takes all night (all night)\nAnd I know I could break her concentration\nOh, but it don't feel right\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nSo by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes\nSits down on the bed and starts to cry\nAnd there's something less about her\nAnd I don't know what I'm supposed to do\nSo I sit down and I cry too\nBut don't let her see\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd she says ooh\nI can't take no more\nHer tears like diamonds on the floor\nAnd her diamonds bring me down\nCause I can't help

eyes\nIf she can find daylight\nThen she'll be all right\nShe'll be all right\nJust not tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd she says ooh\nI can't take no more\nHer tears like diamonds on the floor\nAnd her diamonds bring me down\nCause I can't help her now\nShe's down in it\nShe tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard\nTo see them on the ground\nHer diamonds falling\nOh I can't take no more\nHer

I'm a music man\nI grew up in east Tennessee\nLast night I was everything\nWhen I got a few drinks in me\nI was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son\nBrad Pitt's brother and a man on the run\nAnything I thought would get the job done\n\n[Chorus 2]\nYeah, we went went out last night\nOne thing started leading to another\nOut last night\nHitting on everybody and their mother\nThere were people doing
