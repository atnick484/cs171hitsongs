on the back of my hand\nI called her up\nI was all out of breath\nI said\n\"Come hear me play in my rock and roll band\"\n\nI took a shower\nAnd I put on my best blue jeans\nI picked her up in my new VW van\nShe wore a peasant blouse with nothing underneath\nI said \"Hi\"\nShe said, \"Yeah, I guess I am\"\n\n[Chorus:]\nAriel\nAriel\n\n[Verse 2:]\nWe had a little time\nWe were real hungry\nWe went to Dairy Queen for something to eat\nShe had some onion rings\nShe had a pickle\nShe forgot to tell me how she didn't eat meat\nYou might also likeI had a gig in the American Legion hall\nIt was a dance for the Volunteer Ambulance Corps\nShe was sitting in a corner against the wall\nShe would smile\nAnd I melted all over the floor\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\nAriel\nAriel\n\n[Verse 3:]\nI took her home with me\nWe watched some TV\nAnnette Funicello and some guy going steady\nI started fooling around with the verticle\nWe got the munchies\nSo I made some spaghetti\n\nWe sat and we talked into the night\nWhile channel two was signing off the air\nI found the softness of a mouth\nWe made love\nThe bombs bursting in air\nAriel\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\nAriel\nAriel\nWay on the other side of the

let me tell you, I love you\nLet me hold you close and say these words as gently as I can\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere's been another man that I've needed and I've loved\nBut that doesn't mean I love you less\nAnd he knows he can't possess me and he knows he never will\nThere's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill\n[Chorus]\nTorn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool\nLovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules\nTorn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool\nLovin' you both is breakin' all the rules\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou mustn't think you've failed me\nJust because there's someone else\nYou were the first real love I ever had\nAnd all the things I ever said, I swear they still are true\nFor no one else can have the part of me I gave to you\n\n[Chorus]\nTorn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool\nLovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules\nTorn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool\nLovin' you both is breakin' all the rules\n\n[Bridge]\nI couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away\nBut with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay\n\n[Outro]\nTorn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool\nLovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules\nTorn

today\nI finally made a tricky French connection\nYou winked and gave me your o.k\n\nI'll take you on a trip beside the ocean\nAnd drop the top at Chesapeake Bay\nAin't nothing like the sky to dose a potion\nThe moon'll send you on your way\n[Chorus]\nMoonlight\nFeels right\nMoonlight\nFeels right\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe'll lay back and observe the constellations\nAnd watch the moon smilin' bright\nI'll play the radio on southern stations\nCause southern belles are hell at night\n\nYou say you came to Baltimore from Ole Miss\nClass of seven four gold ring\nThe eastern moon looks ready for a wet kiss\nTo make the tide rise again\n\n[Chorus]\nMoonlight\nFeels right\nMoonlight\nFeels right\n\n[Bridge]\n[Instrumental]\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nWe'll see the sun come up on Sunday morning\nAnd watch it fade the moon away\nI guess you know I'm giving you a warning\nCause me and noon are itching to play\n\nI'll take you on a trip beside the ocean\nAnd drop the top at Chesapeake

Paso Lyrics[Verse 1]\nOut in the West Texas town of El Paso\nI fell in love with a Mexican girl\nNighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina\nMusic would play and Feleena would whirl\n\n[Verse 2]\nBlacker than night were the eyes of Feleena\nWicked and evil while casting her spell\nMy love was deep for this Mexican maiden\nI was in love, but in vain, I could tell\n[Chorus 1]\nOne night, a wild young cowboy came in\nWild as the West Texas wind\nDashing and daring, a drink he was sharing\nWith wicked Feleena, the girl that I love\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo in anger, I challenged his right for the love of this maiden\nDown went his hand for the gun that he wore\nMy challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat\nThe handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor\n[Full-Length Version - Verse 4]\nJust for a moment, I stood there in silence\nShocked by the foul, evil deed I had done\nMany thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there\nI had but one chance, and that was to run\n\n[Chorus 2]\nOut through the back door of Rosa's, I ran\nOut where the horses were tied\nI caught a good one, it looked like it could run\nUp on its back, and away I did ride\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nJust as fast as I could\nFrom the West Texas town of El Paso\nOut to the badlands of New Mexico\nYou might also like[Verse 5]\nBack in El Paso my life would be worthless\nEverything's gone in life, nothing is left\nIt's been so long since I've seen the young maiden\nMy love is stronger than my fear of death\n\n[Chorus 3]\nI saddled up, and away I did go\nRiding alone in the dark\nMaybe tomorrow a bullet may find me\nTonight, nothing's worse than this pain in my heart\n\n[Verse 6]\nAnd at last, here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso\nI can see Rosa's Cantina below\nMy love is strong and it pushes me onward\nDown off the hill to Feleena, I go\n\n[Verse 7]\nOff to my right I see five mounted cowboys\nOff to my left ride a dozen or more\nShouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me\nI have to make it to Rosa's back door\n\n[Chorus 4]\nSomething is dreadfully wrong, for I feel\nA deep burning pain in my side\nThough I am trying to stay in the saddle\nI'm getting weary, unable to ride\n[Verse 8]\nBut my love for Feleena is strong, and I rise where I've fallen\nThough I am weary, I can't stop to rest\nI see the white puff of smoke from the rifle\nI feel the bullet go deep in my chest\n\n[Outro]\nFrom out of nowhere, Feleena has found me\nKissing my cheek as she kneels by my side\nCradled by two loving arms that I'll die for\nOne little kiss, and Feleena, goodbye13Embed"},

comments, leave me out the nonsense\nSpeakin' out of context, people need some content\nNiggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest\nWhippin' Benz concept\nHeaven-sent, God-sent\nLeast that's what my mom says\nProof is in the progress, money's not a object\nBusy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get\nBarkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get\nHaven't fallen off yet, yee\nCome with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper\nThe earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature\nDeposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia\nShe came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser\nForty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva\nYeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza\nYeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus\nBut soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us\n[Chorus: Drake]\nSins, I got sins on my mind\nAnd some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind\nAnd my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind\nI'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time\nAnd they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind\nI got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind\nAnd my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind\nShould repent, I need me some Jesus in my life\nAmen\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Baby]\nI'm from the four, but I love me a threesome\nDM her, delete it, she my lil' secret\nHe tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it\nI can't respond, we just go at your people\nIf I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it\nThis shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it\nMy shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it\nA shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes\nI hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it\nI grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it\nI'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description\nI like to pour, so I get the prescription\nWe walk around with them bands in our britches\nThis gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'\nI'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'\nBut I'll send a hit while I chill with my children\nBigger the business, the bigger the office\nI fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up\nThey call for my artists, they makin' me offers\nI don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom\nI lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada\nI woke up the followin' day and went harder\nI'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter\nI gotta get money, I love to get charter\nI gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter\nI can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up\nI'm screamin' out \"YOLO,\" yeah, that's still the motto\nI know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $134You might also like[Chorus: Drake]\nSins, I got sins on my mind\nAnd some M's, got

roarin'\nYeah, yeah\nYou know how I'm coming\nYou know how\u2005I'm\u2005coming\n\n[Verse 1]\nBend her over,\u2005then I murk her\nCall Gunna if\u2005you want you a Birkin\n\"Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses\nI be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses\"\nI can't even lie, you ain't my type\nYou ain't even all that fine in person\nI can guarantee you if you my kind\nShe got every bag you can imagine\nBig house, I can really be braggin'\nHundred thousand in my mouth like, \"What's happenin'?\"\nNot the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'\nHe ain't me, you can keep the comparisons\nMy bitch probably one of the baddest\nGood girl, turned her into a savage\nDispatch, got a problem in traffic\nWe came through in matching G-Wagens\nLow-key, I've been keeping it classy\nCould be really out here doin' 'em nasty\nNiggas couldn't even see me in last year\nJust started and them niggas in last gear\nI ain't even try to and I passed 'em\nGiving looks, I contribute to fashion\nDrop a song, I be giving them captions\nStand alone, not your regular rapper\n[Chorus]\nBrand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)\nYou ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend\nSee me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect\nWork hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah\nYeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah\nMatter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah\nPost my drip up daily just so they can see, woah\nTurn me up some more so my haters can hear it, woah (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go\nShe hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road\nShe know how I get when I get in that mode\nAin't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes\nWanna do shows and make me some songs\nMake sure that other shit come in, get sold\nWe fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles\nWe play with our money and not with our nose\nI used to go to the West to get loads\nI just came back from the West with a trophy\nI'm on some more shit\nShe said she miss it and sendin' emojis\nNo time to kick it, I'm always in motion\nCan't say I miss you, I don't got emotions\nI'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit\nI'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit\nI'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit\nAin't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit\nI'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it\nI know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless\nIf you tell 'em what was said, you a rodent\nDrive the new Corvette like it's stolen, yeah\nSee Lil Baby LiveGet tickets as low as $120You might also like[Chorus]\nBrand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)\nYou ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend\nSee me and get nervous, I damn near did it

Patr\u00f3n\nAnd I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM\nSay it in the street, that's a knock-out\nBut you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out\nAnd I'm just like, \"Hey, are you okay?\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression\nBut I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun\nAnd snakes and stones never broke my bones\n[Chorus]\nSo oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\nYou need to calm down, you're being too loud\nAnd I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)\nYou need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?\nYou need to calm down\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou are somebody that we don't know\nBut you're comin' at my friends like a missile\nWhy are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)\nSunshine on the street at the parade\nBut you would rather be in the dark ages\nMakin' that sign must've taken all night\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace\nAnd control your urges to scream about all the people you hate\n'Cause shade never made anybody less gay\n\n[Chorus]\nSo oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\nYou need to calm down, you're being too loud\nAnd I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)\nYou need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?\nYou need to calm down\nSee Taylor Swift

Galak\nSi \u00e7a fonctionne pas, j'passe au rock \u00e0 la Barrett Syd\nMes potes sont des vrais, pas des gratteurs de garette-ci\n\u00c7a cherche des m\u00e9thodes pour du talent, pourtant y en a

when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills\nYou know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright\nInstead of asking him how much of your time is left\nAsk him how much of your mind, babe\n'Cause in this life\nThings are much harder than in the afterworld\nIn this life\nYou're on your own\nAnd if de-elevator tries to bring you down\nGo crazy (Punch a higher floor)\nWhoo\n[Verse 1]\nIf you don't like\nThe world you're living in\nTake a look around\nAt least you got friends\nYou see, I called my old lady\nFor a friendly word\nShe picked up the phone\nDropped it on the floor\n\"Ah, ah,\" is all

let's go\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe're all excited\nBut we don't know why\nMaybe it's 'cause\nWe're all gonna die\nAnd when we do (When we do)\nWhat's it all for?

happens here when midnight rolls around\nBut layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain\nAnd I ain't anywhere close to tired\nYour kiss has got me wired\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis\nHigh on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight\nIt's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again\nWe'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane\nThe sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train\nWe'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind\nWe don't have to go home, we can leave the night on\nWe can leave the night on\n[Verse 2]\nNow all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22\nBaby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too\nNow all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go\nOur soundtrack's in the stereo\nThe DJ's on a roll\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis\nHigh on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight\nIt's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again\nWe'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane\nThe sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train\nWe'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind\nWe don't have to go home, we can leave the night on\nWe can leave the night on\n\n[Bridge]\nThe sun'll steal the magic from us soon\nSo let's take one more trip around the moon\n\n[Chorus 2]\nGirl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis\nHigh on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight\nIt's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally\nWe'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane\nThe sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train\nWe'll be rolling down the
