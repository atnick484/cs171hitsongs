planned to marry when June brought the summer\nI couldn't wait to make Patches my bride\nNow I don't see how that ever can happen\nMy folks say \"No\" and my heart breaks inside\n\nPatches, oh what can I do\nI swear I'll always love you\nBut a girl from that place\nWould just bring me disgrace\nSo my folks won't let me love you\nEach night I cry as I think of that shanty\nAnd pretty Patches there watching the door\nShe dosn't know that I can't come to see her\nPatches must think that I love her no more\n\nI hear a neighbour telling my father\nHe says a girl name of Patches was found\nFloating face down in that dirty old river\nThat flows by the coal yards in Old Shanty Town\n\nPatches, oh what can I do\nI swear I'll always love you\nIt may not be right\nBut I'll join you

drill on the op, no clones I see dots\nACG's, Free the Guys shirt, and one pair of rocks\nI'm on the block\nHope my tape don't flop, and it go gold when it drop\nI'm not a liar, start D'ing them baggies, and we risking indictment\nJust to get flier than a first class ticket, United\n300, O'block\nMurder murder, kill kill, in the jam I'll never squeal\nMy label only time I deal\nI fuck with G's, B's, Moes, Kings,  Snakes, 4's and the niggas under Neal\nSilver spoon, you don't know how hunger feel\nDreaming 'bout 100 mil, step on that curb with 100 pills\nWestern Union money to bro and

Lyrics[Intro]\nHere's my story, it's sad but true\nIt's about a girl that I once knew\nShe took my love, then ran around\nWith every single guy in town\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah, I should have known it from the very start\nThis girl would leave me with a broken heart\nNow listen people what I'm telling you\nI'd keep away from a Runaround Sue, yeah\nI might miss her lips and the smile on her face\nThe touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace\nSo if you don't wanna cry like I do\nI'd keep away from a Runaround Sue\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe likes to travel around, yeah\nShe'll love you and she'll put you down\nNow people let me put you wise\nSue goes out with other guys\n\n[Chorus]\nHere's the moral and the story from the guy who knows\nI fell in love and my love still grows\nAsk any fool that she ever knew, they'll say\nKeep away from a Runaround Sue\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah, keep away from this girl\nI know, know what she'll do\nKeep away from Sue\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe likes to travel around, yeah\nShe'll love you and she'll put you down\nNow people let me put you wise\nShe goes out with other guys\n\n[Chorus]\nHere's the moral and the story from the guy who knows\nI fell in love and my

wanna sing along\nAnd though he maybe gets the tune alittle wrong\nHe still goes (boogie-on-na-day)\nHe isn't too young to really feel the beat\nHe rocks back and forth in his little seat\nHe claps both his hands and he taps his feet\nAnd he sings (doo-doo-da-da-da-da-da)\n\nHe is a hully-gully-bouncin-baby-boy\nYou know the record player is his favorite toy\nAnd dont forget hes eveybodys pride and joy\nWhen he goes (ooo-ah-ge-he)\n\n(Yo-a-ah-ah)\n\n(Ladaladalada)\n\nI know there isnt anyone to take a bet\nBut surely hes the youngest teenager yet\nAnd probably the hippest of the diaper set\nCause he goes (go man, I like that!)\n\nHe strolls in his stroller with the radio on\nHe doesn't go to sleep until the musics gone\nHe imitates the singer in the group\nWith a low down voice (dug-a-dug-a)\n\nAnd when its time to tuck him in his little bed\nWith all that music runnin through his sleepy head\nThe little fella doesnt say goodnight\nInstead, but he says (boog-ooo, boog-ooo,

best friend both die with him\nAs likely as not\nIn half of the other songs\nSome Cat's crying or ready to die\nWe've lost most of our happy people\nAnd I'm wondering why\n\nLet's think about living\nLet's think about loving\nLet's think about the whoopin'\nAnd hoppin and boppin'\nAnd the lovie, lovie dovin'\nLet's forget about the whinin' and the cryin'\nAnd the shooting and the

sweetest girl I've\nSeen\"\n\"Some day we're gonna marry and you'll be my pineapple queen\"\nI saw a boy on Oahu isle\nFloatin' down the bay on a crocodile\nHe waved at me and he swam ashore\nAnd I knew he'd be mine forevermore\nCHORUS\nHe sings his song from banana trees\nHe even sings to me on his water skis\nWe went skin-divin' and beneath the blue\nHe sang and played his ukulele, too\n\"Pineapple princess\", I love you, you're the sweetest girl I've\nSeen\n\"Some day we're gonna marry and you'll be my pineapple queen\"\nWe'll settle down in a bamboo hut\nAnd he will be my own

(Yeah)\nHe wore a pair of cowboy boots\n[Verse 3]\nHe busted on through the doorway (Yeah-yeah)\nBad as he could be (Yeah-yeah)\nPulled out his pistol, he turned around\nHe said, \"My name is a Big Boy Pete\"\n\n[Bridge 1]\nThe music stopped\nThere wasn't a sound\nA-over in the corner stood-a\nBad Man Brown\nBrown smiled a grin\nHe said, 'My friend\n('You take your three steps forward\nAnd I'm 'onna, do you in\")\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow, Pete said, \"A-look it here, buddy (Yeah-yeah)\n'Fore I tan your hide\" (Yeah-yeah)\nI got a .45 to keep me alive\nSeven bullets on my side\n\n[Bridge 2]\nBrown pulled a knife\nHe jumped on Pete\nThey fought from the counter\nRight on out to the street\nThey swung from north\nThey swung from south\nBrown cut that black cigar\nRight outta Pete's mouth\nPete hit the ground\nHe yelled and screamed\nPete took his Stetson hat\nAnd beat the scene\nYou might also like[Verse 5]\nNow, if you're ever down on the corner (Yeah-yeah)\nDown on-a honky tonk street

"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Jeffrey-eugenides"}, "artist": "Jeffrey Eugenides", "lyrics": "The Marriage Plot LyricsTo start with, look at all the books. There were her Edith Wharton novels, arranged not by title but date of publication; there was the complete Modern Library set of Henry James, a gift from her father on her twenty-first birthday; there were the dog-eared paperbacks assigned in her college courses, a lot of Dickens, a smidgen of Trollope, along with good helpings of Austen, George Eliot, and the redoubtable Bront\u00eb sisters.\n\nThere were a whole lot of black-and-white New Directions paperbacks, mostly poetry by people like H.D. or Denise Levertov.There were the Colette novels she read on the sly.\n\nThere was the first edition of Couples, belonging to her mother, which Madeleine had surreptitiously dipped into back in sixth grade and which she was using now to provide textual support in her English honors thesis on the marriage plot.\n\nThere was, in short, this mid-size but still portable library representing pretty much everything Madeleine had read in college, a collection of texts, seemingly chosen at random, whose focus slowly narrowed, like a personality test, a sophisticated one you couldn\u2019t trick by anticipating the implications of its questions and finally got so lost in that your only recourse was to answer the simple truth.\n\nAnd then you waited for the result, hoping for \u201cArtistic,\u201d or \u201cPassionate,\u201d thinking you could live with \u201cSensitive,\u201d secretly fearing \u201cNarcissistic\u201d and \u201cDomestic,\u201d but finally being presented with an outcome that cut both ways and made you feel different depending on the day, the hour, or the guy you happened to be dating: \u201cIncurably Romantic.\u201d\n\nThese were the books in the room where Madeleine lay, with a pillow over her head, on the morning of her college graduation. She\u2019d read each and every one, often multiple times, frequently underlining passages, but that was no help to her now.\nMadeleine was trying to ignore the room and everything in it. She was hoping to drift back down into the oblivion where she\u2019d been safely couched for the last three hours.\n\nAny higher level of wakefulness would force her to come to grips with certain disagreeable facts: for instance, the amount and variety of the alcohol she\u2019d imbibed last night, and the fact that she\u2019d gone to sleep with her contacts in.\n\nThinking about such specifics would, in turn, call to mind the reasons she\u2019d drunk so much in the first place, which she definitely didn\u2019t want to do. And so Madeleine adjusted her pillow, blocking out the early morning light, and tried to fall back to sleep.\n\nBut it was useless. Because right then, at the other end of her apartment, the doorbell began to ring.\n\nEarly June, Providence, Rhode Island, the sun up for almost two hours already, lighting up the pale bay and the smokestacks of the Narragansett Electric factory, rising like the sun on the Brown University seal emblazoned on all the pennants and banners draped up over campus, a sun with a sagacious face, representing knowledge.\n\nBut this sun\u2014the one over Providence\u2014was doing the metaphorical sun one better, because the founders of the university, in their Baptist pessimism, had chosen to depict the light of knowledge enshrouded by clouds, indicating that ignorance had not yet been dispelled from the human realm, whereas the actual sun was just now fighting its way through cloud cover, sending down splintered beams of light and giving hope to the squadrons of parents, who\u2019d been soaked and frozen all weekend, that the unseasonable weather might not ruin the day\u2019s festivities.\n\nAll over College Hill, in the geometric gardens of the Georgian mansions, the magnolia-scented front yards of Victorians, along brick sidewalks running past black iron fences like those in a Charles Addams cartoon or a Lovecraft story; outside the art studios at the Rhode Island School of Design, where one painting major, having stayed up all night to work, was blaring Patti Smith; shining off the instruments (tuba and trumpet, respectively) of the two members of the Brown marching band who had arrived early at the meeting point and were nervously looking around, wondering where everyone else was; brightening the cobblestone side streets that led downhill to the polluted river, the sun was shining on every brass doorknob, insect wing, and blade of grass.\n\nAnd, in concert with the suddenly flooding light, like a starting gun for all the activity, the doorbell in Madeleine\u2019s fourth-floor apartment began, clamorously, insistently, to ring.\n\nThe pulse reached her less as a sound than as a sensation, an electric shock shooting up her spine. In one motion Madeleine tore the pillow off her head and sat up in bed. She knew who was ringing the buzzer.\n\nIt was her parents. She\u2019d agreed to meet Alton and Phyllida for breakfast at 7:30. She\u2019d made this plan with them two months ago, in April, and now here they were, at the appointed time, in their eager, dependable way.\n\nThat Alton and Phyllida had driven up from New Jersey to see her graduate, that what they were here to celebrate today wasn\u2019t only her achievement but their own as parents, had nothing wrong or unexpected about it.\n\nThe problem was that Madeleine, for the first time in her life, wanted no part of it. She wasn\u2019t proud of herself. She was in no mood to celebrate. She\u2019d lost faith in the significance of the day and what the day represented.\n\nShe considered not answering. But she knew that if she didn\u2019t answer, one of her roommates would, and then she\u2019d have to explain where she\u2019d disappeared to last night, and with whom. Therefore, Madeleine slid out of the bed and reluctantly stood up.\nThis seemed to go well for a moment, standing up. Her head felt curiously light, as if hollowed out. But then the blood, draining from her skull like sand from an hourglass, hit a bottleneck, and the back of her head exploded in pain.\n\nIn the midst of this barrage, like the furious core from which it emanated, the buzzer erupted again.\n\nShe came out of her bedroom and stumbled in bare feet to the intercom in the hall, slapping the SPEAK button to silence the buzzer.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Didn\u2019t you hear the bell?\u201d It was Alton\u2019s voice, as deep and commanding as ever, despite the fact that it was issuing from a tiny speaker.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI was in the shower.\u201d\n\n\u201cLikely story. Will you let us in, please?\u201d\n\nMadeleine didn\u2019t want to. She needed to wash up first.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming down,\u201d she said.\n\nThis time, she held down the SPEAK button too long, cutting off Alton\u2019s response. She pressed it again and said, \u201cDaddy?\u201d but while she was speaking, Alton must have been speaking, too, because when she pressed LISTEN all that came through was static.\n\nMadeleine took this pause in communications to lean her forehead against the door frame. The wood felt nice and cool.\n\nThe thought struck her that, if she could keep her face pressed against the soothing wood, she might be able to cure her headache, and if she could keep her forehead pressed against the door frame for the rest of the day, while somehow still being able to leave the apartment, she might make it through breakfast with her parents, march in the commencement procession, get a diploma, and graduate.\n\nShe lifted her face and pressed speak again.\n\u201cDaddy?\u201d\n\nBut it was Phyllida\u2019s voice that answered. \u201cMaddy? What\u2019s the matter? Let us in.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy roommates are still asleep. I\u2019m coming down. Don\u2019t ring the bell anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to see your apartment!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now. I\u2019m coming down. Don\u2019t ring.\u201d\n\nShe took her hand from the buttons and stood back, glaring at the intercom as if daring it to make a sound. When it didn\u2019t, she started back down the hall. She was halfway to the bathroom when her roommate Abby emerged, blocking the way.\n\nShe yawned, running a hand through her big hair, and then, noticing Madeleine, smiled knowingly.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Abby said, \u201cwhere did you sneak off to last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents are here,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI have to go to breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on. Tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell. I\u2019m late.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re wearing the same clothes, then?\u201d\n\nInstead of replying, Madeleine looked down at herself. Ten hours earlier, when she\u2019d borrowed the black Betsey Johnson dress from Olivia, Madeleine had thought it looked good on her. But now the dress felt hot and sticky, the fat leather belt looked like an S&M restraint, and there was a stain near the hem that she didn\u2019t want to identify.\n\nAbby, meanwhile, had knocked on Olivia\u2019s door and entered. \u201cSo much for Maddy\u2019s broken heart,\u201d she said. \u201cWake up! You\u2019ve got to see this.\u201d\n\nThe path to the bathroom was clear. Madeleine\u2019s need for a shower was extreme, almost medical. At a minimum, she had to brush her teeth.\n\nBut Olivia\u2019s voice was audible now. Soon Madeleine would have two roommates interrogating her. Her parents were liable to start ringing again any minute. As quietly as possible, she inched back down the hall.\n\nShe stepped into a pair of loafers left by the front door, crushing the heels flat as she caught her balance, and escaped into the outer corridor.\n\nThe elevator was waiting at the end of the floral runner. Waiting, Madeleine realized, because she\u2019d failed to close the sliding gate when she\u2019d staggered out of the thing a few hours earlier.\n\nNow she shut the gate securely and pressed the button for the lobby, and with a jolt the antique contraption began to descend through the building\u2019s interior gloom.\n\nMadeleine\u2019s building, a Neo-Romanesque castle called the Narragansett that wrapped around the plunging corner of Benefit Street and Church Street, had been built at the turn of the century.\n\nAmong its surviving period details\u2014the stained-glass skylight, the brass wall sconces, the marble lobby\u2014was the elevator. Made of curving metal bars like a giant birdcage, the elevator miraculously still functioned, but it moved slowly, and as the car dropped, Madeleine took the opportunity to make herself more presentable.\n\nShe ran her hands through her hair, finger-combing it. She polished her front teeth with her index finger. She rubbed mascara crumbs from her eyes and moistened her lips with her tongue. Finally, passing the balustrade on the second floor, she checked her reflection in the small mirror attached to the rear panel.\n\nOne of the nice things about being twenty-two, or about being Madeleine Hanna, was that three weeks of romantic anguish, followed by a night of epic drinking, didn\u2019t do much visible damage. Except for puffiness around her eyes, Madeleine looked like the same pretty, dark-haired person as usual.\n\nThe symmetries of her face\u2014the straight nose, the Katharine Hepburn\u2013ish cheekbones and jawline\u2014were almost mathematical in their precision. Only the slight furrow in her brow gave evidence of the slightly anxious person that Madeleine felt herself, intrinsically, to be.\n\nShe could see her parents waiting below. They were trapped between the lobby door and the door to the street, Alton in a seersucker jacket,\n\nPhyllida in a navy suit and matching gold-buckled purse. For a second, Madeleine had an impulse to stop the elevator and leave her parents stuck in the foyer amid all the college-town clutter\u2014the posters for New Wave bands with names like Wretched Misery or the Clits, the pornographic Egon Schiele drawings by the RISD kid on the second floor, all the clamorous Xeroxes whose subtext conveyed the message that the wholesome, patriotic values of her parents\u2019 generation were now on the ash heap of history, replaced by a nihilistic, post-punk sensibility that Madeleine herself didn\u2019t understand but was perfectly happy to scandalize her parents by pretending that she did\u2014before the elevator stopped in the lobby and she slid open the gate and stepped out to meet them.\n\nAlton was first through the door. \u201cHere she is!\u201d he said avidly. \u201cThe college graduate!\u201d In his net-charging way, he surged forward to seize her in a hug. Madeleine stiffened, worried that she smelled of alcohol or, worse, of sex.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t let us see your apartment,\u201d Phyllida said, coming up next. \u201cI was looking forward to meeting Abby and Olivia. We\u2019d love to treat them to dinner later.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not staying for dinner,\u201d Alton reminded her.\n\n\u201cWell, we might. That depends on Maddy\u2019s schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the plan. The plan is to see Maddy for breakfast and then leave after the ceremony.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father and his plans,\u201d Phyllida said to Madeleine. \u201cAre you wearing that dress to the ceremony?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get used to these shoulder pads all the young women are wearing. They\u2019re so mannish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Olivia\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look pretty whacked out, Mad,\u201d Alton said. \u201cBig party last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything of your own to wear?\u201d Phyllida said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have my robe on, Mummy,\u201d Madeleine said, and, to forestall further inspection, headed past them through the foyer.\n\nOutside, the sun had lost its battle with the clouds and vanished. The weather looked not much better than it had all weekend. Campus Dance, on Friday night, had been more or less rained out. The Baccalaureate service on Sunday had proceeded under a steady drizzle.\n\nNow, on Monday, the rain had stopped, but the temperature felt closer to St. Patrick\u2019s than to Memorial Day.\n\nAs she waited for her parents to join her on the sidewalk, it occurred to Madeleine that she hadn\u2019t had sex, not really. This was some consolation.\n\n\u201cYour sister sends her regrets,\u201d Phyllida said, coming out.\n\n\u201cShe has to take Richard the Lionhearted for an ultrasound today.\u201d\n\nRichard the Lionhearted was Madeleine\u2019s nine-week-old nephew. Everyone else called him Richard.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d Madeleine asked.\n\n\u201cOne of his kidneys is petite, apparently. The doctors want to keep an eye on it. If you ask me, all these ultrasounds do is find things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of ultrasounds,\u201d Alton said, \u201cI need to get one on my knee.\u201d\n\nPhyllida paid no attention. \u201cAnyway, Allie\u2019s devastated not to see you graduate. As is Blake. But they\u2019re hoping you and your new beau might visit them this summer, on your way to the Cape.\u201d\n\nYou had to stay alert around Phyllida. Here she was, ostensibly talking about Richard the Lionhearted\u2019s petite kidney, and already she\u2019d managed to move the subject to Madeleine\u2019s new boyfriend, Leonard (whom Phyllida and Alton hadn\u2019t met), and to Cape Cod (where Madeleine had announced plans to cohabitate with him). On a normal day, when her brain was working, Madeleine would have been able to keep one step ahead of Phyllida, but this morning the best she could manage was to let the words float past her.\n\nFortunately, Alton changed the subject. \u201cSo, where do you recommend for breakfast?\u201d\n\nMadeleine turned and looked vaguely down Benefit Street. \u201cThere\u2019s a place this way.\u201d\n\nShe started shuffling along the sidewalk. Walking\u2014moving\u2014seemed like a good idea. She led them past a line of quaint, nicely maintained houses bearing historical placards, and a big apartment building with a gable roof. Providence was a corrupt town, crime-ridden and mob-controlled, but up on College Hill this was hard to see.\n\nThe sketchy downtown and dying or dead textile mills lay below, in the grim distance. Here the narrow streets, many of them cobblestone, climbed past mansions or snaked around Puritan graveyards full of headstones as narrow as heaven\u2019s door, streets with names like Prospect, Benevolent, Hope, and Meeting, all of them feeding into the arboreous campus at the top.\n\nThe sheer physical elevation suggested an intellectual one.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t these slate sidewalks lovely,\u201d Phyllida said as she followed along.\n\n\u201cWe used to have slate sidewalks on our street.\n\nThey\u2019re much more attractive. But then the borough replaced them with concrete.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssessed us for the bill, too,\u201d\n\nAlton said. He was limping slightly, bringing up the rear. The right leg of his charcoal trousers was swelled from the knee brace he wore on and off the tennis court. Alton had been club champion in his age group for twelve years running, one of those older guys with a sweatband ringing a balding crown, a choppy forehand, and absolute murder in his eyes.\n\nMadeleine had been trying to beat Alton her entire life without success. This was even more infuriating because she was better than he was, at this point. But whenever she took a set from Alton he started intimidating her, acting mean, disputing calls, and her game fell apart.\n\nMadeleine was worried that there was something paradigmatic in this, that she was destined to go through life being cowed by less capable men.\n\nAs a result, Madeleine\u2019s tennis matches against Alton had assumed such outsize personal significance for her that she got tight whenever she played him, with predictable results.\n\nAnd Alton still gloated when he won, still got all rosy and jiggly, as if he\u2019d bested her by sheer talent.\n\nAt the corner of Benefit and Waterman, they crossed behind the white steeple of First Baptist Church. In preparation for the ceremony, loudspeakers had been set up on the lawn.\n\nA man wearing a bow tie, a dean-of-students-looking person, was tensely smoking a cigarette and inspecting a raft of balloons tied to the churchyard fence.\n\nBy now Phyllida had caught up to Madeleine, taking her arm to negotiate the uneven slate, which was pushed up by the roots of gnarled plane trees that lined the curb. As a little girl, Madeleine had thought her mother pretty, but that was a long time ago. Phyllida\u2019s face had gotten heavier over the years; her cheeks were beginning to sag like those of a camel. The conservative clothes she wore\u2014the clothes of a philanthropist or lady ambassador\u2014had a tendency to conceal her figure. Phyllida\u2019s hair was where her power resided. It was expensively set into a smooth dome, like a band shell for the presentation of that long-running act, her face. For as long as Madeleine could remember, Phyllida had never been at a loss for words or shy about a point of etiquette. Among her friends Madeleine liked to make fun of her mother\u2019s formality, but she often found herself comparing other people\u2019s manners unfavorably with Phyllida\u2019s.\n\nAnd right now Phyllida was looking at Madeleine with the proper expression for this moment: thrilled by the pomp and ceremony, eager to put intelligent questions to any of Madeleine\u2019s professors she happened to meet, or to trade pleasantries with fellow parents of graduating seniors.\n\nIn short, she was available to everyone and everything and in step with the social and academic pageantry, all of which exacerbated Madeleine\u2019s feeling of being out of step, for this day and the rest of her life.\n\nShe plunged on, however, across Waterman Street, and up the steps of Carr House, seeking refuge and coffee.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 had just opened. The guy behind the counter, who was wearing Elvis Costello glasses, was rinsing out the espresso machine.\n\nAt a table against the wall, a girl with stiff pink hair was smoking a clove cigarette and reading Invisible Cities. \u201cTainted Love\u201d played from the stereo on top of the refrigerator.\n\nPhyllida, holding her handbag protectively against her chest, had paused to peruse the student art on the walls: six paintings of small, skin-diseased dogs wearing bleach-bottle collars.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this fun?\u201d she said tolerantly.\n\n\u201cLa Boh\u00e8me,\u201d Alton said.\n\nMadeleine installed her parents at a table near the bay window, as far away from the pink-haired girl as possible, and went up to the counter. The guy took his time coming over. She ordered three coffees\u2014a large for her\u2014and bagels. While the bagels were being toasted, she brought the coffees over to her parents.\n\nAlton, who couldn\u2019t sit at the breakfast table without reading, had taken a discarded Village Voice from a nearby table and was perusing it. Phyllida was staring overtly at the girl with pink hair.\n\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s comfortable?\u201d she inquired in a low voice.\n\nMadeleine turned to see that the girl\u2019s ragged black jeans were held together by a few hundred safety pins.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mummy. Why don\u2019t you go ask her?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of getting poked.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to this article,\u201d Alton said, reading the Voice, \u201chomosexuality didn\u2019t exist until the nineteenth century. It was invented. In Germany.\u201d\n\nThe coffee was hot, and lifesavingly good. Sipping it, Madeleine began to feel slightly less awful.\n\nAfter a few minutes, she went up to get the bagels.\n\nThey were a little burned, but she didn\u2019t want to wait for new ones, and so brought them back to the table. After examining his with a sour expression, Alton began scraping it punitively with a plastic knife.\n\nPhyllida asked, \u201cSo, are we going to meet Leonard today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cAnything you want us to know about?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you two still planning to live together this summer?\u201d\n\nBy this time Madeleine had taken a bite of her bagel. And since the answer to her mother\u2019s question was complicated\u2014strictly speaking, Madeleine and Leonard weren\u2019t planning on living together, because they\u2019d broken up three weeks ago; despite this fact, however, Madeleine hadn\u2019t given up hope of a reconciliation, and seeing as she\u2019d spent so much effort getting her parents used to the idea of her living with a guy, and didn\u2019t want to jeopardize that by admitting that the plan was off\u2014she was relieved to be able to point at her full mouth, which prevented her from replying.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re an adult now,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cYou can do what you like. Though, for the record, I have to say that I don\u2019t approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already gone on record about that,\u201d Alton broke in.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s still a bad idea!\u201d Phyllida cried. \u201cI don\u2019t mean the propriety of it. I\u2019m talking about the practical problems.\n\nIf you move in with Leonard\u2014or any young man\u2014and he\u2019s the one with the job, then you begin at a disadvantage.\n\nWhat happens if you two don\u2019t get along? Where are you then? You won\u2019t have any place to live. Or anything to do.\u201d\n\nThat her mother was correct in her analysis, that the predicament Phyllida warned Madeleine about was exactly the predicament she was already in, didn\u2019t motivate Madeleine to register agreement.\n\n\u201cYou quit your job when you met me,\u201d Alton said to Phyllida.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we change the subject?\u201d Madeleine said at last, having swallowed her food.\n\n\u201cOf course we can, sweetheart. That\u2019s the last I\u2019ll say about it. If your plans change, you can always come home. Your father and I would love to have you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me,\u201d Alton said. \u201cI don\u2019t want her. Moving back home is always a bad idea. Stay away.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe choice is yours,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cBut if you do come home, you could have the loft. That way you can come and go as you like.\u201d\n\nTo her surprise, Madeleine found herself contemplating this proposal.\n\nWhy not tell her parents everything, curl up in the backseat of the car, and let them take her home? She could move into her old bedroom, with the sleigh bed and the Madeline wallpaper.\n\nShe could become a spinster, like Emily Dickinson, writing poems full of dashes and brilliance, and never gaining weight.\n\nPhyllida brought her out of this reverie.\n\n\u201cMaddy?\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that your friend Mitchell?\u201d\n\nMadeleine wheeled in her seat. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s Mitchell. Across the street.\u201d\n\nIn the churchyard, sitting Indian-style in the freshly mown grass, Madeleine\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d Mitchell Grammaticus was indeed there. His lips were moving, as if he was talking to himself.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you invite him to join us?\u201d Phyllida said.\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not? I\u2019d love to see Mitchell.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably waiting for his parents,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nPhyllida waved, despite the fact that Mitchell was too far away to notice.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing sitting on the ground?\u201d Alton asked.\n\nThe three Hannas stared across the street at Mitchell in his half-lotus.\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re not going to ask him, I will,\u201d Phyllida finally said.\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go ask him.\u201d\n\nThe day was getting warmer, but not by much. Black clouds were massing in the distance as Madeleine came down the steps of Carr House and crossed the street into the churchyard.\n\nSomeone inside the church was testing the loudspeakers, fussily repeating, \u201cSussex, Essex, and Kent. Sussex, Essex, and Kent.\u201d A banner draped over the church entrance read \u201cClass of 1982.\u201d Beneath the banner, in the grass, was Mitchell.\n\nHis lips were still moving silently, but when he noticed Madeleine approaching they abruptly stopped.\n\nMadeleine remained a few feet away.\n\n\u201cMy parents are here,\u201d she informed him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s graduation,\u201d Mitchell replied evenly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s parents are here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to say hello to you.\u201d\n\nAt this Mitchell smiled faintly. \u201cThey probably don\u2019t realize you\u2019re not speaking to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cAnd, anyway, I am. Now. Speaking to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder duress or as a change of policy?\u201d\n\nMadeleine shifted her weight, wrinkling her face unhappily. \u201cLook. I\u2019m really hungover. I barely slept last night. My parents have been here about ten minutes and they\u2019re already driving me crazy. So if you could just come over and say hello, that would be great.\u201d\n\nMitchell\u2019s large emotional eyes blinked twice. He was wearing a vintage gabardine shirt, dark wool pants, and beat-up wingtips. Madeleine had never seen him in shorts or tennis shoes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Madeleine said, looking away. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just being my usual vile self.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo was I.\u201d\n\nThey were quiet a moment. Madeleine felt Mitchell\u2019s eyes on her, and she crossed her arms over her chest.\n\nWhat had happened was this: one night the previous December, in a state of anxiety about her romantic life, Madeleine had run into Mitchell on campus and brought him back to her apartment.\n\nShe\u2019d needed male attention and had flirted with him, without entirely admitting it to herself. In her bedroom, Mitchell had picked up a jar of deep-heating gel on her desk, asking what it was for.\n\nMadeleine had explained that people who were athletic sometimes got sore muscles. She understood that Mitchell might not have experienced this phenomenon, seeing as all he did was sit in the library, but he should take her word for it.\n\nAt that point, Mitchell had come up behind her and wiped a gob of heating gel behind her ear. Madeleine jumped up, shouting at Mitchell, and wiped the gunk off with a T-shirt. Though she was within her rights to be angry,\n\nMadeleine also knew (even at the time) that she was using the incident as a pretext for getting Mitchell out of her bedroom and for covering up the fact that she\u2019d been flirting with him in the first place.\n\nThe worst part of the incident was how stricken Mitchell had looked, as if he\u2019d been about to cry. He kept saying he was sorry, he was just joking around, but she ordered him to leave.\n\nIn the following days, replaying the incident in her mind, Madeleine had felt worse and worse about it. She\u2019d been on the verge of calling Mitchell to apologize when she\u2019d received a letter from him, a highly detailed, cogently argued, psychologically astute, quietly hostile four-page letter, in which he called her a \u201ccocktease\u201d and claimed that her behavior that night had been \u201cthe erotic equivalent of bread and circus, with just the circus.\u201d\n\nThe next time they\u2019d run into each other, Madeleine had acted as if she didn\u2019t know him, and they hadn\u2019t spoken since.\n\nNow, in the churchyard of First Baptist, Mitchell looked up at her and said, \u201cO.K. Let\u2019s go say hello to your parents.\u201d\n\nPhyllida was waving as they came up the steps. In the flirtatious voice she reserved for her favorite of Madeleine\u2019s friends, she called out, \u201cI thought that was you on the ground. You looked like a swami!\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Mitchell!\u201d Alton said, heartily shaking Mitchell\u2019s hand. \u201cBig day today. One of the milestones. A new generation takes the reins.\u201d\n\nThey invited Mitchell to sit down and asked him if he wanted anything to eat. Madeleine went back to the counter to get more coffee, glad to have Mitchell keeping her parents occupied. As she watched him, in his old man\u2019s clothes, engaging Alton and Phyllida in conversation, Madeleine thought to herself, as she\u2019d thought many times before, that Mitchell was the kind of smart, sane, parent-pleasing boy she should fall in love with and marry. That she would never fall in love with Mitchell and marry him, precisely because of this eligibility, was yet another indication, in a morning teeming with them, of just how screwed up she was in matters of the heart.\n\nWhen she returned to the table, no one acknowledged her.\n\n\u201cSo, Mitchell,\u201d Phyllida was asking, \u201cwhat are your plans after graduation?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s been asking me the same question,\u201d Mitchell answered. \u201cFor some reason he thinks Religious Studies isn\u2019t a marketable degree.\u201d\n\nMadeleine smiled for the first time all day. \u201cSee? Mitchell doesn\u2019t have a job lined up, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I sort of do,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cYou do not,\u201d Madeleine challenged him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. I do.\u201d He explained that he and his roommate, Larry Pleshette, had come up with a plan to fight the recession. As liberal-arts degree holders matriculating into the job market at a time when unemployment was at 9.5 percent, they had decided, after much consideration, to leave the country and stay away as long as possible.\n\nAt the end of the summer, after they\u2019d saved up enough money, they were going to backpack through Europe. After they\u2019d seen everything in Europe there was to see, they were going to fly to India and stay there as long as their money held out. The whole trip would take eight or nine months, maybe as long as a year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to India?\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be research assistants,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cFor Prof. Hughes.\u201d\n\n\u201cProf. Hughes in the theater department?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw a program about India recently,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cIt was terribly depressing. The poverty!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a plus for me, Mrs. Hanna,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI thrive in squalor.\u201d\n\nPhyllida, who couldn\u2019t resist this sort of mischief, gave up her solemnity, rippling with amusement. \u201cThen you\u2019re going to the right place!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take a trip, too,\u201d Madeleine said in a threatening tone.\n\nNo one reacted. Instead Alton asked Mitchell, \u201cWhat sort of immunizations do you need for India?\u201d\n\n\u201cCholera and typhus. Gamma globulin\u2019s optional.\u201d\n\nPhyllida shook her head. \u201cYour mother must be worried sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was in the service,\u201d Alton said, \u201cthey shot us up with a million things. Didn\u2019t even tell us what the shots were for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll move to Paris,\u201d Madeleine said in a louder voice. \u201cInstead of getting a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cMitchell,\u201d Phyllida continued, \u201cwith your interest in religious studies, I\u2019d think India would be a perfect fit. They\u2019ve got everything. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Jains, Buddhists.\n\nIt\u2019s like Baskin and Robbins! I\u2019ve always been fascinated by religion. Unlike my doubting-Thomas husband.\u201d\n\nAlton winked. \u201cI doubt that doubting Thomas existed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know Paul Moore, Bishop Moore, at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine?\u201d\n\nPhyllida said, keeping Mitchell\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great friend. You might find it interesting to meet him. We\u2019d be happy to introduce you. When we\u2019re in the city, I always go to services at the cathedral. Have you ever been there? Oh. Well. How can I describe it? It\u2019s simply\u2014well, simply divine!\u201d\n\nPhyllida held a hand to her throat with the pleasure of this bon mot, while Mitchell obligingly, even convincingly, laughed.\n\n\u201cSpeaking of religious dignitaries,\u201d\n\nAlton cut in, \u201cdid I ever tell you about the time we met the Dalai Lama?\n\nIt was at this fund-raiser at the Waldorf. We were in the receiving line. Must have been three hundred people at least. Anyway, when we finally got up to the Dalai Lama, I asked him,\n\n\u2018Are you any relation to Dolly Parton?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI was mortified!\u201d Phyllida cried. \u201cAbsolutely mortified.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaddy,\u201d Madeleine said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should get going if you want to get a good spot.\u201d\n\nAlton looked at his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gets really crowded,\u201d Madeleine emphasized. \u201cYou should go now.\u201d\n\nAlton and Phyllida looked at Mitchell, as if they trusted him to advise them. Under the table, Madeleine kicked him, and he alertly responded, \u201cIt does get pretty crowded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the best place to stand?\u201d Alton asked, again addressing Mitchell.\n\n\u201cBy the Van Wickle Gates. At the top of College Street. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll come through.\u201d\n\nAlton stood up from the table. After shaking Mitchell\u2019s hand, he bent to kiss Madeleine on the cheek.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see you later. Miss Baccalaureate, 1982.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Mitchell,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cSo nice to see you.\n\nAnd remember, when you\u2019re on your Grand Tour, be sure to send your mother loads of letters. Otherwise, she\u2019ll be frantic.\u201d\n\nTo Madeleine, she said, \u201cYou might change that dress before the march. It has a visible stain.\u201d\n\nWith that, Alton and Phyllida, in their glaring parental actuality, all seersucker and handbag, cuff links and pearls, crossed the beige-and-brick space of Carr House and went out the door.\n\nAs though to signal their departure, a new song came on: Joe Jackson\u2019s high-pitched voice swooping above a synthesized drumbeat. The guy behind the counter cranked up the volume.\n\nMadeleine laid her head on the table, her hair covering her face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never drinking again,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFamous last words.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have no idea what\u2019s been going on with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I? You haven\u2019t been speaking to me.\u201d\n\nWithout lifting her cheek from the table, Madeleine said in a pitiful voice, \u201cI\u2019m homeless. I\u2019m graduating from college and I\u2019m a homeless person.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am!\u201d Madeleine insisted. \u201cFirst I was supposed to move to New York with Abby and Olivia. Then it looked like I was moving to the Cape, though, so I told them to get another roommate. And now I\u2019m not moving to the Cape and I have nowhere to go. My mother wants me to move back home but I\u2019d rather kill myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m moving back home for the summer,\u201d\n\nMitchell said. \u201cTo Detroit. At least you\u2019re near New York.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard back from grad school yet and it\u2019s June,\u201d Madeleine continued.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to find out over a month ago! I could call the admissions department, but I don\u2019t because I\u2019m scared to find out that I\u2019ve been rejected. As long as I don\u2019t know, I still have hope.\u201d\n\nThere was a moment before Mitchell spoke again. \u201cYou can come to India with me,\u201d he said.\n\nMadeleine opened one eye to see, through a whorl in her hair, that Mitchell wasn\u2019t entirely joking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even about grad school,\u201d she said. Taking a deep breath, she confessed, \u201cLeonard and I broke up.\u201d\n\nIt felt deeply pleasurable to say this, to name her sadness, and so Madeleine was surprised by the coldness of Mitchell\u2019s reply.\n\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d he said.\n\nShe lifted her head, brushing her hair out of her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You wanted to know what was the matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, actually. I didn\u2019t even ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you might care,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cSince you\u2019re my friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Mitchell said, his voice suddenly sarcastic.\n\n\u201cOur wonderful friendship! Our \u2018friendship\u2019 isn\u2019t a real friendship because it only works on your terms.\n\nYou set the rules, Madeleine. If you decide you don\u2019t want to talk to me for three months, we don\u2019t talk. Then you decide you do want to talk to me because you need me to entertain your parents\u2014and now we\u2019re talking again. We\u2019re friends when you want to be friends, and we\u2019re never more than friends because you don\u2019t want to be. And I have to go along with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Madeleine said, feeling put-upon and blindsided. \u201cI just don\u2019t like you that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Mitchell cried. \u201cYou\u2019re not attracted to me physically. O.K., fine. But who says I was ever attracted to you mentally?\u201d\n\nMadeleine reacted as if she\u2019d been slapped. She was outraged, hurt, and defiant all at once.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a\u201d\u2014she tried to think of the worst thing to say\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re such a jerk!\u201d\n\nShe was hoping to remain imperious, but her chest was stinging, and, to her dismay, she burst into tears.\n\nMitchell reached out to touch her arm, but Madeleine shook him off. Getting to her feet, trying not to look like someone angrily weeping, she went out the door and down the steps onto Waterman Street.\n\nConfronted by the festive churchyard, she turned downhill toward the river. She wanted to get away from campus. Her headache had returned, her temples were throbbing, and as she looked up at the storm clouds massing over downtown like more bad things to come, she asked herself why everyone was being so mean to her.\n\n\n\nMadeleine\u2019s love troubles had begun at a time when the French theory she was reading deconstructed the very notion of love. Semiotics 211 was an upper-level seminar taught by a former English department renegade.\n\nMichael Zipperstein had come to Brown thirty-two years earlier as a New Critic. He\u2019d inculcated the habits of close reading and biography-free interpretation into three generations of students before taking a Road to Damascus sabbatical, in Paris, in 1975, where he\u2019d met Roland Barthes at a dinner party and been converted, over cassoulet, to the new faith.\n\nNow Zipperstein taught two courses in the newly created Program in Semiotics Studies: Introduction to Semiotic Theory in the fall and, in the spring, Semiotics 211. Hygienically bald, with a seaman\u2019s mustacheless white beard, Zipperstein favored French fisherman\u2019s sweaters and wide-wale corduroys. He buried people with his reading lists: in addition to all the semiotic big hitters\u2014Derrida, Eco, Barthes\u2014the students in Semiotics 211 had to contend with a magpie nest of reserve reading that included everything from Balzac\u2019s Sarrasine to issues of Semiotext(e) to photocopied selections from E. M. Cioran, Robert Walser, Claude Levi-Strauss, Peter Handke, and Carl Van Vechten.\n\nTo get into the seminar, you had to submit to a one-on-one interview with Zipperstein during which he asked bland personal questions, such as what your favorite food or dog breed was, and made enigmatic Warholian remarks in response. This esoteric probing, along with Zipperstein\u2019s guru\u2019s dome and beard, gave his students a sense that they\u2019d been spiritually vetted and were now\u2014for two hours on Thursday afternoons, at least\u2014part of a campus lit-crit elite.\n\nWhich was exactly what Madeleine wanted. She\u2019d become an English major for the purest and dullest of reasons: because she loved to read.\n\nThe university\u2019s \u201cBritish and American Literature Course Catalog\u201d was, for Madeleine, what its Bergdorf equivalent was for her roommates.\n\nA course listing like \u201cEnglish 274: Lyly\u2019s Euphues\u201d excited Madeleine the way a pair of Fiorucci cowboy boots did Abby. \u201cEnglish 450A:\n\nHawthorne and James\u201d filled Madeleine with an expectation of sinful hours in bed not unlike what Olivia got from wearing a Lycra skirt and leather blazer to Danceteria. Even as a girl in their house in Prettybrook, Madeleine wandered into the library, with its shelves of books rising higher than she could reach\u2014newly purchased volumes such as Love Story or Myra Breckinridgethat exuded a faintly forbidden air, as well as venerable leather-bound editions of Fielding,\n\nThackeray, and Dickens\u2014and the magisterial presence of all those potentially readable words stopped her in her tracks. She could scan book spines for as long as an hour. Her cataloging of the family\u2019s holdings rivaled the Dewey decimal system in its comprehensiveness.\n\nMadeleine knew right where everything was. The shelves near the fireplace held Alton\u2019s favorites, biographies of American presidents and British prime ministers, memoirs by warmongering secretaries of state, novels about sailing or espionage by William F. Buckley, Jr. Phyllida\u2019s books filled the left side of the bookcases leading up to the parlor, NYRB-reviewed novels and essay collections, as well as coffee-table volumes about English gardens or chinoiserie.\n\nEven now, at bed-and-breakfasts or seaside hotels, a shelf full of forlorn books always cried out to Madeleine. She ran her fingers over their salt-spotted covers. She peeled apart pages made tacky by ocean air. She had no sympathy for paperback thrillers and detective stories.\n\nIt was the abandoned hardback, the jacketless 1931 Dial Press edition ringed with many a coffee cup, that pierced Madeleine\u2019s heart. Her friends might be calling her name on the beach, the clambake already under way, but Madeleine would sit down on the bed and read for a little while to make the sad old book feel better. She had read Longfellow\u2019s \u201cHiawatha\u201d that way. She\u2019d read James Fenimore Cooper. She\u2019d read H. M. Pulham, Esquire by John P. Marquand.\n\nAnd yet sometimes she worried about what those musty old books were doing to her. Some people majored in English to prepare for law school. Others became journalists. The smartest guy in the honors program, Adam Vogel, a child of academics, was planning on getting a Ph.D. and becoming an academic himself.\n\nThat left a large contingent of people majoring in English by default. Because they weren\u2019t left-brained enough for science, because history was too dry, philosophy too difficult, geology too petroleum-oriented, and math too mathematical\u2014because they weren\u2019t musical, artistic, financially motivated, or really all that smart, these people were pursuing university degrees doing something no different from what they\u2019d done in first grade: reading stories.\n\nEnglish was what people who didn\u2019t know what to major in majored in.\n\nHer junior year, Madeleine had taken an honors seminar called The Marriage Plot: Selected Novels of Austen, Eliot, and James.\n\nThe class was taught by K. McCall Saunders. Saunders was a seventy-nine-year-old New Englander. He had a long, horsey face and a moist laugh that exposed his gaudy dental work. His pedagogical method consisted of his reading aloud lectures he\u2019d written twenty or thirty years earlier.\n\nMadeleine stayed in the class because she felt sorry for Professor Saunders and because the reading list was so good. In Saunders\u2019s opinion, the novel had reached its apogee with the marriage plot and had never recovered from its disappearance. In the days when success in life had depended on marriage, and marriage had depended on money, novelists had had a subject to write about. The great epics sang of war, the novel of marriage.\n\nSexual equality, good for women, had been bad for the novel. And divorce had undone it completely.\n\nWhat would it matter whom Emma married if she could file for separation later?\n\nHow would Isabel Archer\u2019s marriage to Gilbert Osmond have been affected by the existence of a prenup?\n\nAs far as Saunders was concerned, marriage didn\u2019t mean much anymore, and neither did the novel. Where could you find the marriage plot nowadays? You couldn\u2019t. You had to read historical fiction. You had to read non-Western novels involving traditional societies. Afghani novels, Indian novels. You had to go, literarily speaking, back in time.\n\nMadeleine\u2019s final paper for the seminar was titled \u201cThe Interrogative Mood: Marriage Proposals and the (Strictly Limited) Sphere of the Feminine.\u201d\n\nIt had impressed Saunders so much that he\u2019d asked Madeleine to come see him. In his office, which had a grandparental smell, he expressed his opinion that Madeleine might expand her paper into a senior honors thesis, along with his willingness to serve as her advisor.\n\nMadeleine smiled politely. Professor Saunders specialized in the periods she was interested in, the Regency leading into the Victorian era. He was sweet, and learned, and it was clear from his unsubscribed office hours that no one else wanted him as an advisor, and so Madeleine had said yes, she would love to work with him on her senior thesis.\n\nShe used a line from Trollope\u2019s Barchester Towers as an epigraph:\n\n\u201cThere is no happiness in love, except at the end of an English novel.\u201d\n\nHer plan was to begin with Jane Austen. After a brief examination of Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, and Sense and Sensibility, all comedies, essentially, that ended with weddings, Madeleine was going to move on to the Victorian novel, where things got more complicated and considerably darker. Middlemarch and The Portrait of a Lady didn\u2019t end with weddings.\n\nThey began with the traditional moves of the marriage plot\u2014the suitors, the proposals, the misunderstandings\u2014but after the wedding ceremony they kept on going. These novels followed their spirited, intelligent heroines, Dorothea Brooke and Isabel Archer, into their disappointing married lives, and it was here that the marriage plot reached its greatest artistic expression.\n\nBy 1900 the marriage plot was no more. Madeleine planned to end with a brief discussion of its demise.\n\nIn Sister Carrie, Dreiser had Carrie live adulterously with Drouet, marry Hurstwood in an invalid ceremony, and then run off to become an actress\u2014and this was only in 1900! For a conclusion, Madeleine thought she might cite the wife-swapping in Updike.\n\nThat was the last vestige of the marriage plot: the persistence in calling it \u201cwife-swapping\u201d instead of \u201chusband-swapping.\u201d As if the woman were still a piece of property to be passed around.\n\nProfessor Saunders suggested that Madeleine look at historical sources. She\u2019d obediently boned up on the rise of industrialism and the nuclear family, the formation of the middle class, and the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857. But it wasn\u2019t long before she\u2019d become bored with the thesis. Doubts about the originality of her work nagged at her.\n\nShe felt as if she was regurgitating the arguments Saunders had made in his marriage plot seminar. Her meetings with the old professor were dispiriting, consisting of Saunders shuffling the pages she\u2019d given him, pointing out various red marks he\u2019d made in the margins.\n\nThen one Sunday morning, before winter break, Abby\u2019s boyfriend, Whitney, materialized at their kitchen table, reading something called Of Grammatology.\n\nWhen Madeleine asked what the book was about, she was given to understand by Whitney that the idea of a book being \u201cabout\u201d something was exactly what this book was against, and that, if it was \u201cabout\u201d anything, then it was about the need to stop thinking of books as being about things.\n\nMadeleine said she was going to make coffee. Whitney asked if she would make him some, too.\n\nCollege wasn\u2019t like the real world. In the real world people dropped names based on their renown.\n\nIn college, people dropped names based on their obscurity. Thus, in the weeks after this exchange with Whitney, Madeleine began hearing people saying \u201cDerrida.\u201d She heard them saying \u201cLyotard\u201d and \u201cFoucault\u201d and \u201cDeleuze\u201d and \u201cBaudrillard.\u201d\n\nThat most of these people were those she instinctually disapproved of\u2014upper-middle-class kids who wore Doc Martens and anarchist symbols\u2014made Madeleine dubious about the value of their enthusiasm. But soon she noticed David Koppel, a smart and talented poet, also reading Derrida.\n\nAnd Pookie Ames, who read slush for The Paris Review and whom Madeleine liked, was taking a course with Professor Zipperstein.\n\nMadeleine had always been partial to grandiose professors, people like Sears Jayne who hammed it up in the classroom, reciting Hart Crane or\n\nAnne Sexton in a gag voice. Whitney acted as though Professor Jayne was a joke. Madeleine didn\u2019t agree. But after three solid years of taking literature courses, Madeleine had nothing like a firm critical methodology to apply to what she read.\n\nInstead she had a fuzzy, unsystematic way of talking about books. It embarrassed her to hear the things people said in class. And the things she said. I felt that. It was interesting the way Proust. I liked the way Faulkner.\n\nAnd when Olivia, who was tall and slim, with a long, aristocratic nose like a saluki, came in one day carrying Of Grammatology, Madeleine knew that what had been marginal was now mainstream.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that book like?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t read it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould I be asking if I had?\u201d\n\nOlivia sniffed. \u201cAren\u2019t we a little bitchy today?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust kidding. It\u2019s great. Derrida is my absolute god!\u201d\n\nAlmost overnight it became laughable to read writers like Cheever or Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about anally deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France.\n\nThe reason de Sade was preferable was that his shocking sex scenes weren\u2019t about sex but politics. They were therefore anti-imperialist, anti-bourgeois, anti-patriarchal, and anti-everything a smart young feminist should be against. Right up through her third year at college, Madeleine kept wholesomely taking courses like Victorian Fantasy: From Phantastes to The Water-Babies, but by senior year she could no longer ignore the contrast between the hard-up, blinky people in her Beowulf seminar and the hipsters down the hall reading Maurice Blanchot.\n\nGoing to college in the moneymaking eighties lacked a certain radicalism. Semiotics was the first thing that smacked of revolution. It drew a line; it created an elect; it was sophisticated and Continental; it dealt with provocative subjects, with torture, sadism, hermaphroditism\u2014with sex and power.\n\nMadeleine had always been popular at school. Years of being popular had left her with the reflexive ability to separate the cool from the uncool, even within subgroups, like the English department, where the concept of cool didn\u2019t appear to obtain.\n\nIf Restoration drama was getting you down, if scanning Wordsworth was making you feel dowdy and ink-stained, there was another option. You could flee K. McCall Saunders and the old New Criticism. You could defect to the new imperium of Derrida and Eco. You could sign up for Semiotics 211 and find out what everyone else was talking about.\n\n\n\nSemiotics 211 was limited to ten students. Of the ten, eight had taken Introduction to Semiotic Theory. This was visually apparent at the first class meeting.\n\nLounging around the seminar table, when Madeleine came into the room from the wintry weather outside, were eight people in black T-shirts and ripped black jeans. A few had razored off the necks or sleeves of their T-shirts. There was something creepy about one guy\u2019s face\u2014it was like a baby\u2019s face that had grown whiskers\u2014and it took Madeleine a full minute to realize that he\u2019d shaved off his eyebrows.\n\nEveryone in the room was so spectral-looking that Madeleine\u2019s natural healthiness seemed suspect, like a vote for Reagan. She was relieved, therefore, when a big guy in a down jacket and snowmobile boots showed up and took the empty seat next to her. He had a cup of take-out coffee.\n\nZipperstein asked the students to introduce themselves and explain why they were taking the seminar.\n\nThe boy without eyebrows spoke up first. \u201cUm, let\u2019s see. I\u2019m finding it hard to introduce myself, actually, because the whole idea of social introductions is so problematized.\n\nLike, if I tell you that my name is Thurston Meems and that I grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, will you know who I am? O.K.\n\nMy name\u2019s Thurston and I\u2019m from Stamford, Connecticut. I\u2019m taking this course because I read Of Grammatology last summer and it blew my mind.\u201d\n\nWhen it was the turn of the boy next to Madeleine, he said in a quiet voice that he was a double major (biology and philosophy) and had never taken a semiotics course before, that his parents had named him Leonard, that it had always seemed pretty handy to have a name, especially when you were being called to dinner, and that if anyone wanted to call him Leonard he would answer to it.\n\nLeonard didn\u2019t make another comment. During the rest of the class, he leaned back in his chair, stretching out his long legs. After he finished his coffee, he dug into his right snowmobile boot and, to Madeleine\u2019s surprise, pulled out a tin of chewing tobacco. With two stained fingers, he placed a wad of tobacco in his cheek. For the next two hours, every minute or so, he spat, discreetly but audibly, into the cup.\n\nEvery week Zipperstein assigned one daunting book of theory and one literary selection. The pairings were eccentric if not downright arbitrary. (What did Saussure\u2019s Writings in General Linguistics, for instance, have to do with Pynchon\u2019s The Crying of Lot 49?) As for Zipperstein himself, he didn\u2019t run the class so much as observe it from behind the one-way mirror of his opaque personality. He hardly said a word. He asked questions now and then to stimulate discussion, and often went to the window to gaze in the direction of Narragansett Bay, as if thinking about his wooden sloop in dry dock.\n\nThree weeks into the course, on a February day of flurries and gray skies, they read Zipperstein\u2019s own book, The Making of Signs, along with Peter Handke\u2019s A Sorrow Beyond Dreams.\n\nIt was always embarrassing when professors assigned their own books. Even Madeleine, who found all the reading hard going, could tell that Zipperstein\u2019s contribution to the field was reformulative and second-tier.\n\nEveryone seemed a little hesitant when talking about The Making of Signs, so it was a relief when, after the break, they turned to the literary selection.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Zipperstein asked, blinking behind his round wire-rims. \u201cWhat did you make of the Handke?\u201d\n\nAfter a short silence, Thurston spoke up. \u201cThe Handke was totally dank and depressing,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved it.\u201d\n\nThurston was a sly-looking boy with short, gelled hair. His eyebrowlessness, along with his pale complexion, gave his face a superintelligent quality, like a floating, disembodied brain.\n\n\u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cWell, Professor, here\u2019s a subject dear to my heart\u2014offing yourself.\u201d The other students tittered as Thurston warmed to his topic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s purportedly autobiographical, this book. But I\u2019d contend, with Barthes, that the act of writing is itself a fictionalization, even if you\u2019re treating actual events.\u201d\n\nBart. So that was how you pronounced it. Madeleine made a note, grateful to be spared humiliation.\n\nMeanwhile Thurston was saying, \u201cSo Handke\u2019s mother commits suicide and Handke sits down to write about it. He wants to be as objective as possible, to be totally\u2014remorseless!\u201d\n\nThurston stifled a smile. He aspired to be a person who would react to his own mother\u2019s suicide with high-literary remorselessness, and his soft, young face lit up with pleasure. \u201cSuicide is a trope,\u201d he announced.\n\n\u201cEspecially in German literature. You\u2019ve got The Sorrows of Young Werther. You\u2019ve got Kleist. Hey, I just thought of something.\u201d He held up a finger.\n\n\u201cThe Sorrows of Young Werther.\u201d He held up another finger.\n\n\u201cA Sorrow Beyond Dreams. My theory is that Handke felt the weight of all that tradition and this book was his attempt to break free.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you mean \u2018free\u2019?\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cFrom the whole Teutonic, Sturm-und-Drang, suicidal thing.\u201d\n\nThe flurries swirling outside the windows looked like either flakes of soap or flash of ash, like something either very clean or very dirty.\n\n\u201cThe Sorrows of Young Werther is an apt reference,\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cBut I think that\u2019s more the translator\u2019s doing than Handke\u2019s. In German the book\u2019s called Wunschloses Ungl\u00fcck.\u201d\n\nThurston smiled, either because he was pleased to be receiving Zipperstein\u2019s full attention or because he thought German sounded funny.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a play on a German saying, wunschlos gl\u00fccklich, which means being happier than you could ever wish for. Only here Handke makes a nice reversal. It\u2019s a serious and strangely wonderful title.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it means being unhappier than you could ever wish for,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nZipperstein looked at her for the first time.\n\n\u201cIn a sense. As I said, something is lost in translation. What was your take?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the book?\u201d Madeleine asked, and immediately realized how stupid this sounded. She fell silent, the blood beating in her ears.\n\nPeople blushed in nineteenth-century English novels but never in contemporary Austrian ones.\n\nBefore the silence became uncomfortable, Leonard came to her rescue.\n\n\u201cI have a comment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was going to write about my mother\u2019s suicide, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be too concerned about being experimental.\u201d He leaned forward, putting his elbows on the table.\n\n\u201cI mean, wasn\u2019t anybody put off by Handke\u2019s so-called remorselessness? Didn\u2019t this book strike anyone as a tad cold?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter cold than sentimental,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cDo you think? Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019ve read the sentimental, filial account of a cherished dead parent before. We\u2019ve read it a million times. It doesn\u2019t have any power anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing a little thought experiment here,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cSay my mother killed herself. And say I wrote a book about it.\n\nWhy would I want to do something like that?\u201d He closed his eyes and leaned his head back.\n\n\u201cFirst, I\u2019d do it to cope with my grief. Second, maybe to paint a portrait of my mother. To keep her alive in my memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think your reaction is universal,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cThat because you\u2019d respond to the death of a parent a certain way, that obligates Handke to do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that if your mother kills herself it\u2019s not a literary trope.\u201d\n\nMadeleine\u2019s heart had quieted now. She was listening to the discussion with interest.\n\nThurston was nodding his head in a way that somehow didn\u2019t suggest agreement.\n\n\u201cYeah, O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cHandke\u2019s real mother killed herself. She died in a real world and Handke felt real grief or whatever. But that\u2019s not what this book\u2019s about. Books aren\u2019t about \u2018real life.\u2019 Books are about other books.\u201d He raised his mouth like a wind instrument and blew out bright notes.\n\n\u201cMy theory is that the problem Handke was trying to solve here, from a literary standpoint, was how do you write about something, even something real and painful\u2014like suicide\u2014when all of the writing that\u2019s been done on that subject has robbed you of any originality of expression?\u201d\n\nWhat Thurston was saying seemed to Madeleine both insightful and horribly wrong. It was maybe true, what he said, but it shouldn\u2019t have been.\n\n\u201c\u2018Popular literature,\u2019\u201d Zipperstein quipped, proposing an essay title. \u201c\u2018Or, How to Beat a Dead Horse.\u2019\u201d\n\nA spasm of mirth traveled through the class. Madeleine looked over to see that Leonard was staring at her. When the class ended, he gathered up his books and left.\n\nShe started seeing Leonard around after that. She saw him crossing the green one afternoon, hatless in winter drizzle. She saw him at Mutt & Geoff\u2019s, eating a messy Buddy Cianci sandwich. She saw him, one morning, waiting for a bus on South Main. Each time, Leonard was alone, looking forlorn and uncombed like a great big motherless boy. At the same time, he appeared somehow older than most guys at school.\n\nIt was Madeleine\u2019s last semester of senior year, a time when she was supposed to have some fun, and she wasn\u2019t having any. She\u2019d never thought of herself as hard up. She preferred to think of her current boyfriendless state as salutary and head-clearing. But when she found herself wondering what it would be like to kiss a guy who chewed tobacco, she began to worry that she was fooling herself.\n\nLooking back, Madeleine realized that her college love life had fallen short of expectations. Her freshman roommate, Jennifer Boomgaard, had rushed off to Health Services the first week of school to be fitted for a diaphragm. Unaccustomed to sharing a room with anybody, much less a stranger, Madeleine felt that Jenny was a little too quick with her intimacies. She didn\u2019t want to be shown Jennifer\u2019s diaphragm, which reminded her of an uncooked ravioli, and she certainly didn\u2019t want to feel the spermicidal jelly that Jenny offered to squirt into her palm. Madeleine was shocked when Jennifer started going to parties with the diaphragm already in place, when she wore it to the Harvard-Brown game, and when she left it one morning on top of their miniature fridge. That winter, when the Rev. Desmond Tutu came to campus for an anti-apartheid rally, Madeleine asked Jennifer on their way to see the great cleric, \u201cDid you put your diaphragm in?\u201d They lived the next four months in an eighteen-by-fifteen room without speaking to each other.\n\nThough Madeleine hadn\u2019t arrived at college sexually inexperienced, her freshman learning curve resembled a flat line. Aside from one make-out session with a Uruguayan named Carlos, a sandal-wearing engineering student who in low light looked like Che Guevara, the only boy she\u2019d fooled around with was a high school senior visiting campus for Early Action weekend. She found Tim standing in line at the Ratty, pushing his cafeteria tray along the metal track, and visibly quivering. His blue blazer was too big for him. He\u2019d spent the entire day wandering around campus with no one speaking to him. Now he was starving and wasn\u2019t sure if he was allowed to eat in the cafeteria or not. Tim seemed to be the only person at Brown more lost than Madeleine. She helped him negotiate the Ratty and, afterward, took him on a tour of the university. Finally, around ten-thirty that night, they ended up back in Madeleine\u2019s dorm room. Tim had the long-lashed eyes and pretty features of an expensive Bavarian doll, a little prince or yodeling shepherd boy. His blue blazer was on the floor and Madeleine\u2019s shirt unbuttoned when Jennifer Boomgaard came through the door. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201csorry,\u201d and proceeded to stand there, smiling at the floor as if already relishing how this juicy bit of gossip would play along the hall. When she finally did leave, Madeleine sat up and readjusted her clothes, and Tim picked up his blazer and went back to high school.\n\nAt Christmas, when Madeleine went home for vacation, she thought the scale in her parents\u2019 bathroom was broken. She got off to recalibrate the dial and got back on, whereupon the scale again registered the same weight. Stepping in front of the mirror, Madeleine encountered a worried chipmunk staring back.\n\n\u201cAm I not getting asked out because I\u2019m fat,\u201d the chipmunk said, \u201cor am I fat because I\u2019m not getting asked out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never got the freshman fifteen,\u201d her sister gloated when Madeleine came down to breakfast.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t pig out like all my friends did.\u201d Accustomed to Alwyn\u2019s teasing, Madeleine paid no attention, quietly slicing and eating the first of the fifty-seven grapefruits she subsisted on until New Year\u2019s.\n\nDieting fooled you into thinking you could control your life. By January, Madeleine was down five pounds, and by the time squash season ended she was back in great shape, and still she didn\u2019t meet anyone she liked. The boys at college seemed either incredibly immature or prematurely middle-aged, bearded like therapists, warming brandy snifters over candles while listening to Coltrane\u2019s A Love Supreme. It wasn\u2019t until her junior year that Madeleine had a serious boyfriend. Billy Bainbridge was the son of Dorothy Bainbridge, whose uncle owned a third of the newspapers in the United States. Billy had flushed cheeks, blond curls, and a scar on his right temple that made him even more adorable than he already was. He was soft-spoken and nice-smelling, like Ivory soap. Naked, his body was nearly hairless.\n\nBilly didn\u2019t like to talk about his family. Madeleine took this as a sign of good breeding. Billy was a legacy at Brown and sometimes worried that he wouldn\u2019t have gotten in on his own. Sex with Billy was cozy, it was snuggly, it was perfectly fine. He wanted to be a filmmaker. The one film he made for Advanced Filmmaking, however, was a violent, unbroken twelve minutes of Billy throwing fecal-looking brownie mix at the camera. Madeleine began to wonder if there was a reason he never talked about his family.\n\nOne thing he did talk about, however, with increasing intensity, was circumcision. Billy had read an article in an alternative health magazine that argued against the practice, and it made a big impression on him.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s a pretty weird thing to do to a baby,\u201d he said. \u201cCut off part of its dick? What\u2019s so different about a tribe in, like, Papua New Guinea putting bones through their noses and cutting off a baby\u2019s foreskin? A bone through the nose is a lot less invasive.\u201d Madeleine listened, trying to look sympathetic, and hoped Billy would drop the subject. But as the weeks passed he kept returning to it.\n\n\u201cThe doctors just do it automatically in this country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask my parents. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m Jewish or anything.\u201d He derided justifications on the basis of health or hygiene. \u201cMaybe that made sense three thousand years ago, out in the desert, when you couldn\u2019t take a shower. But now?\u201d\n\nOne night, as they were lying in bed, naked, Madeleine noticed Billy examining his penis, stretching it.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for the scar,\u201d he said somberly.\n\nHe interrogated his European friends, Henrik the Intact, Olivier the Foreskinned, asking,\n\n\u201cBut does it feel supersensitive?\u201d Billy was convinced that he\u2019d been deprived of sensation. Madeleine tried not to take this personally. Plus there were other problems with their relationship by then. Billy had a habit of staring deeply into Madeleine\u2019s eyes in a way that was somehow controlling. His roommate situation was odd. He lived off campus with an attractive, muscular girl named Kyle who was sleeping with at least three people, including Fatima Shirazi, a niece of the shah of Iran. On the wall of his living room Billy had painted the words Kill the Father. Killing the father was what, in Billy\u2019s opinion, college was all about.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your father?\u201d he asked Madeleine. \u201cIs it Virginia Woolf? Is it Sontag?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my case,\u201d Madeleine said, \u201cmy father really is my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you have to kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your father?\u201d\n\n\u201cGodard,\u201d he said.\n\nBilly talked about renting a house in Guanajuato with Madeleine over the summer. He said she could write a novel while he made a film. His faith in her, in her writing (even though she hardly wrote any fiction), made Madeleine feel so good that she started going along with the idea. And then one day she came up onto Billy\u2019s front porch and was about to rap on his window when something told her to look in the window instead. In the storm-tossed bed, Billy lay curled, John Lennon\u2013style, against the spread-eagled Kyle. Both were naked. A second later, in a puff of smoke, Fatima materialized, also naked, shaking baby powder over her gleaming Persian skin. She smiled at her bedmates, her teeth seed-like in purple, royal gums.\n\nMaddy\u2019s next boyfriend wasn\u2019t strictly her fault. She would never have met Dabney Carlisle if she hadn\u2019t taken an acting class, and she would never have taken an acting class if it hadn\u2019t been for her mother. As a young woman, Phyllida had wanted to be an actress. Her parents had been opposed, however.\n\n\u201cActing wasn\u2019t what people in our family, especially the ladies, did,\u201d was the way Phyllida put it. Every so often, in reflective moods, she told her daughters the story of her one great disobedience. After graduating from college, Phyllida had \u201crun away\u201d to Hollywood. Without telling her parents, she\u2019d flown out to Los Angeles, staying with a friend from Smith. She\u2019d found a job as a secretary in an insurance company. She and the friend, a girl named Sally Peyton, moved into a bungalow in Santa Monica. In six months Phyllida had three auditions, one screen test, and \u201cloads of invitations.\u201d She\u2019d once seen Jackie Gleason carrying a chihuahua into a restaurant. She\u2019d developed a lustrous suntan she described as \u201cEgyptian.\u201d Whenever Phyllida spoke about this period in her life, it seemed as if she was talking about another person. As for Alton, he became quiet, fully aware that Phyllida\u2019s loss had been his gain. It was on the train back to New York, the next Christmas, that she\u2019d met the straight-backed lieutenant colonel, recently returned from Berlin. Phyllida never went back to L.A. She got married instead. \u201cAnd had you two,\u201d she told her daughters.\n\nPhyllida\u2019s inability to realize her dreams had given Madeleine her own. Her mother\u2019s life was the great counterexample. It represented the injustice Madeleine\u2019s life would rectify. To come of age simultaneously with a great social movement, to grow up in the age of Betty Friedan and ERA marches and Bella Abzug\u2019s indomitable hats, to define your identity when it was being redefined, this was a freedom as great as any of the American freedoms Madeleine had read about in school. She could remember the night, in 1973, when her family gathered before the television in the den to watch the tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. How she, Alwyn, and Phyllida had rooted for Billie Jean, while Alton had pulled for Bobby Riggs. How, as King ran Riggs back and forth across the court, outserving him, hitting winners he was too slow to return, Alton began to grumble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fair fight! Riggs is too old.\n\nIf they want a real test, she should play Smith or Newcombe.\u201d\n\nBut it didn\u2019t matter what Alton said.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that Bobby Riggs was fifty-five and King twenty-nine, or that Riggs hadn\u2019t been an especially great player even in his prime. What mattered was that this tennis match was on national television, during prime time, billed for weeks as \u201cThe Battle of the Sexes,\u201d and that the woman was winning. If any single moment defined Madeleine\u2019s generation of girls, dramatized their aspirations, put into clear focus what they expected from themselves and from life, it was those two hours and fifteen minutes when the country watched a man in white shorts get thrashed by a woman, pummeled repeatedly until all he could do, after match point, was to jump feebly over the net. And even that was telling: you were supposed to jump the net when you won, not lost. So how male was that, to act like a winner when you\u2019d just been creamed?\n\nAt the first meeting of Acting Workshop, Professor Churchill, a bald bullfrog of a man, asked the students to say something about themselves. Half the people in the class were theater majors, serious about acting or directing. Madeleine mumbled something about loving Shakespeare and Eugene O\u2019Neill.\n\nDabney Carlisle stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019ve done a little modeling work, down in New York. My agent suggested I should take some acting lessons. So here I am.\u201d\n\nThe modeling he\u2019d done consisted of a single magazine ad, showing a group of Leni Riefenstahl\u2013ish athletes in boxer briefs, standing in a receding line on a beach whose black volcanic sand steamed around their marble feet. Madeleine didn\u2019t see the photograph until she and Dabney were already going out, when Dabney gingerly took it out of the bartending manual where he kept it safely pressed. She was inclined to make fun of it but something reverential in Dabney\u2019s expression stopped her. And so she asked where the beach had been (Montauk) and why it was so black (it wasn\u2019t) and how much he\u2019d gotten paid (\u201cfour figures\u201d) and what the other guys were like (\u201ctotal a-holes\u201d) and if he was wearing the underpants right now. It was sometimes difficult, with boys, to take an interest in the things that interested them. But with Dabney she wished it had been curling, she longed for it to be the model UN, anything but male modeling. This, anyway, was the authentic emotion she now identified herself as having felt. At the time\u2014Dabney cautioned her against touching the ad before he got it laminated\u2014Madeleine had rehearsed in her mind the standard arguments: that though objectification was de facto bad, the emergence of the idealized male form in the mass media scored a point for equality; that if men started getting objectified and started worrying about their looks and their bodies, they might begin to understand the burden women had been living with since forever, and might therefore be sensitized to these issues of the body. She even went so far as to admire Dabney for his courage in allowing himself to be photographed in snug little gray underpants.\n\nLooking the way Madeleine and Dabney did, it was inevitable that they would be cast as romantic leads in the scenes the workshop performed. Madeleine was Rosalind to Dabney\u2019s wooden Orlando, Maggie to his brick-like Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. To rehearse the first time, they met at Dabney\u2019s fraternity house. Merely stepping through the front door reinforced Madeleine\u2019s aversion to places like Sigma Chi. It was around ten on a Sunday morning. The vestiges of the previous evening\u2019s \u201cHawaiian Night\u201d were still there to see\u2014the lei hanging from the antlers of the moose head on the wall, the plastic \u201cgrass\u201d skirt trampled on the beer-sodden floor, a skirt that, should Madeleine succumb to the outrageous good looks of Dabney Carlisle, she might, at a minimum, have to watch some drunken slut hula in to the baying of the brothers, or, at a maximum (for mai tais made you do crazy things), might even don herself, up in Dabney\u2019s room, for his pleasure alone. On the low-slung couch two Sigma Chi members were watching TV. At Madeleine\u2019s appearance, they stirred, rising out of the gloom like openmouthed carp. She hurried to the back stairs, thinking the things she always thought when it came to frats and frat guys: that their appeal stemmed from a primitive need for protection (one thought of Neanderthal clans banding together against other Neanderthal clans); that the hazing the pledges underwent (being stripped and blindfolded and left in the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel with bus fare taped to their genitals) enacted the very fears of male rape and emasculation that membership in the fraternity promised protection against; that any guy who longed to join a frat suffered from insecurities that poisoned his relationships with women; that there was something seriously wrong with homophobic guys who centered their lives around a homoerotic bond; that the stately mansions maintained by generations of dues-paying fraternity members were in reality sites for date rape and problem drinking; that frats always smelled bad; that you didn\u2019t ever want to shower in one; that only freshman girls were stupid enough to go to frat parties; that Kelly Traub had slept with a Sigma Delt guy who kept saying,\n\n\u201cNow you see it, now you don\u2019t, now you see it, now you don\u2019t\u201d; that such a thing wasn\u2019t going to happen to her, to Madeleine, ever.\n\nWhat she hadn\u2019t expected when it came to a fraternity was a sunny-haired silent type like Dabney, learning his lines in a folding chair, in parachute pants, shoeless. Looking back on their relationship, Madeleine figured she\u2019d had no choice. Dabney and she had been selected for each other in a Royal Wedding kind of way. She was Prince Charles to his Princess Di. She knew he couldn\u2019t act. Dabney had the artistic soul of a third-string tight end. In life Dabney moved and said little. Onstage he moved not at all but had to say a lot. His best dramatic moments came when the strain on his face from remembering his lines resembled the emotion he was trying to simulate.\n\nActing opposite Dabney made Madeleine more stiff and nervous than she already was. She wanted to do scenes with the talented kids in the workshop. She suggested interesting bits from The Vietnamization of New Jersey and Mamet\u2019s Sexual Perversity in Chicago, but got no takers. Nobody wanted to lower his or her average by acting with her.\n\nDabney didn\u2019t let it bother him. \u201cBunch of little shits in that class,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll never get any print work, much less movies.\u201d\n\nHe was more laconic than she liked her boyfriends to be. He had the wit of a store mannequin. But Dabney\u2019s physical perfection pushed these realities out of her mind. She\u2019d never been in a relationship where she wasn\u2019t the more attractive partner. It was slightly intimidating. But she could handle it. At three a.m., while Dabney lay sleeping beside her, Madeleine found she was up to the task of inventorying each abdominal cord, every hard lump of muscle. She enjoyed applying calipers to Dabney\u2019s waist to measure his body fat. Underwear modeling was all about the abs, Dabney said, and the abs were all about sit-ups and diet. The pleasure Madeleine got from looking at Dabney was reminiscent of the pleasure she\u2019d gotten as a girl from looking at sleek hunting dogs. Underneath this pleasure, like the coals that fed it, was a fierce need to enfold Dabney and siphon off his strength and beauty. It was all very primitive and evolutionary and felt fantastic. The problem was that she hadn\u2019t been able to allow herself to enjoy Dabney or even to exploit him a little, but had had to go and be a total girl about it and convince herself that she was in love with him. Madeleine required emotion, apparently. She disapproved of the idea of meaningless, extremely satisfying sex.\n\nAnd so she began to tell herself that Dabney\u2019s acting was \u201crestrained\u201d or \u201ceconomical.\u201d She appreciated that Dabney was \u201csecure about himself\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t need to prove anything\u201d and wasn\u2019t a \u201cshowoff.\u201d Instead of worrying that he was dull, Madeleine decided he was gentle. Instead of thinking he was poorly read, she called him intuitive. She exaggerated Dabney\u2019s mental abilities in order not to feel shallow for wanting his body. To this end she helped Dabney write\u2014O.K., she wrote\u2014English and anthro papers for him and, when he got A\u2019s, felt confirmed of his intelligence. She sent him off to modeling auditions in New York with good-luck kisses and listened to him complain bitterly about the \u201cfaggots\u201d who hadn\u2019t hired his services. It turned out that Dabney wasn\u2019t so beautiful. Among the truly beautiful he was only so-so. He couldn\u2019t even smile right.\n\nAt the end of the semester, the acting students met separately with the professor for a critical review. Churchill welcomed Madeleine with a wolfish yellow grin, then sat back jowly and deliberate in his chair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed having you in the class, Madeleine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t act.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t hold back,\u201d Madeleine said, chastened but laughing. \u201cGive it to me straight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a good feel for language, for Shakespeare especially. But your voice is reedy and you look worried onstage. Your forehead has a perpetual crease. A vocal coach could go a long way toward helping your instrument. But I worry about your worrying. You\u2019ve got it right now. The crease.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is fine.\n\nIf you\u2019re playing Eleanor Roosevelt. Or Golda Meir. But those parts don\u2019t come around very often.\u201d\n\nChurchill, steepling his fingers, continued, \u201cI\u2019d be more diplomatic if I thought this meant a lot to you. But I get the feeling you don\u2019t want to be a professional actress, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cGood. You\u2019re lovely. You\u2019re bright. The world is your oyster. Go with my blessings.\u201d\n\nWhen Dabney returned from his review with Churchill, he looked even more self-contented than usual.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Madeleine asked. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says I\u2019m perfect for soaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoap commercials?\u201d\n\nDabney looked peeved. \u201cDays of Our Lives. General Hospital. Ever heard of those?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he mean that as a compliment?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow else could he mean it? Soap actors have it made! They work every day, make great money, and never have to travel. I\u2019ve been wasting my time trying to get all this advertising work. Screw that. I\u2019m going to tell my agent to start lining up some auditions for soaps.\u201d\n\nMadeleine was silent at this news. She\u2019d assumed Dabney\u2019s enthusiasm for modeling was temporary, a tuition-earning scheme. Now she realized he was in earnest. She was, in fact, dating a model.\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Dabney asked her.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust that\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014but I doubt Prof. Churchill has that high of an opinion of the acting on Days of Our Lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he tell us the first class? He said he was giving a workshop in acting. For people who wanted to work in the theater.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the theater doesn\u2019t mean \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he tellyou? Did he say you were going to be a movie star?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told me I couldn\u2019t act,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cHe did, huh?\u201d Dabney put his hands in his pockets, leaning back on his heels as if relieved not to have to deliver this verdict himself. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re so pissed off? And have to tear down my crit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not tearing down your crit. I\u2019m just not sure you got Churchill\u2019s meaning, exactly.\u201d\n\nDabney let out a bitter laugh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get it right, would I? I\u2019m too dumb. I\u2019m just some dumb jock you have to write English papers for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. You seem to have a pretty good grasp of sarcasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, am I ever lucky,\u201d Dabney said.\n\n\u201cWhat would I do if you weren\u2019t around?\n\nYou have to catch all the subtleties for me, don\u2019t you? You and your flair for catching subtleties. It must be nice to be rich and sit around all day catching subtleties.\n\nWhat do you know about needing to make a living?\n\nIt\u2019s fine for you to make fun of my ad. You didn\u2019t get into college on a football scholarship. And now you have to come in here and run me down.\n\nYou know what? This is bullshit. This is total bullshit. I\u2019m sick of your condescension and your superiority complex. And Churchill\u2019s right. You can\u2019t act.\u201d\n\nIn the end Madeleine had to admit that Dabney was far more fluent than she\u2019d ever expected. He was capable of portraying a range of emotions, too, anger, disgust, wounded pride, and of simulating others, including affection, passion, and love. He had a great career in the soaps ahead of him.\n\n\n\nMadeleine and Dabney had broken up in May, right before summer, and there was no better time than summer to forget about somebody. She\u2019d gone straight down to Prettybrook the day she finished her last exam. For once she was glad to have such sociable parents. With all the cocktail parties and convivial dinners on Wilson Lane there was little time to dwell on herself. In July, she got an internship at a nonprofit poetry organization on the Upper East Side and began riding the train into the city. Madeleine\u2019s job was to oversee submissions for the annual New Voices award, which involved making sure that the submissions were complete before sending them off to the judge (Howard Nemerov, that year). Madeleine wasn\u2019t particularly technical, but because everyone else in the office was even less so, she ended up being the go-to person whenever the copier or the dot-matrix printer malfunctioned. Her coworker Brenda would come up to Madeleine\u2019s desk at least once a week and ask in a babyish voice,\n\n\u201cCan you help me? The printer\u2019s not being nice.\u201d The only part of the day Madeleine enjoyed was her lunch hour, when she got to walk around the muggy, stinking, thrilling streets, eat quiche in a French bistro as narrow as a bowling alley, and stare at the styles women her age or a little older were wearing. When the one straight guy at the nonprofit asked her to have a drink after work,\n\nMadeleine cooly answered, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t,\u201d trying not to feel bad about hurting his feelings, trying to think about her own feelings for a change.\n\nShe arrived back at college for her senior year, then, intent on being studious, career-oriented, and aggressively celibate. Casting a wide net, Madeleine sent away for applications to Yale grad school (English Language and Literature), an organization for teaching English in China, and an advertising internship at Foote, Cone & Belding, in Chicago. She studied for the GRE using a sample booklet. The verbal section was easy. The math required brushing up on her high school algebra. The logic problems, however, were a defeat to the spirit. \u201cAt the annual dancers\u2019 ball a number of dancers performed their favorite dance with their favorite partners. Alan danced the tango, while Becky watched the waltz. James and Charlotte were fantastic together. Keith was magnificent during his foxtrot and Simon excelled at the rumba. Jessica danced with Alan. But Laura did not dance with Simon. Can you determine who danced with whom and which dance they each enjoyed?\u201d Logic wasn\u2019t something Madeleine had been expressly taught. It seemed unfair to be asked about it. She did as the book suggested, diagramming the problems, placing Alan, Becky, James, Charlotte, Keith, Simon, Jessica, and Laura on the dance floor of her scrap paper, and pairing them according to the instructions. But their complicated transit wasn\u2019t a subject Madeleine\u2019s mind naturally followed. She wanted to know why James and Charlotte were fantastic together, and if Jessica and Alan were going out, and why Laura wouldn\u2019t dance with Simon, and if Becky was upset, watching.\n\nOne afternoon, on the bulletin board outside Hillel House, Madeleine noticed a flyer announcing the Melvin and Hetty Greenberg Fellowship for summer study at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and she applied for that. Using contacts of Alton\u2019s in the publishing world, she put on a business suit and went down to New York for an informational interview with an editor at Simon and Schuster. The editor, Terry Wirth, had once been a bright, idealistic English major just like Madeleine, but she found him that afternoon, in his tiny, manuscript-piled office looking onto the gloomy canyon of Sixth Avenue, a middle-aged father of two with a salary far below the median of his former classmates and a nasty, hour-and-fifteen-minute commute to his split-level in Montclair, New Jersey. On the prospects of a book he was publishing that month, the memoir of a migrant farmer,\n\nWirth said, \u201cNow\u2019s the calm before the calm.\u201d He gave Madeleine a stack of manuscripts from the slush pile to critique, offering to pay her fifty bucks a pop.\n\nInstead of reading the manuscripts, Madeleine took the subway down to the East Village. After buying a bag of pignoli cookies at De Robertis, she plunged into a hair salon, where, on a whim, she allowed a butch woman with a short, rat-tailed haircut to go to work on her.\n\n\u201cCut it close on the sides, higher on top,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Madeleine answered. To show her resolve, she took off her glasses. Forty-five minutes later, she put her glasses back on, horror-struck and elated at the transformation. Her head was really quite enormous. She had never fathomed its true size. She looked like Annie Lennox, or David Bowie. Like someone the hairdresser might be dating.\n\nThe Annie Lennox look was O.K., however. Androgyny was just the thing. Once she was back at school, Madeleine\u2019s haircut proclaimed her serious frame of mind, and by the end of the year, when her bangs had grown out to a maddening length she didn\u2019t know what to do with, she remained firm in her renunciations. (Her only slip-up had been the night in her bedroom with Mitchell, but nothing had happened.) Madeleine had her thesis to write. She had her future to figure out. The last thing she needed was a boy to distract her from her work and disturb her equilibrium. But then, during spring semester, she met Leonard Bankhead and her resolve went out the window.\n\nHe shaved irregularly. His Skoal had a menthol scent, cleaner, more pleasant than Madeleine expected. Whenever she looked up to find Leonard staring at her with his St. Bernard\u2019s eyes (the eyes of a drooler, maybe, but also of a loyal brute who could dig you out of an avalanche), Madeleine couldn\u2019t help staring back a significant moment longer.\n\nOne evening in early March, when she went to the Rockefeller Library to pick up the reserve reading for Semiotics 211, she found Leonard there as well. He was leaning against the counter, speaking animatedly to the girl on duty, who was unfortunately rather cute in a busty Bettie Page way.\n\n\u201cThink about it, though,\u201d Leonard was saying to the girl. \u201cThink about it from the point of view of the fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K., I\u2019m a fly,\u201d the girl said with a throaty laugh.\n\n\u201cWe move in slow motion to them. They can see the swatter coming from a million miles away. The flies are like, \u2018Wake me when the swatter gets close.\u2019\u201d\n\nNoticing Madeleine, the girl told Leonard, \u201cJust a sec.\u201d\n\nMadeleine held out her call order slip, and the girl took it and went off into the stacks.\n\n\u201cPicking up the Balzac?\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBalzac to the rescue.\u201d\n\nNormally, Madeleine would have had many things to say to this, many comments about Balzac to make. But her mind was a blank. She didn\u2019t even remember to smile until he\u2019d looked away.\n\nBettie Page came back with Madeleine\u2019s order, sliding it toward her and immediately turning back to Leonard. He seemed different than he did in class, more exuberant, supercharged. He raised his eyebrows in a crazed, Jack Nicholson way and said,\n\n\u201cMy house fly theory is related to my theory about why time seems to go faster as you get older.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d the girl asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s proportional,\u201d Leonard explained. \u201cWhen you\u2019re five, you\u2019ve only been alive a couple thousand days. But by the time you\u2019re fifty, you\u2019ve lived around twenty thousand days. So a day when you\u2019re five seems longer because it\u2019s a greater percentage of the whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d the girl teased, \u201cthat follows.\u201d\n\nBut Madeleine had understood. \u201cThat makes sense,\u201d she said. \u201cI always wondered why that was.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a theory,\u201d Leonard said.\n\nBettie Page tapped Leonard\u2019s hand to get his attention.\n\n\u201cFlies aren\u2019t always so fast,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve caught flies in my bare hands before.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially in winter,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably the kind of fly I\u2019d be. One of those knucklehead winter flies.\u201d\n\nThere was no good excuse for Madeleine to hang around the reserve reading room, and so she put the Balzac into her bag and headed out.\n\nShe began to dress differently on the days she had semiotics. She took out her diamond studs, leaving her ears bare. She stood in front of the mirror wondering if her Annie Hall glasses might possibly project a New Wave look. She decided not and wore her contacts. She unearthed a pair of Beatle boots she\u2019d bought at a church basement sale in Vinalhaven. She put up her collar, and wore more black.\n\nIn Week Four, Zipperstein assigned Umberto Eco\u2019s The Role of the Reader. It hadn\u2019t done much for Madeleine. She wasn\u2019t all that interested, as a reader, in the reader. She was still partial to that increasingly eclipsed entity: the writer. Madeleine had a feeling that most semiotic theorists had been unpopular as children, often bullied or overlooked, and so had directed their lingering rage onto literature. They wanted to demote the author. They wanted a book, that hard-won, transcendent thing, to be a text, contingent, indeterminate, and open for suggestions. They wanted the reader to be the main thing. Because they were readers.\n\nWhereas Madeleine was perfectly happy with the idea of genius. She wanted a book to take her places she couldn\u2019t get to herself. She thought a writer should work harder writing a book than she did reading it. When it came to letters and literature, Madeleine championed a virtue that had fallen out of esteem: namely, clarity. The week after they read Eco, they read portions of Derrida\u2019s Writing and Difference. The week after that, they read Jonathan Culler\u2019s On Deconstruction, and Madeleine came to class ready to contribute to the discussion for the first time. Before she could do so, however, Thurston beat her to it.\n\n\u201cThe Culler was passable at best,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cWhat didn\u2019t you like about it?\u201d the professor asked him.\n\nThurston had his knee up against the edge of the seminar table. He pushed his chair up on its back legs, scrunching up his face. \u201cIt\u2019s readable and everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd well argued and all that. But it\u2019s just a question of whether you can use a discredited discourse\u2014like, say, reason\u2014to explicate something as paradigmatically revolutionary as deconstruction.\u201d\n\nMadeleine searched along the table for mutual eye-rolling but the other students seemed eager to hear what Thurston had to say.\n\n\u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cWell, what I mean is, first off, reason is just a discourse like any other, right? It\u2019s only been imbued with a sense of absolute truth because it\u2019s the privileged discourse of the West. What Derrida\u2019s saying is that you have to use reason because, you know, reason is all there is. But at the same time you have to be aware that language is by its very nature unreasonable. You have to reason yourself out of reasonableness.\u201d He pulled up the sleeve of his T-shirt and scratched his bony shoulder. \u201cCuller, on the other hand, is still operating in the old mode. Mono as opposed to stereo. So from that point of view, I found the book, yeah, a little bit disappointing.\u201d\n\nA silence ensued. And deepened.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Madeleine said, glancing at Leonard for support.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just me, but wasn\u2019t it a relief to read a logical argument for once? Culler boils down everything Eco and Derrida are saying into a digestible form.\u201d\n\nThurston turned his head slowly to gaze across the seminar table at her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. But Culler\u2019s work is of a different order than Derrida. Every genius needs an explainer. That\u2019s what Culler is for Derrida.\u201d\n\nMadeleine shrugged this off. \u201cI got a lot better idea of what deconstruction is from reading Culler than from reading Derrida.\u201d\n\nThurston took pains to give her point of view full consideration. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of a simplification to be simple,\u201d he said.\n\nClass ended shortly after that, leaving Madeleine fuming. As she was coming out of Sayles Hall, she saw Leonard standing on the steps, holding a Coke can. She went right up to him and said, \u201cThanks for the help.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you were on my side. Why didn\u2019t you say anything in class?\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst Law of Thermodynamics,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cConservation of energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you agree with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did and I didn\u2019t,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t like the Culler?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Culler\u2019s good. But Derrida\u2019s a heavyweight. You can\u2019t just write him off.\u201d\n\nMadeleine looked dubious, but Derrida wasn\u2019t who she was mad at. \u201cConsidering how Thurston\u2019s always going on about how much he worships language, you\u2019d think he wouldn\u2019t parrot so much jargon. He used the word phallus three times today.\u201d\n\nLeonard smiled. \u201cFigures if he says it it\u2019ll be like having one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe drives me crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to get some coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd fascist. That\u2019s another of his favorites. You know the dry cleaners on Thayer Street? He called them fascist.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust have gone extra heavy on the starch.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYes, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just invited me for coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did?\u201d Leonard said. \u201cYes, I did. O.K. Let\u2019s go get coffee.\u201d\n\nLeonard didn\u2019t want to go to the Blue Room. He said he didn\u2019t like to be around college students. They headed through Wayland Arch up to Hope Street, in the direction of Fox Point.\n\nAs they walked, Leonard spat into his Coke can every so often.\n\n\u201cPardon my disgusting habit,\u201d he said.\n\nMadeleine wrinkled up her nose. \u201cAre you going to keep doing that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I do it. It\u2019s just something I picked up from my rodeo days.\u201d\n\nAt the next trash can they came to, he tossed the Coke and spat out his wad of tobacco.\n\nWithin a few blocks pretty campus plantings of tulip and daffodil gave way to treeless streets lined by working-class houses painted in cheerful hues. They passed a Portuguese bakery and a Portuguese fish store selling sardines and cuttlefish. The kids here had no yards to play in but seemed happy enough, wheeling back and forth along the blank sidewalks. Nearer the highway, there were a few warehouses and, on the corner of Wickenden, a local diner.\n\nLeonard wanted to sit at the counter. \u201cI need to be close to the pies,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to see which one is talking to me.\u201d\n\nAs Madeleine took a stool next to him, Leonard stared at the dessert case.\n\n\u201cDo you remember when they used to serve slices of cheese with apple pie?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cVaguely,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to do that anymore. You and I are probably the only two people in this place who remember it.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I don\u2019t remember it,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t? Never had a little slice of Wisconsin cheddar with your apple pie? I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll put a slice of cheese on a piece if you ask them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I liked it. I\u2019m just mourning its passage.\u201d\n\nThe conversation lapsed. And suddenly, to her surprise, Madeleine was flooded with panic. She felt the silence like a judgment against her. At the same time, her anxiety about the silence made it even harder to speak.\n\nThough it didn\u2019t feel nice to be so nervous, it did feel nice, in a way. It had been a while since Madeleine had been that way around a guy.\n\nThe waitress was down at the end of the counter talking to another customer.\n\n\u201cSo why are you taking Zipperstein\u2019s class?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cPhilosophical interest,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cLiterally. Philosophy\u2019s all about theory of language right now. It\u2019s all linguistics. So I figured I\u2019d check it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a biology major, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I really am,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThe philosophy\u2019s just a sideline.\u201d\n\nMadeleine realized that she\u2019d never dated a science major.\n\n\u201cDo you want to be a doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now all I want to do is get the waitress\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nLeonard waved his arm a few times to no avail. Suddenly he said, \u201cIs it hot in here?\u201d\n\nWithout waiting for an answer, he reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a blue bandanna, which he proceeded to put over his head, tying it in back and making a number of small, precise adjustments until he was satisfied. Madeleine watched this with a slight feeling of disappointment. She associated bandannas with hacky sack, the Grateful Dead, and alfalfa sprouts, all of which she could do without. Still, she was impressed with Leonard\u2019s sheer size on the stool next to her. His largeness, coupled with the softness\u2014the delicacy, almost\u2014of his voice, gave Madeleine a strange fairytale feeling, as if she were a princess sitting beside a gentle giant.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, though,\u201d Leonard said, still staring in the waitress\u2019s direction,\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get interested in philosophy because of linguistics. I got interested for the eternal verities. To learn how to die, et cetera. Now it\u2019s more like, \u2018What do we mean when we say we die?\u2019\n\n\u2018What do we mean we mean when we say we die?\u2019\u201d\n\nFinally, the waitress came over. Madeleine ordered the cottage cheese plate and coffee. Leonard ordered apple pie and coffee. When the waitress left, he spun his stool rightward, so that their knees briefly touched.\n\n\u201cHow very female of you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cCottage cheese.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like cottage cheese.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you on a diet? You don\u2019t look like someone on a diet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nAnd here, for the first time, Leonard appeared rattled. Beneath the line of the bandanna, his face colored, and he spun away, breaking eye contact. \u201cJust curious,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the next second, he spun back, resuming the previous conversation. \u201cDerrida\u2019s supposed to be a lot clearer in French,\u201d he said. \u201cRumor has it his prose in French is limpid.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I should read it in French, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know French?\u201d Leonard said, sounding impressed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not great. I can read Flaubert.\u201d\n\nIt was then that Madeleine made a big mistake. Things were going so well with Leonard, the mood was so promising\u2014even the weather lending a hand because, after they finished their food and left the diner, walking back to campus, a March drizzle forced them to share Madeleine\u2019s collapsible umbrella\u2014that a feeling came over her like those she\u2019d had as a girl when treated to a pastry or a dessert, a happiness so fraught by an awareness of its brevity that she took the tiniest bites, making the cream puff or \u00e9clair last as long as possible. In this same way, instead of seeing where the afternoon led, Madeleine decided to check its progress, to save some for later, and she told Leonard she had to go home and study.\n\nThey didn\u2019t kiss goodbye. They didn\u2019t come close to it.\n\nLeonard, hunching under the umbrella, abruptly said \u201cBye\u201d and hurried off through the rain, keeping his head down. Madeleine went back to the Narragansett. She lay down on her bed, and didn\u2019t move for a long time.\n\nThe days dragged until the next meeting of Sem 211. Madeleine arrived early, choosing a seat at the seminar table next to Leonard\u2019s usual spot. But when he showed up, ten minutes late, he took an available chair next to the professor. He didn\u2019t say anything in class or glance in Madeleine\u2019s direction even once. His face looked swollen and there was a line of blemishes running down one cheek. When the class ended, Leonard was the first one out the door.\n\nThe next week he missed class entirely.\n\nAnd so Madeleine was left to contend with semiotics, and with Zipperstein and his disciples, all by herself.\n\nBy now they had moved on to Derrida\u2019s Of Grammatology. The Derrida went like this: \u201cIn that sense, it is the Aufhebung of other writings, particularly of hieroglyphic script and of the Leibnizian characteristic that had been criticized previously through one and the same gesture.\u201d In poetic moods, the Derrida went like this: \u201cWhat writing itself, in its nonphonetic moment, betrays, is life. It menaces at once the breath, the spirit, and history as the spirit\u2019s relationship with itself. It is their end, their finitude, their paralysis.\u201d\n\nSince Derrida claimed that language, by its very nature, undermined any meaning it attempted to promote, Madeleine wondered how Derrida expected her to get his meaning. Maybe he didn\u2019t. That was why he deployed so much arcane terminology, so many loop-de-looping clauses. That was why he said what he said in sentences it took a minute to identify the subjects of. (Could \u201cthe access to pluridimensionality and to a delinearized temporality\u201d really be a subject?)\n\nReading a novel after reading semiotic theory was like jogging empty-handed after jogging with hand weights. After getting out of Semiotics 211, Madeleine fled to the Rockefeller Library, down to B Level, where the stacks exuded a vivifying smell of mold, and grabbed something\u2014anything, The House of Mirth, Daniel Deronda\u2014to restore herself to sanity. How wonderful it was when one sentence followed logically from the sentence before! What exquisite guilt she felt, wickedly enjoying narrative! Madeleine felt safe with a nineteenth-century novel. There were going to be people in it. Something was going to happen to them in a place resembling the world.\n\nThen, too, there were lots of weddings in Wharton and Austen. There were all kinds of irresistible gloomy men.\n\nThe next Thursday, Madeleine came to class wearing a Norwegian sweater with a snowflake design. She\u2019d gone back to her glasses. For the second week in a row, Leonard didn\u2019t show up. Madeleine worried that he\u2019d dropped the class, but it was too late in the semester to do that. Zipperstein said,\n\n\u201cHas anybody seen Mr. Bankhead? Is he sick?\u201d Nobody knew. Thurston arrived with a girl named Cassandra Hart, both of them sniffly and heroin-pale. Taking out a black Flair pen, Thurston wrote on Cassandra\u2019s bare shoulder,\n\n\u201cNot Real Skin.\u201d\n\nZipperstein was in a lively mood. He\u2019d just returned from a conference in New York, dressed differently than usual. Listening to him talk about the paper he\u2019d given at the New School, Madeleine suddenly understood. Semiotics was the form Zipperstein\u2019s midlife crisis had taken. Becoming a semiotician allowed Zipperstein to wear a leather jacket, to fly off to Douglas Sirk retrospectives in Vancouver, and to get all the sexy waifs in his classes. Instead of leaving his wife, Zipperstein had left the English department. Instead of buying a sports car, he\u2019d bought deconstruction.\n\nHe sat at the seminar table now and started speaking:\n\n\u201cI hope you read the Semiotext(e) for this week. Apropos of Lyotard, and in homage to Gertrude Stein, let me suggest the following: the thing about desire is that there is no there there.\u201d\n\nThat was it. That was Zipperstein\u2019s prompt. He sat before them, blinking, waiting for somebody to reply. He appeared to have all the patience in the world.\n\nMadeleine had wanted to know what semiotics was. She\u2019d wanted to know what the fuss was about. Well, now she felt she knew.\n\nBut then, in Week Ten, for reasons that were entirely extracurricular, semiotics began making sense.\n\nIt was a Friday night in April, just past eleven, and Madeleine was in bed, reading. The assigned text for that week was Roland Barthes\u2019 A Lover\u2019s Discourse. For a book purportedly about love, it didn\u2019t look very romantic. The cover was a somber chocolate brown, the title turquoise. There was no author photograph and only a sketchy bio, listing Barthes\u2019 other works.\n\nMadeleine had the book in her lap. With her right hand she was eating peanut butter straight from the jar. The spoon fit perfectly against the curve of her upper palate, allowing the peanut butter to dissolve creamily against her tongue.\n\nOpening to the introduction, she began to read:\n\nThe necessity for this book is to be found in the following consideration: that the lover\u2019s discourse is today of an extreme solitude.\n\nOutside, the temperature, which had remained cold through March, had shot up into the fifties. The resulting thaw was alarming in its suddenness, drainpipes and gutters dripping, sidewalks puddling, streets flooded, a constant sound of water rushing downhill.\n\nMadeleine had her windows open on the liquid darkness. She sucked the spoon and read on:\n\nWhat we have been able to say below about waiting, anxiety, memory is no more than a modest supplement offered to the reader to be made free with, to be added to, subtracted from, and passed on to others: around the figure, the players pass the handkerchief which sometimes, by a final parenthesis, is held a second longer before handing it on. (Ideally, the book would be a cooperative: \u201cTo the United Readers and Lovers.\u201d)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only that this writing seemed beautiful to Madeleine. It wasn\u2019t only that these opening sentences of Barthes\u2019 made immediate sense. It wasn\u2019t only the relief at recognizing that here, finally, was a book she might write her final paper on. What made Madeleine sit up in bed was something closer to the reason she read books in the first place and had always loved them. Here was a sign that she wasn\u2019t alone. Here was an articulation of what she had been so far mutely feeling. In bed on a Friday night, wearing sweatpants, her hair tied back, her glasses smudged, and eating peanut butter from the jar, Madeleine was in a state of extreme solitude.\n\nIt had to do with Leonard. With how she felt about him and how she couldn\u2019t tell anyone. With how much she liked him and how little she knew about him. With how desperately she wanted to see him and how hard it was to do so.\n\nIn recent days, from her solitude, Madeleine had sent out feelers. She talked about Semiotics 211 with her roommates, mentioning Thurston, Cassandra, and Leonard. It turned out that Abby knew Leonard from her freshman year.\n\n\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d Madeleine asked.\n\n\u201cSort of intense. Really smart, but intense. He used to call me all the time. Like every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he like you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he just wanted to talk. He\u2019d keep me on the phone for an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you guys talk about?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything! His relationship. My relationship. His parents, my parents. Jimmy Carter getting attacked by that swamp rabbit, which he was obsessed about. He\u2019d go on and on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was he going out with?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome girl named Mindy. But then they broke up. That\u2019s when he really started calling me. He\u2019d call like six times a day. He was always going on about how good Mindy smelled. She had this smell that was supposedly perfectly compatible to Leonard, chemically. He was worried no girl would ever smell right to him again. I told him it was probably her moisturizer. He said no, it was her skin. It was chemically perfect. That\u2019s what he\u2019s like.\u201d She paused and gave Madeleine a searching look. \u201cWhy are you asking? Do you like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just know him from class,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to invite him for dinner?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll invite him to dinner,\u201d Abby said.\n\nThe dinner had been on Tuesday night, three days ago. Leonard had come politely bearing a gift, a set of dish towels. He\u2019d dressed up, wearing a white shirt with a skinny necktie, his long hair gathered in a masculine ponytail like a Scottish warrior. He was touchingly sincere, saying hello to Abby, handing her the wrapped gift and thanking her for the invitation.\n\nMadeleine tried not to seem overeager. At dinner, she paid attention to Brian Weeger, whose breath had a dog-food smell. A couple of times, when she looked over at Leonard, he stared back, fixedly, appearing almost upset. Later, when Madeleine was in the kitchen, rinsing dishes, Leonard came in. She turned to find him inspecting a bump on the wall.\n\n\u201cThis must be an old gas main,\u201d he said.\n\nMadeleine looked at the bump, which had been painted over many times.\n\n\u201cThey used to have gas lamps in these old places,\u201d Leonard went on.\n\n\u201cThey probably used to pump the gas up from the basement. If anybody\u2019s pilot blew out, on any floor, you\u2019d have a leak. Gas didn\u2019t have an odor back then, either. They didn\u2019t start adding methyl mercaptan until later.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood to know,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cThis place must have been a powder keg.\u201d Leonard tapped the jutting object with his fingernail, turned, and looked Madeleine meaningfully in the face.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been going to class,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s head was way up above her, but then he bent down, in a peaceful, leaf-eater motion, and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been feeling well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you sick?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m better now.\u201d\n\nIn the living room Olivia called out, \u201cWho wants some Delamain? It\u2019s yummy!\u201d\n\n\u201cI want some,\u201d Brian Weeger said. \u201cThat stuff\u2019s killer.\u201d\n\nLeonard said, \u201cWere the dish towels all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dish towels. I bought you some dish towels.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re great,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect. We\u2019ll use them! Thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have brought wine, or scotch, but that\u2019s the kind of thing my father would do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do anything your father would do?\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s face and voice remained solemn as he replied, \u201cMy father is a depressive who self-medicates with alcohol. My mother is more or less the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do they live?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re divorced. My mother still lives in Portland, where I\u2019m from. My dad\u2019s in Europe. He lives in Antwerp. Last time I heard.\u201d\n\nThis interchange was encouraging, in a way. Leonard was sharing personal information. On the other hand, the information indicated that he had a troubled relationship with his parents, who were themselves troubled, and Madeleine made a point of going out only with guys who liked their parents.\n\n\u201cWhat does your father do?\u201d Leonard asked.\n\nCaught off guard, Madeleine hesitated. \u201cHe used to work at a college,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s retired.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was he? Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the president.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s face twitched. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a small college. In New Jersey. It\u2019s called Baxter.\u201d\n\nAbby came in to get some glasses. Leonard helped her get them off the top shelf. When she was gone, he turned back to Madeleine and said, as if in pain, \u201cThere\u2019s a Fellini film playing at the Cable Car this weekend. Amarcord.\u201d\n\nMadeleine gazed encouragingly up at him. There were all kinds of outmoded, novelistic words to describe how she was feeling, words like aflutter. But she had her rules. One rule was that the guy had to ask her out, not the other way around.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s playing on Saturday,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cThis Saturday?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like Fellini?\u201d\n\nTo reply to this question did not, in Madeleine\u2019s view, compromise her rule.\n\n\u201cYou want to know something embarrassing?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a Fellini film.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should see one,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I have your number? Oh, right, I have it. It\u2019s the same as Abby\u2019s number.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want me to write it down?\u201d Madeleine asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cI have it.\u201d\n\nAnd he rose, brontosaurus-like, to his place among the treetops.\n\nFor the rest of the week, Madeleine stayed in every night, waiting for Leonard to call. When she came back from classes in the afternoon she interrogated her roommates to find out if he had called while she was out.\n\n\u201cSome guy called yesterday,\u201d Olivia said, on Thursday. \u201cWhen I was in the shower.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, I forgot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it sound like Leonard?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice. I was dripping wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for taking a message!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorree,\u201d Olivia said.\n\n\u201cGod. It was just a two-second call. He said he\u2019d call back later.\u201d\n\nAnd so now it was Friday night\u2014Friday night!\u2014and Madeleine had declined to go out with Abby and Olivia in order to stay in and wait by the phone. She was reading A Lover\u2019s Discourse and marveling at its relevance to her life.\n\n\n\nWaiting\nattente / waiting\nTumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the loved being, subject to trivial delays (rendezvous, letters, telephone calls, returns).\n\u2026 Waiting is an enchantment: I have received orders not to move. Waiting for a telephone is thereby woven out of tiny, unavowable interdictions to infinity: I forbid myself to leave the room, to go to the toilet, even to telephone (to keep the line from being busy) \u2026\n\nShe could hear the television going in the apartment below. Madeleine\u2019s bedroom faced the State Capitol dome, brightly lit against the dark sky. The heat, which they couldn\u2019t control, was still on, the radiator wastefully knocking and hissing.\n\nThe more she thought about it, the more Madeleine understood that extreme solitude didn\u2019t just describe the way she was feeling about Leonard. It explained how she\u2019d always felt when she was in love. It explained what love was like and, just maybe, what was wrong with it.\n\nThe telephone rang.\n\nMadeleine sat up in bed. She dog-eared the page she was reading. She waited as long as she could (three rings) before answering.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaddy?\u201d\n\nIt was Alton, calling from Prettybrook.\n\n\u201cOh. Hi, Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t sound so excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m studying.\u201d\n\nIn his usual way, without niceties, he got to the matter at hand. \u201cYour mother and I were just discussing graduation plans.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, Madeleine thought Alton meant that they were discussing her future. But then she realized it was just logistics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s April,\u201d she said. \u201cGraduation\u2019s not until June.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy experience with college towns is that the hotels get booked up months in advance. So we have to decide what we\u2019re doing. Now, here are the options. Are you listening?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Madeleine said, and began, at that instant, to tune out. She stuck the spoon back into the peanut butter jar and brought it to her mouth, this time just licking it.\n\nIn the phone Alton\u2019s voice was saying,\n\n\u201cOption one: Your mother and I come up the night before the ceremony, stay in a hotel, and we see you for dinner the night of graduation. Option two: We come up the morning of the ceremony, have breakfast with you, and then leave after the ceremony. Both proposals are acceptable to us. It\u2019s your choice. But let me explain the pros and cons of each scenario.\u201d\n\nMadeleine was about to answer when Phyllida spoke up on another extension.\n\n\u201cHi, dear. I hope we didn\u2019t wake you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t wake her,\u201d Alton barked. \u201cEleven o\u2019clock\u2019s not late at college. Especially on a Friday night. Hey, what are you doing in on a Friday night? Got a pimple?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Mummy,\u201d Madeleine said, ignoring him.\n\n\u201cMaddy, sweetie, we\u2019re redoing your bedroom and I wanted to ask you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re redoing my bedroom?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it needs freshening up. I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy room?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I was thinking about recarpeting it in green. You know, a good green.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Madeleine cried.\n\n\u201cMaddy, we\u2019ve kept your room the way it is for four years now\u2014you\u2019d think it was a shrine! I\u2019d like to be able to use it as a guest room, occasionally, because of the en suite bathroom. You can still have it when you come home, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll always be your room.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about my wallpaper?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s old. It\u2019s peeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change my wallpaper!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, all right. I\u2019ll leave the wallpaper alone. But the carpet\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Alton said in a peremptory tone. \u201cThis call is about graduation. Phyl, you\u2019re hijacking my agenda. You two sort out the redecorating some other time. Now, Maddy, let me go over the pros and cons. When your cousin graduated from Williams, we all had dinner after the ceremony. And, if you\u2019ll remember, Doats complained the whole time that he was missing all the parties\u2014and he left halfway through the meal. Now, your mother and I are willing to stay the night\u2014or two nights\u2014if we\u2019re going to see you. But if you\u2019re going to be busy, maybe the breakfast option makes more sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraduation\u2019s two months away. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I told your father,\u201d Phyllida said.\n\nIt occurred to Madeleine that she was tying up the line.\n\n\u201cLet me think about it,\u201d she said abruptly. \u201cI have to go. I\u2019m studying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to stay the night,\u201d Alton repeated, \u201cI\u2019d like to make reservations soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall me later. Let me think about it. Call me Sunday.\u201d\n\nAlton was still speaking when she hung up, so when the phone rang again, twenty seconds later,\n\nMadeleine picked up and said,\n\n\u201cDaddy, stop it. We don\u2019t have to decide tonight.\u201d\n\nThere was silence on the line. And then a male voice said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to call me Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, God. Leonard? Sorry! I thought you were my father. He\u2019s freaking out about graduation plans already.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just having a little freak-out myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout calling you.\u201d\n\nThis was good. Madeleine ran a finger along her lower lip. She said, \u201cHave you calmed down or do you want to call back later?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m resting comfortably now, thank you.\u201d\n\nMadeleine waited for more. None came. \u201cAre you calling for a reason?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYes. That Fellini film? I was hoping you might, if you\u2019re not too, I know it\u2019s bad manners calling so late, but I was at the lab.\u201d\n\nLeonard did sound a little nervous. That wasn\u2019t good. Madeleine didn\u2019t like nervous guys. Nervous guys were nervous for a reason. Up until now Leonard had seemed more the tortured type than the nervous type. Tortured was better.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that was a complete sentence,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat did I leave out?\u201d Leonard asked.\n\n\u201cHow about, \u2018Would you like to come with me?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy to,\u201d Leonard said.\n\nMadeleine frowned into the receiver. She had a feeling that Leonard had set up this exchange, like a chess player thinking eight moves ahead. She was going to complain when Leonard said, \u201cSorry. Not funny.\u201d He comically cleared his throat. \u201cListen, would you like to go to the movies with me?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer right away. He deserved a little punishment. And so she put the screws to him\u2014for another three seconds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d\n\nAnd there it was already, that word. She wondered if Leonard had noticed. She wondered what it meant that she had noticed. It was just a word, after all. A way of speaking.\n\nThe next night, Saturday, the fickle weather turned cold again. Madeleine was chilled in her brown suede jacket as she walked to the restaurant where they\u2019d agreed to meet. Afterward, they made their way to the Cable Car and found a sagging couch among the other mismatched sofas and armchairs that furnished the art-house cinema.\n\nShe had a hard time following the movie. The narrative cues weren\u2019t as crisp as those of Hollywood, and the film had a dream-like quality, lush but discontinuous. The audience, being a college audience, laughed knowingly during the risqu\u00e9 European moments: when the huge-titted woman stuffed her huge tit into the young hero\u2019s mouth; or when the old man up in the tree cried out, \u201cI want a woman!\u201d Fellini\u2019s theme appeared to be the same as Roland Barthes\u2019\u2014love\u2014but here it was Italian and all about the body instead of French and all about the mind. She wondered if Leonard had known what Amarcord was going to be about. She wondered if it was his way of getting her in the mood. As it so happened, she was in the mood, but no thanks to the movie. The movie was pretty to look at but confused her and made her feel na\u00efve and suburban. It seemed both overly indulgent and overly male.\n\nAfter it was over, they made their way out onto South Main. They had no stated destination. Madeleine was pleased to realize that Leonard, though tall, wasn\u2019t too tall. If she wore heels, the top of her head came up higher than his shoulders, almost to his chin.\n\n\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell, at least now I know what Felliniesque is.\u201d\n\nThe downtown skyline was on their left, across the river, the spire of the Superman building visible against the unnaturally pink city sky. The streets were empty except for other people leaving the cinema.\n\n\u201cMy goal in life is to become an adjective,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cPeople would go around saying, \u2018That was so Bankheadian.\u2019 Or, \u2018A little too Bankheadian for my taste.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBankheadian has a ring,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than Bankheadesque.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr Bankheadish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsh is terrible all around. There\u2019s Joycean, Shakespearean, Faulknerian. But ish? Who is there who\u2019s an ish?\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas Mannish?\u201d\n\n\u201cKafkaesque,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cPynchonesque! See, Pynchon\u2019s already an adjective. Gaddis. What would Gaddis be? Gaddisesque? Gaddisy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really do it with Gaddis,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cTough luck for Gaddis. Do you like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI read a little of The Recognitions,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nThey turned up Planet Street, climbing the slope.\n\n\u201cBellovian,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cIt\u2019s extra nice when they change the spelling slightly. Nabokovian already has the v. So does Chekhovian. The Russians have it made. Tolstoyan! That guy was an adjective waiting to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget Tolstoyanism,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cMy God!\u201d Leonard said. \u201cA noun! I\u2019ve never even dreamed of being a noun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would Bankheadian mean?\u201d\n\nLeonard thought for a second. \u201c\u2018Of or related to Leonard Bankhead (American, born 1959), characterized by excessive introspection or worry. Gloomy, depressive. See basket case.\u2019\u201d\n\nMadeleine was laughing. Leonard stopped walking and took hold of her arm, looking at her seriously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking you to my place,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this time we\u2019ve been walking? I\u2019ve been leading you back to my place. This is how I do it, apparently. It\u2019s shameful. Shameful. I don\u2019t want it to be like that. Not with you. So I\u2019m telling you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI figured we were going back to your place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to call you on it. When we got closer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already close.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t come up.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Not tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cHannaesque,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cStubborn. Given to ironclad positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHannarian,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cDangerous. Not to be messed with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stand warned.\u201d\n\nThey stood looking at each other on cold, dark Planet Street. Leonard took his hands out of his pockets to tuck his long hair behind his ears.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll come up just for a minute,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpecial Days\u201d\nf\u00eate / festivity\nThe amorous subject experiences every meeting\nwith the loved being as a festival.\n1. The Festivity is what is waited for, what is expected. What I expect of the promised presence is an unheard-of totality of pleasures, a banquet; I rejoice like the child laughing at the sight of the mother whose mere presence heralds and signifies a plenitude of satisfactions: I am about to have before me, and for myself, the \u201csource of all good things.\u201d\n\u201cI am living through days as happy as those God keeps for his chosen people; and whatever becomes of me, I can never say that I have not tasted the purest joys of life.\u201d\n\nIt was debatable whether or not Madeleine had fallen in love with Leonard the first moment she\u2019d seen him. She hadn\u2019t even known him then, and so what she\u2019d felt was only sexual attraction, not love. Even after they\u2019d gone out for coffee, she couldn\u2019t say that what she was feeling was anything more than infatuation. But ever since the night when they went back to Leonard\u2019s place after watching Amarcordand started fooling around, when Madeleine found that instead of being turned off by physical stuff, the way she often was with boys, instead of putting up with that or trying to overlook it, she\u2019d spent the entire night worrying that she was turning Leonard off, worrying that her body wasn\u2019t good enough, or that her breath was bad from the Caesar salad she\u2019d unwisely ordered at dinner; worrying, too, about having suggested they order martinis because of the way Leonard had sarcastically said,\n\n\u201cSure. Martinis. We can pretend we\u2019re Salinger characters\u201d; after having had, as a consequence of all this anxiety, pretty much no sexual pleasure, despite the perfectly respectable session they\u2019d put together; and after Leonard (like every guy) had immediately fallen asleep, leaving her to lie awake stroking his head and vaguely hoping she didn\u2019t get a urinary tract infection, Madeleine asked herself if the fact that she\u2019d just spent the whole night worrying wasn\u2019t, in fact, a surefire sign that she was falling in love. And certainly after they\u2019d spent the next three days at Leonard\u2019s place having sex and eating pizza, after she\u2019d relaxed enough to be able to come at least once in a while and finally to stop worrying so much about having an orgasm because her hunger for Leonard was in some way satisfied by his satisfaction, after she\u2019d allowed herself to sit naked on his gross couch and to walk to the bathroom knowing he was staring at her (imperfect) ass, to root for food in his disgusting refrigerator, to read the brilliant half-page of philosophy paper sticking up out of his typewriter, and to hear him pee with taurine force into the toilet bowl, certainly, by the end of those three days, Madeleine knew she was in love.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t mean she had to tell anyone. Especially Leonard.\n\nLeonard Bankhead had a studio apartment on the third floor of a low-rent student building. The halls were full of bikes and junk mail. Stickers decorated the other tenants\u2019 doors: a fluorescent marijuana leaf, a silk-screen Blondie. Leonard\u2019s door, however, was as blank as the apartment inside. In the middle of the room, a twin mattress lay beside a plastic milk crate supporting a reading lamp. There was no desk, no bookcase, not even a table, only the nasty couch, with a typewriter on another milk crate in front of it. There was nothing on the walls but bits of masking tape and, in one corner, a small portrait of Leonard, done in pencil. The drawing showed Leonard as George Washington, wearing a tricorne hat and sheltering under a blanket at Valley Forge. The caption read:\n\n\u201cYou go. I like it here.\u201d\n\nMadeleine thought the handwriting looked feminine.\n\nA ficus tree endured in the corner. Leonard moved it into the sun whenever he remembered to. Madeleine, taking pity on the tree, began to water it, until she caught Leonard looking at her one day, his eyes narrowed with suspicion.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on. What?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re watering my tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe soil\u2019s dry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking care of my tree.\u201d\n\nShe stopped doing it after that.\n\nThere was a tiny kitchen where Leonard brewed and reheated the gallon of coffee he drank every day. A big greasy wok sat on the stove. The most Leonard did in the way of preparing a meal, however, was to pour Grape Nuts into the wok. With raisins. Raisins satisfied his fruit requirement.\n\nThe apartment had a message. The message said: I am an orphan. Abby and Olivia asked Madeleine what she and Leonard did together and she never had an answer. They didn\u2019t do<!--?i--> anything. She came to his apartment and they lay down on the mattress and Leonard asked her how she was doing, really wanting to know.\n\nWhat did they do? She talked; he listened; then he talked and she listened. She\u2019d never met anyone, and certainly not a guy, who was so receptive, who took everything in. She guessed that Leonard\u2019s shrink-like manner came from years of seeing shrinks himself, and though another of her rules was to never date guys who went to shrinks, Madeleine began to reconsider this prohibition. Back home, she and her sister had a phrase for serious emotional talks. They called it \u201chaving a heavy.\u201d If a boy approached during one, the girls would look up and give warning:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a heavy.\u201d And the boy would retreat. Until it was over. Until the heavy had passed.\n\nGoing out with Leonard was like having a heavy all the time. Whenever she was with him, Leonard gave her his full attention. He didn\u2019t stare into her eyes or smother her the way Billy had, but he made it clear he was available. He offered little advice. Only listened, and murmured, reassuringly.\n\nPeople often fell in love with their shrinks, didn\u2019t they? That was called transference and was to be avoided. But what if you were already sleeping with your shrink? What if your shrink\u2019s couch was already a bed?\n\nAnd plus it wasn\u2019t all heavy, the heavies. Leonard was funny. He told hilarious stories in a deadpan voice. His head sank into his shoulders, his eyes filled with rue, as his sentences drawled on. \u201cDid I ever tell you I play an instrument? The summer my parents got divorced, they sent me to live with my grandparents in Buffalo. The people next door were Latvian, the Bruverises. And they both played the kokle.\n\nDo you know what a kokle is?\n\nIt\u2019s sort of like a zither, but Latvian.\n\n\u201cAnyway, I used to hear Mr. and Mrs. Bruveris playing their kokles over in the next yard. It was an amazing sound. Sort of wild and over-stimulated on the one hand, but melancholy on the other. The kokle is the manic-depressive of the string family. Anyway, I was bored to death that summer. I was sixteen. Six foot one. One hundred and thirty-eight pounds. A major reefer smoker. I used to get high in my bedroom and blow the smoke out the window, and then I\u2019d go out to the porch and listen to the Bruverises playing next door. Sometimes other people came over. Other kokle players. They set up lawn chairs in the backyard and they\u2019d all sit there playing together. It was an orchestra! A kokle orchestra. Then one day they saw me watching and invited me over. They gave me potato salad and a grape Popsicle and I asked Mr. Bruveris how you played a kokle and he started giving me lessons. I used to go over there every day. They had an old kokle they let me borrow. I used to practice five, six hours a day. I was into it.\n\n\u201cAt the end of that summer, when I had to leave, the Bruverises gave me the kokle. To keep. I took it on the plane with me. I got a separate seat for it, like I was Rostropovich. My father had moved out of the house by then. So it was just me, my sister, and my mother. And I kept on practicing. I got good enough that I joined this band. We used to play at ethnic festivals and Orthodox weddings. We had these traditional costumes, embroidered vests, puffy sleeves, knee-high boots. Me and all the adults. Most of them were Latvian, some Russians, too. Our big number was \u2018Otchi Tchornyia.\u2019 That\u2019s the only thing that saved me in high school. The kokle.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you still play?\u201d\n\n\u201cHell no. Are you kidding? The kokle?\u201d\n\nListening to Leonard, Madeleine felt impoverished by her happy childhood. She never wondered why she acted the way she did, or what effect her parents had had on her personality. Being fortunate had dulled her powers of observation. Whereas Leonard noticed every little thing. For instance, they spent a weekend on Cape Cod (partly to visit Pilgrim Lake Laboratory, where Leonard was applying for a research fellowship), and as they were driving back, Leonard said, \u201cWhat do you do? Just hold it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just hold it. For two days. Until you get back home.\u201d\n\nAs his meaning seeped in, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have never, ever, taken a dump in my presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your presence?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I am present. Or nearby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it? Nothing. If you\u2019re talking about I-sleep-over-and-go-off-to-class-the-next-morning and then you go and take a dump, that\u2019s understandable. But when we spend two, almost three days together, eating surf and turf, and you do not take a dump the entire time, I can only conclude that you are more than a little anal.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what? It\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cO.K.? I find it embarrassing.\u201d\n\nLeonard stared at her without expression and said, \u201cDo you mind when I take a dump?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have to talk about this? It\u2019s sort of gross.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we do need to talk about it. Because you\u2019re obviously not very relaxed around me, and I am\u2014or thought I was\u2014your boyfriend, and that means\u2014or should mean\u2014that I\u2019m the person you\u2019re most relaxed around. Leonard equals maximum relaxation.\u201d\n\nGuys weren\u2019t supposed to be the talkers. Guys weren\u2019t supposed to get you to open up. But this guy was; this guy did. He\u2019d said he was her \u201cboyfriend,\u201d too. He\u2019d made it official.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to be more relaxed,\u201d Madeleine said, \u201cif it\u2019ll make you happy. But in terms of\u2014excretion\u2014don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t for me,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThis is for Mr. Lower Intestine. This is for Mr. Duodenum.\u201d\n\nEven though this kind of amateur therapy didn\u2019t exactly work (after that last conversation, for instance, Madeleine had more, not less, trouble going Number 2 if Leonard was within a mile), it affected Madeleine deeply. Leonard was examining her closely. She felt handled in the right way, like something precious or immensely fascinating. It made her happy to think about how much he thought about her.\n\nBy the end of April, Madeleine and Leonard had gotten into a routine of spending every night together. On weeknights, after Madeleine finished studying, she headed over to the biology lab, where she\u2019d find Leonard staring at slides with two Chinese grad students. After she finally got Leonard to leave the lab, Madeleine then had to cajole him into sleeping at her place. At first, Leonard had liked staying at the Narragansett. He liked the ornate moldings and the view from her bedroom. He charmed Olivia and Abby by making pancakes on Sunday mornings. But soon Leonard began to complain that they always stayed at Madeleine\u2019s place and that he never got to wake up in his own bed. Staying at Leonard\u2019s place, however, required Madeleine to bring a fresh set of clothes each night, and since he didn\u2019t like her to leave clothes at his place (and, to be honest, she didn\u2019t like to, either, because whatever she left picked up a fusty smell), Madeleine had to carry her dirty clothes around to classes all day. She preferred sleeping at her own apartment, where she could use her own shampoo, conditioner, and loofah, and where it was \u201cclean-sheet day\u201d every Wednesday. Leonard never changed his sheets. They were a disturbing gray color. Dust balls clung to the edges of the mattress. One morning, Madeleine was horrified to see a calligraphic smear of blood that had leaked from her three weeks earlier, a stain she\u2019d attacked with a kitchen sponge while Leonard was sleeping.\n\n\u201cYou never wash your sheets!\u201d she complained.\n\n\u201cI wash them,\u201d Leonard said evenly.\n\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they get dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot everyone can drop off their laundry at the cleaners every week. Not everybody grew up with \u2018clean-sheet day.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drop them off,\u201d Madeleine said, undeterred. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a washer in the basement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI use the washer,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cJust not every Wednesday. I don\u2019t equate dirt with death and decay.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, and I do? I\u2019m obsessed with death because I wash my sheets?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s attitudes to cleanliness have a lot to do with their fear of death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about death, Leonard. This is about crumbs in the bed. This is about the fact that your pillow smells like a liverwurst sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does!\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmell it, Leonard!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s salami. I don\u2019t like liverwurst.\u201d\n\nTo a certain extent, this kind of arguing was fun. But then came nights when Madeleine forgot to pack a change of clothes and Leonard accused her of doing this on purpose in order to force him to sleep at her place. Next, more worryingly, came nights when Leonard said he was going home to study and would see her tomorrow. He began pulling all-nighters. One of his philosophy professors offered Leonard the use of his cabin in the Berkshires and, for an entire rainy weekend, Leonard went there, alone, to write a paper on Fichte, returning with a typescript 123 pages long and wearing a bright orange hunter\u2019s vest. The vest became his favorite item of clothing. He wore it all the time.\n\nHe started finishing Madeleine\u2019s sentences. As if her mind was too slow. As if he couldn\u2019t wait for her to gather her thoughts. He riffed on the things she said, going off on strange tangents, making puns. Whenever she told him he needed to get some sleep, he got angry and didn\u2019t call her for days. And it was during this period that Madeleine fully understood how the lover\u2019s discourse was of an extreme solitude. The solitude was extreme because it wasn\u2019t physical. It was extreme because you felt it while in the company of the person you loved. It was extreme because it was in your head, that most solitary of places.\n\nThe more Leonard pulled away, the more anxious Madeleine became. The more desperate she became, the more Leonard pulled away. She told herself to act cool. She went to the library to work on her marriage-plot thesis, but the sex-fantasy atmosphere\u2014the reading-room eye contact, the beckoning stacks\u2014made her desperate to see Leonard. And so against her will her feet began leading her back across campus through the darkness to the biology department. Up to the last moment, Madeleine had the crazy hope that this expression of weakness might in fact be strength. It was a brilliant strategy because it lacked all strategy. It involved no games, only sincerity. Seeing such sincerity, how could Leonard fail to respond? She was almost happy as she came up behind the lab table and tapped Leonard on the shoulder, and her happiness lasted until he turned around with a look not of love but of annoyance.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that it was spring. Every day, people seemed more and more unclothed. The magnolia trees, budding on the green, looked positively enflamed. They sent out a perfume that drifted through the windows of Semiotics 211. The magnolia trees hadn\u2019t read Roland Barthes. They didn\u2019t think love was a mental state; the magnolias insisted it was natural, perennial.\n\nOn a beautiful warm May day, Madeleine showered, shaved her legs with extra care, and put on her first spring dress: an apple-green baby-doll dress with a bib collar and a high hem. With this, she wore Buster Browns, cream and rust, and went sockless. Her bare legs, toned from a winter of squash-playing, were pale but smooth. She kept her glasses on, left her hair loose, and walked over to Leonard\u2019s apartment on Planet Street. On the way, she stopped at a market to buy a hunk of cheese, some Stoned Wheat Thins, and a bottle of Valpolicella. Coming down the hill from Benefit toward South Main, she felt the warm breeze between her thighs. The front door of Leonard\u2019s building was propped open with a brick, so she went up to his apartment and knocked. Leonard opened the door. He looked like he\u2019d been napping.\n\n\u201cNiiiiice dress,\u201d he said.\n\nThey never made it to the park. They picnicked on each other. As Leonard pulled her toward the mattress, Madeleine dropped her packages, hoping the wine bottle didn\u2019t break. She slipped her dress over her head. Soon they were naked, raiding, it felt like, a huge basket of goodies. Madeleine lay on her stomach, her side, her back, nibbling all the treats, the nice-smelling fruit candies, the meaty drumsticks, as well as more sophisticated offerings, the biscotti flavored with anise, the wrinkly truffles, the salty spoonfuls of olive tapenade. She\u2019d never been so busy in her life. At the same time, she felt strangely displaced, not quite her usual tidy ego but merged with Leonard into a great big protoplasmic, ecstatic thing. She thought she\u2019d been in love before. She knew she\u2019d had sex before. But all those torrid adolescent gropings, all those awkward backseat romps, the meaningful, performative summer nights with her high school boyfriend Jim McManus, even the tender sessions with Billy where he insisted they look into each other\u2019s eyes as they came\u2014none of that prepared her for the wallop, the all-consuming pleasure, of this.\n\nLeonard was kissing her. When she could bear no more, Madeleine grabbed him savagely by his ears. She pulled Leonard\u2019s head away and held it still to show him the evidence of how she felt (she was crying now). In a hoarse voice edged with something else, a sense of peril, Madeleine said, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nLeonard stared back at her. His eyebrows twitched. Suddenly, he rolled sideways off the mattress. He stood up and walked, naked, across the room. Crouching, he reached into her bag and pulled out A Lover\u2019s Discourse, from the pocket where she always kept it. He flipped the pages until he found the one he wanted. Then he returned to the bed and handed the book to her.\n\nI Love You\nje-t\u2019aime / I-love-you\n\nAs she read these words, Madeleine was flooded with happiness. She glanced up at Leonard, smiling. With his finger he motioned for her to keep going. The figure refers not to the declaration of love, to the avowal, but to the repeated utterance of the love cry.<!--?i--> Suddenly Madeleine\u2019s happiness diminished, usurped by the feeling of peril. She wished she weren\u2019t naked. She narrowed her shoulders and covered herself with the bedsheet as she obediently read on.\n\nOnce the first avowal has been made, \u201cI love you\" has no meaning whatever \u2026\n\nLeonard, squatting, had a smirk on his face.\n\nIt was then that Madeleine threw the book at his head.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1158107", "artist_names": "The

When Columbus and his sailors came ashore, carrying swords, speaking oddly, the Arawaks ran to greet them, brought them food, water, gifts. He later wrote of this in his log:\n\"They ... brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things, which they exchanged for the glass beads and hawks' bells. They willingly traded everything they owned... . They were well-built, with good bodies and handsome features.... They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron. Their spears are made of cane... They would make fine servants.... With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.\"\n\nThese Arawaks of the Bahama Islands were much like Indians on the mainland, who were remarkable (European observers were to say again and again) for their hospitality, their belief in sharing. These traits did not stand out in the Europe of the Renaissance, dominated as it was by the religion of popes, the government of kings, the frenzy for money that marked Western civilization and its first messenger to the Americas, Christopher Columbus.\n\nColumbus wrote:\n\n\"As soon as I arrived in the Indies, on the first Island which I found, I took some of the natives by force in order that they might learn and might give me information of whatever there is in these parts.\"\nThe information that Columbus wanted most was: Where is the gold? He had persuaded the king and queen of Spain to finance an expedition to the lands, the wealth, he expected would be on the other side of the Atlantic-the Indies and Asia, gold and spices. For, like other informed people of his time, he knew the world was round and he could sail west in order to get to the Far East.\nSpain was recently unified, one of the new modern nation-states, like France, England, and Portugal. Its population, mostly poor peasants, worked for the nobility, who were 2 percent of the population and owned 95 percent of the land. Spain had tied itself to the Catholic Church, expelled all the Jews, driven out the Moors. Like other states of the modern world, Spain sought gold, which was becoming the new mark of wealth, more useful than land because it could buy anything.\n\nThere was gold in Asia, it was thought, and certainly silks and spices, for Marco Polo and others had brought back marvelous things from their overland expeditions centuries before. Now that the Turks had conquered Constantinople and the eastern Mediterranean, and controlled the land routes to Asia, a sea route was needed. Portuguese sailors were working their way around the southern tip of Africa. Spain decided to gamble on a long sail across an unknown ocean.\n\nIn return for bringing back gold and spices, they promised Columbus 10 percent of the profits, governorship over new-found lands, and the fame that would go with a new title: Admiral of the Ocean Sea. He was a merchant's clerk from the Italian city of Genoa, part-time weaver (the son of a skilled weaver), and expert sailor. He set out with three sailing ships, the largest of which was the Santa Maria, perhaps 100 feet long, and thirty-nine crew members.\n\nColumbus would never have made it to Asia, which was thousands of miles farther away than he had calculated, imagining a smaller world. He would have been doomed by that great expanse of sea. But he was lucky. One-fourth of the way there he came upon an unknown, uncharted land that lay between Europe and Asia-the Americas. It was early October 1492, and thirty-three days since he and his crew had left the Canary Islands, off the Atlantic coast of Africa. Now they saw branches and sticks floating in the water. They saw flocks of birds.\n\nThese were signs of land. Then, on October 12, a sailor called Rodrigo saw the early morning moon shining on white sands, and cried out. It was an island in the Bahamas, the Caribbean sea. The first man to sight land was supposed to get a yearly pension of 10,000 maravedis for life, but Rodrigo never got it. Columbus claimed he had seen a light the evening before. He got the reward.\n\nSo, approaching land, they were met by the Arawak Indians, who swam out to greet them. The Arawaks lived in village communes, had a developed agriculture of corn, yams, cassava. They could spin and weave, but they had no horses or work animals. They had no iron, but they wore tiny gold ornaments in their ears.\n\nThis was to have enormous consequences: it led Columbus to take some of them aboard ship as prisoners because he insisted that they guide him to the source of the gold. He then sailed to what is now Cuba, then to Hispaniola (the island which today consists of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). There, bits of visible gold in the rivers, and a gold mask presented to Columbus by a local Indian chief, led to wild visions of gold fields.\n\nOn Hispaniola, out of timbers from the Santa Maria, which had run aground, Columbus built a fort, the first European military base in the Western Hemisphere. He called it Navidad (Christmas) and left thirty-nine crewmembers there, with instructions to find and store the gold. He took more Indian prisoners and put them aboard his two remaining ships. At one part of the island he got into a fight with Indians who refused to trade as many bows and arrows as he and his men wanted. Two were run through with swords and bled to death. Then the Nina and the Pinta set sail for the Azores and Spain. When the weather turned cold, the Indian prisoners began to die.\n\nColumbus's report to the Court in Madrid was extravagant. He insisted he had reached Asia (it was Cuba) and an island off the coast of China (Hispaniola). His descriptions were part fact, part fiction:\n\nHispaniola is a miracle. Mountains and hills, plains and pastures, are both fertile and beautiful ... the harbors are unbelievably good and there are many wide rivers of which the majority contain gold. . . . There are many spices, and great mines of gold and other metals....\n\nThe Indians, Columbus reported, \"are so naive and so free with their possessions that no one who has not witnessed them would believe it. When you ask for something they have, they never say no. To the contrary, they offer to share with anyone....\" He concluded his report by asking for a little help from their Majesties, and in return he would bring them from his next voyage \"as much gold as they need ... and as many slaves as they ask.\" He was full of religious talk: \"Thus the eternal God, our Lord, gives victory to those who follow His way over apparent impossibilities.\"\n\nBecause of Columbus's exaggerated report and promises, his second expedition was given seventeen ships and more than twelve hundred men. The aim was clear: slaves and gold. They went from island to island in the Caribbean, taking Indians as captives. But as word spread of the Europeans' intent they found more and more empty villages. On Haiti, they found that the sailors left behind at Fort Navidad had been killed in a battle with the Indians, after they had roamed the island in gangs looking for gold, taking women and children as slaves for sex and labor.\n\nNow, from his base on Haiti, Columbus sent expedition after expedition into the interior. They found no gold fields, but had to fill up the ships returning to Spain with some kind of dividend. In the year 1495, they went on a great slave raid, rounded up fifteen hundred Arawak men, women, and children, put them in pens guarded by Spaniards and dogs, then picked the five hundred best specimens to load onto ships. Of those five hundred, two hundred died en route. The rest arrived alive in Spain and were put up for sale by the archdeacon of the town, who reported that, although the slaves were \"naked as the day they were born,\" they showed \"no more embarrassment than animals.\" Columbus later wrote: \"Let us in the name of the Holy Trinity go on sending all the slaves that can be sold.\"\nBut too many of the slaves died in captivity. And so Columbus, desperate to pay back dividends to those who had invested, had to make good his promise to fill the ships with gold. In the province of Cicao on Haiti, where he and his men imagined huge gold fields to exist, they ordered all persons fourteen years or older to collect a certain quantity of gold every three months. When they brought it, they were given copper tokens to hang around their necks. Indians found without a copper token had their hands cut off and bled to death.\n\nThe Indians had been given an impossible task. The only gold around was bits of dust garnered from the streams. So they fled, were hunted down with dogs, and were killed.\n\nTrying to put together an army of resistance, the Arawaks faced Spaniards who had armor, muskets, swords, horses. When the Spaniards took prisoners they hanged them or burned them to death. Among the Arawaks, mass suicides began, with cassava poison. Infants were killed to save them from the Spaniards. In two years, through murder, mutilation, or suicide, half of the 250,000 Indians on Haiti were dead.\n\nWhen it became clear that there was no gold left, the Indians were taken as slave labor on huge estates, known later as encomiendas. They were worked at a ferocious pace, and died by the thousands. By the year 1515, there were perhaps fifty thousand Indians left. By 1550, there were five hundred. A report of the year 1650 shows none of the original Arawaks or their descendants left on the island.\n\nThe chief source-and, on many matters the only source-of information about what happened on the islands after Columbus came is Bartolome de las Casas, who, as a young priest, participated in the conquest of Cuba. For a time he owned a plantation on which Indian slaves worked, but he gave that up and became a vehement critic of Spanish cruelty. Las Casas transcribed Columbus's journal and, in his fifties, began a multivolume History of the Indies. In it, he describes the Indians. They are agile, he says, and can swim long distances, especially the women. They are not completely peaceful, because they do battle from time to time with other tribes, but their casualties seem small, and they fight when they are individually moved to do so because of some grievance, not on the orders of captains or kings.\n\nWomen in Indian society were treated so well as to startle the Spaniards. Las Casas describes sex relations:\n\nMarriage laws are non-existent men and women alike choose their mates and leave them as they please, without offense, jealousy or anger. They multiply in great abundance; pregnant women work to the last minute and give birth almost painlessly; up the next day, they bathe in the river and are as clean and healthy as before giving birth. If they tire of their men, they give themselves abortions with herbs that force stillbirths, covering their shameful parts with leaves or cotton cloth; although on the whole, Indian men and women look upon total nakedness with as much casualness as we look upon a man's head or at his hands.\n\nThe Indians, Las Casas says, have no religion, at least no temples. They live in\n\nlarge communal bell-shaped buildings, housing up to 600 people at one time ... made of very strong wood and roofed with palm leaves.... They prize bird feathers of various colors, beads made of fishbones, and green and white stones with which they adorn their ears and lips, but they put no value on gold and other precious things. They lack all manner of commerce, neither buying nor selling, and rely exclusively on their natural environment for maintenance. They are extremely generous with their possessions and by the same token covet the possessions of their friends and expect the same degree of liberality. ...\n\nIn Book Two of his History of the Indies, Las Casas (who at first urged replacing Indians by black slaves, thinking they were stronger and would survive, but later relented when he saw the effects on blacks) tells about the treatment of the Indians by the Spaniards. It is a unique account and deserves to be quoted at length:\n\nEndless testimonies . .. prove the mild and pacific temperament of the natives.... But our work was to exasperate, ravage, kill, mangle and destroy; small wonder, then, if they tried to kill one of us now and then.... The admiral, it is true, was blind as those who came after him, and he was so anxious to please the King that he committed irreparable crimes against the Indians....\n\nLas Casas tells how the Spaniards \"grew more conceited every day\" and after a while refused to walk any distance. They \"rode the backs of Indians if they were in a hurry\" or were carried on hammocks by Indians running in relays. \"In this case they also had Indians carry large leaves to shade them from the sun and others to fan them with goose wings.\"\n\nTotal control led to total cruelty. The Spaniards \"thought nothing of knifing Indians by tens and twenties and of cutting slices off them to test the sharpness of their blades.\" Las Casas tells how \"two of these so-called Christians met two Indian boys one day, each carrying a parrot; they took the parrots and for fun beheaded the boys.\"\nThe Indians' attempts to defend themselves failed. And when they ran off into the hills they were found and killed. So, Las Casas reports, \"they suffered and died in the mines and other labors in desperate silence, knowing not a soul in the world to whom they could turn for help.\" He describes their work in the mines:\n\n... mountains are stripped from top to bottom and bottom to top a thousand times; they dig, split rocks, move stones, and carry dirt on their backs to wash it in the rivers, while those who wash gold stay in the water all the time with their backs bent so constantly it breaks them; and when water invades the mines, the most arduous task of all is to dry the mines by scooping up pansful of water and throwing it up outside....\n\nAfter each six or eight months' work in the mines, which was the time required of each crew to dig enough gold for melting, up to a third of the men died.\n\nWhile the men were sent many miles away to the mines, the wives remained to work the soil, forced into the excruciating job of digging and making thousands of hills for cassava plants.\n\nThus husbands and wives were together only once every eight or ten months and when they met they were so exhausted and depressed on both sides ... they ceased to procreate. As for the newly born, they died early because their mothers, overworked and famished, had no milk to nurse them, and for this reason, while I was in Cuba, 7000 children died in three months. Some mothers even drowned their babies from sheer desperation.... in this way, husbands died in the mines, wives died at work, and children died from lack of milk . .. and in a short time this land which was so great, so powerful and fertile ... was depopulated. ... My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature, and now I tremble as I write. ...\n\nWhen he arrived on Hispaniola in 1508, Las Casas says, \"there were 60,000 people living on this island, including the Indians; so that from 1494 to 1508, over three million people had perished from war, slavery, and the mines. Who in future generations will believe this? I myself writing it as a knowledgeable eyewitness can hardly believe it....\"\n\nThus began the history, five hundred years ago, of the European invasion of the Indian settlements in the Americas. That beginning, when you read Las Casas-even if his figures are exaggerations (were there 3 million Indians to begin with, as he says, or less than a million, as some historians have calculated, or 8 million as others now believe?)-is conquest, slavery, death. When we read the history books given to children in the United States, it all starts with heroic adventure-there is no bloodshed-and Columbus Day is a celebration.\n\nPast the elementary and high schools, there are only occasional hints of something else. Samuel Eliot Morison, the Harvard historian, was the most distinguished writer on Columbus, the author of a multivolume biography, and was himself a sailor who retraced Columbus's route across the Atlantic. In his popular book Christopher Columbus, Mariner, written in 1954, he tells about the enslavement and the killing: \"The cruel policy initiated by Columbus and pursued by his successors resulted in complete genocide.\"\n\nThat is on one page, buried halfway into the telling of a grand romance. In the book's last paragraph, Morison sums up his view of Columbus:\n\nHe had his faults and his defects, but they were largely the defects of the qualities that made him great-his indomitable will, his superb faith in God and in his own mission as the Christ-bearer to lands beyond the seas, his stubborn persistence despite neglect, poverty and discouragement. But there was no flaw, no dark side to the most outstanding and essential of all his qualities-his seamanship.\n\nOne can lie outright about the past. Or one can omit facts which might lead to unacceptable conclusions. Morison does neither. He refuses to lie about Columbus. He does not omit the story of mass murder; indeed he describes it with the harshest word one can use: genocide.\n\nBut he does something else-he mentions the truth quickly and goes on to other things more important to him. Outright lying or quiet omission takes the risk of discovery which, when made, might arouse the reader to rebel against the writer. To state the facts, however, and then to bury them in a mass of other information is to say to the reader with a certain infectious calm: yes, mass murder took place, but it's not that important-it should weigh very little in our final judgments; it should affect very little what we do in the world.\n\nIt is not that the historian can avoid emphasis of some facts and not of others. This is as natural to him as to the mapmaker, who, in order to produce a usable drawing for practical purposes, must first flatten and distort the shape of the earth, then choose out of the bewildering mass of geographic information those things needed for the purpose of this or that particular map.\n\nMy argument cannot be against selection, simplification, emphasis, which are inevitable for both cartographers and historians. But the map-maker's distortion is a technical necessity for a common purpose shared by all people who need maps. The historian's distortion is more than technical, it is ideological; it is released into a world of contending interests, where any chosen emphasis supports (whether the historian means to or not) some kind of interest, whether economic or political or racial or national or sexual.\n\nFurthermore, this ideological interest is not openly expressed in the way a mapmaker's technical interest is obvious (\"This is a Mercator projection for long-range navigation-for short-range, you'd better use a different projection\"). No, it is presented as if all readers of history had a common interest which historians serve to the best of their ability. This is not intentional deception; the historian has been trained in a society in which education and knowledge are put forward as technical problems of excellence and not as tools for contending social classes, races, nations.\n\nTo emphasize the heroism of Columbus and his successors as navigators and discoverers, and to de-emphasize their genocide, is not a technical necessity but an ideological choice. It serves- unwittingly-to justify what was done. My point is not that we must, in telling history, accuse, judge, condemn Columbus in absentia. It is too late for that; it would be a useless scholarly exercise in morality. But the easy acceptance of atrocities as a deplorable but necessary price to pay for progress (Hiroshima and Vietnam, to save Western civilization; Kronstadt and Hungary, to save socialism; nuclear proliferation, to save us all)-that is still with us. One reason these atrocities are still with us is that we have learned to bury them in a mass of other facts, as radioactive wastes are buried in containers in the earth. We have learned to give them exactly the same proportion of attention that teachers and writers often give them in the most respectable of classrooms and textbooks. This learned sense of moral proportion, coming from the apparent objectivity of the scholar, is accepted more easily than when it comes from politicians at press conferences. It is therefore more deadly.\n\nThe treatment of heroes (Columbus) and their victims (the Arawaks)-the quiet acceptance of conquest and murder in the name of progress-is only one aspect of a certain approach to history, in which the past is told from the point of view of governments, conquerors, diplomats, leaders. It is as if they, like Columbus, deserve universal acceptance, as if they-the Founding Fathers, Jackson, Lincoln, Wilson, Roosevelt, Kennedy, the leading members of Congress, the famous Justices of the Supreme Court-represent the nation as a whole. The pretense is that there really is such a thing as \"the United States,\" subject to occasional conflicts and quarrels, but fundamentally a community of people with common interests. It is as if there really is a \"national interest\" represented in the Constitution, in territorial expansion, in the laws passed by Congress, the decisions of the courts, the development of capitalism, the culture of education and the mass media.\n\n\"History is the memory of states,\" wrote Henry Kissinger in his first book, A World Restored, in which he proceeded to tell the history of nineteenth-century Europe from the viewpoint of the leaders of Austria and England, ignoring the millions who suffered from those statesmen's policies. From his standpoint, the \"peace\" that Europe had before the French Revolution was \"restored\" by the diplomacy of a few national leaders. But for factory workers in England, farmers in France, colored people in Asia and Africa, women and children everywhere except in the upper classes, it was a world of conquest, violence, hunger, exploitation-a world not restored but disintegrated.\n\nMy viewpoint, in telling the history of the United States, is different: that we must not accept the memory of states as our own. Nations are not communities and never have been, The history of any country, presented as the history of a family, conceals fierce conflicts of interest (sometimes exploding, most often repressed) between conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalists and workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex. And in such a world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, as Albert Camus suggested, not to be on the side of the executioners.\n\nThus, in that inevitable taking of sides which comes from selection and emphasis in history, I prefer to try to tell the story of the discovery of America from the viewpoint of the Arawaks, of the Constitution from the standpoint of the slaves, of Andrew Jackson as seen by the Cherokees, of the Civil War as seen by the New York Irish, of the Mexican war as seen by the deserting soldiers of Scott's army, of the rise of industrialism as seen by the young women in the Lowell textile mills, of the Spanish-American war as seen by the Cubans, the conquest of the Philippines as seen by black soldiers on Luzon, the Gilded Age as seen by southern farmers, the First World War as seen by socialists, the Second World War as seen by pacifists, the New Deal as seen by blacks in Harlem, the postwar American empire as seen by peons in Latin America. And so on, to the limited extent that any one person, however he or she strains, can \"see\" history from the standpoint of others.\n\nMy point is not to grieve for the victims and denounce the executioners. Those tears, that anger, cast into the past, deplete our moral energy for the present. And the lines are not always clear. In the long run, the oppressor is also a victim. In the short run (and so far, human history has consisted only of short runs), the victims, themselves desperate and tainted with the culture that oppresses them, turn on other victims.\n\nStill, understanding the complexities, this book will be skeptical of governments and their attempts, through politics and culture, to ensnare ordinary people in a giant web of nationhood pretending to a common interest. I will try not to overlook the cruelties that victims inflict on one another as they are jammed together in the boxcars of the system. I don't want to romanticize them. But I do remember (in rough paraphrase) a statement I once read: \"The cry of the poor is not always just, but if you don't listen to it, you will never know what justice is.\"\n\nI don't want to invent victories for people's movements. But to think that history-writing must aim simply to recapitulate the failures that dominate the past is to make historians collaborators in an endless cycle of defeat. If history is to be creative, to anticipate a possible future without denying the past, it should, I believe, emphasize new possibilities by disclosing those hidden episodes of the past when, even if in brief flashes, people showed their ability to resist, to join together, occasionally to win. I am supposing, or perhaps only hoping, that our future may be found in the past's fugitive moments of compassion rather than in its solid centuries of warfare.\n\nThat, being as blunt as I can, is my approach to the history of the United States. The reader may as well know that before going on.\n\nWhat Columbus did to the Arawaks of the Bahamas, Cortes did to the Aztecs of Mexico, Pizarro to the Incas of Peru, and the English settlers of Virginia and Massachusetts to the Powhatans and the Pequots.\n\nThe Aztec civilization of Mexico came out of the heritage of Mayan, Zapotec, and Toltec cultures. It built enormous constructions from stone tools and human labor, developed a writing system and a priesthood. It also engaged in (let us not overlook this) the ritual killing of thousands of people as sacrifices to the gods. The cruelty of the Aztecs, however, did not erase a certain innocence, and when a Spanish armada appeared at Vera Cruz, and a bearded white man came ashore, with strange beasts (horses), clad in iron, it was thought that he was the legendary Aztec man-god who had died three hundred years before, with the promise to return-the mysterious Quetzalcoatl. And so they welcomed him, with munificent hospitality.\n\nThat was Hernando Cortes, come from Spain with an expedition financed by merchants and landowners and blessed by the deputies of God, with one obsessive goal: to find gold. In the mind of Montezuma, the king of the Aztecs, there must have been a certain doubt about whether Cortes was indeed Quetzalcoatl, because he sent a hundred runners to Cortes, bearing enormous treasures, gold and silver wrought into objects of fantastic beauty, but at the same time begging him to go back. (The painter Durer a few years later described what he saw just arrived in Spain from that expedition-a sun of gold, a moon of silver, worth a fortune.)\n\nCortes then began his march of death from town to town, using deception, turning Aztec against Aztec, killing with the kind of deliberateness that accompanies a strategy-to paralyze the will of the population by a sudden frightful deed. And so, in Cholulu, he invited the headmen of the Cholula nation to the square. And when they came, with thousands of unarmed retainers, Cortes's small army of Spaniards, posted around the square with cannon, armed with crossbows, mounted on horses, massacred them, down to the last man. Then they looted the city and moved on. When their cavalcade of murder was over they were in Mexico City, Montezuma was dead, and the Aztec civilization, shattered, was in the hands of the Spaniards.\n\nAll this is told in the Spaniards' own accounts.\n\nIn Peru, that other Spanish conquistador Pizarro, used the same tactics, and for the same reasons- the frenzy in the early capitalist states of Europe for gold, for slaves, for products of the soil, to pay the bondholders and stockholders of the expeditions, to finance the monarchical bureaucracies rising in Western Europe, to spur the growth of the new money economy rising out of feudalism, to participate in what Karl Marx would later call \"the primitive accumulation of capital.\" These were the violent beginnings of an intricate system of technology, business, politics, and culture that would dominate the world for the next five centuries.\n\nIn the North American English colonies, the pattern was set early, as Columbus had set it in the islands of the Bahamas. In 1585, before there was any permanent English settlement in Virginia, Richard Grenville landed there with seven ships. The Indians he met were hospitable, but when one of them stole a small silver cup, Grenville sacked and burned the whole Indian village.\n\nJamestown itself was set up inside the territory of an Indian confederacy, led by the chief, Powhatan. Powhatan watched the English settle on his people's land, but did not attack, maintaining a posture of coolness. When the English were going through their \"starving time\" in the winter of 1610, some of them ran off to join the Indians, where they would at least be fed. When the summer came, the governor of the colony sent a messenger to ask Powhatan to return the runaways, whereupon Powhatan, according to the English account, replied with \"noe other than prowde and disdaynefull Answers.\" Some soldiers were therefore sent out \"to take Revenge.\" They fell upon an Indian settlement, killed fifteen or sixteen Indians, burned the houses, cut down the corn growing around the village, took the queen of the tribe and her children into boats, then ended up throwing the children overboard \"and shoteinge owit their Braynes in the water.\" The queen was later taken off and stabbed to death.\n\nTwelve years later, the Indians, alarmed as the English settlements kept growing in numbers, apparently decided to try to wipe them out for good. They went on a rampage and massacred 347 men, women, and children. From then on it was total war.\n\nNot able to enslave the Indians, and not able to live with them, the English decided to exterminate them. Edmund Morgan writes, in his history of early Virginia, American Slavery, American Freedom:\n\nSince the Indians were better woodsmen than the English and virtually impossible to track down, the method was to feign peaceful intentions, let them settle down and plant their com wherever they chose, and then, just before harvest, fall upon them, killing as many as possible and burning the corn... . Within two or three years of the massacre the English had avenged the deaths of that day many times over.\n\nIn that first year of the white man in Virginia, 1607, Powhatan had addressed a plea to John Smith that turned out prophetic. How authentic it is may be in doubt, but it is so much like so many Indian statements that it may be taken as, if not the rough letter of that first plea, the exact spirit of it:\n\nI have seen two generations of my people die.... I know the difference between peace and war better than any man in my country. I am now grown old, and must die soon; my authority must descend to my brothers, Opitehapan, Opechancanough and Catatough-then to my two sisters, and then to my two daughters-I wish them to know as much as I do, and that your love to them may be like mine to you. Why will you take by force what you may have quietly by love? Why will you destroy us who supply you with food? What can you get by war? We can hide our provisions and run into the woods; then you will starve for wronging your friends. Why are you jealous of us? We are unarmed, and willing to give you what you ask, if you come in a friendly manner, and not so simple as not to know that it is much better to eat good meat, sleep comfortably, live quietly with my wives and children, laugh and be merry with the English, and trade for their copper and hatchets, than to run away from them, and to lie cold in the woods, feed on acorns, roots and such trash, and be so hunted that I can neither eat nor sleep. In these wars, my men must sit up watching, and if a twig break, they all cry out \"Here comes Captain Smith!\" So I must end my miserable life. Take away your guns and swords, the cause of all our jealousy, or you may all die in the same manner.\n\nWhen the Pilgrims came to New England they too were coming not to vacant land but to territory inhabited by tribes of Indians. The governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, John Winthrop, created the excuse to take Indian land by declaring the area legally a \"vacuum.\" The Indians, he said, had not \"subdued\" the land, and therefore had only a \"natural\" right to it, but not a \"civil right.\" A \"natural right\" did not have legal standing.\n\nThe Puritans also appealed to the Bible, Psalms 2:8: \"Ask of me, and I shall give thee, the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\" And to justify their use of force to take the land, they cited Romans 13:2: \"Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.\"\n\nThe Puritans lived in uneasy truce with the Pequot Indians, who occupied what is now southern Connecticut and Rhode Island. But they wanted them out of the way; they wanted their land. And they seemed to want also to establish their rule firmly over Connecticut settlers in that area. The murder of a white trader, Indian-kidnaper, and troublemaker became an excuse to make war on the Pequots in 1636.\n\nA punitive expedition left Boston to attack the Narraganset Indians on Block Island, who were lumped with the Pequots. As Governor Winthrop wrote:\n\nThey had commission to put to death the men of Block Island, but to spare the women and children, and to bring them away, and to take possession of the island; and from thence to go to the Pequods to demand the murderers of Captain Stone and other English, and one thousand fathom of wampum for damages, etc. and some of their children as hostages, which if they should refuse, they were to obtain it by force.\n\nThe English landed and killed some Indians, but the rest hid in the thick forests of the island and the English went from one deserted village to the next, destroying crops. Then they sailed back to the mainland and raided Pequot villages along the coast, destroying crops again. One of the officers of that expedition, in his account, gives some insight into the Pequots they encountered: \"The Indians spying of us came running in multitudes along the water side, crying, What cheer, Englishmen, what cheer, what do you come for? They not thinking we intended war, went on cheerfully... -\"\n\nSo, the war with the Pequots began. Massacres took place on both sides. The English developed a tactic of warfare used earlier by Cortes and later, in the twentieth century, even more systematically: deliberate attacks on noncombatants for the purpose of terrorizing the enemy. This is ethno historian Francis Jennings's interpretation of Captain John Mason's attack on a Pequot village on the Mystic River near Long Island Sound: \"Mason proposed to avoid attacking Pequot warriors, which would have overtaxed his unseasoned, unreliable troops. Battle, as such, was not his purpose. Battle is only one of the ways to destroy an enemy's will to fight. Massacre can accomplish the same end with less risk, and Mason had determined that massacre would be his objective.\"\n\nSo the English set fire to the wigwams of the village. By their own account: \"The Captain also said, We must Burn Them; and immediately stepping into the Wigwam ... brought out a Fire Brand, and putting it into the Matts with which they were covered, set the Wigwams on Fire.\" William Bradford, in his History of the Plymouth Plantation written at the time, describes John Mason's raid on the Pequot village:\n\nThose that scaped the fire were slaine with the sword; some hewed to peeces, others rune throw with their rapiers, so as they were quickly dispatchte, and very few escaped. It was conceived they thus destroyed about 400 at this time. It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the fyer, and the streams of blood quenching the same, and horrible was the stincke and sente there of, but the victory seemed a sweete sacrifice, and they gave the prayers thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to inclose their enemise in their hands, and give them so speedy a victory over so proud and insulting an enimie.\n\nAs Dr. Cotton Mather, Puritan theologian, put it: \"It was supposed that no less than 600 Pequot souls were brought down to hell that day.\"\n\nThe war continued. Indian tribes were used against one another, and never seemed able to join together in fighting the English. Jennings sums up:\n\nThe terror was very real among the Indians, but in time they came to meditate upon its foundations. They drew three lessons from the Pequot War: (1) that the Englishmen's most solemn pledge would be broken whenever obligation conflicted with advantage; (2) that the English way of war had no limit of scruple or mercy; and (3) that weapons of Indian making were almost useless against weapons of European manufacture. These lessons the Indians took to heart.\n\nA footnote in Virgil Vogel's book This Land Was Ours (1972) says: \"The official figure on the number of Pequots now in Connecticut is twenty-one persons.\"\n\nForty years after the Pequot War, Puritans and Indians fought again. This time it was the Wampanoags, occupying the south shore of Massachusetts Bay, who were in the way and also beginning to trade some of their land to people outside the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Their chief, Massasoit, was dead. His son Wamsutta had been killed by Englishmen, and Wamsuttas brother Metacom (later to be called King Philip by the English) became chief. The English found their excuse, a murder which they attributed to Metacom, and they began a war of conquest against the Wampanoags, a war to take their land. They were clearly the aggressors, but claimed they attacked for preventive purposes. As Roger Williams, more friendly to the Indians than most, put it: \"All men of conscience or prudence ply to windward, to maintain their wars to be defensive.\"\n\nJennings says the elite of the Puritans wanted the war; the ordinary white Englishman did not want it and often refused to fight. The Indians certainly did not want war, but they matched atrocity with atrocity. When it was over, in 1676, the English had won, but their resources were drained; they had lost six hundred men. Three thousand Indians were dead, including Metacom himself. Yet the Indian raids did not stop.\n\nFor a while, the English tried softer tactics. But ultimately, it was back to annihilation. The Indian population of 10 million that lived north of Mexico when Columbus came would ultimately be reduced to less than a million. Huge numbers of Indians would die from diseases introduced by the whites. A Dutch traveler in New Netherland wrote in 1656 that \"the Indians ... affirm, that before the arrival of the Christians, and before the smallpox broke out amongst them, they were ten times as numerous as they now are, and that their population had been melted down by this disease, whereof nine-tenths of them have died.\" When the English first settled Martha's Vineyard in 1642, the Wampanoags there numbered perhaps three thousand. There were no wars on that island, but by 1764, only 313 Indians were left there. Similarly, Block Island Indians numbered perhaps 1,200 to 1,500 in 1662, and by 1774 were reduced to fifty-one.\n\nBehind the English invasion of North America, behind their massacre of Indians, their deception, their brutality, was that special powerful drive born in civilizations based on private property. It was a morally ambiguous drive; the need for space, for land, was a real human need. But in conditions of scarcity, in a barbarous epoch of history ruled by competition, this human need was transformed into the murder of whole peoples. Roger Williams said it was\n\na depraved appetite after the great vanities, dreams and shadows of this vanishing life, great portions of land, land in this wilderness, as if men were in as great necessity and danger for want of great portions of land, as poor, hungry, thirsty seamen have, after a sick and stormy, a long and starving passage. This is one of the gods of New England, which the living and most high Eternal will destroy and famish.\n\nWas all this bloodshed and deceit-from Columbus to Cortes, Pizarro, the Puritans-a necessity for the human race to progress from savagery to civilization? Was Morison right in burying the story of genocide inside a more important story of human progress? Perhaps a persuasive argument can be made-as it was made by Stalin when he killed peasants for industrial progress in the Soviet Union, as it was made by Churchill explaining the bombings of Dresden and Hamburg, and Truman explaining Hiroshima. But how can the judgment be made if the benefits and losses cannot be balanced because the losses are either unmentioned or mentioned quickly?\n\nThat quick disposal might be acceptable (\"Unfortunate, yes, but it had to be done\") to the middle and upper classes of the conquering and \"advanced\" countries. But is it acceptable to the poor of Asia, Africa, Latin America, or to the prisoners in Soviet labor camps, or the blacks in urban ghettos, or the Indians on reservations-to the victims of that progress which benefits a privileged minority in the world? Was it acceptable (or just inescapable?) to the miners and railroaders of America, the factory hands, the men and women who died by the hundreds of thousands from accidents or sickness, where they worked or where they lived-casualties of progress? And even the privileged minority-must it not reconsider, with that practicality which even privilege cannot abolish, the value of its privileges, when they become threatened by the anger of the sacrificed, whether in organized rebellion, unorganized riot, or simply those brutal individual acts of desperation labeled crimes by law and the state?\n\nIf there are necessary sacrifices to be made for human progress, is it not essential to hold to the principle that those to be sacrificed must make the decision themselves? We can all decide to give up something of ours, but do we have the right to throw into the pyre the children of others, or even our own children, for a progress which is not nearly as clear or present as sickness or health, life or death?\n\nWhat did people in Spain get out of all that death and brutality visited on the Indians of the Americas? For a brief period in history, there was the glory of a Spanish Empire in the Western Hemisphere. As Hans Koning sums it up in his book Columbus: His Enterprise:\n\nFor all the gold and silver stolen and shipped to Spain did not make the Spanish people richer. It gave their kings an edge in the balance of power for a time, a chance to hire more mercenary soldiers for their wars. They ended up losing those wars anyway, and all that was left was a deadly inflation, a starving population, the rich richer, the poor poorer, and a ruined peasant class.\n\nBeyond all that, how certain are we that what was destroyed was inferior? Who were these people who came out on the beach and swam to bring presents to Columbus and his crew, who watched Cortes and Pizarro ride through their countryside, who peered out of the forests at the first white settlers of Virginia and Massachusetts?\n\nColumbus called them Indians, because he miscalculated the size of the earth. In this book we too call them Indians, with some reluctance, because it happens too often that people are saddled with names given them by their conquerors.\n\nAnd yet, there is some reason to call them Indians, because they did come, perhaps 25,000 years ago, from Asia, across the land bridge of the Bering Straits (later to disappear under water) to Alaska. Then they moved southward, seeking warmth and land, in a trek lasting thousands of years that took them into North America, then Central and South America. In Nicaragua, Brazil, and Ecuador their petrified footprints can still be seen, along with the print of bison, who disappeared about five thousand years ago, so they must have reached South America at least that far back\n\nWidely dispersed over the great land mass of the Americas, they numbered approximately 75 million people by the time Columbus came, perhaps 25 million in North America. Responding to the different environments of soil and climate, they developed hundreds of different tribal cultures, perhaps two thousand different languages. They perfected the art of agriculture, and figured out how to grow maize (corn), which cannot grow by itself and must be planted, cultivated, fertilized, harvested, husked, shelled. They ingeniously developed a variety of other vegetables and fruits, as well as peanuts and chocolate and tobacco and rubber.\n\nOn their own, the Indians were engaged in the great agricultural revolution that other peoples in Asia, Europe, Africa were going through about the same time.\n\nWhile many of the tribes remained nomadic hunters and food gatherers in wandering, egalitarian communes, others began to live in more settled communities where there was more food, larger populations, more divisions of labor among men and women, more surplus to feed chiefs and priests, more leisure time for artistic and social work, for building houses. About a thousand years before Christ, while comparable constructions were going on in Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Zuni and Hopi Indians of what is now New Mexico had begun to build villages consisting of large terraced buildings, nestled in among cliffs and mountains for protection from enemies, with hundreds of rooms in each village. Before the arrival of the European explorers, they were using irrigation canals, dams, were doing ceramics, weaving baskets, making cloth out of cotton.\n\nBy the time of Christ and Julius Caesar, there had developed in the Ohio River Valley a culture of so-called Moundbuilders, Indians who constructed thousands of enormous sculptures out of earth, sometimes in the shapes of huge humans, birds, or serpents, sometimes as burial sites, sometimes as fortifications. One of them was 3 1/2 miles long, enclosing 100 acres. These Moundbuilders seem to have been part of a complex trading system of ornaments and weapons from as far off as the Great Lakes, the Far West, and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAbout A.D. 500, as this Moundbuilder culture of the Ohio Valley was beginning to decline, another culture was developing westward, in the valley of the Mississippi, centered on what is now St. Louis. It had an advanced agriculture, included thousands of villages, and also built huge earthen mounds as burial and ceremonial places near a vast Indian metropolis that may have had thirty thousand people. The largest mound was 100 feet high, with a rectangular base larger than that of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. In the city, known as Cahokia, were toolmakers, hide dressers, potters, jewelry makers, weavers, salt makers, copper engravers, and magnificent ceramists. One funeral blanket was made of twelve thousand shell beads.\n\nFrom the Adirondacks to the Great Lakes, in what is now Pennsylvania and upper New York, lived the most powerful of the northeastern tribes, the League of the Iroquois, which included the Mohawks (People of the Flint), Oneidas (People of the Stone), Onondagas (People of the Mountain), Cayugas (People at the Landing), and Senecas (Great Hill People), thousands of people bound together by a common Iroquois language.\n\nIn the vision of the Mohawk chief Iliawatha, the legendary Dekaniwidah spoke to the Iroquois: \"We bind ourselves together by taking hold of each other's hands so firmly and forming a circle so strong that if a tree should fall upon it, it could not shake nor break it, so that our people and grandchildren shall remain in the circle in security, peace and happiness.\"\n\nIn the villages of the Iroquois, land was owned in common and worked in common. Hunting was done together, and the catch was divided among the members of the village. Houses were considered common property and were shared by several families. The concept of private ownership of land and homes was foreign to the Iroquois. A French Jesuit priest who encountered them in the 1650s wrote: \"No poorhouses are needed among them, because they are neither mendicants nor paupers.. . . Their kindness, humanity and courtesy not only makes them liberal with what they have, but causes them to possess hardly anything except in common.\"\n\nWomen were important and respected in Iroquois society. Families were matrilineal. That is, the family line went down through the female members, whose husbands joined the family, while sons who married then joined their wives' families. Each extended family lived in a \"long house.\" When a woman wanted a divorce, she set her husband's things outside the door.\n\nFamilies were grouped in clans, and a dozen or more clans might make up a village. The senior women in the village named the men who represented the clans at village and tribal councils. They also named the forty-nine chiefs who were the ruling council for the Five Nation confederacy of the Iroquois. The women attended clan meetings, stood behind the circle of men who spoke and voted, and removed the men from office if they strayed too far from the wishes of the women.\n\nThe women tended the crops and took general charge of village affairs while the men were always hunting or fishing. And since they supplied the moccasins and food for warring expeditions, they had some control over military matters. As Gary B. Nash notes in his fascinating study of early America, Red, White, and Black: \"Thus power was shared between the sexes and the European idea of male dominancy and female subordination in all things was conspicuously absent in Iroquois society.\"\n\nChildren in Iroquois society, while taught the cultural heritage of their people and solidarity with the tribe, were also taught to be independent, not to submit to overbearing authority. They were taught equality in status and the sharing of possessions. The Iroquois did not use harsh punishment on children; they did not insist on early weaning or early toilet training, but gradually allowed the child to learn self-care.\n\nAll of this was in sharp contrast to European values as brought over by the first colonists, a society of rich and poor, controlled by priests, by governors, by male heads of families. For example, the pastor of the Pilgrim colony, John Robinson, thus advised his parishioners how to deal with their children: \"And surely there is in all children ... a stubbornness, and stoutness of mind arising from natural pride, which must, in the first place, be broken and beaten down; that so the foundation of their education being laid in humility and tractableness, other virtues may, in their time, be built thereon.\"\n\nGary Nash describes Iroquois culture:\n\nNo laws and ordinances, sheriffs and constables, judges and juries, or courts or jails-the apparatus of authority in European societies-were to be found in the northeast woodlands prior to European arrival. Yet boundaries of acceptable behavior were firmly set. Though priding themselves on the autonomous individual, the Iroquois maintained a strict sense of right and wrong.... He who stole another's food or acted invalourously in war was \"shamed\" by his people and ostracized from their company until he had atoned for his actions and demonstrated to their satisfaction that he had morally purified himself.\n\nNot only the Iroquois but other Indian tribes behaved the same way. In 1635, Maryland Indians responded to the governor's demand that if any of them killed an Englishman, the guilty one should be delivered up for punishment according to English law. The Indians said:\n\nIt is the manner amongst us Indians, that if any such accident happen, wee doe redeeme the life of a man that is so slaine, with a 100 armes length of Beades and since that you are heere strangers, and come into our Countrey, you should rather conform yourselves to the Customes of our Countrey, than impose yours upon us....\n\nSo, Columbus and his successors were not coming into an empty wilderness, but into a world which in some places was as densely populated as Europe itself, where the culture was complex, where human relations were more egalitarian than in Europe, and where the relations among men, women, children, and nature were more beautifully worked out than perhaps any place in the world.\n\nThey were people without a written language, but with their own laws, their poetry, their history kept in memory and passed on, in an oral vocabulary more complex than Europe's, accompanied by song, dance, and ceremonial drama. They paid careful attention to the development of personality, intensity of will, independence and flexibility, passion and potency, to their partnership with one another and with nature.\n\nJohn Collier, an American scholar who lived among Indians in the 1920s and 1930s in the American Southwest, said of their spirit: \"Could we make it our own, there would be an eternally inexhaustible earth and a forever lasting peace.\"\n\nPerhaps there is some romantic mythology in that. But the evidence from European travelers in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, put together recently by an American specialist on Indian life, William Brandon, is overwhelmingly supportive of much of that \"myth.\" Even allowing for the imperfection of myths, it is enough to make us question, for that time and ours, the excuse of progress in the annihilation of races, and the telling of history from the standpoint of the conquerors and leaders of Western civilization.10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/810557", "artist_names": "Paul Anka", "full_title": "Puppy Love by\u00a0Paul\u00a0Anka", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/ac69911732e17cce53d55931642c53a7.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ac69911732e17cce53d55931642c53a7.550x550x1.jpg", "id": 810557, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 9514119, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1632526371, "path": "/Paul-anka-puppy-love-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Paul-anka-puppy-love-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1960, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1960", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1960", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/ac69911732e17cce53d55931642c53a7.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ac69911732e17cce53d55931642c53a7.550x550x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 26063}, "title": "Puppy Love", "title_with_featured": "Puppy Love", "updated_by_human_at": 1661624125, "url": "https://genius.com/Paul-anka-puppy-love-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/42458", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/7deb5c7c8bca1630de4d1e5eb1d09b54.480x360x1.jpg", "id": 42458, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c1830688225545aefb615c28999dfcb0.727x727x1.jpg", "index_character": "p", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Paul Anka", "slug": "Paul-anka", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Paul-anka"}, "artist": "Paul Anka", "lyrics": "Puppy Love Lyrics[Verse 1]\nAnd they called it puppy love\nOh, I guess they'll never know\nHow a young heart really feels\nAnd why I love her so\nAnd they called it puppy love\nJust because we're, we're seventeen\nTell them all it, please tell them it isn't fair\nTo take away my only dream\n\n[Verse 2]\nI cry each night my tears for you\nMy tears are all in vain\nI hope and I'll pray that maybe someday\nYou'll be back (You'll be back), in my arms (in my arms)\nOnce again (Will be back in my arms once again)\n[Verse 3]\nSomeone help me, help me, help me please\nIs the answer up above?\nHow can I, oh, how can I tell them\nThis is not a puppy love?

The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Who's Who of Goldman Sachs graduates.\n\nBy now, most of us know the major players. As George Bush's last Treasury secretary, former Goldman CEO Henry Paulson was the architect of the bailout, a suspiciously self-serving plan to funnel trillions of Your Dollars to a handful of his old friends on Wall Street. Robert Rubin, Bill Clinton's former Treasury secretary, spent 26 years at Goldman before becoming chairman of Citigroup \u2014 which in turn got a $300 billion taxpayer bailout from Paulson. There's John Thain, the asshole chief of Merrill Lynch who bought an $87,000 area rug for his office as his company was imploding; a former Goldman banker, Thain enjoyed a multi-billion-dollar handout from Paulson, who used billions in taxpayer funds to help Bank of America rescue Thain's sorry company. And Robert Steel, the former Goldmanite head of Wachovia, scored himself and his fellow executives $225 million in golden-parachute payments as his bank was self-destructing. There's Joshua Bolten, Bush's chief of staff during the bailout, and Mark Patterson, the current Treasury chief of staff, who was a Goldman lobbyist just a year ago, and Ed Liddy, the former Goldman director whom Paulson put in charge of bailed-out insurance giant AIG, which forked over $13 billion to Goldman after Liddy came on board. The heads of the Canadian and Italian national banks are Goldman alums, as is the head of the World Bank, the head of the New York Stock Exchange, the last two heads of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \u2014 which, incidentally, is now in charge of overseeing Goldman \u2014 not to mention \u2026\n\nBut then, any attempt to construct a narrative around all the former Goldmanites in influential positions quickly becomes an absurd and pointless exercise, like trying to make a list of everything. What you need to know is the big picture: If America is circling the drain, Goldman Sachs has found a way to be that drain \u2014 an extremely unfortunate loophole in the system of Western democratic capitalism, which never foresaw that in a society governed passively by free markets and free elections, organized greed always defeats disorganized democracy.\n\nThe bank's unprecedented reach and power have enabled it to turn all of America into a giant pump-and-dump scam, manipulating whole economic sectors for years at a time, moving the dice game as this or that market collapses, and all the time gorging itself on the unseen costs that are breaking families everywhere \u2014 high gas prices, rising consumer credit rates, half-eaten pension funds, mass layoffs, future taxes to pay off bailouts. All that money that you're losing, it's going somewhere, and in both a literal and a figurative sense, Goldman Sachs is where it's going: The bank is a huge, highly sophisticated engine for converting the useful, deployed wealth of society into the least useful, most wasteful and insoluble substance on Earth \u2014 pure profit for rich individuals.\n\nThey achieve this using the same playbook over and over again. The formula is relatively simple: Goldman positions itself in the middle of a speculative bubble, selling investments they know are crap. Then they hoover up vast sums from the middle and lower floors of society with the aid of a crippled and corrupt state that allows it to rewrite the rules in exchange for the relative pennies the bank throws at political patronage. Finally, when it all goes bust, leaving millions of ordinary citizens broke and starving, they begin the entire process over again, riding in to rescue us all by lending us back our own money at interest, selling themselves as men above greed, just a bunch of really smart guys keeping the wheels greased. They've been pulling this same stunt over and over since the 1920s \u2014 and now they're preparing to do it again, creating what may be the biggest and most audacious bubble yet.\n\nIf you want to understand how we got into this financial crisis, you have to first understand where all the money went \u2014 and in order to understand that, you need to understand what Goldman has already gotten away with. It is a history exactly five bubbles long \u2014 including last year's strange and seemingly inexplicable spike in the price of oil. There were a lot of losers in each of those bubbles, and in the bailout that followed. But Goldman wasn't one of them.\nBUBBLE #1 The Great Depression\n\nGoldman wasn't always a too-big-to-fail Wall Street behemoth, the ruthless face of kill-or-be-killed capitalism on steroids \u2014just almost always. The bank was actually founded in 1869 by a German immigrant named Marcus Goldman, who built it up with his son-in-law Samuel Sachs. They were pioneers in the use of commercial paper, which is just a fancy way of saying they made money lending out short-term IOUs to smalltime vendors in downtown Manhattan.\n\nYou can probably guess the basic plotline of Goldman's first 100 years in business: plucky, immigrant-led investment bank beats the odds, pulls itself up by its bootstraps, makes shitloads of money. In that ancient history there's really only one episode that bears scrutiny now, in light of more recent events: Goldman\u2019s disastrous foray into the speculative mania of pre-crash Wall Street in the late 1920s.\n\nThis great Hindenburg of financial history has a few features that might sound familiar. Back then, the main financial tool used to bilk investors was called an \"investment trust.\" Similar to modern mutual funds, the trusts took the cash of investors large and small and (theoretically, at least) invested it in a smorgasbord of Wall Street securities, though the securities and amounts were often kept hidden from the public. So a regular guy could invest $10 or $100 in a trust and feel like he was a big player. Much as in the 1990s, when new vehicles like day trading and e-trading attracted reams of new suckers from the sticks who wanted to feel like big shots, investment trusts roped a new generation of regular-guy investors into the speculation game.\n\nBeginning a pattern that would repeat itself over and over again, Goldman got into the investmenttrust game late, then jumped in with both feet and went hogwild. The first effort was the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation; the bank issued a million shares at $100 apiece, bought all those shares with its own money and then sold 90 percent of them to the hungry public at $104. The trading corporation then relentlessly bought shares in itself, bidding the price up further and further. Eventually it dumped part of its holdings and sponsored a new trust, the Shenandoah Corporation, issuing millions more in shares in that fund \u2014 which in turn sponsored yet another trust called the Blue Ridge Corporation. In this way, each investment trust served as a front for an endless investment pyramid: Goldman hiding behind Goldman hiding behind Goldman. Of the 7,250,000 initial shares of Blue Ridge, 6,250,000 were actually owned by Shenandoah \u2014 which, of course, was in large part owned by Goldman Trading.\n\nThe end result (ask yourself if this sounds familiar) was a daisy chain of borrowed money, one exquisitely vulnerable to a decline in performance anywhere along the line. The basic idea isn't hard to follow. You take a dollar and borrow nine against it; then you take that $10 fund and borrow $90; then you take your $100 fund and, so long as the public is still lending, borrow and invest $900. If the last fund in the line starts to lose value, you no longer have the money to pay back your investors, and everyone gets massacred.\n\nIn a chapter from The Great Crash, 1929 titled \"In Goldman Sachs We Trust,\" the famed economist John Kenneth Galbraith held up the Blue Ridge and Shenandoah trusts as classic examples of the insanity of leveragebased investment. The trusts, he wrote, were a major cause of the market's historic crash; in today's dollars, the losses the bank suffered totaled $475 billion. \"It is difficult not to marvel at the imagination which was implicit in this gargantuan insanity,\" Galbraith observed, sounding like Keith Olbermann in an ascot. \"If there must be madness, something may be said for having it on a heroic scale.\"\n\nBUBBLE #2 Tech Stocks\n\nFast-forward about 65 years. Goldman not only survived the crash that wiped out so many of the investors it duped, it went on to become the chief underwriter to the country's wealthiest and most powerful corporations. Thanks to Sidney Weinberg, who rose from the rank of janitor's assistant to head the firm, Goldman became the pioneer of the initial public offering, one of the principal and most lucrative means by which companies raise money. During the 1970s and 1980s, Goldman may not have been the planet-eating Death Star of political influence it is today, but it was a top-drawer firm that had a reputation for attracting the very smartest talent on the Street.\n\nIt also, oddly enough, had a reputation for relatively solid ethics and a patient approach to investment that shunned the fast buck; its executives were trained to adopt the firm's mantra, \"long-term greedy.\" One former Goldman banker who left the firm in the early Nineties recalls seeing his superiors give up a very profitable deal on the grounds that it was a long-term loser. \"We gave back money to 'grownup' corporate clients who had made bad deals with us,\" he says. \"Everything we did was legal and fair \u2014 but 'long-term greedy' said we didn't want to make such a profit at the clients' collective expense that we spoiled the marketplace.\"\n\nBut then, something happened. It's hard to say what it was exactly; it might have been the fact that Goldman's cochairman in the early Nineties, Robert Rubin, followed Bill Clinton to the White House, where he directed the National Economic Council and eventually became Treasury secretary. While the American media fell in love with the story line of a pair of baby-boomer, Sixties-child, Fleetwood Mac yuppies nesting in the White House, it also nursed an undisguised crush on Rubin, who was hyped as without a doubt the smartest person ever to walk the face of the Earth, with Newton, Einstein, Mozart and Kant running far behind.\n\nRubin was the prototypical Goldman banker. He was probably born in a $4,000 suit, he had a face that seemed permanently frozen just short of an apology for being so much smarter than you, and he exuded a Spock-like, emotion-neutral exterior; the only human feeling you could imagine him experiencing was a nightmare about being forced to fly coach. It became almost a national clich\u00e8 that whatever Rubin thought was best for the economy \u2014 a phenomenon that reached its apex in 1999, when Rubin appeared on the cover of Time with his Treasury deputy, Larry Summers, and Fed chief Alan Greenspan under the headline The Committee To Save The World. And \"what Rubin thought,\" mostly, was that the American economy, and in particular the financial markets, were over-regulated and needed to be set free. During his tenure at Treasury, the Clinton White House made a series of moves that would have drastic consequences for the global economy \u2014 beginning with Rubin's complete and total failure to regulate his\nold firm during its first mad dash for obscene short-term profits.\n\nThe basic scam in the Internet Age is pretty easy even for the financially illiterate to grasp. Companies that weren't much more than potfueled ideas scrawled on napkins by uptoolate bongsmokers were taken public via IPOs, hyped in the media and sold to the public for mega-millions. It was as if banks like Goldman were wrapping ribbons around watermelons, tossing them out 50-story windows and opening the phones for bids. In this game you were a winner only if you took your money out before the melon hit the pavement.\nIt sounds obvious now, but what the average investor didn't know at the time was that the banks had changed the rules of the game, making the deals look better than they actually were. They did this by setting up what was, in reality, a two-tiered investment system \u2014 one for the insiders who knew the real numbers, and another for the lay investor who was invited to chase soaring prices the banks themselves knew were irrational. While Goldman's later pattern would be to capitalize on changes in the regulatory environment, its key innovation in the Internet years was to abandon its own industry's standards of quality control.\n\n\"Since the Depression, there were strict underwriting guidelines that Wall Street adhered to when taking a company public,\" says one prominent hedge-fund manager. \"The company had to be in business for a minimum of five years, and it had to show profitability for three consecutive years. But Wall Street took these guidelines and threw them in the trash.\" Goldman completed the snow job by pumping up the sham stocks: \"Their analysts were out there saying Bullshit.com is worth $100 a share.\"\n\nThe problem was, nobody told investors that the rules had changed. \"Everyone on the inside knew,\" the manager says. \"Bob Rubin sure as hell knew what the underwriting standards were. They'd been intact since the 1930s.\"\n\nJay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida who specializes in IPOs, says banks like Goldman knew full well that many of the public offerings they were touting would never make a dime. \"In the early Eighties, the major underwriters insisted on three years of profitability. Then it was one year, then it was a quarter. By the time of the Internet bubble, they were not even requiring profitability in the foreseeable future.\"\n\nGoldman has denied that it changed its underwriting standards during the Internet years, but its own statistics belie the claim. Just as it did with the investment trust in the 1920s, Goldman started slow and finished crazy in the Internet years. After it took a little-known company with weak financials called Yahoo! public in 1996, once the tech boom had already begun, Goldman quickly became the IPO king of the Internet era. Of the 24 companies it took public in 1997, a third were losing money at the time of the IPO. In 1999, at the height of the boom, it took 47 companies public, including stillborns like Webvan and eToys, investment offerings that were in many ways the modern equivalents of Blue Ridge and Shenandoah. The following year, it underwrote 18 companies in the first four months, 14 of which were money losers at the time. As a leading underwriter of Internet stocks during the boom, Goldman provided profits far more volatile than those of its competitors: In 1999, the average Goldman IPO leapt 281 percent above its offering price, compared to the Wall Street average of 181 percent.\n\nHow did Goldman achieve such extraordinary results? One answer is that they used a practice called \"laddering,\" which is just a fancy way of saying they manipulated the share price of new offerings. Here's how it works: Say you're Goldman Sachs, and Bullshit.com comes to you and asks you to take their company public. You agree on the usual terms: You'll price the stock, determine how many shares should be released and take the Bullshit.com CEO on a \"road show\" to schmooze investors, all in exchange for a substantial fee (typically six to seven percent of the amount raised). You then promise your best clients the right to buy big chunks of the IPO at the low offering price \u2014 let's say Bullshit.com's starting share price is $15 \u2014 in exchange for a promise that they will buy more shares later on the open market. That seemingly simple demand gives you inside knowledge of the IPO's future, knowledge that wasn't disclosed to the day trader schmucks who only had the prospectus to go by: You know that certain of your clients who bought X amount of shares at $15 are also going to buy Y more shares at $20 or $25, virtually guaranteeing that the price is going to go to $25 and beyond. In this way, Goldman could artificially jack up the new company's price, which of course was to the bank's benefit \u2014 a six percent fee of a $500 million IPO is serious money.\n\nGoldman was repeatedly sued by shareholders for engaging in laddering in a variety of Internet IPOs, including Webvan and NetZero. The deceptive practices also caught the attention of Nicholas Maier, the syndicate manager of Cramer & Co., the hedge fund run at the time by the now-famous chattering television asshole Jim Cramer, himself a Goldman alum. Maier told the SEC that while working for Cramer between 1996 and 1998, he was repeatedly forced to engage in laddering practices during IPO deals with Goldman.\n\n\"Goldman, from what I witnessed, they were the worst perpetrator,\" Maier said. \"They totally fueled the bubble. And it's specifically that kind of behavior that has caused the market crash. They built these stocks upon an illegal foundation \u2014 manipulated up \u2014 and ultimately, it really was the small person who ended up buying in.\" In 2005, Goldman agreed to pay $40 million for its laddering violations \u2014 a puny penalty relative to the enormous profits it made. (Goldman, which has denied wrongdoing in all of the cases it has settled, refused to respond to questions for this story.)\n\nAnother practice Goldman engaged in during the Internet boom was \"spinning,\" better known as bribery. Here the investment bank would offer the executives of the newly public company shares at extra-low prices, in exchange for future underwriting business. Banks that engaged in spinning would then undervalue the initial offering price \u2014 ensuring that those \"hot\" opening-price shares it had handed out to insiders would be more likely to rise quickly, supplying bigger first-day rewards for the chosen few. So instead of Bullshit.com opening at $20, the bank would approach the Bullshit.com CEO and offer him a million shares of his own company at $18 in exchange for future business \u2014 effectively robbing all of Bullshit's new shareholders by diverting cash that should have gone to the company's bottom line into the private bank account of the company's CEO.\n\nIn one case, Goldman allegedly gave a multimillion-dollar special offering to eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who later joined Goldman's board, in exchange for future i-banking business. According to a report by the House Financial Services Committee in 2002, Goldman gave special stock offerings to executives in 21 companies that it took public, including Yahoo! cofounder Jerry Yang and two of the great slithering villains of the financial-scandal age \u2014 Tyco's Dennis Kozlowski and Enron's Ken Lay. Goldman angrily denounced the report as \"an egregious distortion of the facts\" \u2014 shortly before paying $110 million to settle an investigation into spinning and other manipulations launched by New York state regulators. \"The spinning of hot IPO shares was not a harmless corporate perk,\" then-attorney general Eliot Spitzer said at the time. \"Instead, it was an integral part of a fraudulent scheme to win new investment-banking business.\"\n\nSuch practices conspired to turn the Internet bubble into one of the greatest financial disasters in world history: Some $5 trillion of wealth was wiped out on the NASDAQ alone. But the real problem wasn't the money that was lost by shareholders, it was the money gained by investment bankers, who received hefty bonuses for tampering with the market. Instead of teaching Wall Street a lesson that bubbles always deflate, the Internet years demonstrated to bankers that in the age of freely flowing capital and publicly owned financial companies, bubbles are incredibly easy to inflate, and individual bonuses are actually bigger when the mania and the irrationality are greater.\n\nNowhere was this truer than at Goldman. Between 1999 and 2002, the firm paid out $28.5 billion in compensation and benefits \u2014 an average of roughly $350,000 a year per employee. Those numbers are important because the key legacy of the Internet boom is that the economy is now driven in large part by the pursuit of the enormous salaries and bonuses that such bubbles make possible. Goldman's mantra of \"long-term greedy\" vanished into thin air as the game became about getting your check before the melon hit the pavement.\n\nThe market was no longer a rationally managed place to grow real, profitable businesses: It was a huge ocean of Someone Else's Money where bankers hauled in vast sums through whatever means necessary and tried to convert that money into bonuses and payouts as quickly as possible. If you laddered and spun 50 Internet IPOs that went bust within a year, so what? By the time the Securities and Exchange Commission got around to fining your firm $110 million, the yacht you bought with your IPO bonuses was already six years old. Besides, you were probably out of Goldman by then, running the U.S. Treasury or maybe the state of New Jersey. (One of the truly comic moments in the history of America's recent financial collapse came when Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey, who ran Goldman from 1994 to 1999 and left with $320 million in IPO-fattened stock, insisted in 2002 that \"I've never even heard the term 'laddering' before.\")\nFor a bank that paid out $7 billion a year in salaries, $110 million fines issued half a decade late were something far less than a deterrent \u2014they were a joke. Once the Internet bubble burst, Goldman had no incentive to reassess its new, profit-driven strategy; it just searched around for another bubble to inflate. As it turns out, it had one ready, thanks in large part to Rubin.\n\nBUBBLE #3 The Housing Craze\n\nGoldman's role in the sweeping global disaster that was the housing bubble is not hard to trace. Here again, the basic trick was a decline in underwriting standards, although in this case the standards weren't in IPOs but in mortgages. By now almost everyone knows that for decades mortgage dealers insisted that home buyers be able to produce a down payment of 10 percent or more, show a steady income and good credit rating, and possess a real first and last name. Then, at the dawn of the new millennium, they suddenly threw all that shit out the window and started writing mortgages on the backs of napkins to cocktail waitresses and ex-cons carrying five bucks and a Snickers bar.\n\nNone of that would have been possible without investment bankers like Goldman, who created vehicles to package those shitty mortgages and sell them en masse to unsuspecting insurance companies and pension funds. This created a mass market for toxic debt that would never have existed before; in the old days, no bank would have wanted to keep some addict ex-con's mortgage on its books, knowing how likely it was to fail. You can't write these mortgages, in other words, unless you can sell them to someone who doesn't know what they are.\n\nGoldman used two methods to hide the mess they were selling. First, they bundled hundreds of different mortgages into instruments called Collateralized Debt Obligations. Then they sold investors on the idea that, because a bunch of those mortgages would turn out to be OK, there was no reason to worry so much about the shitty ones: The CDO, as a whole, was sound. Thus, junk-rated mortgages were turned into AAA-rated investments. Second, to hedge its own bets, Goldman got companies like AIG to provide insurance \u2014 known as credit default swaps \u2014 on the CDOs. The swaps were essentially a racetrack bet between AIG and Goldman: Goldman is betting the ex-cons will default, AIG is betting they won't.\n\nThere was only one problem with the deals: All of the wheeling and dealing represented exactly the kind of dangerous speculation that federal regulators are supposed to rein in. Derivatives like CDOs and credit swaps had already caused a series of serious financial calamities: Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings both lost fortunes, and Orange County, California, was forced to default in 1994. A report that year by the Government Accountability Office recommended that such financial instruments be tightly regulated \u2014 and in 1998, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a woman named Brooksley Born, agreed. That May, she circulated a letter to business leaders and the Clinton administration suggesting that banks be required to provide greater disclosure in derivatives trades, and maintain reserves to cushion against losses.\n\nMore regulation wasn\u2019t exactly what Goldman had in mind. \u201cThe banks go crazy \u2014 they want it stopped,\u201d says Michael Greenberger, who worked for Born as director of trading and markets at the CFTC and is now a law professor at the University of Maryland. \u201cGreenspan, Summers, Rubin and [SEC chief Arthur] Levitt want it stopped.\u201d\n\nClinton's reigning economic foursome \u2014 \u201cespecially Rubin,\u201d according to Greenberger \u2014 called Born in for a meeting and pleaded their case. She refused to back down, however, and continued to push for more regulation of the derivatives. Then, in June 1998, Rubin went public to denounce her move, eventually recommending that Congress strip the CFTC of its regulatory authority. In 2000, on its last day in session, Congress passed the now-notorious Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which had been inserted into an 11,000-page spending bill at the last minute, with almost no debate on the floor of the Senate. Banks were now free to trade default swaps with impunity.\n\nBut the story didn't end there. AIG, a major purveyor of default swaps, approached the New York State Insurance Department in 2000 and asked whether default swaps would be regulated as insurance. At the time, the office was run by one Neil Levin, a former Goldman vice president, who decided against regulating the swaps. Now freed to underwrite as many housing-based securities and buy as much credit-default protection as it wanted, Goldman went berserk with lending lust. By the peak of the housing boom in 2006, Goldman was underwriting $76.5 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities \u2014 a third of which were sub-prime \u2014 much of it to institutional investors like pensions and insurance companies. And in these massive issues of real estate were vast swamps of crap.\n\nTake one $494 million issue that year, GSAMP Trust 2006S3. Many of the mortgages belonged to second-mortgage borrowers, and the average equity they had in their homes was 0.71 percent. Moreover, 58 percent of the loans included little or no documentation \u2014 no names of the borrowers, no addresses of the homes, just zip codes. Yet both of the major ratings agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, rated 93 percent of the issue as investment grade. Moody's projected that less than 10 percent of the loans would default. In reality, 18 percent of the mortgages were in default within 18 months.\n\nNot that Goldman was personally at any risk. The bank might be taking all these hideous, completely irresponsible mortgages from beneath-gangster-status firms like Countrywide and selling them off to municipalities and pensioners \u2014 old people, for God's sake \u2014 pretending the whole time that it wasn't grade D horseshit. But even as it was doing so, it was taking short positions in the same market, in essence betting against the same crap it was selling. Even worse, Goldman bragged about it in public. \"The mortgage sector continues to be challenged,\" David Viniar, the bank's chief financial officer, boasted in 2007. \"As a result, we took significant markdowns on our long inventory positions \u2026 However, our risk bias in that market was to be short, and that net short position was profitable.\" In other words, the mortgages it was selling were for chumps. The real money was in betting against those same mortgages.\n\n\"That's how audacious these assholes are,\" says one hedge fund manager. \"At least with other banks, you could say that they were just dumb \u2014 they believed what they were selling, and it blew them up. Goldman knew what it was doing.\"\n\nI ask the manager how it could be that selling something to customers that you're actually betting against \u2014 particularly when you know more about the weaknesses of those products than the customer \u2014 doesn't amount to securities fraud.\n\n\"It's exactly securities fraud,\" he says. \"It's the heart of securities fraud.\"\n\nEventually, lots of aggrieved investors agreed. In a virtual repeat of the Internet IPO craze, Goldman was hit with a wave of lawsuits after the collapse of the housing bubble, many of which accused the bank of withholding pertinent information about the quality of the mortgages it issued. New York state regulators are suing Goldman and 25 other underwriters for selling bundles of crappy Countrywide mortgages to city and state pension funds, which lost as much as $100 million in the investments. Massachusetts also investigated Goldman for similar misdeeds, acting on behalf of 714 mortgage holders who got stuck holding predatory loans. But once again, Goldman got off virtually scot-free, staving off prosecution by agreeing to pay a paltry $60 million \u2014 about what the bank's CDO division made in a day and a half during the real estate boom.\n\nThe effects of the housing bubble are well known \u2014 it led more or less directly to the collapse of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG, whose toxic portfolio of credit swaps was in significant part composed of the insurance that banks like Goldman bought against their own housing portfolios. In fact, at least $13 billion of the taxpayer money given to AIG in the bailout ultimately went to Goldman, meaning that the bank made out on the housing bubble twice: It fucked the investors who bought their horseshit CDOs by betting against its own crappy product, then it turned around and fucked the taxpayer by making him pay off those same bets.\n\nAnd once again, while the world was crashing down all around the bank, Goldman made sure it was doing just fine in the compensation department. In 2006, the firm's payroll jumped to $16.5 billion \u2014 an average of $622,000 per employee. As a Goldman spokesman explained, \"We work very hard here.\"\n\nBut the best was yet to come. While the collapse of the housing bubble sent most of the financial world fleeing for the exits, or to jail, Goldman boldly doubled down \u2014 and almost single-handedly created yet another bubble, one the world still barely knows the firm had anything to do with.\n\nBUBBLE #4 $4 a Gallon\n\nBy the beginning of 2008, the financial world was in turmoil. Wall Street had spent the past two and a half decades producing one scandal after another, which didn't leave much to sell that wasn't tainted. The terms junk bond, IPO, sub-prime mortgage and other once-hot financial fare were now firmly associated in the public's mind with scams; the terms credit swaps and CDOs were about to join them. The credit markets were in crisis, and the mantra that had sustained the fantasy economy throughout the Bush years \u2014 the notion that housing prices never go down \u2014 was now a fully exploded myth, leaving the Street clamoring for a new bullshit paradigm to sling.\n\nWhere to go? With the public reluctant to put money in anything that felt like a paper investment, the Street quietly moved the casino to the physical-commodities market \u2014 stuff you could touch: corn, coffee, cocoa, wheat and, above all, energy commodities, especially oil. In conjunction with a decline in the dollar, the credit crunch and the housing crash caused a \"flight to commodities.\" Oil futures in particular skyrocketed, as the price of a single barrel went from around $60 in the middle of 2007 to a high of $147 in the summer of 2008.\n\nThat summer, as the presidential campaign heated up, the accepted explanation for why gasoline had hit $4.11 a gallon was that there was a problem with the world oil supply. In a classic example of how Republicans and Democrats respond to crises by engaging in fierce exchanges of moronic irrelevancies, John McCain insisted that ending the moratorium on offshore drilling would be \"very helpful in the short term,\" while Barack Obama in typical liberal-arts yuppie style argued that federal investment in hybrid cars was the way out.\n\nBut it was all a lie. While the global supply of oil will eventually dry up, the short-term flow has actually been increasing. In the six months before prices spiked, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the world oil supply rose from 85.24 million barrels a day to 85.72 million. Over the same period, world oil demand dropped from 86.82 million barrels a day to 86.07 million. Not only was the short-term supply of oil rising, the demand for it was falling \u2014 which, in classic economic terms, should have brought prices at the pump down.\n\nSo what caused the huge spike in oil prices? Take a wild guess. Obviously Goldman had help \u2014 there were other players in the physical commodities market \u2014 but the root cause had almost everything to do with the behavior of a few powerful actors determined to turn the once-solid market into a speculative casino. Goldman did it by persuading pension funds and other large institutional investors to invest in oil futures \u2014 agreeing to buy oil at a certain price on a fixed date. The push transformed oil from a physical commodity, rigidly subject to supply and demand, into something to bet on, like a stock. Between 2003 and 2008, the amount of speculative money in commodities grew from $13 billion to $317 billion, an increase of 2,300 percent. By 2008, a barrel of oil was traded 27 times, on average, before it was actually delivered and consumed.\n\nAs is so often the case, there had been a Depression-era law in place designed specifically to prevent this sort of thing. The commodities market was designed in large part to help farmers: A grower concerned about future price drops could enter into a contract to sell his corn at a certain price for delivery later on, which made him worry less about building up stores of his crop. When no one was buying corn, the farmer could sell to a middleman known as a \"traditional speculator,\" who would store the grain and sell it later, when demand returned. That way, someone was always there to buy from the farmer, even when the market temporarily had no need for his crops.\n\nIn 1936, however, Congress recognized that there should never be more speculators in the market than real producers and consumers. If that happened, prices would be affected by something other than supply and demand, and price manipulations would ensue. A new law empowered the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \u2014 the very same body that would later try and fail to regulate credit swaps \u2014 to place limits on speculative trades in commodities. As a result of the CFTC's oversight, peace and harmony reigned in the commodities markets for more than 50 years.\n\nAll that changed in 1991 when, unbeknownst to almost everyone in the world, a Goldman-owned commodities-trading subsidiary called J. Aron wrote to the CFTC and made an unusual argument. Farmers with big stores of corn, Goldman argued, weren't the only ones who needed to hedge their risk against future price drops \u2014 Wall Street dealers who made big bets on oil prices also needed to hedge their risk, because, well, they stood to lose a lot too.\n\nThis was complete and utter crap \u2014 the 1936 law, remember, was specifically designed to maintain distinctions between people who were buying and selling real tangible stuff and people who were trading in paper alone. But the CFTC, amazingly, bought Goldman's argument. It issued the bank a free pass, called the \"Bona Fide Hedging\" exemption, allowing Goldman's subsidiary to call itself a physical hedger and escape virtually all limits placed on speculators. In the years that followed, the commission would quietly issue 14 similar exemptions to other companies.\n\nNow Goldman and other banks were free to drive more investors into the commodities markets, enabling speculators to place increasingly big bets. That 1991 letter from Goldman more or less directly led to the oil bubble in 2008, when the number of speculators in the market \u2014 driven there by fear of the falling dollar and the housing crash \u2014 finally overwhelmed the real physical suppliers and consumers. By 2008, at least three quarters of the activity on the commodity exchanges was speculative, according to a congressional staffer who studied the numbers \u2014 and that's likely a conservative estimate. By the middle of last summer, despite rising supply and a drop in demand, we were paying $4 a gallon every time we pulled up to the pump.\n\nWhat is even more amazing is that the letter to Goldman, along with most of the other trading exemptions, was handed out more or less in secret. \"I was the head of the division of trading and markets, and Brooksley Born was the chair of the CFTC,\" says Greenberger, \"and neither of us knew this letter was out there.\" In fact, the letters only came to light by accident. Last year, a staffer for the House Energy and Commerce Committee just happened to be at a briefing when officials from the CFTC made an offhand reference to the exemptions.\n\n\"I had been invited to a briefing the commission was holding on energy,\" the staffer recounts. \"And suddenly in the middle of it, they start saying, 'Yeah, we've been issuing these letters for years now.' I raised my hand and said, 'Really? You issued a letter? Can I see it?' And they were like, 'Duh, duh.' So we went back and forth, and finally they said, 'We have to clear it with Goldman Sachs.' I'm like, 'What do you mean, you have to clear it with Goldman Sachs?'\"\n\nThe CFTC cited a rule that prohibited it from releasing any information about a company's current position in the market. But the staffer's request was about a letter that had been issued 17 years earlier. It no longer had anything to do with Goldman's current position. What's more, Section 7 of the 1936 commodities law gives Congress the right to any information it wants from the commission. Still, in a classic example of how complete Goldman's capture of government is, the CFTC waited until it got clearance from the bank before it turned the letter over.\n\nArmed with the semi-secret government exemption, Goldman had become the chief designer of a giant commodities betting parlor. Its Goldman Sachs Commodities Index \u2014 which tracks the prices of 24 major commodities but is overwhelmingly weighted toward oil \u2014 became the place where pension funds and insurance companies and other institutional investors could make massive long-term bets on commodity prices. Which was all well and good, except for a couple of things. One was that index speculators are mostly \"long only\" bettors, who seldom if ever take short positions \u2014 meaning they only bet on prices to rise. While this kind of behavior is good for a stock market, it's terrible for commodities, because it continually forces prices upward. \"If index speculators took short positions as well as long ones, you'd see them pushing prices both up and down,\" says Michael Masters, a hedge fund manager who has helped expose the role of investment banks in the manipulation of oil prices. \"But they only push prices in one direction: up.\"\n\nComplicating matters even further was the fact that Goldman itself was cheerleading with all its might for an increase in oil prices. In the beginning of 2008, Arjun Murti, a Goldman analyst, hailed as an \"oracle of oil\" by The New York Times, predicted a \"super spike\" in oil prices, forecasting a rise to $200 a barrel. At the time Goldman was heavily invested in oil through its commodities trading subsidiary, J. Aron; it also owned a stake in a major oil refinery in Kansas, where it warehoused the crude it bought and sold. Even though the supply of oil was keeping pace with demand, Murti continually warned of disruptions to the world oil supply, going so far as to broadcast the fact that he owned two hybrid cars. High prices, the bank insisted, were somehow the fault of the piggish American consumer; in 2005, Goldman analysts insisted that we wouldn't know when oil prices would fall until we knew \"when American consumers will stop buying gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and instead seek fuel-efficient alternatives.\"\n\nBut it wasn't the consumption of real oil that was driving up prices \u2014 it was the trade in paper oil. By the summer of 2008, in fact, commodities speculators had bought and stockpiled enough oil futures to fill 1.1 billion barrels of crude, which meant that speculators owned more future oil on paper than there was real, physical oil stored in all of the country's commercial storage tanks and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve combined. It was a repeat of both the Internet craze and the housing bubble, when Wall Street jacked up present-day profits by selling suckers shares of a fictional fantasy future of endlessly rising prices.\n\nIn what was by now a painfully familiar pattern, the oil-commodities melon hit the pavement hard in the summer of 2008, causing a massive loss of wealth; crude prices plunged from $147 to $33. Once again the big losers were ordinary people. The pensioners whose funds invested in this crap got massacred: CalPERS, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, had $1.1 billion in commodities when the crash came. And the damage didn't just come from oil. Soaring food prices driven by the commodities bubble led to catastrophes across the planet, forcing an estimated 100 million people into hunger and sparking food riots throughout the Third World.\n\nNow oil prices are rising again: They shot up 20 percent in the month of May and have nearly doubled so far this year. Once again, the problem is not supply or demand. \"The highest supply of oil in the last 20 years is now,\" says Rep. Bart Stupak, a Democrat from Michigan who serves on the House energy committee. \"Demand is at a 10-year low. And yet prices are up.\"\n\nAsked why politicians continue to harp on things like drilling or hybrid cars, when supply and demand have nothing to do with the high prices, Stupak shakes his head. \"I think they just don't understand the problem very well,\" he says. \"You can't explain it in 30 seconds, so politicians ignore it.\"\n\nBUBBLE #5 Rigging the Bailout\n\nAfter the oil bubble collapsed last fall, there was no new bubble to keep things humming \u2014 this time, the money seems to be really gone, like worldwide-depression gone. So the financial safari has moved elsewhere, and the big game in the hunt has become the only remaining pool of dumb, unguarded capital left to feed upon: taxpayer money. Here, in the biggest bailout in history, is where Goldman Sachs really started to flex its muscle.\n\nIt began in September of last year, when then-Treasury secretary Paulson made a momentous series of decisions. Although he had already engineered a rescue of Bear Stearns a few months before and helped bail out quasi-private lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Paulson elected to let Lehman Brothers \u2014 one of Goldman's last real competitors \u2014 collapse without intervention. (\"Goldman's superhero status was left intact,\" says market analyst Eric Salzman, \"and an investment banking competitor, Lehman, goes away.\") The very next day, Paulson green-lighted a massive, $85 billion bailout of AIG, which promptly turned around and repaid $13 billion it owed to Goldman. Thanks to the rescue effort, the bank ended up getting paid in full for its bad bets: By contrast, retired auto workers awaiting the Chrysler bailout will be lucky to receive 50 cents for every dollar they are owed.\n\nImmediately after the AIG bailout, Paulson announced his federal bailout for the financial industry, a $700 billion plan called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and put a heretofore unknown 35-year-old Goldman banker named Neel Kashkari in charge of administering the funds. In order to qualify for bailout monies, Goldman announced that it would convert from an investment bank to a bank holding company, a move that allows it access not only to $10 billion in TARP funds, but to a whole galaxy of less conspicuous, publicly backed funding \u2014 most notably, lending from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. By the end of March, the Fed will have lent or guaranteed at least $8.7 trillion under a series of new bailout programs \u2014 and thanks to an obscure law allowing the Fed to block most congressional audits, both the amounts and the recipients of the monies remain almost entirely secret.\n\nConverting to a bank-holding company has other benefits as well: Goldman's primary supervisor is now the New York Fed, whose chairman at the time of its announcement was Stephen Friedman, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs. Friedman was technically in violation of Federal Reserve policy by remaining on the board of Goldman even as he was supposedly regulating the bank; in order to rectify the problem, he applied for, and got, a conflict of interest waiver from the government. Friedman was also supposed to divest himself of his Goldman stock after Goldman became a bank holding company, but thanks to the waiver, he was allowed to go out and buy 52,000 additional shares in his old bank, leaving him $3 million richer. Friedman stepped down in May, but the man now in charge of supervising Goldman \u2014 New York Fed president William Dudley \u2014 is yet another former Goldmanite.\n\nThe collective message of all this \u2014 the AIG bailout, the swift approval for its bank holding conversion, the TARP funds \u2014 is that when it comes to Goldman Sachs, there isn't a free market at all. The government might let other players on the market die, but it simply will not allow Goldman to fail under any circumstances. Its edge in the market has suddenly become an open declaration of supreme privilege. \"In the past it was an implicit advantage,\" says Simon Johnson, an economics professor at MIT and former official at the International Monetary Fund, who compares the bailout to the crony capitalism he has seen in Third World countries. \"Now it's more of an explicit advantage.\"\n\nOnce the bailouts were in place, Goldman went right back to business as usual, dreaming up impossibly convoluted schemes to pick the American carcass clean of its loose capital. One of its first moves in the post-bailout era was to quietly push forward the calendar it uses to report its earnings, essentially wiping December 2008 \u2014 with its $1.3 billion in pretax losses \u2014 off the books. At the same time, the bank announced a highly suspicious $1.8 billion profit for the first quarter of 2009 \u2014 which apparently included a large chunk of money funneled to it by taxpayers via the AIG bailout. \"They cooked those first quarter results six ways from Sunday,\" says one hedge fund manager. \"They hid the losses in the orphan month and called the bailout money profit.\"\n\nTwo more numbers stand out from that stunning first-quarter turnaround. The bank paid out an astonishing $4.7 billion in bonuses and compensation in the first three months of this year, an 18 percent increase over the first quarter of 2008. It also raised $5 billion by issuing new shares almost immediately after releasing its first quarter results. Taken together, the numbers show that Goldman essentially borrowed a $5 billion salary payout for its executives in the middle of the global economic crisis it helped cause, using half-baked accounting to reel in investors, just months after receiving billions in a taxpayer bailout.\n\nEven more amazing, Goldman did it all right before the government announced the results of its new \"stress test\" for banks seeking to repay TARP money \u2014 suggesting that Goldman knew exactly what was coming. The government was trying to carefully orchestrate the repayments in an effort to prevent further trouble at banks that couldn't pay back the money right away. But Goldman blew off those concerns, brazenly flaunting its insider status. \"They seemed to know everything that they needed to do before the stress test came out, unlike everyone else, who had to wait until after,\" says Michael Hecht, a managing director of JMP Securities. \"The government came out and said, 'To pay back TARP, you have to issue debt of at least five years that is not insured by FDIC \u2014 which Goldman Sachs had already done, a week or two before.\"\n\nAnd here's the real punch line. After playing an intimate role in four historic bubble catastrophes, after helping $5 trillion in wealth disappear from the NASDAQ, after pawning off thousands of toxic mortgages on pensioners and cities, after helping to drive the price of gas up to $4 a gallon and to push 100 million people around the world into hunger, after securing tens of billions of taxpayer dollars through a series of bailouts overseen by its former CEO, what did Goldman Sachs give back to the people of the United States in 2008?\n\nFourteen million dollars.\n\nThat is what the firm paid in taxes in 2008, an effective tax rate of exactly one, read it, one percent. The bank paid out $10 billion in compensation and benefits that same year and made a profit of more than $2 billion \u2014 yet it paid the Treasury less than a third of what it forked over to CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who made $42.9 million last year.\n\nHow is this possible? According to Goldman's annual report, the low taxes are due in large part to changes in the bank's \"geographic earnings mix.\" In other words, the bank moved its money around so that most of its earnings took place in foreign countries with low tax rates. Thanks to our completely fucked corporate tax system, companies like Goldman can ship their revenues offshore and defer taxes on those revenues indefinitely, even while they claim deductions upfront on that same untaxed income. This is why any corporation with an at least occasionally sober accountant can usually find a way to zero out its taxes. A GAO report, in fact, found that between 1998 and 2005, roughly two-thirds of all corporations operating in the U.S. paid no taxes at all.\n\nThis should be a pitchfork-level outrage \u2014 but somehow, when Goldman released its post-bailout tax profile, hardly anyone said a word. One of the few to remark on the obscenity was Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Texas who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee. \"With the right hand out begging for bailout money,\" he said, \"the left is hiding it offshore.\"\n\nBUBBLE #6 Global Warming\n\nFast-forward to today. It's early June in Washington, D.C. Barack Obama, a popular young politician whose leading private campaign donor was an investment bank called Goldman Sachs \u2014 its employees paid some $981,000 to his campaign \u2014 sits in the White House. Having seamlessly navigated the political minefield of the bailout era, Goldman is once again back to its old business, scouting out loopholes in a new government-created market with the aid of a new set of alumni occupying key government jobs.\n\nGone are Hank Paulson and Neel Kashkari; in their place are Treasury chief of staff Mark Patterson and CFTC chief Gary Gensler, both former Goldmanites. (Gensler was the firm's co-head of finance.) And instead of credit derivatives or oil futures or mortgage-backed CDOs, the new game in town, the next bubble, is in carbon credits \u2014 a booming trillion dollar market that barely even exists yet, but will if the Democratic Party that it gave $4,452,585 to in the last election manages to push into existence a groundbreaking new commodities bubble, disguised as an \"environmental plan,\" called cap-and-trade.\n\nThe new carbon credit market is a virtual repeat of the commodities-market casino that's been kind to Goldman, except it has one delicious new wrinkle: If the plan goes forward as expected, the rise in prices will be government-mandated. Goldman won't even have to rig the game. It will be rigged in advance.\n\nHere's how it works: If the bill passes, there will be limits for coal plants, utilities, natural-gas distributors and numerous other industries on the amount of carbon emissions (a.k.a. greenhouse gases) they can produce per year. If the companies go over their allotment, they will be able to buy \"allocations\" or credits from other companies that have managed to produce fewer emissions. President Obama conservatively estimates that about $646 billion worth of carbon credits will be auctioned in the first seven years; one of his top economic aides speculates that the real number might be twice or even three times that amount.\n\nThe feature of this plan that has special appeal to speculators is that the \"cap\" on carbon will be continually lowered by the government, which means that carbon credits will become more and more scarce with each passing year. Which means that this is a brand new commodities market where the main commodity to be traded is guaranteed to rise in price over time. The volume of this new market will be upwards of a trillion dollars annually; for comparison's sake, the annual combined revenues of all electricity suppliers in the U.S. total $320 billion.\n\nGoldman wants this bill. The plan is (1) to get in on the ground floor of paradigm-shifting legislation, (2) make sure that they're the profit-making slice of that paradigm and (3) make sure the slice is a big slice. Goldman started pushing hard for cap-and-trade long ago, but things really ramped up last year when the firm spent $3.5 million to lobby climate issues. (One of their lobbyists at the time was none other than Patterson, now Treasury chief of staff.) Back in 2005, when Hank Paulson was chief of Goldman, he personally helped author the bank's environmental policy, a document that contains some surprising elements for a firm that in all other areas has been consistently opposed to any sort of government regulation. Paulson's report argued that \"voluntary action alone cannot solve the climate change problem.\" A few years later, the bank's carbon chief, Ken Newcombe, insisted that cap-and-trade alone won't be enough to fix the climate problem and called for further public investments in research and development. Which is convenient, considering that Goldman made early investments in wind power (it bought a subsidiary called Horizon Wind Energy), renewable diesel (it is an investor in a firm called Changing World Technologies) and solar power (it partnered with BP Solar), exactly the kind of deals that will prosper if the government forces energy producers to use cleaner energy. As Paulson said at the time, \"We're not making those investments to lose money.\"\n\nThe bank owns a 10 percent stake in the Chicago Climate Exchange, where the carbon credits will be traded. Moreover, Goldman owns a minority stake in Blue Source LLC, a Utah-based firm that sells carbon credits of the type that will be in great demand if the bill passes. Nobel Prize winner Al Gore, who is intimately involved with the planning of cap-and-trade, started up a company called Generation Investment Management with three former bigwigs from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, David Blood, Mark Ferguson and Peter Harris. Their business? Investing in carbon offsets. There's also a $500 million Green Growth Fund set up by a Goldmanite to invest in green-tech \u2026 the list goes on and on. Goldman is ahead of the headlines again, just waiting for someone to make it rain in the right spot. Will this market be bigger than the energy futures market?\n\n\"Oh, it'll dwarf it,\" says a former staffer on the House energy committee.\n\nWell, you might say, who cares? If cap-and-trade succeeds, won't we all be saved from the catastrophe of global warming? Maybe \u2014 but cap-and-trade, as envisioned by Goldman, is really just a carbon tax structured so that private interests collect the revenues. Instead of simply imposing a fixed government levy on carbon pollution and forcing unclean energy producers to pay for the mess they make, cap-and-trade will allow a small tribe of greedy-as-hell Wall Street swine to turn yet another commodities market into a private tax collection scheme. This is worse than the bailout: It allows the bank to seize taxpayer money before it's even collected.\n\n\"If it's going to be a tax, I would prefer that Washington set the tax and collect it,\" says Michael Masters, the hedge fund director who spoke out against oil futures speculation. \"But we're saying that Wall Street can set the tax, and Wall Street can collect the tax. That's the last thing in the world I want. It's just asinine.\"\n\nCap-and-trade is going to happen. Or, if it doesn't, something like it will. The moral is the same as for all the other bubbles that Goldman helped create, from 1929 to 2009. In almost every case, the very same bank that behaved recklessly for years, weighing down the system with toxic loans and predatory debt, and accomplishing nothing but massive bonuses for a few bosses, has been rewarded with mountains of virtually free money and government guarantees \u2014 while the actual victims in this mess, ordinary taxpayers, are the ones paying for it.\n\nIt's not always easy to accept the reality of what we now routinely allow these people to get away with; there's a kind of collective denial that kicks in when a country goes through what America has gone through lately, when a people lose as much prestige and status as we have in the past few years. You can't really register the fact that you're no longer a citizen of a thriving first-world democracy, that you're no longer above getting robbed in broad daylight, because like an amputee, you can still sort of feel things that are no longer there.\n\nBut this is it. This is the world we live in now. And in this world, some of us have to play by the rules, while others get a note from the principal excusing them from homework till the end of time, plus 10 billion free dollars in a paper bag to buy lunch. It's a gangster state, running on gangster economics, and even prices can't be trusted anymore; there are hidden taxes in every buck you pay. And maybe we can't stop it, but we should at least know where it's all going.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1459497", "artist_names": "Fats Domino",

Torok", "lyrics": "Caribbean LyricsHave you ever been down to Haiti\nWhen the summer sun was sinkin' low\nThere's nothing but romance just everwhere you glance\nAnd the native hearts are all aglow\n\nBut when the Cuban Queen comes upon the scene\nThey all stare like a statue out of stone\nWhen they realize what's before their eyes\nThe other girls are left all alone\n\nDown in the Caribbean it's not a dream you're seein'\nWhen you get a glimpse of the lady with the charm\nAnd from miles away you can see her sway\nTo the beat of the Cuban Conga line that forms\nUp in a tree so high way up in the sky\nSits a wide eyed monkey on a limb\nHe wonders why the people go to so much trouble\nJust to try to be like him\n\nHe doesn't understand that it's a lady's hand\nThat makes a heart feel so sublime\nAnd before too long he starts singing the song\nAnd then he gets in the Conga line\n\nColumbus searched for spices but he missed the nicest\nPart of the Caribbean\nHe didn't see the charms and the open arms\nIt was the gold that he was seein'\n\nBut I'm glad he missed the sweetest thing I've kissed\n'Cause we're on our honeymoon\nI'm so sorry Chris to talk about you like this\nBut you were five hundred years too soon\n\nDown in the Caribbean...You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/854878", "artist_names": "Brook

For example, I don\u2019t disagree with Mr. Burford that the inequality suffered by the American Negro population of the United States has hindered the American dream. Indeed, it has. I quarrell with some other things he has to say. The other, deeper, element of a certain awkwardness I feel has to do with one\u2019s point of view. I have to put it that way \u2013 one\u2019s sense, one\u2019s system of reality. It would seem to me the proposition before the House, and I would put it that way, is the American Dream at the expense of the American Negro, or the American Dream *is* at the expense of the American Negro. Is the question hideously loaded, and then one\u2019s response to that question \u2013 one\u2019s reaction to that question \u2013 has to depend on effect and, in effect, where you find yourself in the world, what your sense of reality is, what your system of reality is. That is, it depends on assumptions which we hold so deeply so as to be scarcely aware of them.\nAre white South African or Mississippi sharecropper, or Mississippi sheriff, or a Frenchman driven out of Algeria, all have, at bottom, a system of reality which compels them to, for example, in the case of the French exile from Algeria, to offend French reasons from having ruled Algeria. The Mississippi or Alabama sheriff, who really does believe, when he\u2019s facing a Negro boy or girl, that this woman, this man, this child must be insane to attack the system to which he owes his entire identity. Of course, to such a person, the proposition which we are trying to discuss here tonight does not exist. And on the other hand, I, have to speak as one of the people who\u2019ve been most attacked by what we now must here call the Western or European system of reality. What white people in the world, what we call white supremacy \u2013 I hate to say it here \u2013 comes from Europe. It\u2019s how it got to America. Beneath then, whatever one\u2019s reaction to this proposition is, has to be the question of whether or not civilizations can be considered, as such, equal, or whether one\u2019s civilization has the right to overtake and subjugate, and, in fact, to destroy another. Now, what happens when that happens. Leaving aside all the physical facts that one can quote. Leaving aside, rape or murder. Leaving aside the bloody catalog of oppression, which we are in one way too familiar with already, what this does to the subjugated, the most private, the most serious thing this does to the subjugated, is to destroy his sense of reality. It destroys, for example, his father\u2019s authority over him. His father can no longer tell him anything, because the past has disappeared, and his father has no power in the world. This means, in the case of an American Negro, born in that glittering republic, and the moment you are born, since you don\u2019t know any better, every stick and stone and every face is white.\n\nAnd since you have not yet seen a mirror, you suppose that you are, too. It comes as a great shock around the age of 5, or 6, or 7, to discover that the flag to which you have pledged allegiance, along with everybody else, has not pledged allegiance to you. It comes as a great shock to discover that Gary Cooper killing off the Indians, when you were rooting for Gary Cooper, that the Indians were you. It comes as a great shock to discover that the country which is your birthplace and to which you owe your life and your identity, has not, in its whole system of reality, evovled any place for you. The disaffection, the demoralization, and the gap between one person and another only on the basis of the color of their skin, begins there and accelerates \u2013 accelerates throughout a whole lifetime \u2013 to the present when you realize you\u2019re thirty and are having a terrible time managing to trust your countrymen. By the time you are thirty, you have been through a certain kind of mill. And the most serious effect of the mill you\u2019ve been through is, again, not the catalog of disaster, the policemen, the taxi drivers, the waiters, the landlady, the landlord, the banks, the insurance companies, the millions of details, twenty four hours of every day, which spell out to you that you are a worthless human being. It is not that. It\u2019s by that time that you\u2019ve begun to see it happening, in your daughter or your son, or your niece or your nephew.\n\nYou are thirty by now and nothing you have done has helped to escape the trap. But what is worse than that, is that nothing you have done, and as far as you can tell, nothing you can do, will save your son or your daughter from meeting the same disaster and not impossibly coming to the same end. Now, we\u2019re speaking about expense. I suppose there are several ways to address oneself, to some attempt to find what that word means here. Let me put it this way, that from a very literal point of view, the harbors and the ports, and the railroads of the country\u2013the economy, especially of the Southern states\u2013could not conceivably be what it has become, if they had not had, and do not still have, indeed for so long, for many generations, cheap labor. I am stating very seriously, and this is not an overstatement: *I* picked the cotton, *I* carried it to the market, and *I* built the railroads under someone else\u2019s whip for nothing. For nothing.\nThe Southern oligarchy, which has still today so very much power in Washington, and therefore some power in the world, was created by my labor and my sweat, and the violation of my women and the murder of my children. This, in the land of the free, and the home of the brave. And no one can challenge that statement. It is a matter of historical record.\nIn another way, this dream, and we\u2019ll get to the dream in a moment, is at the expense of the American Negro. You watched this in the Deep South in great relief. But not only in the Deep South. In the Deep South, you are dealing with a sheriff or a landlord, or a landlady or a girl of the Western Union desk, and she doesn\u2019t know quite who she\u2019s dealing with, by which I mean, that if you\u2019re not a part of the town, and if you are a Nothern Nigger, it shows in millions of ways. So she simply knows that it\u2019s an unknown quantity, and she wants to have nothing to do with it because she won\u2019t talk to you, you have to wait for a while to get your telegram. OK, we all know this. We\u2019ve all been through it and, by the time you get to be a man, it\u2019s very easy to deal with. But what is happening in the poor woman, the poor man\u2019s mind is this: they\u2019ve been raised to believe, and by now they helplessly believe, that no matter how terrible their lives may be, and their lives have been quite terrible, and no matter how far they fall, no matter what disaster overtakes them, they have one enormous knowledge in consolation, which is like a heavenly revelation: at least, they are not Black.\n\nNow, I suggest that of all the terrible things that can happen to a human being, that is one of the worst. I suggest that what has happened to white Southerners is in some ways, after all, much worse than what has happened to Negroes there because Sheriff Clark in Selma, Alabama, cannot be considered \u2013 you know, no one can be dismissed as a total monster. I\u2019m sure he loves his wife, his children. I\u2019m sure, you know, he likes to get drunk. You know, after all, one\u2019s got to assume he is visibly a man like me. But he doesn\u2019t know what drives him to use the club, to menace with the gun and to use the cattle prod. Something awful must have happened to a human being to be able to put a cattle prod against a woman\u2019s breasts, for example. What happens to the woman is ghastly. What happens to the man who does it is in some ways much, much worse. This is being done, after all, not a hundred years ago, but in 1965, in a country which is blessed with what we call prosperity, a word we won\u2019t examine too closely; with a certain kind of social coherence, which calls itself a civilized nation, and which espouses the notion of the freedom of the world. And it is perfectly true from the point of view now simply of an American Negro. Any American Negro watching this, no matter where he is, from the vantage point of Harlem, which is another terrible place, has to say to himself, in spite of what the government says \u2013 the government says we can\u2019t do anything about it \u2013 but if those were white people being murdered in Mississippi work farms, being carried off to jail, if those were white children running up and down the streets, the government would find some way of doing something about it. We have a civil rights bill now where an amendment, the fifteenth amendment, nearly a hundred years ago \u2013 I hate to sound again like an Old Testament prophet \u2013 but if the amendment was not honored then, I would have any reason to believe in the civil rights bill will be honored now. And after all one\u2019s been there, since before, you know, a lot of other people got there. If one has got to prove one\u2019s title to the land, isn\u2019t four hundred years enough? Four hundred years? At least three wars? The American soil is full of the corpses of my ancestors. Why is my freedom or my citizenship, or my right to live there, how is it conceivably a question now? And I suggest further, and in the same way, the moral life of Alabama sheriffs and poor Alabama ladies \u2013 white ladies \u2013 their moral lives have been destroyed by the plague called color, that the American sense of reality has been corrupted by it.\n\nAt the risk of sounding excessive, what I always felt, when I finally left the country, and found myself abroad, in other places, and watched the Americans abroad \u2013 and these are my countrymen \u2013 and I do care about them, and even if I didn\u2019t, there is something between us. We have the same shorthand, I know, if I look at a boy or a girl from Tennessee, where they came from in Tennessee and what that means. No Englishman knows that. No Frenchman, no one in the world knows that, except another Black man who comes from the same place. One watches these lonely people denying the only kin they have. We talk about integration in America as though it was some great new conundrum. The problem in America is that we\u2019ve been integrated for a very long time. Put me next to any African and you will see what I mean. My grandmother was not a rapist. What we are not facing is the result of what we\u2019ve done. What one brings the American people to do for all our sakes is simply to accept our history. I was there not only as a slave, but also as a concubine. One knows the power, after all, which can be used against another person if you\u2019ve got absolute power over that person.\n\nIt seemed to me when I watched Americans in Europe what they didn\u2019t know about Europeans was what they didn\u2019t know about me. They weren\u2019t trying, for example, to be nasty to the French girl, or rude to the French waiter. They didn\u2019t know they hurt their feelings. They didn\u2019t have any sense this particular woman, this particular man, though they spoke another language and had different manners and ways, was a human being. And they walked over them, the same kind of bland ignorance, condescension, charming and cheerful with which they\u2019ve always pat me on the head and called me Shine and were upset when I was upset. What is relevant about this is that whereas forty years ago when I was born, the question of having to deal with what is unspoken by the subjugated, what is never said to the master, of ever having to deal with this reality was a very remote possibility. It was in no one\u2019s mind. When I was growing up, I was taught in American history books, that Africa had no history, and neither did I. That I was a savage about whom the less said, the better, who had been saved by Europe and brought to America. And, of course, I believed it. I didn\u2019t have much choice. Those were the only books there were. Everyone else seemed to agree.\n\nIf you walk out of Harlem, ride out of Harlem, downtown, the world agrees what you see is much bigger, cleaner, whiter, richer, safer than where you are. They collect the garbage. People obviously can pay their life insurance. Their children look happy, safe. You\u2019re not. And you go back home, and it would seem that, of course, that it\u2019s an act of God that this is true! That you belong where white people have put you.\n\nIt is only since the Second World War that there\u2019s been a counter-image in the world. And that image did not come about through any legislation or part of any American government, but through the fact that Africa was suddenly on the stage of the world, and Africans had to be dealt with in a way they\u2019d never been dealt with before. This gave an American Negro for the first time a sense of himself beyond the savage or a clown. It has created and will create a great many conundrums. One of the great things that the white world does not know, but I think I do know, is that Black people are just like everybody else. One has used the myth of Negro and the myth of color to pretend and to assume that you were dealing with, essentially, with something exotic, bizarre, and practically, according to human laws, unknown. Alas, it is not true. We\u2019re also mercenaries, dictators, murderers, liars. We are human too.\n\nWhat is crucial here is that unless we can manage to accept, establish some kind of dialog between those people whom I pretend have paid for the American dream and those other people who have not achieved it, we will be in terrible trouble. I want to say, at the end, the last, is that that is what concerns me most. We are sitting in this room, and we are all, at least I\u2019d like to think we are, relatively civilized, and we can talk to each other at least on certain levels so that we could walk out of here assuming that the measure of our enlightenment, or at least, our politeness, has some effect on the world. It may not.\n\nI remember, for example, when the ex Attorney General, Mr. Robert Kennedy, said that it was conceivable that in forty years, in America, we might have a Negro president. That sounded like a very emancipated statement, I suppose, to white people. They were not in Harlem when this statement was first heard. And they\u2019re not here, and possibly will never hear the laughter and the bitterness, and the scorn with which this statement was greeted. From the point of view of the man in the Harlem barber shop, Bobby Kennedy only got here yesterday, and he\u2019s already on his way to the presidency. We\u2019ve been here for four hundred years and now he tells us that maybe in forty years, if you\u2019re good, we may let you become president.\nWhat is dangerous here is the turning away from \u2013 the turning away  from \u2013 anything any white American says. The reason for the political hesitation, in spite of the Johnson landslide is that one has been betrayed by American politicians for so long. And I am a grown man and perhaps I can be reasoned with. I certainly hope I can be. But I don\u2019t know, and neither does Martin Luther King, none of us know how to deal with those other people whom the white world has so long ignored, who don\u2019t believe anything the white world says and don\u2019t entirely believe anything I or Martin is saying. And one can\u2019t blame them. You watch what has happened to them in less than twenty years.\n\nIt seems to me that the City of New York, for example \u2013 this is my last point \u2013 It\u2019s had Negroes in it for a very long time. If the city of New York were able, as it has indeed been able, in the last fifteen years to reconstruct itself, tear down buildings and raise great new ones, downtown and for money, and has done nothing whatever except build housing projects in the ghetto for the Negroes. And of course, Negroes hate it. Presently the property does indeed deteriorate because the children cannot bear it. They want to get out of the ghetto. If the American pretensions were based on more solid, a more honest assessment of life and of themselves, it would not mean for Negroes when someone says \u201cUrban Renewal\u201d that Negroes can simply are going to be thrown out into the streets. This is just what it does mean now. This is not an act of God. We\u2019re dealing with a society made and ruled by men. Had the American Negro had not been present in America, I am convinced the history of the American labor movement would be much more edifying than it is. It is a terrible thing for an entire people to surrender to the notion that one-ninth of its population is beneath them. And until that moment, until the moment comes when we, the Americans, we, the American people, are able to accept the fact, that I have to accept, for example, that my ancestors are both white and Black. That on that continent we are trying to forge a new identity for which we need each other and that I am not a ward of America. I am not an object of missionary charity. I am one of the people who built the country\u2013until this moment there is scarcely any hope for the American dream, because the people who are denied participation in it, by their very presence, will wreck it. And if that happens it is a very grave moment for the West.\n\nThank you.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1758551", "artist_names": "Kathy Linden", "full_title":
