You wasn't cool unless you had a 1957 Chevrolet, with pipes and a foxtail hanging from your radio antenna, out of sight mudflaps, have mercy. And most of all, the cats had something written on the side of the door, for all of the girls just to dig. Usually, you would see something on it like \"Sweet Daddy,\" have mercy. What I had on mine was \"Daddy Whipped Cr\u0435am.\" Whoa-oh-oh-oh. I've seen 'em all. I've been on th\u0435 stage with some of the greatest. Cats like Jimmy Clanton, the magnificent Bobby Darin, Fabian, Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed, and the incomparable John Lee Hooker. Whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, my, my, my, my, my, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, baby, baby, baby. I've seen 'em all. Elvis Presley, Sarah Vaughn, and the great Dinah Washington, Brook Benton, and my man, out of sight cat, Ray Charles. James Brown and the Famous Flames. Whoa-oh. Hank Ballard and the Midnighters, Chubby Checker, yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah. Baby, you know I've seen 'em all. Whoa, now, baby, baby, whoa-oh. I'm here to tell you 'bout it, yeah. If you don't think I know what I'm talking about, go home and ask your big brother or your big sister, have mercy. Better and still, go home and ask mom and dad about it, they might tell you the truth, ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah, I've seen 'em all. Woo, woo, woo, ooh-ooh-ooh. Before I step back, I gotta tell you about this: In 1958, going back to the Brooklyn Fox Theater, and the Paramount, have mercy, I remember the time when the kids used to come in to see the show and they'd bring their lunch, because they didn't go to school. The school officials used to send out the truant officer to get 'em \u2014 he end up bringing his lunch, too. 'Cause we was in there sockin' it to 'em.

If you met on the binge a poor acheseyeld from Ailing, when the tune of his tremble shook shimmy on shin, while his countrary raged in the weak of his wailing, like a rugilant pugi-lant Lyon O\u2019Lynn; if he maundered in misliness, plaining his plight or, played fox and lice, pricking and dropping hips teeth, or wringing his handcuffs for peace, the blind blighter, praying Dieuf and Domb Nostrums foh thomethinks to eath; if he weapt while he leapt and guffalled quith a quhimper, made cold blood a blue mundy and no bones without flech, taking kiss, kake or kick with a suck, sigh or simper, a diffle to larn and a dibble to lech; if the fain shinner pegged you to shave his immartial, wee skillmustered shoul with his ooh, hoodoodoo! brok \u2014 ing wind that to wiles, woemaid sin he was partial, we don\u2019t think, Jones, we\u2019d care to this evening, would you?\n\nAnswer: No, blank ye! So you think I have impulsivism? Did they tell you I am one of the fortysixths? And I suppose you heard I had a wag on my ears? And I suppose they told you too that my roll of life is not natural? But before proceeding to conclusively confute this begging question it would be far fitter for you, if you dare! to hasitate to consult with and consequentially attempt at my disposale of the same dime-cash problem elsewhere naturalistically of course, from the blinkpoint of so eminent a spatialist. From it you will here notice, Schott, upon my for the first remarking you that the sophology of Bitchson while driven as under by a purely dime-dime urge is not without his cashcash characktericksticks, borrowed for its nonce ends from the fiery goodmother Miss Fortune (who the lost time we had the pleasure we have had our little recherch\u201a brush with, what, Schott?) and as I further could have told you as brisk as your D.B.C. beha-viouristically paillet\u201a with a coat of homoid icing which is in reality only a done by chance ridiculisation of the whoo-whoo and where\u2019s hairs theorics of Winestain. To put it all the more plumbsily. The speechform is a mere sorrogate. Whilst the qua-lity and tality (I shall explex what you ought to mean by this with its proper when and where and why and how in the subsequent sentence) are alternativomentally harrogate and arrogate, as the gates may be.\n\nTalis is a word often abused by many passims (I am working out a quantum theory about it for it is really most tantumising state of affairs). A pessim may frequent you to say: Have you been seeing much of Talis and Talis those times? optimately meaning: Will you put up at hree of irish? Or a ladyeater may perhaps have casualised as you temptoed her \u2026 la sourdine: Of your plates? Is Talis de Talis, the swordswallower, who is on at the Craterium the same Talis von Talis, the penscrusher, no funk you! who runs his duly mile? Or this is a perhaps cleaner example. At a recent postvortex piece infustigation of a determinised case of chronic spinosis an extension lecturer on The Ague who out of matter of form was trying his seesers, Dr\u2019s Het Ubeleeft, borrowed the question: Why\u2019s which Suchman\u2019s talis qualis? to whom, as a fatter of macht, Dr Gedankje of Stoutgirth, who was wiping his whistle, toarsely retoarted: While thou beast\u2019 one zoom of a whorl!

I need not anthrapologise for any obintentional (I must here correct all that school of neoitalian or paleoparisien schola of tinkers and spanglers who say I\u2019m wrong parcequeue out of revolscian from romanitis I want to be) down-trodding on my foes.

When Mullocky won the couple of colds, when we were stripping in number three, I would like the neat drop that would malt in my mouth but I fail to see when (I am purposely refraining from expounding the obvious fallacy as to the specific gravitates of the two deglutables implied nor to the lapses lequou asousiated with the royal gorge through students of mixed hydrostatics and pneumodipsics will after some difficulties grapple away with my meinungs).

Dr\u2019s showings, the plea, if he pleads, is all posh and robbage on a melodeontic scale since his man\u2019s when is no otherman\u2019s quandour (Mine, dank you?) while, \u2014 for aught I care for the contrary, the all is where in love as war and the plane where me arts soar you\u2019d aisy rouse a thunder from and where I cling true\u2019tis there I climb tree and where Innocent looks best (pick!) there\u2019s holly in his ives.\n\nAs my explanations here are probably above your understand-ings, lattlebrattons, though as augmentatively uncomparisoned as Cadwan, Cadwallon and Cadwalloner, I shall revert to a more expletive method which I frequently use when I have to sermo with muddlecrass pupils. Imagine for my purpose that you are a squad of urchins, snifflynosed, goslingnecked, clothyheaded, tangled in your lacings, tingled in your pants, etsitaraw etcicero. And you, Bruno Nowlan, take your tongue out of your inkpot! As none of you knows javanese I will give all my easyfree trans-lation of the old fabulist\u2019s parable. Allaboy Minor, take your head out of your satchel! Audi, Joe Peters! Exaudi facts!\n\nThe Mookse and The Gripes.\n\nGentes and laitymen, fullstoppers and semicolonials, hybreds and lubberds!\n\nEins within a space and a wearywide space it wast ere wohned a Mookse. The onesomeness wast alltolonely, archunsitslike, broady oval, and a Mookse he would a walking go (My hood! cries Antony Romeo), so one grandsumer evening, after a great morning and his good supper of gammon and spittish, having flabelled his eyes, pilleoled his nostrils, vacticanated his ears and palliumed his throats, he put on his impermeable, seized his impugnable, harped on his crown and stepped out of his immobile De Rure Albo (socolled becauld it was chalkfull of masterplasters and had borgeously letout gardens strown with cascadas, pinta-costecas, horthoducts and currycombs) and set off from Luds \u2014 town a spasso to see how badness was badness in the weirdest of all pensible ways.\n\nAs he set off with his father\u2019s sword, his lancia spezzata, he was girded on, and with that between his legs and his tarkeels, our once in only Bragspear, he clanked, to my clinking, from veetoes to threetop, every inch of an immortal.\n\nHe had not walked over a pentiadpair of parsecs from his azylium when at the turning of the Shinshone Lanteran near Saint Bowery\u2019s-without-his-Walls he came (secunding to the one one oneth of the propecies, Amnis Limina Permanent) upon the most unconsciously boggylooking stream he ever locked his eyes with. Out of the colliens it took a rise by daubing itself Ni-non. It looked little and it smelt of brown and it thought in nar \u2014 rows and it talked showshallow. And as it rinn it dribbled like any lively purliteasy: My, my, my! Me and me! Little down dream don\u2019t I love thee!\nAnd, I declare, what was there on the yonder bank of the stream that would be a river, parched on a limb of the olum, bolt downright, but the Gripes? And no doubt he was fit to be dried for why had he not been having the juice of his times?\n\nHis pips had been neatly all drowned on him; his polps were charging odours every older minute; he was quickly for getting the dresser\u2019s desdaign on the flyleaf of his frons; and he was quietly for giving the bailiff\u2019s distrain on to the bulkside of his cul de Pompe. In all his specious heavings, as be lived by Opti-mus Maximus, the Mookse had never seen his Dubville brooder \u2014 on-low so nigh to a pickle.\nAdrian (that was the Mookse now\u2019s assumptinome) stuccstill phiz-\u2026-phiz to the Gripes in an accessit of aurignacian.

Bellua Triumphanes, his everyway addedto wallat\u2019s collectium, for yea longer he lieved yea broader he betaught of it, the fetter, the summe and the haul it cost, he looked the first and last micahlike laicness of Quartus the Fifth and Quintus the Sixth and Sixtus the Seventh giving allnight sitting to Lio the Faultyfindth.\n\n\u2014 Good appetite us, sir Mookse! How do you do it? cheeped the Gripes in a wherry whiggy maudelenian woice and the jack- asses all within bawl laughed and brayed for his intentions for they knew their sly toad lowry now. I am rarumominum blessed to see you, my dear mouster. Will you not perhopes tell me everything if you are pleased, sanity? All about aulne and lithial and allsall allinall about awn and liseias?

By the watch, what is the time, pace?\n\nFigure it! The pining peever! To a Mookse!\n\n\u2014 Ask my index, mund my achilles, swell my obolum, wosh-up my nase serene, answered the Mookse, rapidly by turning clement, urban, eugenious and celestian in the formose of good grogory humours. Quote awhore? That is quite about what I came on my missions with my intentions laudibiliter to settle with you, barbarousse. Let thor be orlog. Let Pauline be Irene. Let you be Beeton.

How she was brightened when Should-rups in his glaubering hochskied his welkinstuck and how she was overclused when Kneesknobs on his zwivvel was makeacting such a paulse of himshelp! She was alone. All her nubied companions were asleeping with the squirrels. Their mivver, Mrs Moonan, was off in the Fuerst quarter scrubbing the back-steps of Number 28. Fuvver, that Skand, he was up in Norwood\u2019s sokaparlour, eating oceans of Voking\u2019s Blemish. Nuvoletta lis-tened as she reflected herself, though the heavenly one with his constellatria and his emanations stood between, and she tried all she tried to make the Mookse look up at her (but he was fore too adiaptotously farseeing) and to make the Gripes hear how coy she could be (though he was much too schystimatically auricular about his ens to heed her) but it was all mild\u2019s vapour moist. Not even her feignt reflection, Nuvoluccia, could they toke their gnoses off for their minds with intrepifide fate and bungless curiasity, were conclaved with Heliogobbleus and Commodus and Enobarbarus and whatever the coordinal dickens they did as their damprauch of papyrs and buchstubs said. As if that was their spiration! As if theirs could duiparate her queendim! As if she would be third perty to search on search proceedings! She tried all the winsome wonsome ways her four winds had taught her. She tossed her sfumastelliacinous hair like le princesse de la Petite Bretagne and she rounded her mignons arms like Mrs Cornwallis\u2013West and she smiled over herself like the beauty of the image of the pose of the daughter of the queen of the Em-perour of Irelande and she sighed after herself as were she born to bride with Tristis Tristior Tristissimus. But, sweet madonine, she might fair as well have carried her daisy\u2019s worth to Florida. For the Mookse, a dogmad Accanite, were not amoosed and the Gripes, a dubliboused Catalick, wis pinefully obliviscent.\n\nI see, she sighed. There are menner.\n\nThe siss of the whisp of the sigh of the softzing at the stir of the ver grose O arundo of a long one in midias reeds: and shades began to glidder along the banks, greepsing, greepsing, duusk unto duusk, and it was as glooming as gloaming could be in the waste of all peacable worlds. Metamnisia was allsoonome coloro-form brune; citherior spiane an eaulande, innemorous and un numerose. The Mookse had a sound eyes right but he could not all hear. The Gripes had light ears left yet he could but ill see. He ceased. And he ceased, tung and trit, and it was neversoever so dusk of both of them. But still Moo thought on the deeps of the undths he would profoundth come the morrokse and still Gri feeled of the scripes he would escipe if by grice he had luck enoupes.\n\nOh, how it was duusk! From Vallee Maraia to Grasyaplaina, dormimust echo! Ah dew! Ah dew! It was so duusk that the tears of night began to fall, first by ones and twos, then by threes and fours, at last by fives and sixes of sevens, for the tired ones were wecking, as we weep now with them. O! O! O! Par la pluie!\n\nThen there came down to the thither bank a woman of no appearance (I believe she was a Black with chills at her feet) and she gathered up his hoariness the Mookse motamourfully where he was spread and carried him away to her invisible dwelling, thats hights, Aquila Rapax, for he was the holy sacred solem and poshup spit of her boshop\u2019s apron. So you see the Mookse he had reason as I knew and you knew and he knew all along. And there came down to the hither bank a woman to all important (though they say that she was comely, spite the cold in her heed) and, for he was as like it as blow it to a hawker\u2019s hank, she plucked down the Gripes, torn panicky autotone, in angeu from his limb and cariad away its beotitubes with her to her unseen shieling, it is, De Rore Coeli. And so the poor Gripes got wrong; for that is always how a Gripes is, always was and always will.be. And it was never so thoughtful of either of them. And there were left now an only elmtree and but a stone. Polled with pietrous, Sierre but saule. O! Yes! And Nuvoletta, a lass.\n\nThen Nuvoletta reflected for the last time in her little long life and she made up all her myriads of drifting minds in one. She cancelled all her engauzements. She climbed over the bannistars; she gave a childy cloudy cry: Nu\u201ae! Nu\u201ae! A lightdress fluttered. She was gone. And into the river that had been a stream (for a thousand of tears had gone eon her and come on her and she was stout and struck on dancing and her muddied name was Missis-liffi) there fell a tear, a singult tear, the loveliest of all tears (I mean for those crylove fables fans who are \u2018keen\u2019 on the pretty-pretty commonface sort of thing you meet by hopeharrods) for it was a leaptear. But the river tripped on her by and by, lapping as though her heart was brook: Why, why, why! Weh, O weh I\u2019se so silly to be flowing but I no canna stay!\n\nNo applause, please! Bast! The romescot nattleshaker will go round your circulation in diu dursus.\n\nAllaboy, Major, I\u2019ll take your reactions in another place after themes. Nolan Browne, you may now leave the classroom.

I could love that man like my own ambo for being so baileycliaver though he\u2019s a nawful curillass and I must slav to methodiousness.

The seemsame home and histry seeks and hidepence which we used to be reading for our prepurgatory, hot, Schott? till Duddy shut the shopper op and Mutti, poor Mutti! brought us our poor suppy, (ah who! eh how!) in Acetius and Oleosus and Sellius Volatilis and Petrus Papricus!

Nex quovis burro num fit mercaseus? I am not hereby giving my final endorsement to the learned ignorants of the Cusanus philosophism in which old Nicholas pegs it down that the smarter the spin of the top the sounder the span of the buttom (what the worthy old auberginiste ought to have meant was: the more stolidly immobile in space appears to me the bottom which is presented to use in time by the top primo-mobilisk &c.). And I shall be misunderstord if understood to give an unconditional sinequam to the heroicised furibouts of the Nolanus theory, or, at any rate, of that substrate of apart from hissheory where the Theophil swoors that on principial he was the pointing start of his odiose by comparison and that whiles eggs will fall cheapened all over the walled the Bure will be dear on the Brie.\n\nNow, while I am not out now to be taken up as unintention-ally recommending the Silkebjorg tyrondynamon machine for the more economical helixtrolysis of these amboadipates until I can find space to look into it myself a little more closely first I shall go on with my decisions after having shown to you in good time how both products of our social stomach (the excellent Dr Burroman, I noticed by the way from his emended food theory, has been carefully digesting the very wholesome criticism I helped him to in my princeps edition which is all so munch to the cud) are mutuearly polarised the incompatabilily of any delusional acting as ambivalent to the fixation of his pivotism. Positing, as above, too males pooles, the one the pictor of the other and the omber the Skotia of the one, and looking want-ingly around our undistributed middle between males we feel we must waistfully woent a female to focus and on this stage there pleasantly appears the cowrymaid M. whom we shall often meet below who introduces herself upon us at some precise hour which we shall again agree to call absolute zero or the babbling pumpt of platinism. And so like that former son of a kish who went up and out to found his farmer\u2019s ashes we come down home gently on our own turnedabout asses to meet Margareen.\n\nWe now romp through a period of pure lyricism of shame-bred music (technologically, let me say, the appetising entry of this subject on a fool chest of vialds is plumply pudding the carp before doevre hors) evidenced by such words in distress as I cream for thee, Sweet Margareen, and the more hopeful O Mar-gareena! O Margareena! Still in the bowl is left a lump of gold! (Correspondents, by the way, will keep on asking me what is the correct garnish to serve drisheens with. Tansy Sauce. Enough). The pawnbreaking pathos of the first of these shoddy pieces reveals it as a Caseous effort. Burrus\u2019s bit is often used for a toast. Criniculture can tell us very precisely indeed how and why this particular streak of yellow silver first appeared on (not in) the bowel, that is to see, the human head, bald, black, bronze, brown, brindled, betteraved or blanchemanged where it might be use-fully compared with an earwig on a fullbottom. I am offering this to Signorina Cuticura and I intend to take it up and bring it under the nosetice of Herr Harlene by way of diverting his attentions. Of course the unskilled singer continues to pervert our wiser ears by subordinating the space-element, that is to sing, the aria, to the time-factor, which ought to be killed, ill tempor. I should advise any unborn singer who may still be among my heeders to forget her temporal diaphragm at home (the best thing that could happen to it!) and attack the roulade with a swift colpo di glottide to the lug (though Maace I will insist was reclined from overdoing this, his recovery often being slow) and then, O! on the third dead beat, O! to cluse her eyes and aiopen her oath and see what spice I may send her. How? Cease thee, cantatrickee! I fain would be solo. Arouse thee, my valour! And save for e\u2019er my true Bdur!\n\nI shall have a word to say in a few yards about the acoustic and orchidectural management of the tonehall but, as ours is a vivarious where one plant\u2019s breaf is a lunger planner\u2019s byscent and you may not care for argon, it will be very convenient for me for the emolument to pursue Burrus and Caseous for a rung or two up their isocelating biangle. Every admirer has seen my goulache of Marge (she is so like the sister, you don\u2019t know, and they both dress A L I K E!) which I titled The Very Picture of a Needlesswoman which in the presence ornates our national cruetstand. This genre of portraiture of changes of mind in order to be truly torse should evoke the bush soul of females so I am leaving it to the experienced victim to complete the general suggestion by the mental addition of a wallopy bound or, should the zulugical zealot prefer it, a congorool teal. The hatboxes which composed Rhomba, lady Trabezond (Marge in her ex-celsis), also comprised the climactogram up which B and C may fondly be imagined ascending and are suggestive of gentlemen\u2019s spring modes, these modes carrying us back to the superimposed claylayers of eocene and pleastoseen formation and the gradual morphological changes in our body politic which Professor Ebahi\u2013Ahuri of Philadespoinis (Ill) \u2014 whose bluebutterbust I have just given his coupe de grass to \u2014 neatly names a bo\u0152te \u2026 surprises. The boxes, if I may break the subject gently, are worth about fourpence pourbox but I am inventing a more patent pro-cess, foolproof and pryperfect (I should like to ask that Shedlock Homes person who is out for removing the roofs of our criminal classics by what deductio ad domunum he hopes de tacto to detect anything unless he happens of himself, movibile tectu, to have a slade off) after which they can be reduced to a fragment of their true crust by even the youngest of Margees if she will take plase to be seated and smile if I please.\n\nNow there can be no question about it either that I having done as much, have quite got the size of that demilitery young female (we will continue to call her Marge) whose types may be met with in any public garden, wearing a very \u201cdressy\u201d affair, known as an \u201cethel\u201d of instep length and with a real fur, reduced to 3/9, and muffin cap to tone (they are \u201cangelskin\u201d this fall), ostentatiously hemming apologetically over the shirtness of some \u201csweet\u201d garment, when she is not sitting on all the free benches avidously reading about \u201cit\u201d but ovidently on the look out for \u201chim\u201d or so \u201cthrilled\u201d about the best dressed dolly pram and beautiful elbow competition or at the movies swallowing sobs and blowing bixed mixcuits over \u201cchilde\u201d chaplain\u2019s \u201clatest\u201d or on the verge of the gutter with some bobbedhair brieffrocked babyma\u2019s toddler (the Smythe\u2013Smythes now keep TWO domes-tics and aspire to THREE male ones, a shover, a butlegger and a sectary) held hostage at armslength, teaching His Infant Majesty how to make waters worse.\n\n(I am closely watching Master Pules, as I have regions to sus-pect from my post that her \u201clitde man\u201d is a secondary school \u2014 teacher under the boards of education, a voted disciple of Infan \u2014 tulus who is being utilised thus publicly by the seducente infanta to conceal her own more mascular personality by flaunting frivolish finery over men\u2019s inside clothes, for the femininny of that totamulier will always lack the musculink of a verumvirum. My solotions for the proper parturience of matres and the edu-cation of micturious mites must stand over from the moment till I tackle this tickler hussy for occupying my uttentions.)\n\nMargareena she\u2019s very fond of Burrus but, alick and alack! she velly fond of chee. (The important influence exercised on everything by this eastasian import has not been till now fully flavoured though we can comfortably taste it in this case. I shall come back for a little more say farther on.) A cleopatrician in her own right she at once complicates the position while Burrus and Caseous are contending for her misstery by implicating her- self with an elusive Antonius, a wop who would appear to hug a personal interest in refined chees of all chades at the same time as he wags an antomine art of being rude like the boor. This Antonius\u2013Burrus-Caseous grouptriad may be said to equate the qualis equivalent with the older socalled talis on talis one just as quantly as in the hyperchemical economantarchy the tan-tum ergons irruminate the quantum urge so that eggs is to whey as whay is to zeed like your golfchild\u2019s abe boob caddy. And this is why any simple philadolphus of a fool you like to dress, an athemisthued lowtownian, exlegged phatrisight, may be awfully green to one side of him and fruitfully blue on the other which will not screen him however from appealing to my gropesarching eyes, through the strongholes of my acropoll, as a boosted blasted bleating blatant bloaten blasphorus blesphorous idiot who kennot tail a bomb from a painapple when he steals one and wannot psing his psalmen with the cong in our gregational pompoms with the canting crew.\n\nNo! Topsman to your Tarpeia! This thing, Mister Abby, is nefand. (And, taking off soutstuffs and alkalike matters, I hope we can kill time to reach the salt because there\u2019s some forceglass neutric assets bittering in the soldpewter for you to plump your pottage in). The thundering legion has stormed Olymp that it end. Twelve tabular times till now have I edicted it. Merus Genius to Careous Caseous! Moriture, te salutat! My phemous themis race is run, so let Demoncracy take the highmost! (Abra-ham Tripier. Those old diligences are quite out of date. Read next answer). I\u2019ll beat you so lon. (Bigtempered. Why not take direct action. See previous reply). My unchanging Word is sacred. The word is my Wife, to exponse and expound, to vend and to velnerate, and may the curlews crown our nuptias! Till Breath us depart! Wamen. Beware would you change with my years. Be as young as your grandmother! The ring man in the rong shop but the rite words by the rote order! Ubi lingua nuncupassit, ibi fas! Adversus hostem semper sac! She that will not feel my ful-moon let her peel to thee as the hoyden and the impudent! That mon that hoth no moses in his sole nor is not awed by conquists of word\u2019s law, who never with humself was fed and leaves his soil to lave his head, when his hope\u2019s in his highlows from whisking his woe, if he came to my preach, a proud pursebroken ranger, when the heavens were welling the spite of their spout, to beg for a bite in our bark Noisdanger, would meself and Mac Jeffet, four-inhand, foot him out? \u2014 ay! \u2014 were he my own breastbrother, my doubled withd love and my singlebiassed hate, were we bread by the same fire and signed with the same salt, had we tapped from the same master and robbed the same till, were we tucked in the one bed and bit by the one flea, homo-gallant and hemycapnoise, bum and dingo, jack by churl, though it broke my heart to pray it, still I\u2019d fear I\u2019d hate to say!\n\n12.

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, Dude Ranch would be it. The long term benefits of Dude Ranch have been proven by Vice articles from the early 2000s, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable  than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now. Enjoy the pow\u0435r and beauty of your nation. Never mind, you will not und\u0435rstand the power and beauty of your nation until they\u2019ve faded, but trust me. In another 161 episodes you\u2019ll look back at all the memes and recall in a way you can\u2019t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous Sam really looked with a man bun. You are not as punk as you imagine. Don't worry about the future, or worry and know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by asking Nate Ruess for help. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind. The kind that blindside you while you\u2019re skateboarding all alone at night through the streets of Montreal. Do one thing every day that scares you. Sing. Don\u2019t be reckless with other people\u2019s pods. Don\u2019t put up with people who are reckless with yours. Floss. Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you\u2019re celebrated in Canadian media journalism,  sometimes you're not. The race is long, and in the end it\u2019s only with The Ringer. Remember the good sclusies, FORGET THE BAD ONES. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how. Keep your old fan accounts, throw away your archives, but trust me on the Dude Ranch\n\n[Commie Rae Jepsen]\nHello?\nThis is Blink-155\nYou're now listening to Blink-155\nHere\u2019s the ad libs you requested\nUh!

You don't wanna be involved in this one, huh?\nThis here, this is, this is gonna be a blues number\nBut, first, I wanna do a little bit of background on the Blues and say what it is\nLike, there are six cardinal colors, and colors have always come to\nSignify more than simply that particular shade\nLike redneck or \"got the blues\"\nThat's where you apply colors to something else, you know, to come up with\nWhat it is you're trying to say\nSo, there are six cardinal colors: yellow, red, orange, green, blue, and purple\nAnd there are 3,000 shades\nAnd if you take these 3,000 shades and divide them by 6, you will come up with 500\nMeaning there are at least 500 shades of the blues\nFor example, there is the I-ain't-got-me-no-money Blues\nThere is the I-ain't-got-me-no-woman Blues\nThere is the I-ain't-got-me-no-money-and-I-ain't-got-me-no-woman\nWhich is the double blues\nAnd for years, it was thought that, that black people were the only one who could get the blues, so\nSo the blues hadn't come into no international type of fame (Had a corner on the market)\nBut, lately, we done had Frank Rizzo with the Lie Detector Blues\nWe done had the United States government talking \u2018bout the Energy Crisis Blues\nAnd we gonna dedicate this next poem here to, to Spearhead X\nThe Ex-Second in Command in terms of this country\n(He got the blues)\nAnd the poem is called \"H2O-G-A-T-E Blues\"\nAnd if H2O is still water, and G-A-T-E is still gate\nWhat we\u2019re getting ready to deal on is the Watergate Blues\n(Rated X!)\nLet me see if I can dial this number right quick\n[Interlude 1: Gil Scott-Heron]\n*Click! Whirrr!  Click!*\n\"I am sorry, the government you have elected is inoperative\nClick.  Inoperative\"\n\n[Verse 1: Gil Scott-Heron]\nJust how blind will America be?\nThe world is on the edge of its seat\nDefeat on the horizon.  Very surprising\nThat we all could see the plot\nAnd still could not...\nLet me do that part again\n\n[Verse 2: Gil Scott-Heron]\nJust how blind will America be?\n(There ain't no telling)\nThe world is on the edge of its seat\nDefeat on the horizon.  Very surprising\nThat we all could see the plot\nAnd claimed that we could not...\n(All right)\n\n[Verse 3: Gil Scott-Heron]\nJust how blind, America?\nJust as Vietnam exploded in the rice, snap, crackle, and pop\nCould not stop people determined to be free\nJust how blind will America be?\nYou might also like[Verse 4: Gil Scott-Heron]\nThe shock of a Vietnam defeat\nSent Republican donkeys\nScurrying down on Wall Street\nAnd when the roll was called it was:\nPepsi-Cola and Phillips 66\nBoeing, Dow, and Lockheed\nAsk them what they\u2019re fighting for, and they\u2019ll never mention the economics of war\nEcological Warfare\u2014above all else, destroy the land!\nIf we can't break the Asian will, we'll\nBomb the dykes and starve the man!\n\n[Verse 5: Gil Scott-Heron]\nAmerica!\nThe international Jekyll and Hyde\nThe land of a thousand disguises\nSneaks up on you but rarely surprises\n(Yeah!)\nPlundering the Asian countryside\nIn the name of Fu Man Tu\n\n[Verse 6: Gil Scott-Heron]\nAfraid of shoeless, undernourished Cambodians\nWhile we strike big wheat bargains with Russia\nOur nuclear enemy.  Just how blind, America?\n[Verse 7: Gil Scott-Heron]\nBut tell me: who was around where Hale Boggs died?\nAnd what was the cause of LBJ's untimely demise?\nAnd what really happened to J. Edgar Hoover?\nThe king is proud of Patrick Gray\nWhile America's faith is drowning\nBeneath that cesspool: Watergate\n(Yeah!)\n\n[Verse 8: Gil Scott-Heron]\nHow long will the citizens sit and wait?\nIt's looking like Europe in '38\nDid they move to stop Hitler before it was too late?\n(No)\nHow long, America, before the consequences of\nKeeping the school systems segregated\nAllowing the press to be intimidated\nWatching the price of everything soar\nAnd hearing complaints \u2018cause the rich want more?\n(All right!)\nIt seems that Macbeth, and not his lady, went mad\nWe've let him eliminate the whole middle class\nThe dollar's the only thing we can't inflate\nWhile the poor go on without a new minimum wage\nBut what really happened to J Edgar Hoover?\nThe king is proud of Patrick Gray\nAnd there are those who say America's faith is drowning\nBeneath that cesspool: Watergate\n\n[Verse 9: Gil Scott-Heron]\nHow much more evidence do the citizens need\nThat the election was sabotaged by trickery and greed?\nAnd, if this is so, and who we got didn't win\nLet's do the whole goddamn election over again!\n(Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!)\n\n[Verse 10: Gil Scott-Heron]\nThe obvious key to the whole charade\nWould be to run down all of the games they played:\nRemember Dita Beard and ITT, the slaughter of Attica\nThe C.I.A. in Chile knowing nothing about Allende at this time\nIn the past, as I recollect, Augusta, Georgia\nThe nomination of Supreme Court Jesters to head off the tapes\nWilliam Calley's Executive Interference in the image of John Wayne\nKent State, Jackson State, Southern Louisiana\nHundreds of unauthorized bombing raids\nThe chaining and gagging of Bobby Seale\nSomebody tell these Maryland Governors to be for real!\n\n[Verse 11: Gil Scott-Heron]\nWe recall all of these events just to prove\n(Yeah!)\nThe Waterbuggers in the Watergate wasn't no news!\nThe thing that seems to justify all of our fears\nIs that all of this went down in the last five years\nBut tell me, what really happened to J. Edgar Hoover?\nThe king is proud of Patrick Gray\nWhile America's faith is drowning\nBeneath that cesspool: Watergate\n\n[Verse 12: Gil Scott-Heron]\nWe leave America to ponder the image\nOf justice from its new wave of leaders:\nFrank Rizzo, the high school graduate\nMayor of Philadelphia, whose ignorance\nIs surpassed only by those who voted for him;\n(Hahahaha)\nRichard Daley, imperial Napoleonic Mayor of Chicago\nWho took over from Al Capone and\nContinues to implement the same tactics;\nGeorge Wallace; Lester Maddawg\nStrom Thurmond; Ronald Reagan\nAn almost endless list\nThat won't be missed\nWhen at last America is purged\n(Yeah!  All right!)\n\n[Verse 13: Gil Scott-Heron]\nAnd the silent White House with the James Brothers once in command\nBut see the sauerkraut Mafia men\nDeserting the sinking White House ship and\nTheir main mindless, megalomaniac Ahab\n\n[Verse 14: Gil Scott-Heron]\nMcCord has blown.  Mitchell has blown.  No tap on my telephone\nMcCord has blown.  Mitchell has blown.  No tap on my telephone\nHalderman, Ehrlichman, Mitchell, and Dean\nIt follows a pattern if you dig what I mean\nHalderman, Ehrlichman, Mitchell, and Dean\nIt follows a pattern if you dig what I mean\n\n[Verse 15: Gil Scott-Heron]\nAnd what are we left with now?\nBumper stickers that say \"Free the Watergate 500\"\nSpy movies of the same name with a cast of thousands\nAnd that ominous phrase that: if Nixon knew, Ag\u2019 knew!\n(Check it out!)\nBut Ag' didn't knew enough to stay out of jail\nWhat really happened to J. Edgar Hoover?\nThe king is proud of Patrick Gray\nAnd there are those who swear they've seen King Richard\n(Who?  Who?

me\nAnd she's just the opposite of you\nHear me now\nYou can't hurt me no more\nCause it doesn't matter\nNow what you do\nGot ahold of yourself\nCrying ain't gonna help you now\nAshamed that we end this way\nAnd this is all that I can say\nYou can't hurt me no more\nGive up cause I don't feel a thing\nYou can't hurt me no more\nGo find another who'll play your game\nCause I've got another who

everything\n'Til I fell from my throne\n\nMy honour used to be\nAnd suddenly, I'm I'm all alone\n\nOnly yesterday, I held you in my arms\nAnd when I heard you say\nYou'd love me forever\nIt's funny but forever\nMust have came today\n\nSuddenly, I'm all alone\nAnd the sun still shines above\nThe happy world I found\nCame tumbling down\nWhen I lost your love\n\nNow I've got nothing\nTo cling

'Is there ony genelmen there as can len' a hond here? Keep quiet, dang ye! Wo ho!'\n\n'What's the matter?' demanded Nicholas, looking sleepily up.\n\n'Matther mun, matter eneaf for one neight,' replied the guard; 'dang the wall-eyed bay, he's gane mad wi' glory I think, carse t'coorch is over. Here, can't ye len' a hond? Dom it, I'd ha' dean it if all my boans were brokken.'\n\n'Here!' cried Nicholas, staggering to his feet, 'I'm ready. I'm only a little abroad, that's all.'\n\n'Hoold 'em toight,' cried the guard, 'while ar coot treaces. Hang on tiv'em sumhoo. Well deane, my lod. That's it. Let'em goa noo. Dang 'em, they'll gang whoam fast eneaf!'\nIn truth, the animals were no sooner released than they trotted back, with much deliberation, to the stable they had just left, which was distant not a mile behind.\n\n'Can you blo' a harn?' asked the guard, disengaging one of the coach-lamps.\n'I dare say I can,' replied Nicholas.\n\n'Then just blo' away into that 'un as lies on the grund, fit to wakken the deead, will'ee,' said the man, 'while I stop sum o' this here squealing inside. Cumin', cumin'. Dean't make that noise, wooman.'\n\nAs the man spoke, he proceeded to wrench open the uppermost door of the coach, while Nicholas, seizing the horn, awoke the echoes far and wide with one of the most extraordinary performances on that instrument ever heard by mortal ears. It had its effect, however, not only in rousing such of their fall, but in summoning assistance to their relief; for lights gleamed in the distance, and people were already astir.\n\nIn fact, a man on horseback galloped down, before the passengers were well collected together; and a careful investigation being instituted, it appeared that the lady inside had broken her lamp, and the gentleman his head; that the two front outsides had escaped with black eyes; the box with a bloody nose; the coachman with a contusion on the temple; Mr Squeers with a portmanteau bruise on his back; and the remaining passengers without any injury at all\u2014thanks to the softness of the snow-drift in which they had been overturned. These facts were no sooner thoroughly ascertained, than the lady gave several indications of fainting, but being forewarned that if she did, she must be carried on some gentleman's shoulders to the nearest public-house, she prudently thought better of it, and walked back with the rest.\n\nThey found on reaching it, that it was a lonely place with no very great accommodation in the way of apartments\u2014that portion of its resources being all comprised in one public room with a sanded floor, and a chair or two. However, a large faggot and a plentiful supply of coals being heaped upon the fire, the appearance of things was not long in mending; and, by the time they had washed off all effaceable marks of the late accident, the room was warm and light, which was a most agreeable exchange for the cold and darkness out of doors.\n\n'Well, Mr Nickleby,' said Squeers, insinuating himself into the warmest corner, 'you did very right to catch hold of them horses. I should have done it myself if I had come to in time, but I am very glad you did it. You did it very well; very well.'\n\n'So well,' said the merry-faced gentleman, who did not seem to approve very much of the patronising tone adopted by Squeers, 'that if they had not been firmly checked when they were, you would most probably have had no brains left to teach with.'\n\nThis remark called up a discourse relative to the promptitude Nicholas had displayed, and he was overwhelmed with compliments and commendations.\n\n'I am very glad to have escaped, of course,' observed Squeers: 'every man is glad when he escapes from danger; but if any one of my charges had been hurt\u2014if I had been prevented from restoring any one of these little boys to his parents whole and sound as I received him\u2014what would have been my feelings? Why the wheel a-top of my head would have been far preferable to it.'\n\n'Are they all brothers, sir?' inquired the lady who had carried the 'Davy' or safety-lamp.\n\n'In one sense they are, ma'am,' replied Squeers, diving into his greatcoat pocket for cards. 'They are all under the same parental and affectionate treatment. Mrs Squeers and myself are a mother and father to every one of 'em. Mr Nickleby, hand the lady them cards, and offer these to the gentleman. Perhaps they might know of some parents that would be glad to avail themselves of the establishment.'\n\nExpressing himself to this effect, Mr Squeers, who lost no opportunity of advertising gratuitously, placed his hands upon his knees, and looked at the pupils with as much benignity as he could possibly affect, while Nicholas, blushing with shame, handed round the cards as directed.\n'I hope you suffer no inconvenience from the overturn, ma'am?' said the merry-faced gentleman, addressing the fastidious lady, as though he were charitably desirous to change the subject.\n\n'No bodily inconvenience,' replied the lady.\n\n'No mental inconvenience, I hope?'\n\n'The subject is a very painful one to my feelings, sir,' replied the lady with strong emotion; 'and I beg you as a gentleman, not to refer to it.'\n\n'Dear me,' said the merry-faced gentleman, looking merrier still, 'I merely intended to inquire\u2014'\n\n'I hope no inquiries will be made,' said the lady, 'or I shall be compelled to throw myself on the protection of the other gentlemen. Landlord, pray direct a boy to keep watch outside the door\u2014and if a green chariot passes in the direction of Grantham, to stop it instantly.'\n\nThe people of the house were evidently overcome by this request, and when the lady charged the boy to remember, as a means of identifying the expected green chariot, that it would have a coachman with a gold-laced hat on the box, and a footman, most probably in silk stockings, behind, the attentions of the good woman of the inn were redoubled. Even the box-passenger caught the infection, and growing wonderfully deferential, immediately inquired whether there was not very good society in that neighbourhood, to which the lady replied yes, there was: in a manner which sufficiently implied that she moved at the very tiptop and summit of it all.\n\n'As the guard has gone on horseback to Grantham to get another coach,' said the good-tempered gentleman when they had been all sitting round the fire, for some time, in silence, 'and as he must be gone a couple of hours at the very least, I propose a bowl of hot punch. What say you, sir?'\n\nThis question was addressed to the broken-headed inside, who was a man of very genteel appearance, dressed in mourning. He was not past the middle age, but his hair was grey; it seemed to have been prematurely turned by care or sorrow. He readily acceded to the proposal, and appeared to be prepossessed by the frank good-nature of the individual from whom it emanated.\n\nThis latter personage took upon himself the office of tapster when the punch was ready, and after dispensing it all round, led the conversation to the antiquities of York, with which both he and the grey-haired gentleman appeared to be well acquainted. When this topic flagged, he turned with a smile to the grey-headed gentleman, and asked if he could sing.\n\n'I cannot indeed,' replied gentleman, smiling in his turn.\n\n'That's a pity,' said the owner of the good-humoured countenance. 'Is there nobody here who can sing a song to lighten the time?'\n\nThe passengers, one and all, protested that they could not; that they wished they could; that they couldn't remember the words of anything without the book; and so forth.\n'Perhaps the lady would not object,' said the president with great respect, and a merry twinkle in his eye. 'Some little Italian thing out of the last opera brought out in town, would be most acceptable I am sure.'\n\nAs the lady condescended to make no reply, but tossed her head contemptuously, and murmured some further expression of surprise regarding the absence of the green chariot, one or two voices urged upon the president himself, the propriety of making an attempt for the general benefit.\n\n'I would if I could,' said he of the good-tempered face; 'for I hold that in this, as in all other cases where people who are strangers to each other are thrown unexpectedly together, they should endeavour to render themselves as pleasant, for the joint sake of the little community, as possible.'\n\n'I wish the maxim were more generally acted on, in all cases,' said the grey-headed gentleman.\n\n'I'm glad to hear it,' returned the other. 'Perhaps, as you can't sing, you'll tell us a story?'\n\n'Nay. I should ask you.'\n\n'After you, I will, with pleasure.'\n\n'Indeed!' said the grey-haired gentleman, smiling, 'Well, let it be so. I fear the turn of my thoughts is not calculated to lighten the time you must pass here; but you have brought this upon yourselves, and shall judge. We were speaking of York Minster just now. My story shall have some reference to it. Let us call it\n\nTHE FIVE SISTERS OF YORK\n\nAfter a murmur of approbation from the other passengers, during which the fastidious lady drank a glass of punch unobserved, the grey-headed gentleman thus went on:\n\n'A great many years ago\u2014for the fifteenth century was scarce two years old at the time, and King Henry the Fourth sat upon the throne of England\u2014there dwelt, in the ancient city of York, five maiden sisters, the subjects of my tale.\n\n'These five sisters were all of surpassing beauty. The eldest was in her twenty-third year, the second a year younger, the third a year younger than the second, and the fourth a year younger than the third. They were tall stately figures, with dark flashing eyes and hair of jet; dignity and grace were in their every movement; and the fame of their great beauty had spread through all the country round.\n\n'But, if the four elder sisters were lovely, how beautiful was the youngest, a fair creature of sixteen! The blushing tints in the soft bloom on the fruit, or the delicate painting on the flower, are not more exquisite than was the blending of the rose and lily in her gentle face, or the deep blue of her eye. The vine, in all its elegant luxuriance, is not more graceful than were the clusters of rich brown hair that sported round her brow.\n\n'If we all had hearts like those which beat so lightly in the bosoms of the young and beautiful, what a heaven this earth would be! If, while our bodies grow old and withered, our hearts could but retain their early youth and freshness, of what avail would be our sorrows and sufferings! But, the faint image of Eden which is stamped upon them in childhood, chafes and rubs in our rough struggles with the world, and soon wears away: too often to leave nothing but a mournful blank remaining.\n'The heart of this fair girl bounded with joy and gladness. Devoted attachment to her sisters, and a fervent love of all beautiful things in nature, were its pure affections. Her gleesome voice and merry laugh were the sweetest music of their home. She was its very light and life. The brightest flowers in the garden were reared by her; the caged birds sang when they heard her voice, and pined when they missed its sweetness. Alice, dear Alice; what living thing within the sphere of her gentle witchery, could fail to love her!\n\n'You may seek in vain, now, for the spot on which these sisters lived, for their very names have passed away, and dusty antiquaries tell of them as of a fable. But they dwelt in an old wooden house\u2014old even in those days\u2014with overhanging gables and balconies of rudely-carved oak, which stood within a pleasant orchard, and was surrounded by a rough stone wall, whence a stout archer might have winged an arrow to St Mary's Abbey. The old abbey flourished then; and the five sisters, living on its fair domains, paid yearly dues to the black monks of St Benedict, to which fraternity it belonged.\n\n'It was a bright and sunny morning in the pleasant time of summer, when one of those black monks emerged from the abbey portal, and bent his steps towards the house of the fair sisters. Heaven above was blue, and earth beneath was green; the river glistened like a path of diamonds in the sun; the birds poured forth their songs from the shady trees; the lark soared high above the waving corn; and the deep buzz of insects filled the air. Everything looked gay and smiling; but the holy man walked gloomily on, with his eyes bent upon the ground. The beauty of the earth is but a breath, and man is but a shadow. What sympathy should a holy preacher have with either?\n\n'With eyes bent upon the ground, then, or only raised enough to prevent his stumbling over such obstacles as lay in his way, the religious man moved slowly forward until he reached a small postern in the wall of the sisters' orchard, through which he passed, closing it behind him. The noise of soft voices in conversation, and of merry laughter, fell upon his ears ere he had advanced many paces; and raising his eyes higher than was his humble won't, he descried, at no great distance, the five sisters seated on the grass, with Alice in the centre: all busily plying their customary task of embroidering.\n\n'\"Save you, fair daughters!\" said the friar; and fair in truth they were. Even a monk might have loved them as choice masterpieces of his Maker's hand.\n\n'The sisters saluted the holy man with becoming reverence, and the eldest motioned him to a mossy seat beside them. But the good friar shook his head, and bumped himself down on a very hard stone,\u2014at which, no doubt, approving angels were gratified.\n\n'\"Ye were merry, daughters,\" said the monk.\n\n'\"You know how light of heart sweet Alice is,\" replied the eldest sister, passing her fingers through the tresses of the smiling girl.\n\n'\"And what joy and cheerfulness it wakes up within us, to see all nature beaming in brightness and sunshine, father,\" added Alice, blushing beneath the stern look of the recluse.\n\n'The monk answered not, save by a grave inclination of the head, and the sisters pursued their task in silence.\n\n'\"Still wasting the precious hours,\" said the monk at length, turning to the eldest sister as he spoke, \"still wasting the precious hours on this vain trifling. Alas, alas! that the few bubbles on the surface of eternity\u2014all that Heaven wills we should see of that dark deep stream\u2014should be so lightly scattered!\"\n\n'\"Father,\" urged the maiden, pausing, as did each of the others, in her busy task, \"we have prayed at matins, our daily alms have been distributed at the gate, the sick peasants have been tended,\u2014all our morning tasks have been performed. I hope our occupation is a blameless one?'\n\n'\"See here,\" said the friar, taking the frame from her hand, \"an intricate winding of gaudy colours, without purpose or object, unless it be that one day it is destined for some vain ornament, to minister to the pride of your frail and giddy sex. Day after day has been employed upon this senseless task, and yet it is not half accomplished. The shade of each departed day falls upon our graves, and the worm exults as he beholds it, to know that we are hastening thither. Daughters, is there no better way to pass the fleeting hours?\"\n\n'The four elder sisters cast down their eyes as if abashed by the holy man's reproof, but Alice raised hers, and bent them mildly on the friar.\n\n'\"Our dear mother,\" said the maiden; \"Heaven rest her soul!\"\n\n'\"Amen!\" cried the friar in a deep voice.\n\n'\"Our dear mother,\" faltered the fair Alice, \"was living when these long tasks began, and bade us, when she should be no more, ply them in all discretion and cheerfulness, in our leisure hours; she said that if in harmless mirth and maidenly pursuits we passed those hours together, they would prove the happiest and most peaceful of our lives, and that if, in later times, we went forth into the world, and mingled with its cares and trials\u2014if, allured by its temptations and dazzled by its glitter, we ever forgot that love and duty which should bind, in holy ties, the children of one loved parent\u2014a glance at the old work of our common girlhood would awaken good thoughts of bygone days, and soften our hearts to affection and love.\"\n\n'\"Alice speaks truly, father,\" said the elder sister, somewhat proudly. And so saying she resumed her work, as did the others.\n\n'It was a kind of sampler of large size, that each sister had before her; the device was of a complex and intricate description, and the pattern and colours of all five were the same. The sisters bent gracefully over their work; the monk, resting his chin upon his hands, looked from one to the other in silence.\n\n'\"How much better,\" he said at length, \"to shun all such thoughts and chances, and, in the peaceful shelter of the church, devote your lives to Heaven! Infancy, childhood, the prime of life, and old age, wither as rapidly as they crowd upon each other. Think how human dust rolls onward to the tomb, and turning your faces steadily towards that goal, avoid the cloud which takes its rise among the pleasures of the world, and cheats the senses of their votaries. The veil, daughters, the veil!\"\n\n'\"Never, sisters,\" cried Alice. \"Barter not the light and air of heaven, and the freshness of earth and all the beautiful things which breathe upon it, for the cold cloister and the cell. Nature's own blessings are the proper goods of life, and we may share them sinlessly together. To die is our heavy portion, but, oh, let us die with life about us; when our cold hearts cease to beat, let warm hearts be beating near; let our last look be upon the bounds which God has set to his own bright skies, and not on stone walls and bars of iron! Dear sisters, let us live and die, if you list, in this green garden's compass; only shun the gloom and sadness of a cloister, and we shall be happy.\"\n\n'The tears fell fast from the maiden's eyes as she closed her impassioned appeal, and hid her face in the bosom of her sister.\n\n'\"Take comfort, Alice,\" said the eldest, kissing her fair forehead. \"The veil shall never cast its shadow on thy young brow. How say you, sisters? For yourselves you speak, and not for Alice, or for me.\"\n\n'The sisters, as with one accord, cried that their lot was cast together, and that there were dwellings for peace and virtue beyond the convent's walls.\n\n'\"Father,\" said the eldest lady, rising with dignity, \"you hear our final resolve. The same pious care which enriched the abbey of St Mary, and left us, orphans, to its holy guardianship, directed that no constraint should be imposed upon our inclinations, but that we should be free to live according to our choice. Let us hear no more of this, we pray you. Sisters, it is nearly noon. Let us take shelter until evening!\" With a reverence to the friar, the lady rose and walked towards the house, hand in hand with Alice; the other sisters followed.\n\n'The holy man, who had often urged the same point before, but had never met with so direct a repulse, walked some little distance behind, with his eyes bent upon the earth, and his lips moving AS IF in prayer. As the sisters reached the porch, he quickened his pace, and called upon them to stop.\n\n'\"Stay!\" said the monk, raising his right hand in the air, and directing an angry glance by turns at Alice and the eldest sister. \"Stay, and hear from me what these recollections are, which you would cherish above eternity, and awaken\u2014if in mercy they slumbered\u2014by means of idle toys. The memory of earthly things is charged, in after life, with bitter disappointment, affliction, death; with dreary change and wasting sorrow. The time will one day come, when a glance at those unmeaning baubles will tear open deep wounds in the hearts of some among you, and strike to your inmost souls. When that hour arrives\u2014and, mark me, come it will\u2014turn from the world to which you clung, to the refuge which you spurned. Find me the cell which shall be colder than the fire of mortals grows, when dimmed by calamity and trial, and there weep for the dreams of youth. These things are Heaven's will, not mine,\" said the friar, subduing his voice as he looked round upon the shrinking girls. \"The Virgin's blessing be upon you, daughters!\"\n\n'With these words he disappeared through the postern; and the sisters hastening into the house were seen no more that day.\n\n'But nature will smile though priests may frown, and next day the sun shone brightly, and on the next, and the next again. And in the morning's glare, and the evening's soft repose, the five sisters still walked, or worked, or beguiled the time by cheerful conversation, in their quiet orchard.\n\n'Time passed away as a tale that is told; faster indeed than many tales that are told, of which number I fear this may be one. The house of the five sisters stood where it did, and the same trees cast their pleasant shade upon the orchard grass. The sisters too were there, and lovely as at first, but a change had come over their dwelling. Sometimes, there was the clash of armour, and the gleaming of the moon on caps of steel; and, at others, jaded coursers were spurred up to the gate, and a female form glided hurriedly forth, as if eager to demand tidings of the weary messenger. A goodly train of knights and ladies lodged one night within the abbey walls, and next day rode away, with two of the fair sisters among them. Then, horsemen began to come less frequently, and seemed to bring bad tidings when they did, and at length they ceased to come at all, and footsore peasants slunk to the gate after sunset, and did their errand there, by stealth. Once, a vassal was dispatched in haste to the abbey at dead of night, and when morning came, there were sounds of woe and wailing in the sisters' house; and after this, a mournful silence fell upon it, and knight or lady, horse or armour, was seen about it no more.\n\n'There was a sullen darkness in the sky, and the sun had gone angrily down, tinting the dull clouds with the last traces of his wrath, when the same black monk walked slowly on, with folded arms, within a stone's-throw of the abbey. A blight had fallen on the trees and shrubs; and the wind, at length beginning to break the unnatural stillness that had prevailed all day, sighed heavily from time to time, as though foretelling in grief the ravages of the coming storm. The bat skimmed in fantastic flights through the heavy air, and the ground was alive with crawling things, whose instinct brought them forth to swell and fatten in the rain.\n\n'No longer were the friar's eyes directed to the earth; they were cast abroad, and roamed from point to point, as if the gloom and desolation of the scene found a quick response in his own bosom. Again he paused near the sisters' house, and again he entered by the postern.\n\n'But not again did his ear encounter the sound of laughter, or his eyes rest upon the beautiful figures of the five sisters. All was silent and deserted. The boughs of the trees were bent and broken, and the grass had grown long and rank. No light feet had pressed it for many, many a day.\n\n'With the indifference or abstraction of one well accustomed to the change, the monk glided into the house, and entered a low, dark room. Four sisters sat there. Their black garments made their pale faces whiter still, and time and sorrow had worked deep ravages. They were stately yet; but the flush and pride of beauty were gone.\n'And Alice\u2014where was she? In Heaven.\n\n'The monk\u2014even the monk\u2014could bear with some grief here; for it was long since these sisters had met, and there were furrows in their blanched faces which years could never plough. He took his seat in silence, and motioned them to continue their speech.\n\n'\"They are here, sisters,\" said the elder lady in a trembling voice. \"I have never borne to look upon them since, and now I blame myself for my weakness. What is there in her memory that we should dread? To call up our old days shall be a solemn pleasure yet.\"\n\n'She glanced at the monk as she spoke, and, opening a cabinet, brought forth the five frames of work, completed long before. Her step was firm, but her hand trembled as she produced the last one; and, when the feelings of the other sisters gushed forth at sight of it, her pent-up tears made way, and she sobbed \"God bless her!\"\n\n'The monk rose and advanced towards them. \"It was almost the last thing she touched in health,\" he said in a low voice.\n\n'\"It was,\" cried the elder lady, weeping bitterly.\n\n'The monk turned to the second sister.\n\n'\"The gallant youth who looked into thine eyes, and hung upon thy very breath when first he saw thee intent upon this pastime, lies buried on a plain whereof the turf is red with blood. Rusty fragments of armour, once brightly burnished, lie rotting on the ground, and are as little distinguishable for his, as are the bones that crumble in the mould!\"\n\n'The lady groaned, and wrung her hands.\n\n'\"The policy of courts,\" he continued, turning to the two other sisters, \"drew ye from your peaceful home to scenes of revelry and splendour. The same policy, and the restless ambition of\u2014proud and fiery men, have sent ye back, widowed maidens, and humbled outcasts. Do I speak truly?\"\n\n'The sobs of the two sisters were their only reply.\n\n'\"There is little need,\" said the monk, with a meaning look, \"to fritter away the time in gewgaws which shall raise up the pale ghosts of hopes of early years. Bury them, heap penance and mortification on their heads, keep them down, and let the convent be their grave!\"\n\n'The sisters asked for three days to deliberate; and felt, that night, as though the veil were indeed the fitting shroud for their dead joys. But, morning came again, and though the boughs of the orchard trees drooped and ran wild upon the ground, it was the same orchard still. The grass was coarse and high, but there was yet the spot on which they had so often sat together, when change and sorrow were but names. There was every walk and nook which Alice had made glad; and in the minster nave was one flat stone beneath which she slept in peace.\n\n'And could they, remembering how her young heart had sickened at the thought of cloistered walls, look upon her grave, in garbs which would chill the very ashes within it? Could they bow down in prayer, and when all Heaven turned to hear them, bring the dark shade of sadness on one angel's face? No.\n\n'They sent abroad, to artists of great celebrity in those times, and having obtained the church's sanction to their work of piety, caused to be executed, in five large compartments of richly stained glass, a faithful copy of their old embroidery work. These were fitted into a large window until that time bare of ornament; and when the sun shone brightly, as she had so well loved to see it, the familiar patterns were reflected in their original colours, and throwing a stream of brilliant light upon the pavement, fell warmly on the name of Alice.\n\n'For many hours in every day, the sisters paced slowly up and down the nave, or knelt by the side of the flat broad stone. Only three were seen in the customary place, after many years; then but two, and, for a long time afterwards, but one solitary female bent with age. At length she came no more, and the stone bore five plain Christian names.\n\n'That stone has worn away and been replaced by others, and many generations have come and gone since then. Time has softened down the colours, but the same stream of light still falls upon the forgotten tomb, of which no trace remains; and, to this day, the stranger is shown in York Cathedral, an old window called the Five Sisters.'\n\n'That's a melancholy tale,' said the merry-faced gentleman, emptying his glass.\n\n'It is a tale of life, and life is made up of such sorrows,' returned the other, courteously, but in a grave and sad tone of voice.\n\n'There are shades in all good pictures, but there are lights too, if we choose to contemplate them,' said the gentleman with the merry face. 'The youngest sister in your tale was always light-hearted.'\n\n'And died early,' said the other, gently.\n\n'She would have died earlier, perhaps, had she been less happy,' said the first speaker, with much feeling. 'Do you think the sisters who loved her so well, would have grieved the less if her life had been one of gloom and sadness? If anything could soothe the first sharp pain of a heavy loss, it would be\u2014with me\u2014the reflection, that those I mourned, by being innocently happy here, and loving all about them, had prepared themselves for a purer and happier world. The sun does not shine upon this fair earth to meet frowning eyes, depend upon it.'\n\n'I believe you are right,' said the gentleman who had told the story.\n\n'Believe!' retorted the other, 'can anybody doubt it? Take any subject of sorrowful regret, and see with how much pleasure it is associated. The recollection of past pleasure may become pain\u2014'\n\n'It does,' interposed the other.\n\n'Well; it does. To remember happiness which cannot be restored, is pain, but of a softened kind. Our recollections are unfortunately mingled with much that we deplore, and with many actions which we bitterly repent; still in the most chequered life I firmly think there are so many little rays of sunshine to look back upon, that I do not believe any mortal (unless he had put himself without the pale of hope) would deliberately drain a goblet of the waters of Lethe, if he had it in his power.'\n\n'Possibly you are correct in that belief,' said the grey-haired gentleman after a short reflection. 'I am inclined to think you are.'\n\n'Why, then,' replied the other, 'the good in this state of existence preponderates over the bad, let miscalled philosophers tell us what they will. If our affections be tried, our affections are our consolation and comfort; and memory, however sad, is the best and purest link between this world and a better. But come! I'll tell you a story of another kind.'\n\nAfter a very brief silence, the merry-faced gentleman sent round the punch, and glancing slyly at the fastidious lady, who seemed desperately apprehensive that he was going to relate something improper, began\n\nTHE BARON OF GROGZWIG\n\n'The Baron Von Koeldwethout, of Grogzwig in Germany, was as likely a young baron as you would wish to see. I needn't say that he lived in a castle, because that's of course; neither need I say that he lived in an old castle; for what German baron ever lived in a new one? There were many strange circumstances connected with this venerable building, among which, not the least startling and mysterious were, that when the wind blew, it rumbled in the chimneys, or even howled among the trees in the neighbouring forest; and that when the moon shone, she found her way through certain small loopholes in the wall, and actually made some parts of the wide halls and galleries quite light, while she left others in gloomy shadow. I believe that one of the baron's ancestors, being short of money, had inserted a dagger in a gentleman who called one night to ask his way, and it WAS supposed that these miraculous occurrences took place in consequence. And yet I hardly know how that could have been, either, because the baron's ancestor, who was an amiable man, felt very sorry afterwards for having been so rash, and laying violent hands upon a quantity of stone and timber which belonged to a weaker baron, built a chapel as an apology, and so took a receipt from Heaven, in full of all demands.\n\n'Talking of the baron's ancestor puts me in mind of the baron's great claims to respect, on the score of his pedigree. I am afraid to say, I am sure, how many ancestors the baron had; but I know that he had a great many more than any other man of his time; and I only wish that he had lived in these latter days, that he might have had more. It is a very hard thing upon the great men of past centuries, that they should have come into the world so soon, because a man who was born three or four hundred years ago, cannot reasonably be expected to have had as many relations before him, as a man who is born now. The last man, whoever he is\u2014and he may be a cobbler or some low vulgar dog for aught we know\u2014will have a longer pedigree than the greatest nobleman now alive; and I contend that this is not fair.\n\n'Well, but the Baron Von Koeldwethout of Grogzwig! He was a fine swarthy fellow, with dark hair and large moustachios, who rode a-hunting in clothes of Lincoln green, with russet boots on his feet, and a bugle slung over his shoulder like the guard of a long stage. When he blew this bugle, four-and-twenty other gentlemen of inferior rank, in Lincoln green a little coarser, and russet boots with a little thicker soles, turned out directly: and away galloped the whole train, with spears in their hands like lacquered area railings, to hunt down the boars, or perhaps encounter a bear: in which latter case the baron killed him first, and greased his whiskers with him afterwards.\n\n'This was a merry life for the Baron of Grogzwig, and a merrier still for the baron's retainers, who drank Rhine wine every night till they fell under the table, and then had the bottles on the floor, and called for pipes. Never were such jolly, roystering, rollicking, merry-making blades, as the jovial crew of Grogzwig.\n'But the pleasures of the table, or the pleasures of under the table, require a little variety; especially when the same five-and-twenty people sit daily down to the same board, to discuss the same subjects, and tell the same stories. The baron grew weary, and wanted excitement. He took to quarrelling with his gentlemen, and tried kicking two or three of them every day after dinner. This was a pleasant change at first; but it became monotonous after a week or so, and the baron felt quite out of sorts, and cast about, in despair, for some new amusement.\n\n'One night, after a day's sport in which he had outdone Nimrod or Gillingwater, and slaughtered \"another fine bear,\" and brought him home in triumph, the Baron Von Koeldwethout sat moodily at the head of his table, eyeing the smoky roof of the hall with a discontented aspect. He swallowed huge bumpers of wine, but the more he swallowed, the more he frowned. The gentlemen who had been honoured with the dangerous distinction of sitting on his right and left, imitated him to a miracle in the drinking, and frowned at each other.\n\n'\"I will!\" cried the baron suddenly, smiting the table with his right hand, and twirling his moustache with his left. \"Fill to the Lady of Grogzwig!\"\n\n'The four-and-twenty Lincoln greens turned pale, with the exception of their four-and-twenty noses, which were unchangeable.\n\n'\"I said to the Lady of Grogzwig,\" repeated the baron, looking round the board.\n\n'\"To the Lady of Grogzwig!\" shouted the Lincoln greens; and down their four-and-twenty throats went four-and-twenty imperial pints of such rare old hock, that they smacked their eight-and-forty lips, and winked again.\n\n'\"The fair daughter of the Baron Von Swillenhausen,\" said Koeldwethout, condescending to explain. \"We will demand her in marriage of her father, ere the sun goes down tomorrow. If he refuse our suit, we will cut off his nose.\"\n\n'A hoarse murmur arose from the company; every man touched, first the hilt of his sword, and then the tip of his nose, with appalling significance.\n\n'What a pleasant thing filial piety is to contemplate! If the daughter of the Baron Von Swillenhausen had pleaded a preoccupied heart, or fallen at her father's feet and corned them in salt tears, or only fainted away, and complimented the old gentleman in frantic ejaculations, the odds are a hundred to one but Swillenhausen Castle would have been turned out at window, or rather the baron turned out at window, and the castle demolished. The damsel held her peace, however, when an early messenger bore the request of Von Koeldwethout next morning, and modestly retired to her chamber, from the casement of which she watched the coming of the suitor and his retinue. She was no sooner assured that the horseman with the large moustachios was her proffered husband, than she hastened to her father's presence, and expressed her readiness to sacrifice herself to secure his peace. The venerable baron caught his child to his arms, and shed a wink of joy.\n\n'There was great feasting at the castle, that day. The four-and-twenty Lincoln greens of Von Koeldwethout exchanged vows of eternal friendship with twelve Lincoln greens of Von Swillenhausen, and promised the old baron that they would drink his wine \"Till all was blue\"\u2014meaning probably until their whole countenances had acquired the same tint as their noses. Everybody slapped everybody else's back, when the time for parting came; and the Baron Von Koeldwethout and his followers rode gaily home.\n\n'For six mortal weeks, the bears and boars had a holiday. The houses of Koeldwethout and Swillenhausen were united; the spears rusted; and the baron's bugle grew hoarse for lack of blowing.\n\n'Those were great times for the four-and-twenty; but, alas! their high and palmy days had taken boots to themselves, and were already walking off.\n\n'\"My dear,\" said the baroness.\n\n'\"My love,\" said the baron.\n\n'\"Those coarse, noisy men\u2014\"\n\n'\"Which, ma'am?\" said the baron, starting.\n\n'The baroness pointed, from the window at which they stood, to the courtyard beneath, where the unconscious Lincoln greens were taking a copious stirrup-cup, preparatory to issuing forth after a boar or two.\n\n'\"My hunting train, ma'am,\" said the baron.\n\n'\"Disband them, love,\" murmured the baroness.\n\n'\"Disband them!\" cried the baron, in amazement.\n\n'\"To please me, love,\" replied the baroness.\n\n'\"To please the devil, ma'am,\" answered the baron.\n\n'Whereupon the baroness uttered a great cry, and swooned away at the baron's feet.\n'What could the baron do? He called for the lady's maid, and roared for the doctor; and then, rushing into the yard, kicked the two Lincoln greens who were the most used to it, and cursing the others all round, bade them go\u2014but never mind where. I don't know the German for it, or I would put it delicately that way.\n\n'It is not for me to say by what means, or by what degrees, some wives manage to keep down some husbands as they do, although I may have my private opinion on the subject, and may think that no Member of Parliament ought to be married, inasmuch as three married members out of every four, must vote according to their wives' consciences (if there be such things), and not according to their own. All I need say, just now, is, that the Baroness Von Koeldwethout somehow or other acquired great control over the Baron Von Koeldwethout, and that, little by little, and bit by bit, and day by day, and year by year, the baron got the worst of some disputed question, or was slyly unhorsed from some old hobby; and that by the time he was a fat hearty fellow of forty-eight or thereabouts, he had no feasting, no revelry, no hunting train, and no hunting\u2014nothing in short that he liked, or used to have; and that, although he was as fierce as a lion, and as bold as brass, he was decidedly snubbed and put down, by his own lady, in his own castle of Grogzwig.\n\n'Nor was this the whole extent of the baron's misfortunes. About a year after his nuptials, there came into the world a lusty young baron, in whose honour a great many fireworks were let off, and a great many dozens of wine drunk; but next year there came a young baroness, and next year another young baron, and so on, every year, either a baron or baroness (and one year both together), until the baron found himself the father of a small family of twelve. Upon every one of these anniversaries, the venerable Baroness Von Swillenhausen was nervously sensitive for the well-being of her child the Baroness Von Koeldwethout; and although it was not found that the good lady ever did anything material towards contributing to her child's recovery, still she made it a point of duty to be as nervous as possible at the castle of Grogzwig, and to divide her time between moral observations on the baron's housekeeping, and bewailing the hard lot of her unhappy daughter. And if the Baron of Grogzwig, a little hurt and irritated at this, took heart, and ventured to suggest that his wife was at least no worse off than the wives of other barons, the Baroness Von Swillenhausen begged all persons to take notice, that nobody but she, sympathised with her dear daughter's sufferings; upon which, her relations and friends remarked, that to be sure she did cry a great deal more than her son-in-law, and that if there were a hard-hearted brute alive, it was that Baron of Grogzwig.\n\n'The poor baron bore it all as long as he could, and when he could bear it no longer lost his appetite and his spirits, and sat himself gloomily and dejectedly down. But there were worse troubles yet in store for him, and as they came on, his melancholy and sadness increased. Times changed. He got into debt. The Grogzwig coffers ran low, though the Swillenhausen family had looked upon them as inexhaustible; and just when the baroness was on the point of making a thirteenth addition to the family pedigree, Von Koeldwethout discovered that he had no means of replenishing them.\n'\"I don't see what is to be done,\" said the baron. \"I think I'll kill myself.\"\n\n'This was a bright idea. The baron took an old hunting-knife from a cupboard hard by, and having sharpened it on his boot, made what boys call \"an offer\" at his throat.\n\n'\"Hem!\" said the baron, stopping short. \"Perhaps it's not sharp enough.\"\n\n'The baron sharpened it again, and made another offer, when his hand was arrested by a loud screaming among the young barons and baronesses, who had a nursery in an upstairs tower with iron bars outside the window, to prevent their tumbling out into the moat.\n\n'\"If I had been a bachelor,\" said the baron sighing, \"I might have done it fifty times over, without being interrupted. Hallo! Put a flask of wine and the largest pipe in the little vaulted room behind the hall.\"\n\n'One of the domestics, in a very kind manner, executed the baron's order in the course of half an hour or so, and Von Koeldwethout being apprised thereof, strode to the vaulted room, the walls of which, being of dark shining wood, gleamed in the light of the blazing logs which were piled upon the hearth. The bottle and pipe were ready, and, upon the whole, the place looked very comfortable.\n\n'\"Leave the lamp,\" said the baron.\n\n'\"Anything else, my lord?\" inquired the domestic.\n\n'\"The room,\" replied the baron. The domestic obeyed, and the baron locked the door.\n\n'\"I'll smoke a last pipe,\" said the baron, \"and then I'll be off.\" So, putting the knife upon the table till he wanted it, and tossing off a goodly measure of wine, the Lord of Grogzwig threw himself back in his chair, stretched his legs out before the fire, and puffed away.\n\n'He thought about a great many things\u2014about his present troubles and past days of bachelorship, and about the Lincoln greens, long since dispersed up and down the country, no one knew whither: with the exception of two who had been unfortunately beheaded, and four who had killed themselves with drinking. His mind was running upon bears and boars, when, in the process of draining his glass to the bottom, he raised his eyes, and saw, for the first time and with unbounded astonishment, that he was not alone.\n\n'No, he was not; for, on the opposite side of the fire, there sat with folded arms a wrinkled hideous figure, with deeply sunk and bloodshot eyes, and an immensely long cadaverous face, shadowed by jagged and matted locks of coarse black hair. He wore a kind of tunic of a dull bluish colour, which, the baron observed, on regarding it attentively, was clasped or ornamented down the front with coffin handles. His legs, too, were encased in coffin plates as though in armour; and over his left shoulder he wore a short dusky cloak, which seemed made of a remnant of some pall. He took no notice of the baron, but was intently eyeing the fire.\n\n'\"Halloa!\" said the baron, stamping his foot to attract attention.\n\n'\"Halloa!\" replied the stranger, moving his eyes towards the baron, but not his face or himself \"What now?\"\n\n'\"What now!\" replied the baron, nothing daunted by his hollow voice and lustreless eyes. \"I should ask that question. How did you get here?\"\n\n'\"Through the door,\" replied the figure.\n\n'\"What are you?\" says the baron.\n\n'\"A man,\" replied the figure.\n\n'\"I don't believe it,\" says the baron.\n\n'\"Disbelieve it then,\" says the figure.\n\n'\"I will,\" rejoined the baron.\n\n'The figure looked at the bold Baron of Grogzwig for some time, and then said familiarly,\n\n'\"There's no coming over you, I see. I'm not a man!\"\n\n'\"What are you then?\" asked the baron.\n\n'\"A genius,\" replied the figure.\n\n'\"You don't look much like one,\" returned the baron scornfully.\n\n'\"I am the Genius of Despair and Suicide,\" said the apparition. \"Now you know me.\"\n\n'With these words the apparition turned towards the baron, as if composing himself for a talk\u2014and, what was very remarkable, was, that he threw his cloak aside, and displaying a stake, which was run through the centre of his body, pulled it out with a jerk, and laid it on the table, as composedly as if it had been a walking-stick.\n\n'\"Now,\" said the figure, glancing at the hunting-knife, \"are you ready for me?\"\n\n'\"Not quite,\" rejoined the baron; \"I must finish this pipe first.\"\n\n'\"Look sharp then,\" said the figure.\n\n'\"You seem in a hurry,\" said the baron.\n\n'\"Why, yes, I am,\" answered the figure; \"they're doing a pretty brisk business in my way, over in England and France just now, and my time is a good deal taken up.\"\n\n'\"Do you drink?\" said the baron, touching the bottle with the bowl of his pipe.\n\n'\"Nine times out of ten, and then very hard,\" rejoined the figure, drily.\n\n'\"Never in moderation?\" asked the baron.\n\n'\"Never,\" replied the figure, with a shudder, \"that breeds cheerfulness.\"\n\n'The baron took another look at his new friend, whom he thought an uncommonly queer customer, and at length inquired whether he took any active part in such little proceedings as that which he had in contemplation.\n\n'\"No,\" replied the figure evasively; \"but I am always present.\"\n\n'\"Just to see fair, I suppose?\" said the baron.\n\n'\"Just that,\" replied the figure, playing with his stake, and examining the ferule. \"Be as quick as you can, will you, for there's a young gentleman who is afflicted with too much money and leisure wanting me now, I find.\"\n\n'\"Going to kill himself because he has too much money!\" exclaimed the baron, quite tickled. \"Ha! ha! that's a good one.\" (This was the first time the baron had laughed for many a long day.)\n\n'\"I say,\" expostulated the figure, looking very much scared; \"don't do that again.\"\n'\"Why not?\" demanded the baron.\n\n'\"Because it gives me pain all over,\" replied the figure. \"Sigh as much as you please: that does me good.\"\n\n'The baron sighed mechanically at the mention of the word; the figure, brightening up again, handed him the hunting-knife with most winning politeness.\n\n'\"It's not a bad idea though,\" said the baron, feeling the edge of the weapon; \"a man killing himself because he has too much money.\"\n\n'\"Pooh!\" said the apparition, petulantly, \"no better than a man's killing himself because he has none or little.\"\n\n'Whether the genius unintentionally committed himself in saying this, or whether he thought the baron's mind was so thoroughly made up that it didn't matter what he said, I have no means of knowing. I only know that the baron stopped his hand, all of a sudden, opened his eyes wide, and looked as if quite a new light had come upon him for the first time.\n\n'\"Why, certainly,\" said Von Koeldwethout, \"nothing is too bad to be retrieved.\"\n\n'\"Except empty coffers,\" cried the genius.\n\n'\"Well; but they may be one day filled again,\" said the baron.\n\n'\"Scolding wives,\" snarled the genius.\n\n'\"Oh! They may be made quiet,\" said the baron.\n\n'\"Thirteen children,\" shouted the genius.\n\n'\"Can't all go wrong, surely,\" said the baron.\n\n'The genius was evidently growing very savage with the baron, for holding these opinions all at once; but he tried to laugh it off, and said if he would let him know when he had left off joking he should feel obliged to him.\n\n'\"But I am not joking; I was never farther from it,\" remonstrated the baron.\n\n'\"Well, I am glad to hear that,\" said the genius, looking very grim, \"because a joke, without any figure of speech, IS the death of me. Come! Quit this dreary world at once.\"\n\n'\"I don't know,\" said the baron, playing with the knife; \"it's a dreary one certainly, but I don't think yours is much better, for you have not the appearance of being particularly comfortable. That puts me in mind\u2014what security have I, that I shall be any the better for going out of the world after all!\" he cried, starting up; \"I never thought of that.\"\n\n'\"Dispatch,\" cried the figure, gnashing his teeth.\n\n'\"Keep off!\" said the baron. 'I'll brood over miseries no longer, but put a good face on the matter, and try the fresh air and the bears again; and if that don't do, I'll talk to the baroness soundly, and cut the Von Swillenhausens dead.' With this the baron fell into his chair, and laughed so loud and boisterously, that the room rang with it.\n\n'The figure fell back a pace or two, regarding the baron meanwhile with a look of intense terror, and when he had ceased, caught up the stake, plunged it violently into its body, uttered a frightful howl, and disappeared.\n\n'Von Koeldwethout never saw it again. Having once made up his mind to action, he soon brought the baroness and the Von Swillenhausens to reason, and died many years afterwards: not a rich man that I am aware of, but certainly a happy one: leaving behind him a numerous family, who had been carefully educated in bear and boar-hunting under his own personal eye. And my advice to all men is, that if ever they become hipped and melancholy from similar causes (as very many men do), they look at both sides of the question, applying a magnifying-glass to the best one; and if they still feel tempted to retire without leave, that they smoke a large pipe and drink a full bottle first, and profit by the laudable example of the Baron of Grogzwig.'\n\n'The fresh coach is ready, ladies and gentlemen, if you please,' said a new driver, looking in.\n\nThis intelligence caused the punch to be finished in a great hurry, and prevented any discussion relative to the last story. Mr Squeers was observed to draw the grey-headed gentleman on one side, and to ask a question with great apparent interest; it bore reference to the Five Sisters of York, and was, in fact, an inquiry whether he could inform him how much per annum the Yorkshire convents got in those days with their boarders.\n\nThe journey was then resumed. Nicholas fell asleep towards morning, and, when he awoke, found, with great regret, that, during his nap, both the Baron of Grogzwig and the grey-haired gentleman had got down and were gone. The day dragged on uncomfortably enough. At about six o'clock that night, he and Mr Squeers, and the little boys, and their united luggage, were all put down together at the George and New Inn, Greta Bridge.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/1234147", "artist_names": "George Jones", "full_title": "The Race Is On by\u00a0George\u00a0Jones", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/061f4b830b05bd6076bcca5add11eb7d.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/061f4b830b05bd6076bcca5add11eb7d.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1234147, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 195999, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1650477305, "path": "/George-jones-the-race-is-on-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/George-jones-the-race-is-on-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1964, "month": 11, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "November 1, 1964", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Nov. 1, 1964", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/061f4b830b05bd6076bcca5add11eb7d.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/061f4b830b05bd6076bcca5add11eb7d.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 17642}, "title": "The Race Is On", "title_with_featured": "The Race Is On", "updated_by_human_at": 1650477305, "url": "https://genius.com/George-jones-the-race-is-on-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/47668", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/848ecec1b2ce7bd1ffaf301610861db0.720x321x1.jpg", "id": 47668, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/359edc07f34cc74189eaec0aa62c1735.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "George Jones", "slug": "George-jones", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/George-jones"}, "artist": "George Jones", "lyrics": "The Race Is On Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside\nLike my heart's sprung a big leak\nAnd the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful\nThat I may never shake\nNow you might say that I was taking it hard\nSince you wrote me off with a call\nBut don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow\nWhen I may break right down and bawll\n\n[Chorus]\nNow the race is on\nAnd here comes pride up the back stretch\nHeartache's a-going to the inside\nMy tears are holding back\nThey're trying not to fall\nMy heart's out of the running\nTrue love's scratched for another's sake\nThe race is on, and it looks like heartache's\nAnd the winner loses all\n[Verse 2]\nOne day I had ventured in love, never once suspecting\nWhat the final results would be\nHow I lived in fear of waking up each morning\nAnd finding that you'd gone from me\nThere's aching and pain in my heart\nFor the day was the one that I hated to face\nSomebody new came up to win her\nAnd I came out in second place\n\n[Chorus]\nNow the race is on\nAnd here comes pride up the back stretch\nHeartache's a-going to the inside\nMy tears are holding back\nThey're trying not to fall\nMy heart's out of the running\nTrue love's scratched for another's sake\nThe race is on, and it looks like heartache's\nAnd the winner loses allYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/3091350", "artist_names": "Clarence The Kid (Ft.

What do you\u2026?\nI don\u2019t know if I feel the connection\nI don\u2019t\u2026 I thought we were good, like I thought things were working fine\nI just\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\n\n[Verse 2: Clarence the Kid]\nAs of late, we\u2019ve been going through the ringer\nBut you still got that two heart ring upon your finger\nWhich tells me that you\u2019re in it for the long haul\nIt\u2019s been days since the last call, look\nIt\u2019s been a long time you and me have been together\nIt was sunny at first now there\u2019s so much stormy weather\nDamn, you had a brother feeling lighter than a feather\nNow my heart is getting heavy and the gravity won\u2019t let up\nBut keep your head up, maybe things will get better\nAnd we can be like we were, 2015 in December\nI remember sitting on that bench you had that college sweater\nUh, I should\u2019ve known when I saw that college sweater that\nThe road ahead would bumpy and rough\nPlus the distance in between us would be making it tough\nThinking back, girl those times was the happiest stuff\nNowadays I think I\u2019ve had enough, but you\u2019re still great\nYou might also like[Hook: Warren Hastings]\nBabygirl you\u2019re so great\nI don\u2019t wanna fight\nI don\u2019t wanna fight\nBabygirl you\u2019re so great\nI don\u2019t wanna fight\nWe\u2019ve got so much to lose\nBabygirl you\u2019re so great\nI can\u2019t keep losing you\nOh baby, no, no, no\nBabygirl you\u2019re so great\nBut what I really need\nIs what\u2019s best for me\n\n[Interlude: Clarence the Kid & Kyana Smith]\nYeah I\u2026 I feel like this isn\u2019t really working out\nHonestly, I think you need to figure out who you are first, and we can talk about this later\nYeah, okay\u2026 I guess that would be best...\n\n[Verse 3: Clarence the Kid]\nNo, this ain\u2019t a break up song\nBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a make up song\nI still can\u2019t tell how this has all gone wrong\nWhen we\u2019ve been loving each other for such a long\nTime, to tell the truth I\u2019ve been crying\nI\u2019ve got so many pieces of myself that been dying\nI strapped myself into this rollercoaster ride\nSaw our future from the top of the hill as we were climbing\n(But now we\u2019re falling down the other side)\nThe coaster should have come with a sign\nThat said heart must be this tough to ride\nBut I never got the message\nAnd babygirl I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s bout to happen\nWe might crash, we might be okay\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, at the end of the day\nGirl you\u2019ve been greatEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

Assembly of Nihilo\n\n\n[You see a soul right outside the Assembly.]\n\nSOUL:\nThe Mantra attacked the Assembly of Nihilo. Is this the end of Nihilo?\n\n[You enter the Assembly of Nihilo. You see a strange pillar in the center of\nthe room that is dripping with Magatsuhi. You speak to an Oni demon.]\n\nDEMON:\nHahaha! World of stillness, my ass! Creation? Yeah, right! The Assembly of\nNihilo is in shambles! Hahahahahaha!\n\n[You walk to the Core on floor B2.]\n\n[You can hear sounds coming from inside the room.\n\n[You enter and see Hijiri. He turns toward you, looking startled.]\n\nHIJIRI:\n*sigh* Thank god it's just you. I thought I was ambushed. Don't scare me\nlike that! ...Well, you look like you're alright. I'm sorry about what\nhappened last time. Yeah, I screwed up...But, it worked out for the best. I\nhad no idea they had a base this big...If I had used that thing correctly,\nyou would have been here all by yourself! ...I have some idea what's going\non. The Mantra launched their assault at just the right time. Thanks to\nthem, my arrival went unnoticed.\n.....\nHey, this might sound crazy, but... Did you join the Mantra?\n\t       CHOICES\n\n\t  1)   Yeah, I did.\n\t\n\t       ...I see.\n\t       Well, it's your decision, so I won't say anything.\n\t\n2)   Why would I do that?\n\t\n\t       Oh, so it's just a rumor. You seem so much stronger, I\n\t       thought it might be true...Oh well.\n\n\nHIJIRI:\nThis entire room is a facility for collecting Magatsuhi. We're at the center\nof that big hole you see from outside. It was destroyed during the assault,\nand now it's completely shut down. But, this place was filled with tons of\nMagatsuhi just a moment ago. Those Mantra guys beat the hell outta this\nplace. I don't blame them... Anybody would assume that this is the core of\nNihilo. They just left here, acting like they ruled the world...\n...not realizing that Hikawa fooled them. I wouldn't have known either, if I\ndidn't use the Amala Network to get here...The flow of Magatsuhi seems a\nlittle strange. It's cleverly disguised, but this is just bait. The real\ncore must be located somewhere else inside the base...And that's where\nHikawa will be.\n[The core shakes.]\n\nHIJIRI:\nDamn it, I better not stick around much longer...The commotion caused by the\nMantra has pretty much died down. It'll be even more dangerous now. I wanted\nto meet Hikawa in person, but... I'm not gonna fool myself. I know I won't\nsurvive that long. On your way here, did you see a corridor that you\ncouldn't enter, one that was spinning? I deactivated it, so you should be\nable to go through it now. That's about all the help I can offer...It's up\nto you to decide how to deal with Hikawa. You've come this far...If you turn\nback now, you'll regret it, right? Alright then... See ya.\n\n[He leaves, and you are now outside the core.]\n\n[The floor is stable.]\n\n[You head to floor B10, and come to another door.]\n\n[You sense a strong power from beyond the door.]\n\n[You enter and see two demons talking in front of another strange, spinning\npillar.]\n\nKOPPA:\nThose idiot Mantra demons fell for it hook, line and sinker. They're\nprobably getting cocky, thinking that they destroyed the core unit.\nPower-shmower. Power's nothing without brains!\n\n[Koppa turns around.]\n\nKOPPA:\n.....Hm? Who're you?\n\nINCUBUS:\nHmmm...I don't know who you're with, but it looks like you have some brains.\nYou just wanna make a name for yourself by taking Commander Hikawa's head,\nhuh? Just our luck... We were getting bored of the Mantra's stupidity. We\nneed to welcome our guests and show them off to their afterlife comfortably.\n\nBOTH:\nDiiiiiieeeeeeee!!\n\n[You fight them.]\n\n[You obtained the [Yellow Kila].]\n\n[You see a soul.]\n\nSOUL:\n...Oh, a wise guy, eh??? Did you come here after Commander Hikawa?\n\n\t CHOICES\n\t\n1)   Yes.\n\t\n\t       Commander Hikawa is on Floor B15 of the core. But,\n\t       you need the [four Kilas], stakes that control the\n\t       Magatsuhi in this structure, to get to him. You saw\n\t       those four pedestals on the way here, right? Use the\n\t       Kilas there...Occasionally, there are visitors like\n\t       you, but they all disappear up ahead. They all fall\n\t       prey to the traps made by the great Commander Hikawa.\n\t       So, why tell you all this? I figure you have the\n\t       right to know before you die...\n\t\n2)   No.\n\t\n\t       If you're just here to get in some rubbernecking, I\n\t       suggest you turn back. I can't guarantee your safety\nanywhere past here.\n\n[In the next room, you see another soul.]\n\nSOUL:\n..........\nThis is the storehouse for Magatsuhi. It's separated into three floors, and\neach leads to a storeroom where a Kila is kept. You see that switch? It's\nset up so that it changes the flow of Magatsuhi. *chuckle*  In other words,\nif you don't use the switches properly, you'll never make it to the\nstorerooms.\n\n[You complete the puzzle room and head north, where you see a soul.]\n\nSOUL:\nIn each of the storerooms is a demon guarding the Kila. Even if someone\nwere to make it that far, they'd be killed anyway. So, that's why we don't\nhave to panic.\n\n[You head north and come across the White Treasure Room.]\n\n[You sense a strong power from beyond the door.]\n\n[You enter, and an Eligor appears.]\n\nELIGOR:\nI am Eligor, one of the fallen angels. I guard this Kila under the order of\nour commander. Now... You seem to have some brains, unlike those Mantra\nfools. I like those with intelligence. To show you my respect, I will kill\nyou painlessly. I won't let you have the Kila... Die!!\n\n[You fight him, and open the cache cube in the room to obtain the [White Kila].\nYou complete the next puzzle room and enter another room where an Eligor\nappears.]\n\nDEMON GUARD:\nAlright, that's enough...\n\n[You fight him, and make your way to the Red Treasure Room.]\n\n[You sense a strong power from beyond the door.]\n\n[You enter and open a cache cube containing the [Red Kila]. When you attempt\nto leave the room, you see a Berith demon.]\n\nBERITH:\nHalt...\nI am Berith, the great duke of hell.\nInsolent scoundrel, put down the Kila and begone!\n\n\t       CHOICES\n\t\n1)   Yes.\n\t\n\t       Then, hurry and begone! No, wait... I can see your\n\t       future...I can see your face and body bloodied by my\n\t       hands...If that is the future, then so shall it be!\n\t       Die!!\n\t\n\t  2)   No.\n\t\n\t       I see...Then, prepare yourself...\n\t       ...for my spear shall pierce through your insolent\n\t       skull!\n\t\n\n[You finish another puzzle, and move on the the next. During the final\npuzzle, a Kaiwan will occasionally appear to switch things up and say the\nfollowing.]\n\nMYSTERIOUS DEMON:\nOh, no you don't! I won't let you get past here. How's this?\n\n[After saying this, he hits a switch.]\n\n[You will eventually come to the Green Treasure Room. You open the cache cube,\nbut it is empty. You leave the room and are stopped.]\n\nVOICE:\nHahahaha... What took you so long? Had a hard time figuring out those\nswitches at the storehouse?\n\n[Kaiwan appears.]\n\nKAIWAN:\nI'm Kaiwan... Sorry, but I can't let you have the Kila. So, take a hike.\nHahahaha!!\n\n[Kaiwan fled.]\n\n[You chase after him, and in the room with many doors you enter the third\ndoor on the left.]\n\n[ The door is unlocked.]\n[ Will you enter?]\n\n[You enter and see three Kaiwan demons.]\n\nKAIWAN:\nThat's right... I'm the real one. It's been fun! It's truly regrettable,\nbut I have to kill you now...Playtime's over.\n\n[You fight them.]\n\n[You obtained the [Green Kila].]\n\n[You go back to the main room and use the Kilas on the light pillars. A\nstairway is revealed. You go down the stairs and take the elevator to floor\nB15. You head to the True Core.]\n\n[You sense a strong power from beyond the door.]\n\n[You enter and see one of those strange blue pillars. Magatsuhi flows from\nit into the floor. Hikawa is standing in front of the pillar.]\n\nHIKAWA:\nInteresting...So, you found your way here. I guess the members of Mantra\naren't as thick as I thought...\n\n[He turns around to face you.]\n\nHIKAWA:\nNow, this is a big surprise. You're that boy from the hospital, correct?\nI'm amazed that you're still alive. And judging by your appearance...you've\ngained considerable strength. Why have you come here?\n...Are you here to see me?\n\n\t\nCHOICES\n:\n\t  1)   Yes.\n\t\n\t       ...I see. Even though I nearly killed you, you've\n\t       tracked me down to obtain the answers you seek.\n\t\n\t  2)   No.\n\t\n\t       Then, are you here to steal the Magatsuhi, like the\n\t       Mantra? No... That's not it. But, I have an idea why\n\t       you're really here.\n\t\n\n[Hikawa begins walking.]\n\nHIKAWA:\n...Very well. I commend you for reaching this place on your own.\nIf it is truth that you seek, then I will reveal everything...\n...all there is to know of this world. Take a look at this device...\nIts function is to collect the Magatsuhi.\nYou must have seen one like it on the upper level.\nDo you know why Magatsuhi exists?\n\n\t  CHOICES\n\n\t  1)   Yes.                                                                                                                   :\n\t       No, not simply for demons to consume. That's a\n\t       ridiculous oversimplification...\n\t\n\t  2)   No.\n\t\n\t       Remember this... In this world, you might as well be\n\t       dead if you don't fully understand Magatsuhi.\n\n\nHIKAWA:\nMagatsuhi... It's used as an offering. It is the power needed to call\nforth the god of creation. It is essential to this world's existence. One\nwho possesses a strong will can change everything in this world. When\n'Reason'--one's ideology--has been spread, and Magatsuhi has been gathered,\ngod will descend from above and reshape the very foundation of the world.\nYes, for the sole purpose of creation, this world of chaos was brought into\nexistence...by me. Soon, my dream will be realized. A complete circle of\nstillness, in harmony with the workings of time... The world of Shijima will\nbe born. Mantra believes they've destroyed this base, but as you can see,\nthe core is fully functional... Nothing more needs to be done. The targeted\namount of Magatsuhi will be reached shortly. However, they deserve to be\npunished. We'll use them as an example...of what happens to those who oppose\nthe Assembly of Nihilo. This is a good opportunity. Witness what is about to\ntake place. Using the Magatsuhi stored here, I will call on my new strength.\nThe time has come... Activate the Nightmare System!\n\n[The True Core shakes, and the Magatsuhi stops flowing. The True Core goes\ndark, and the opening on the top of the Assembly bursts forth with Magatsuhi.\nYou see above the tower at  Ikebukuro - Magatsuhi starts to rise slowly from\nit.]\n\nHIKAWA:\nDo you understand what is happening? It's a system which gives me total\ncontrol over the flow of Magatsuhi on a worldwide scale... This tiny facility\npales in comparison. As my first target, I have selected Ikebukuro, the home\nof Mantra's headquarters. The Magatsuhi in that area will be depleted, and\nthe Mantra will die out in no time.\n\n[He turns around.]\n\nHIKAWA:\n...Oh, I forgot to mention. Yuko Takao plays a key role in this system.\nShe's been a great help to me. Her abilities as the Maiden have been\ninvaluable...Are you worried about Yuko?\n\nCHOICES\n\n\t  1)   Yes.\n\t\n\t       I am sorry to say, but she is not here. I doubt that\n\t       you will ever see her again. She is the Maiden of\n\t       creation...not the teacher you once knew.\n\t\n\t  2)   No.\n\t\n\t       You risked your life and came all this way, and you\nsay it was not for her? ...Well, it doesn't matter.\n\t       She is not here anyways.\n\t\n\nHIKAWA:\nYou were not meant to survive the Conception in the first place. Your\nattachment to the previous world will only serve to deepen your despair...\nI should not have been so merciful back then. Your pain, your suffering...\nI shall end it here. I don't know what hopes and dreams you brought with\nyou here, but...there is not a single things that you can accomplish in\nthis world.\n\n[He raises his hand, and Ose appears.]\n\nHIKAWA:\nNow, go and join the others that you have lost...\n\n[You fight Ose.]\n\n[You obtained the Magatama [Anathema].]\n\nOSE:\n...So you defeated me. But, you will never be able to find our commander, or\nthe Maiden. The Nightmare System has been activated. This base will soon be\nclosed down, and the way to the Maiden will be lost forever... Begone, demon!\nIt is we, the Assembly of Nihilo, who will create the new world!\n\n[Ose disappears, and you are outside of the Assembly.]\n\nSOUL:\nWhat's going on? Didn't the Mantra win??? I heard that a bunch of Magatsuhi\nwas sucked up from Ikebukuro!!\n\n[You go back to Ginza, and transport to Ikebukuro. You enter Mantra\nHeadquarters, where you see Chiaki leaning against a pillar.]\n\nCHIAIKI:\n...Hi, Hero. I heard about the trial by combat, and I thought it might be\nyou who was the winner. Getting here was tough, to say the least...but I'm\nglad I made it.\n\n[Chiaki walks toward you.]\n\nCHIAKI:\nHero...There's something I want to tell you. I decided to play by the rules\nof this world. You know what the purpose of this new world is, right?\n\n[She stops walking.]\n\nCHIAKI:\nI...I want to try my hand at the creation.\n...You probably think I'm crazy. But, I remembered that voice...\n...that voice I heard when the world changed...\nYou must've heard it too, Hero, since you survived.\n\n[She walks further toward you. White light surround her. You suddenly see her\nin a room of red silhouettes of people sitting at desks in a classroom.]\n\nCHIAKI:\n...After we went our separate ways, I started thinking. Not just about what\nI have to do in this world, but why the world ended up like this. And then,\nI realized...that there were too many unnecessary things occupying the\nprevious world. There were lots of things, and lots of people...But,\nnothing new was being made. Time passed, and nothing changed. What the world\nreally needed...it was not getting.\n\n[The red silhouettes vanish, leaving only the desks and Chiaki in the room.]\n\nCHIAKI:\n...it's true that I lost everything. It was the saddest thing imaginable.\nBut, I survived the Conception. I was chosen...That's what I'm going to\nbelieve, and now,  I have to look forward. I still feel a great sadness in\nmy heart... but if I can swallow it down... endless possibilities await...\nThe power of creation...will be mine.\n\n[Chiaki sits on the teacher's desk as the student desks and chalkboard melt\naway, leaving only Chiaki, the front desk, and whiteness.]\n\nCHIAKI:\n'Choose,' the voice said to me.  The world doesn't need any more worthless\nthings... That's why I want to create my ideal society, a paradise ruled by\nthe strong, the chosen...The world of Yosuga. Hero, you've fought your way\nthis far. You know what I'm saying, don't you?\n\nCHOICES\n\n\t  1)   Yeah, I get it.\n\t\n\t       ...I'm happy to hear that. I knew you'd understand,\n\t       Hero. I might ask you to help me out, then.\n\t\n\t  2)   I don't see your point.\n\t\n\t       .....\n\t       ...That's too bad. I was hoping you'd understand.\n\t       But, no matter what you say, I won't change my mind.\n\t\n\t  3)  I don't know what to say.\n\t\n\t       ...I see. But I believe in you, Hero.\n\t       I believe that one day you'll come to accept it.\n\n\n[You are back in Mantra Headquarters.]\n\nCHIAKI:\nI'm going to start collecting Magatsuhi. Honestly, I don't know where to\nbegin... But, since Yosuga is the Reason of the strong, I'll see what I can\ndo on my own first...I'm glad we had the chance to talk today.  We both\nsurvived the Conception...I'm sure we'll cross paths again. See you later,\nHero.\n\n[Chiaki left.]\n\n[You enter fully and head for the top floor. Magatsuhi rises all throughout\nthe Headquarters. You enter Gozu-Tennoh's Chamber.]\n\nGOZU-TENNOH:\nYou have returned, mighty demon... Have you not seen it with your own\neyes...? The stronghold of Nihilo was laid to waste by my army...\nThen, why...?\n\n[You see Magatsuhi streaming from his body.]\n\nGOZU-TENNOH:\nBehold... Magatsuhi escapes from my body, against my will... And I am not\nthe only one! All the members of Mantra are being drained of their\nMagatsuhi...!\n\n[The chained Manikin convulses on the floor.]\n\nMANIKIN:\nCurse you, Nihilo! ...What sort of devious trick did they use!? Oh, the\nhumiliation! I can see...the Maiden...where the Magatsuhi is drawn to...But\nalas, we are utterly powerless... We have no choice but to wait for our\ndoom... Woe to our leader! Gozu-Tennoh!!\n\nGOZU-TENNOH:\n...No! I will not die! My body may perish, but my spirit will live on! In\ntime, the one worthy of my power will come. It is there that I shall return!!\nI will not let them create a world of stillness!! What good is a world\nwithout strength!? I will not forget this rage, this fire that burns my\nflesh and soul! My kingdom shall rise again...!!\n...Gu...oh.....\n\n[Gozu-Tennoh crumbles, bursts, his head falls to the ground. Hero ducks out\nof the way. The light from Gozu's yellow eyes goes out. You are now outside\nthe chamber.]\n\nVOICE:\nI knew you would be here...\n\n[The camera pans around to show Thor.]\n\nTHOR:\nGozu-Tennoh has... No...The Mantra has been utterly destroyed by Nihilo's\nattack...The Assembly of Nihilo had a higher goal than just ruling over\nTokyo. We, on the other hand, did nothing more than enforce a reign of\nterror....That is the reason we lost. And all those that we called comrades\nhave deserted us...You had a friend who was being held prisoner here, did\nyou not? Both of you are free to do whatever you want... I have no business\nhere anymore. There is no point in guarding an abandoned city...Farewell.\nI will go on a quest to realize my dream of a world where the strong thrive.\nIf you are truly strong, then we shall meet again...\n\n[Thor leaves. You head for the basement of the Mantra Headquarters, and see\nIsamu behind a door.]\n\nISAMU:\n...Yo, Hero. It's been a while... I heard about you...even from this cell.\nYou participated in the attack on Nihilo, huh? ...Did you know that Ms.\nTakao is the Maiden? That's what I wanted to tell you when I got caught,\nbut... Either way, it doesn't look like you brought her back... Damn, even\nyou couldn't pull through...I was counting on that demonic power of yours...\nThe Mantra's finished, Nihilo's gaining ground...and we still have no idea\nwhere our teacher is...\n\n[Isamu holds his hat and looks down.]\n\nISAMU:\nWhat the hell are we doing, wandering around in this godforsaken world...?\n\n[He looks up at you again.]\n\nISAMU:\n...I guess I have to place my bets on that guy. I heard a rumor about this\nincredible Manikin. They say he can see the future...He actually predicted\nthe fall of the Mantra. Maybe he can tell us about Ms. Takao...and what we\nshould do from here. The last thing I heard was that he was taken to prison,\nso he's probably still there. I'm gonna head off to Kabukicho and look for\nhim. There's no place where I can be safe...So, I'll take my chances. Lates.\n\n[Isamu left.]\n\n[A door in the east part of the Headquarters that was previously guarded is\nnow clear. You go through it, and head toward Kabukicho prison.]\n\n\n===============================================================================\n12. Kabukicho Prison\n\n\n\nSOUL:\nThis is Kabukicho Prison...Huh? This is just a run-down building? You got\nthat wrong. This is a prison!!  Even though the Mantra fell, there's still\nloads of Manikins being held here.\n\n[You check out various rooms, and they are empty. In a few, though, you hear\nvoices.]\n\nVOICE:\nSave us... We're trapped in the mirage...\n\nVOICE:\nMizuchi is holding us captive in his mirage... Someone save us!\n\n[You walk a bit and see a Naga in front of a Mysterious Wall.]\n\nEX-GUARD:\nHeheheh... Gozu-Tennoh is gone. This prison now belongs to [Mizuchi]...\nI feel like torturing those [Manikins in the mirage]! I think I'll go do\nthat right now. Heheheh...\n\n[The demon disappeared.]\n\n[As you walk back toward entrance:]\n\n[You can hear a voice coming from somewhere.]\n\nEX-GUARD:\nC'mon, c'mon, c'mon! You better keep it up, or you'll be dead! You want me\nto stop? You REALLY want me to stop? ...Well, too bad!\nHyahahahahahahahahahaha!!\n\nVOICE:\nGaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!! Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!!\n\nEX-GUARD:\nHyahahahahahahahahahaha!! Phew!! I think I'll let you off with that for\ntoday. I have [this], so I can come and go into the mirage as I please...\nI'll be back!\n\n[You head back to the Mysterious Wall, and see the Naga again.]\n\nEX-GUARD:\nWho the hell are you!? Wait, you couldn't be...!?\n\n\t CHOICES\n\n\t  1)   You better believe it.\n\t\n\t       ...I-I don't care! This is paradise for us ex-Mantra!\n\t       Whatever you did during that attacks on Nihilo doesn't\n\t       mean shit here!!\n\t\n\t  2)   It's just a coincidence.\n\t\n\t       Whaddya think you're doing here then, punk!? This is\n\t       paradise for us ex-Mantra! I'll give you a taste of my\n\t       torturing techniques!!\n\t\n\t\n\n[You obtained the [Umugi Stone].]\n\n[There is a mysterious wall.]\n[Will you use the Umugi Stone?]\n\n[You say 'Yes.']\n\n[You used the Umugi Stone.]\n[The building has been shrouded in a mirage.]\n\n[Everything turns upside down - you are walking on the ceiling. All of the\ncolors change to black and white. You can now see the Manikins entrapped\nthere...they appear right side up because they were hung upside down in their\ncells. You come across a Manikin who is not chained by his feet.]\n\n[A Manikin is doing something.]\n\nDIGGING MANIKIN:\n.....Shit! A Mantra demon!?\n..........? Nooooooooooooo! My spoon broke! Look what you did! I was almost\ndone digging, too...It's your fault! I needed that spoon... Take\nresponsibility! ...I know. How about you getting me another spoon? The\n[Collector Manikin] should be around here somewhere. He has just about\nanything. Find him and grab a [spoon]. You got that? You're responsible!\n\n[You go find the Collector Manikin.]\n\nCOLLECTOR MANIKIN:\n*cough*\n.........?\n...I know you!\nYou're the demon I met in the Great Underpass...\n...Huh? A spoon?\n.........\n...I see.\n...Alright, then.\nYou did help me... with the Bill...\n*cough* I'll give you my spoon...\n\n[ You obtained the [spoon].]\n\nCOLLECTOR MANIKIN:\n...While you're at it, could you rescue me...?\n\n[You head back to the Digging Manikin.]\n\nDIGGING MANIKIN:\nDid you bring me the spoon?\n\n[Will you hand him the spoon?]\n\nCHOICES\n\n\t  1)   Yes.\n\t\n\t       Whoa! This is one powerful spoon!\n\t\n\t       The Manikin began digging.\n\t        The hole was dug instantly.\n\t\n\t       ...This is incredible. I dug the hole in a flash.\n\t       Alright, I'm outta here. See ya!\n\t\n\t        The Manikin jumped into the hole.\n\t\n\t  2)   No.\n\t\n\t       What the heck!? I was counting on you!! Hurry up and\n\t       get that spoon from the Collector Manikin!\n\t\n\n\n[You use the Umugi stone and head back to this room to jump in the hole that\nwas dug by the Manikin. You walk walk for a bit, and hear his voice.]\n\nDIGGING MANIKIN'S VOICE:\n...Dammit!!  I was able to escape from my cell...\nBut I need to defeat Mizuchi to escape from the mirage...\n\n[You head to the top floor of the Prison, and hear a scream.]\n\nSCREAM:\nArgh! Stop it! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!\n\nMANIKIN PRISONER:\nYou there, listen to what I have to say! You see those doors over there?\nMizuchi, the boss of this prison, is in there! Defeat him and save Futomimi,\nplease!!\n\n[You walk up to the door and enter to see Mizuchi.]\n\nMIZUCHI:\nDAMN YOU PESTS! YOU THINK YOU CAN BEAT ME? NOT A CHANCE! I'LL TEAR YOU\nAPART!\n\n[You fight Mizuchi.]\n\n[You obtained the Magatama [Miasma].]\n\n[The mirage is disappearing.]\n\n[You open the door that was behind Mizuchi, and a Manikin enters from other\nroom.]\n\nMALE MANIKIN:\n............!\n.....You're.....\n...a human...? No, a demon...? ...I see. You are the 'Demi-fiend' I\nprophesied about. Very interesting. Thank you for defeating Mizuchi. Now,\nwe can finally escape from this prison. My name is [Futomimi]. You may know\nit already, but I can see into the near future. I've been waiting for you\nto come and save us, you who are both human and demon... You may be\ninterested to know that there is a [young man] trapped in the other room. It\nseems he came to see me, but he was also caught. Hm...?\n\n[He touches his forehead.]\n\nFUTOMIMI:\n...I see, he is your friend. You should see him, then. I sense a strange\nenergy in him. I am worried about the other Manikins, so I must be going.\nThank you again for saving us...Now, if you'll excuse me.\n\n[Futomimi left.]\n\n[You go to the other room, and see Isamu standing in front of a blue pillar.\nHe turns around.]\n\nISAMU:\nWell, look who we have here...Hero.  Don't tell me you came to save me.\nYou're way too late.\n\n\t       CHOICES\n\t\n\t  1)   Talk back.\n\t\n\t       What are you pissed off for?\n\t       It's not like you went out of your way to help me.\n\t\n\t  2)   Apologize.\n\t\n\t       I don't want your apology. It won't change anything.\n\t\n\t  3)   Leave the room.\n\t\n\t       You're leaving? Sure, go ahead. I didn't expect\n\t       anything from you anyway.\n\n\nISAMU:\nIt's obvious I can't count on you or Ms. Takao anymore. No one's gonna help\nme in this world...I'll have to survive on my own.\n\n[Blue lightning begins to flash.]\n\nISAMU:\nWhen this world was created... I heard a voice that told me to search for\nthe truth. At the time, I didn't know what that meant... But, when I was\nlocked up in this room, I came to realize. Truth isn't something other\npeople can give you: you have to find it within yourself.\n\n[Isamu touches the pillar.]\n\nISAMU:\nAnd I opened the way without anybody's help. The Amala Network... What I'm\nlooking for is in there. The great power that'll lead me to the truth...\nIt's calling me...\n\n-[he barrel sucks Isamu in.]\n\n[Isamu disappeared...]\n\n[You leave the room and see Futomimi and the other Manikins.]\n\nFUTOMIMI:\nI have come again to thank you once more...We Manikins plan to leave the\narea. Together, we will find a way to live without suffering...Let me\nprophesy your future as a token of my gratitude.\n\n[He touches his forehead.]\n\nFUTOMIMI:\n...A man... at Ginza...\n...It seems that there is a man waiting for you at Ginza. Go and see him...\nWe must get going now. Again, thank you so much...Now, if you'll excuse us.\n\n[Futomimi led the other Manikins out.]\n\n[You use Amala Link to go to Ginza, as Futomimi suggested. You see Hijiri.]\n\nHIJIRI:\n...Hey, Hero! Looks like you're doing alright. How did you know I was here?\nI heard what Hikawa did. I didn't think he would wipe out the Mantra\ncompletely. Man, that Nightmare System... It's more powerful than I ever\nimagined. But, I haven't given up just yet. If he makes a move, it may give\nus some clues. Maybe we can figure out where the Nightmare System is located,\nor more about the Maiden...It's too bad this terminal is under Nihilo's\ncontrol. I can't do much digging without raising a red flag. We need to find\na terminal that Nihilo doesn't know about... Remember those Manikins that\nwere enslaved by the Mantra? I heard they're rebuilding the town of\n[Asakusa]. Maybe there's a terminal over there that Nihilo's unaware of.\nWith the Mantra out of the way, you should be able to get to Asakusa. It's\nway too dangerous for me to come along, though. I'll see what I can do with\nthis terminal...Wait a minute. I completely forgot about you. Hey, do you\nfeel like going to Asakusa? If you can get there and contact me through the\nAmala Network, it'll make my job much easier. I'm sure you're strong enough\nto make it to Asakusa. So... will you do it for me?\n\n\t    CHOICES\n\t  1)   Okay.\n\t\n\t       Thanks, I appreciate it. I'll tell you everything I\n\t       find out there, so let's stay in touch, alright?\n\t\n\t  2)   I'd rather not.\n\t\n\t       Oh, come on. You're not gonna let Nihilo have things\n\t       their way, are you? I'll tell you everything I find out\n\t       there...about Nihilo and the Maiden. Most importantly,\n\t       we have to stop Hikawa. So, you're going. Case closed.\n\t\n\t\n\nHIJIRI:\nI'll be waiting, then. You should check out the tunnel in [East Ikebukuro].\nIf the rumor is true, it'll take you to Asakusa. I'll be working on this\nterminal, but you'll probably have more luck than me. I'm counting on ya.\n\n[You make your way to Ikebukuro Tunnel.]\n\n\n===============================================================================\n13.

Then, die!\n\t\n\t       --He attacks.--\n\n\n[Once you have fought those three, you head to the main room to fight the\nlast one.]\n\nONGYO-KI:\nMy name is Ongyo-ki... Are you the one who slew my partners and awakened me!?\n\n\t        CHOICES\n\n\t  1)   I sliced and diced them.\n\t\n\t       Insolent fool!!!!\n\t       Learn your weakness through my illusions!\n\t\n\t  2)   Must be some other guy.\n\t\n\t       You cannot fool me!!\n\t       Learn your weakness through my illusions!\n\n\n[After the fight, you open a cache cube containing the Magatama [Murakumo].\nYou leave the Tunnel and come out in Kuramae Station. You head from there to\nAsakusa.]\n\n\n===============================================================================\n14. Asakusa\n\n\nMALE MANIKIN:\nWelcome to Asakusa, the city of the Manikins...Ah, it has such a sweet ring\nto it.\n\n[You enter the save terminal and see Hijiri.]\n\nHIJIRI:\nHey Hero, you made it. Sorry if I pressured you too much, but I managed to\nget here after all. It took a while, but I was finally able to pinpoint the\nroute to this terminal. Not bad for an ordinary human, eh?  Oh yeah, I found\nout something interesting about Asakusa. This is where the Manikins are\ncreated. They're made from the black mud that's scooped up from a river\naround here. No wonder they want to rebuild this town...Anyways, like I\nsuspected, the terminal here isn't under Nihilo's surveillance. It's perfect\nfor monitoring their activities and finding out about the Nightmare System.\nI just started investigating, so I need some time. It shouldn't take too\nlong, though. Why don't you go look around for a while?\n\n[You look around Asakusa. You approach the door to Mifunashiro, and\nFutomimi appears.]\n\nFUTOMIMI:\n...Hello, and welcome. Just as I foresaw, you have come to Asakusa. We are\nfated to meet again...Although, that is all I can say at this point. Have\nyou looked around Asakusa? Everyone is doing their best to restore the city.\nThis is the first city we Manikins have ever considered as our own, after\nall. However...Though you may 'see' our land, you may not 'enter' it any\nfurther. This is the holy land of the Manikins, [Mifunashiro]. Beyond here\nis our motherland, where we were born... Even if we owe you our lives, I\ncannot allow you past here. I'm truly sorry... Now, I must return to my\nmeditations. I have to foresee our new future. I need to find out what I\nneed to do to create a world where Manikins can live in peace.\n..........\n...Oh, yes. Beware of a Manikin named [Sakahagi]. He's a traitor to our\ncause, having committed various atrocities. He's probably hiding out\nsomewhere in Asakusa... He might cause you some trouble, but please\nunderstand that he is not one of us.\n..........\nNow, I must be going...\n\n[Futomimi left.]\n\n[In room next door:]\n\nMALE? MANIKIN:\nThose days when I used to be tortured by the Mantra...\nOh, it felt sooooo good!\n\nSOUL:\nI heard there was a human girl hanging around the Mantra's headquarters\nwhen they fell. She must have some guts.\n\n[Back in Asakusa:]\n\nFEMALE MANIKIN:\nWe're working hard to restore the city, but there's a bad Manikin that's\nruining our peace. He's ruthless, tearing off the skins of other Manikins.\nHe might be around here, so be careful!\n\n[You further investigate, and after going through west gate, you enter a\nplace that has blood all over floor.]\n\nMALE MANIKIN: (on floor)\nUh... Ugh.....\nIt's Sa...[Sakahagi]...\nTh-That traitor, Sakahagi is going wild... up ahead...\n\n[You see a door smeared with blood.]\n\n[You sense a strong power from beyond the door.]\n\n[You enter and see a Manikin covered in what appears to be a sweater made\nfrom the skin of human faces, crouched over the body of another Manikin.\nThere is a knife in his hand.]\n\nSTRANGE MANIKIN:\nYou should've just handed over your Magatsuhi... But instead, you decided to\noppose me...That was too funny. Well, I'm not complaining. Now, I have this\nnew skin to add to my collection...\n\n...!!\n\n[He stands up and turns around to face you.]\n\nSTRANGE MANIKIN:\nWho's there!? Damn, you had me scared for a second... I thought those\nManikins were back. They're pretty weak, all of them except this one guy\nthat escaped from the Mantra... He's been giving me a headache recently.\nIt would've made my life a lot easier if he'd been killed in Ikebukuro. I\nshould thank him, though, for bringing his followers here. It's like free\nMagatsuhi. I've been collecting Magatsuhi... Eventually, I'll have enough\npower to dominate all demons. You're a demon: you know how it is.\nYou're thirsty for some Magatsuhi yourself, aren't ya?\n\n\t    CHOICES\n\n\t  1)   Yeah, I am.\n\t\n\t       That's what I thought.\n\t       Hey, I think you and I will get along just fine.\n\t\n\t  2)   Not really.\n\t\n\t       You don't want Magatsuhi?  ...You're one weird demon.\n\t\n\t\n\nSTRANGE MANIKIN:\n...Well, it's time for me to go. Maybe we'll meet again, maybe not. We'll\nsee. Just remember... I'm Sakahagi, the future ruler of the demons...\n\n[You go back to the save terminal.]\n\nHIJIRI:\nHey, good timing. How was Asakusa? About the Nightmare System...I've got\ngood news. They say a picture is worth a thousand words...so here, take a\nlook.\n\n[The pillar spins. You see a tall tower absorbing a large amount of\nMagatsuhi.]\n\nHIJIRI:\nYou see it? That's the [Obelisk] in Chiyoda. The Nightmare System's inside\nit, along with all the Magatsuhi that's been collected. In other words,\nwe've found Nihilo's current headquarters...The system is probably being\noperated by that woman they call the Maiden. I have no idea how it works,\nbut we know it's dangerous.\n\n[The view switches back to Hijiri.]\n\nHIJIRI:\nIf I could, I'd go in there myself, but I'm just not strong enough. However,\nif no one does anything, Hikawa will take over the world for sure. I'm\nafraid I have to ask for your help again, Hero. You must stop the Nightmare\nSystem inside the Obelisk, and return the flow of Magatsuhi in the Vortex\nWorld back to normal. Use [the secondary entrance to Nihilo's old\nheadquarters] to reach the Obelisk. That entrance is locked right now, but\nI can take care of it. With this terminal, it'll be a piece of cake. The\nObelisk looks pretty tall, and who knows that kind of demons are gonna be\nthere. We don't know what kind of power this so-called Maiden has, either.\nIt's not gonna be easy, that's for sure... But, I know you can do it.\n\n[You transfer to Ginza, then head for the secondary entrance of the Assembly\nof Nihilo. You arrive at the Obelisk.]\n\n\n===============================================================================\n15. The Obelisk\n\n\nSOUL:\nThis is the Obelisk.\nThis is the closest you'll ever get to Kagutsuchi, in all of Tokyo.\n\nSOUL:\nThe Maiden is at the top floor. She is collecting Magatsuhi with her\npowers...\n\n[You walk for a bit, and a message flashes on screen.]\n\n[You sense a strong power.]\n\n[Three women appear.\n\nCOLD-SOUNDING WOMAN:\nHahahahaha... Just as Lord Hikawa predicted...\nIt seems a rat has wandered in!\n\nARROGANT-SOUNDING WOMAN:\nOhohoho... I assume you are here for that woman, but we three sisters are\nguarding the Obelisk... We are not like that useless Ose.\n\nCRUEL-SOUNDING WOMAN:\nAhaha... If you want her back, you must defeat us. Well, if you can get to\nus in the first place.\n\nCOLD-SOUNDING WOMAN:\nKagutsuchi repeats the process of birth and death. It will not wait for you.\nNow... Come!\n\nWOMEN:\nAhaha...\nHahahahahaha...\nOhohoho...\n\n[The women disappeared.]\n\n[You make your way through the Obelisk, and will eventually complete a\npuzzle during which you must fight three boss battles in a row.]\n\nCOLD-LOOKING WOMAN:\nHahahahaha... So, have you figured out how the puzzle works? I am Clotho,\nthe youngest of the Moirae Sisters. I shall wind the thread of your life!\n\n[You fight her, and she runs away before you kill her.]\n\nARROGANT-LOOKING WOMAN:\nOhohoho.. I will not allow you past here. I am Lachesis, the second of the\nMoirae Sisters. I measure the length of life.\nYour thread is reaching its end!\n\n[You fight her, and she runs away before you kill her.]\n\nCRUEL-LOOKING WOMAN:\nAhaha... Were you able to keep up with Kagutsuchi? I am Atropos, the eldest\nof the Moirae Sisters. How unlucky of you to meet me. I cut the threads of\nfate... In other words... Your fate is already sealed!\n\n[You fight her, and she runs away before you kill her.]\n\n[You travel a bit further, and eventually you must fight all of them once\nmore.]\n\nCLOTHO:\nHahahahaha...! We aren't letting you pass that easily!\n\nLACHESIS:\nDo not underestimate us!\n\nATROPOS:\nWe three Moirae Sisters will...\n\nCLOTHO:\nSpin!\n\nLACHESIS:\nMeasure!\n\nATROPOS:\nAnd snip your fate!!\n\n[You fight all three of them at once.]\n\n[You obtained the Magatama [Djed].]\n\n[There is a light coming from above.]\n[ Will you ascend?]\n\n[You choose to ascend, and in the center of room you see Ms. Takao hovering\nupside-down, Magatsuhi flowing through her body into a black pyramid. You\nreach out your hand and it all stops. The screen cuts to Ms. Takao on the\nfloor, with you crouched in front of her.]\n\nYUKO:\n...Thank you, Hero. I don't know why, but I had a feeling that you'd come\nand save me. It's funny... I told you that I'd be your strength, and you\nended up helping me instead. I have no power whatsoever. How can I control\nthe world, when I can't even take control of my own life...? As the Maiden,\nI just do Hikawa's bidding. 'I would like you to become the pillar of the\nnew world.' That's what he told me. In the end, I was nothing but a tool for\ncollecting Magatsuhi... It's true that the Conception did take place, and I\nassisted in making it happen. The world is about to be reborn, but as it\nstands now, the new world is going to be a far cry from what I had hoped for.\nI dreamed of an ideal world where people were grateful to be alive...\n\n...I didn't like how the world was before. People said they wanted peace,\nbut they continued to act selfishly, accepting no personal responsibility\nfor the world's problems. Nobody realized it, but they were not really happy.\nThey were simply lazy. No one had the desire to compete or become strong.\nAnd there was no need to, either. That's why I thought...that we'd eventually\nlose our power and fade away. No wonder I was used by Hikawa...But, it's\nnot over yet.\n\n[She stands and looks up at the pillar of light.]\n\nYUKO:\nThe world is still being recreated... Its shape is not yet fixed. It was\nhere that I discovered my god, a god that even Hikawa is unaware of...\nShe was drawn here by the power of Magatsuhi. She will surely teach me the\nReason for creation...\n\n[Yuko closes her eyes. When she next turns around to face you, her face is\ncovered with a splatter of purple. She sways to and fro, occasionally\nconvulsing. She is obviously possessed.]\n\nUNKNOWN GOD:\nFool who bears the name Freedom... Under the light of liberty, your wrongs\nshall be forgiven. I am [Aradia]. I have come from the far reaches of Amala.\n\nARADIA:\nIt is my duty to bestow freedom. Ask, and you shall be set free. If you deem\nyourself right, light will return to the world, but so will darkness. Pursue\nthe way of creation! You yourself are a world too.\nDo not obey others: do\nwhat you believe is right.\n\n[A flash of light.]\n\n[You received power from Aradia.]\n[ You can now employ 2 additional demons.]\n\nARADIA:\nThis woman will soon recover her lost power. She will set forth on the path\nof creation, and I will guide her. Go, and see the world with your own eyes.\nFrom there will your creation begin...\n\n[Her body begins to levitate, and disappears in a black cloud. Suddently, the\nold woman and blond child appear.]\n\nOLD WOMAN:\nOh dear, Aradia has entered this world. This can only mean trouble,\nmy little master.\n\n[He whispers to her.]\n\nOLD WOMAN:\nBe very thankful. My little master has given me permission to enlighten you.\nListen closely to what I am about to tell you. The time of creation for this\nVortex World is near. War will erupt amongst those who spread their Reason\nin hopes of shaping the new world. As a demon, you are forbidden to conceive\nyour own Reason... Which Reason will you side with? Which will you oppose?\nWill the Reason you choose persevere, or fail? Your suffering is my little\nmaster's delight. Struggle as hard as you can; You are free to follow\nwhichever Reason you like. My only wish is that you do not disappoint my\nlittle master with a dull ending...\n\n[The child and the old woman disappeared...]\n\n[You transport to Asakusa and see Hijiri.]\n\nHIJIRI:\nHero! You did it! I could tell from here that the flow of Magatsuhi had\nreturned to normal. Well, with this blow to Nihilo, Hikawa won't be able to\nmake his move for a while. I think we can take a little breather. But, how\ndid you stop the Nightmare System? Wasn't that Maiden operating it?\n\n\t   CHOICES\n\n\t  1)   I saved her.\n\t\n\t       So, Hikawa was using her, huh? Who knows what she'll\n\t       do now, but at least the Nightmare System is dead.\n\t\n\t  2)   I took care of her.\n\t\n\t       I see... She might have been one of the few surviving\n\t       humans, but I guess you had no choice...\n\t\n\t  3)   I don't want to talk about it.\n\t\n\t       Oh, you're not gonna tell me? ...Does it bother you\n\t       that much? If so, then I'll stop asking. I'm satisfied\n\t       knowing that the Nightmare System is out of commission.\n\t\n\nHIJIRI:\nOh yeah, it might seem like I'm making you do all the work, but...\n...I'm doing what I can. Let me share with you what I've found out so far,\nokay?\n\n\t CHOICES\n\n\t  1)   Sure.\n\t\n\t       Alright, listen up.\n\t\n\t  2)   No thanks.\n\t\n\t       Come on, man. Journalism is pointless without an\n\t       audience. I don't care if you're interested or not,\n\t       just listen.\n\n\nHIJIRI:\nTo create a new world, you must have a strong idea of what kind of world you\nwant to create. This idea is commonly referred to as a Reason. Now, to\nacquire a Reason, you must receive divine protection from a god, and this\nis where the Magatsuhi comes into play. You need a large quantity of\nMagatsuhi in order to summon a god. That's why Hikawa, a human, was\ncollecting Magatsuhi. Oh, I almost forgot. I met a human inside the Amala\nNetwork just a minute ago. It was a guy who was held captive by the Mantra.\nHis name's Isamu. Do you know him?\n\n\t    CHOICES\n\n\t  1)   Yes, I know him.\n\t\n\t       Yeah, that's what I thought.\n\t\n\t  2)   No, I don't.\n\t\nReally? There was a rumor that you were trying to help\n\t       him, but... Oh well.\n\t\n\nHIJIRI:\nAnyways, about Isamu... He actually seemed to be doing okay in Amala. If\nyou're unlucky, you can get swept away somewhere, or even worse, you can\nend up being absorbed by the Network. Well, in a world like this... one life\ndoesn't amount to much, and you're better off not getting involved. But if\nyou want, I can send you to where I met Isamu.\n\n[You speak to Hijiri again.]\n\nHIJIRI:\nDo you want me to transfer you to where Isamu is?\n\n\t   CHOICES\n\n\t  1)   Yeah, can you?\n\t\n\t       Here we go. By the way, tell Isamu not to spend too\n\t       much time in there.\n\t\n\t       --He transfers you to Amala Network.--\n\t\n\t  2)   Not right now.\n\t\n\t       Just let me know when you're ready.\n\t\n\t  3)   Tell me again how creation works.\n\t\n\t       It was a little confusing, wasn't it? No big deal.\n\t\n\t       --He repeats the explanation from above.--\n\t\n\t       ...Well, there you go.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1576982",

EXT. NEW YORK - LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY\nThe STATUE OF LIBERTY stands watch at the mouth of the Hudson.  Over\nscene, we SUPER TITLE:\n\nNEW YORK CITY - JULY 1976\n\n2. JERSEY CITY PIER - DAY\nA live news update.  Network correspondent CINDY CHAN stands at the\nedge of the  dock, the statue plainly visible in the distance behind\nher.\nCINDY\n-- insist that the situation is under control.  Authorities have just\nagreed to the release of nine Radical Front prisoners in hopes of\nfreeing the hostages.\n(adjusting her hair)\nWe repeat: terrorists have taken Liberty Island, and are holding some\nforty hostages -- including tourists and maintenance workers --\ncaptive in the Statue of Liberty itself.\n\n3. FERRYBOAT - DAY\nThe ferry -- one of six anchored a half-mile off Liberty Island --\nhas been commandeered by a fully-armed SWAT TEAM.  The SWAT CAPTAIN,\nwho's in charge of negotiations, speaks to the terrorists via\nwalkie-talkie.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nYour demands have been met.  The prisoners and the money are on their\nway.  If you tune your TV to Channel 4 you'll see the copters\npreparing for takeoff.\n\n4. INT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT\nThe screen of a portable TV shows THREE HELICOPTERS lifting off from\nLaguardia.  We're in the OBSERVATION ROOM inside the statue's head.\nA TERRORIST holds a crowd of SQUEALING TOURISTS -- men, women,\nschoolchildren -- at bay with an automatic rifle.  Two others stand\nby the windows, scanning the harbor for signs of a double-cross; and\na fourth, the RINGLEADER, speaks into a walkie-talkie.\nRINGLEADER\nGood.  We got forty innocent people here.  One false move . . . and\nwe blow her brains out.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)\n(filter; from walkie-talkie)\nBlow whose brains out?\n\n5. EXT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT\nTIGHT on the ring of OBSERVATION WINDOWS situated just below the\njutting spikes of the CROWN.  CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly to take in\nthe whole of the statue's head.\n\nRINGLEADER (O.S.)\n(a nasty laugh)\nLady Liberty, my friend.  Lady Liberty's brains!\n\n6. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nMOUNTING TENSION among the SWAT TEAM on deck.\n\nSWAT COP\nSons of bitches.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nRelax.  We'll nail 'em on the transfer.  Let's get those hostages out\nfirst.\nSWAT COP II\nCaptain . . . what the hell is that?\n\nAll eyes turn upward.  In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from\nthe clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head\nof the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nShit.  Shit fire!!\n\nSWAT COP\nSir!  What is it?\n\n7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS\nA magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic,\nblimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)\nChrist almighty, it's the goddamned Watchmen!\n\n8. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nIn the cabin we find THREE COSTUMED SUPERHEROES: the red-and-gold\nsuited CAPTAIN METROPOLIS; RORSCHACH, whose face is a shifting\ninkblot mask; and NIGHT OWL, who's manning the instrument panel.\n\nNIGHT OWL\nOkay, Adrian, we're in position.  What now?\n\nHe looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT,\nblond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:\n\nVEIDT\n(on monitor)\nLet's take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.\n\n9. EXT. HEAD OF STATUE - DAY\nA line drops from the OWLSHIP, and an ELECTRONIC DEVICE lands with a\nthud on the dome of Lady Liberty's crown.\n\n10. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nTERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows\nnothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his\nwalkie-talkie:\n\nRINGLEADER\nHey.  We got a problem here --\n\nHe releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.\n\nRINGLEADER\nCome in.  Do you read me?  Don't play around with us,\nGoddammit !\n\n11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT\nThe SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared,\nhe glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic\nfrenzy.\n\nSWAT COP\nIgnorant bastards!  They've jammed us!\n\nSWAT COP II\nWhat do we do now?\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nWe sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.\n\n12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nA HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water.\nThere's an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he\nswaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to\nreveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.\n\nSuperhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather\nbreastplate; incongruously, it's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it\nmatches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.\n\n13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nA TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of\nthe statue.  They're holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is\nfumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone\nhaywire.\n\nTERRORIST I\nBase to head.  Base to head.  Come in!\n(flustered)\nI can't get shit!\n\nTERRORIST II\nWhat the hell is going on??\n\nThere's a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison --\njust as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.\n\nPanic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of\na long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to\nhis head.\n\nTERRORIST I\nI'M NOT JOKING!!\n\nThe COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED\nSHOTS directly into the JANITOR's gut.  The old man's body jerks twice\nand he slumps to the floor, stone dead.\n\nThe TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they're too\nstunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --\n\nCOMEDIAN\nThe joke's on you.\n\n-- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As\nthe saying goes . . . it's nice to see a man who enjoys his work.\n\n14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nRORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor\nof the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --\n\n15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nA sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to\nthe nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL\nFIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.\n\nWhile the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point\nbehind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS\nand RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the\nstatue's upraised TORCH.\n\nThe TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the\nfar side of the torch.\n\nRINGLEADER\nI don't like this.  Go downstairs and see what's up.\n\n16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nRORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.\n\nRORSCHACH\nGot your flashgun?\n\nCAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and\ngoes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits\nbehind.\n\n17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nThe COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue's layout.\nHe spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor,\nthen strolls over and jimmies it open.\n\nANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one's different.\nThis one's a WOMAN.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nAbout time.  It stinks down there.\n\nCOMEDIAN\nB-team's upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.\n\nAs the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched\nwetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME\nunderneath.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nWhy do I get all the glamour jobs?\n\nCOMEDIAN\nA woman's work is never done.\n\n18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nThe TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later,\nCAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their\nguns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a\nTEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.\n\nRINGLEADER\nI don't know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.\n\nCAPT. METROPOLIS\nPlease.  There's something I'd like you to see first.\n\nHe holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer's flash.\nAll at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding\nlight has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the\nfloor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.\n\nAll except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who's wearing his special sunglasses.\nHe pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.\n\n19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER\nAn edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he's grabbed\nfrom behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at\nhis throat.\n\nCOMEDIAN\nOkay, Abdul.  Where's the bomb?\n\n20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nEveryone's slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the\nTERRORISTS tied up; he's consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.\n\nCAPT. METROPOLIS\nDon't cry, little one.  You're in good hands.\n(standing; to the crowd)\nNow everyone.  Listen carefully.  We're going out through the torch.\n\nHe goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the\ntorch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.\n\n21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER\nA METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH\nsecures it to the tip of the torch.\n\n22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT\nSILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nShould be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .\n\nCOMEDIAN\nJust barge in.  While they're staring at your tits we'll blow their\nballs off.\n\nThey look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead\nlanding.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist\nhits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the\nlanding.\n\n23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER\nGas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS' BOMB, and it's a big fat one, sits\nin a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with\nUNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the\nCOMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:\n\nCOMEDIAN\nWell.  They look distracted.\n(turning to face her)\nDon't suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nEddie -- !\n\nSuddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He\nturns.\n\nOne of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself\nover to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A\nSWITCH on the housing.\n\nA TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.\n\nCOMEDIAN\nSHIT!\n\nHe hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to\nblink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An\nempty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nWhat about the --\n\nCOMEDIAN\nFUCK 'EM!\n\nThere's a mountain-climber's CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it\naround the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only\na second before following suit.\n\n24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nCAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once,\nhe FREEZES.  There's a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as\nwell.\n\n25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nYET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL's instrument panel.\nHe looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.\n\nNIGHT OWL\nAdrian!\n\nVEIDT\nYeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.\n\nNIGHT OWL\nWell, good God, we can't just --\n\nVEIDT\nMission aborted, Daniel!\n\nNIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.\n\n26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT\nOn the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.\n\n27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER\nThe COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS\nthrowing off sparks against the cable.\n\n28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nCAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands\npressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and\nRORSCHACH, who's hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off\nthe torch.\n\n29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT\nTHE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE\ntouches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator\ndoors open, and the two of them dive through.\n\n30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER\nRORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP\nstreaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure\nof Lady Liberty.\n\nThree beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.\n\n31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nA heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an\noverhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.\n\n32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER\nSmoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat\nagainst a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling\nDEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.\n\n33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER\nThe furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of\nthe statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He\nturns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nThat's it.  I quit.\n\nThe water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --\n\n34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY\n-- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through\nthe harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the\ndemolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes\nwondering what the hell happened to his date.\n\nMeet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR.\nMANHATTAN.\n\nDown below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact --\nare crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge\nblue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:\n\nCOMEDIAN\nASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?\n\nCUT TO:\n\n35. INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT\nThe Channel 4 Newsroom, with anchors SHEILA SHEA and JIM BRADLEY.\n\nSHEILA\nIn the face of mounting public pressure, the city of New York has\nrevoked its contract with Adrian Veidt's super-team.  Local police\nhave threatened a city-wide walkout if criminal charges against the\nWatchmen are dropped.\n\nOn the bluescreen behind them, red circles with diagonal crossbars\nsurround SIX HEAD SHOTS of the individual WATCHMEN.\n\nJIM\nAnd in Washington today, the Senate introduced legislation which\nwould ban all costumed adventurers nationwide.  Easy passage\nis expected.\n(shuffling his papers)\nWell, Sheila, it looks like the age of the superhero is officially\nhistory.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n36.  CREDITS SEQUENCE\nTIMEPIECES of every description -- pocket watches, grandfather\nclocks, travel alarms, all perfectly synchronized -- DRIFT UPWARD\nthrough a vast black void, ticking off the seconds.  At the stroke of\nmidnight, GONGS sound, BUZZERS buzz, BELLS tinkle -- and without\nwarning the clocks EXPLODE.  As gears and coils and crystals cascade\ndownward through the void, we SUPER TITLE:\n\nWATCHMEN\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\n37. EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT\nDarkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT\nUP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP\ndrifts lazily through distant clouds; the sounds of traffic echo\nfaint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where\nheavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED\nPLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:\n\nNEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER\n\n38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nA ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by\nthe garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the\nhigh-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated\nbubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on\ntheir roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.\n\nA CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: \"NEW SKIRMISH ON\nAFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW.\"\n\nCUSTOMER\nCrazy reds don't know who they're messing with.\n(indicating the cop cars)\nWhat happened over there?\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nSome guy went sidewalk divin'  Twenny-five cents.\n\n39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT\nA riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from\nthe DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare\nwith sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.\n\nPATROLMAN\nSTAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!\n\nWe are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of\nreality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the\ncity -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance:\nhis standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his\nplastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears\na path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the\nback of a waiting ambulance.\n\nDET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and\nbuttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the\ninvestigation.\n\nBURNS\nHad a lot of blood in him.\n\nHYDE\nYou oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.\n\nBURNS\nNo idea who's behind this?\n\nHYDE\nSmall army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.\n\nBURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.\n\nBURNS\nHe would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a\ncall from Washington.\n\nHYDE\nWashington?\n\nBURNS\nThey want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.\n\nHYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after\nthe ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.\n\n40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nTIGHT ON a large placard: \"THE END IS NIGH.\"  The bearer of the sign,\na hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk\nspreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make\nout an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.\n\nThe NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his\ncollar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against\nthe kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick,\ncross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in\nresponse and plugs on.\n\nAt the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the\nsidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET\nCRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain\ngrate.\n\nIt's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its\nsurface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to\nmidnight.\n\nThe STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the\nshattered window some forty stories above.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT\nCAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted\ncorridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading\n\"POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS.\"  At the far end is a single door,\nSEALED OFF.\n\n42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT\nMOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and\noverturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture\nwindow.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are\nflapping wildly.\n\nA ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.\n\nSHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps\ninside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is\ninvisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the\nroom.\n\nThe apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints,\ngaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The\nflashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS\nand an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.\n\nThe INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains\nof a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky\nglass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for\nhis face.\n\nHe has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and\never-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should\nbe. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.\n\nWe've met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.\n\n43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk\ndainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood.\nOffhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL.\nHe tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his\ntrenchcoat pocket.\n\n44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nThe beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls,\nand settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet.\nRORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive\nsuits.\n\nHe shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on\nthe wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP.\nTHUMP.\n\nHe pauses.  He's found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully\nalong the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a\nCONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing\na SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.\n\nHe reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a\nbizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit,\nrows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed\nPHOTOGRAPH.\n\nRORSCHACH examines the photo.  It's a group shot, six men, one woman,\nall dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is\nwearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN's\ncostume.\n\nThey're all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT.\nMETROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH\nhimself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT\nA LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner\nstore.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with\nthe heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated\n-- old before his time.\n\nHe holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough\nto open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.\n\n46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT\nIn an alleyway just off the access street, there's a MUGGING in\nprogress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in\nknot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG\nsees what's happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious\ndecision to move on.  Then --\n\nVOICE\nHold up, papa-san!\n\nThe KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and\nspotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they\nmarch toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them,\nalmost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE\nSlow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the\ngimmick, it should suggest that the events we're watching take place\nin a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.\n\nIt's out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in\nan alleyway not unlike the one we've just left.  There's a flurry of\nfists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--\n\n-- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME,\ntransporting us back to:\n\n48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT\nReal-time again.  Our reverie's been interrupted by a SHAFT OF\nWHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the\nalley.\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nHALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --\n\nThe KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the\nLIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair\nsome forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of\nthe kids.\n\nDREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the\nalleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past\nhelp.\n\n49. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nTHREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The\nsecurity system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN's\napartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.\n\nDREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs\nit carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for\nthe kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most\npeculiar sight:\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . Rorschach.\n\n50. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\nLeaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is\nthe aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up,\nexposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he's calmly eating a plate of\nbaked beans.\n\nDREIBERG\nHow did you get in here?\n\nIgnoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping,\nutterly emotionless whisper:\n\nRORSCHACH\nHiya, pardner.  Long time no see.\n\nDREIBERG\nDid anybody follow you?  See you come here?\n\nDREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn't care less --\nemits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can\nonto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup\nfrom a squeeze bottle.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nI can't believe you're back on the streets.  Good God, man, you're\nwanted on fourteen counts of murder.\n\nRORSCHACH\nAt least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.\n\nHe reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it\nto DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his\nfingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nLook familiar?\n\nDREIBERG\nSure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHuman bean juice.\n(beat)\nThe Comedian is dead.\n\nDREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture.\nHis jaw goes slack.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nHad a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up --\nbeautiful view.\nHope he enjoyed it on the way down.\n\nDREIBERG\nJesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?\n\nRORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nWell, God, he'd been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he\nmust've had enemies.\n\nRORSCHACH\nSo do I.  So do you.\n\nDREIBERG\nRorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just\nparanoia.\n\nRORSCHACH's head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG\nblinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But\nRORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the\nfront door.\n\nRORSCHACH\nMaybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with\na grudge.\n(pause)\nThought you might want to spread the word.\n\nDREIBERG\nHey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?\n\nRORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He\nopens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.\n\nRORSCHACH\nYou the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.\n\nHe reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo\nfrom the COMEDIAN's wall.  A moment later, he's gone.\n\nDREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone,\nCAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple\ntunic and mask . . .\n\n51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT\nA GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is\nfar from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome\ndesk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is\nADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he's\nDREIBERG's age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and\npale, he looks thirty.  When he's sixty he'll look forty.\n\nVEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic\npatents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his\noffice reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the\nlike.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE\nRINGS.\n\nVEIDT\nVeidt here.\n\n52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT\nDREIBERG\nAdrian?  Listen, it's Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach.\nI had to call you before he --\n\nVEIDT\nDaniel, slow down.  What's this about Rorschach?\n\nDREIBERG\nThe Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.\n\nVEIDT\nMy God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?\n\nDREIBERG\nIt's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's\n. . . I don't know, stalking us.\n\nVEIDT\nUs.  You mean the Watchmen.\n\nThe big CAT purrs; it's a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red\nfur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a\nchunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders\nDREIBERG's words.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nDaniel, Rorschach is insane.\n\nDREIBERG\nI know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells\nblood.\n\nVEIDT\nYou know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs\n-- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.\n\nDREIBERG\nHe's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at\nthis late date.\n\nVEIDT\nIf he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected\nyou.  Haven't I?\n(slight pause)\nDo you need money?\n\nDREIBERG\nNo.  I just wanted you to --\n\nVEIDT\nYou did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good\nnight.\n\nDREIBERG\nGood night.\n\nVEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a\ncigarette.  It's \"matchless\"; you ignite it guy striking the tip of\nthe cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a\nlong, slow drag.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\nBarbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the\ncheckpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE\nrolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign\nwhich reads \"ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.\"\n\n54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\nADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED\nESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door\nwith a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a\nsix-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .\n\n. . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple\ndoorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and\nwait -- to VEIDT's great amusement.\n\nThe inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned\nwoman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK\nSPECTRE.\n\nLAURIE\nAdrian.\n\nVEIDT\nLaurie!  Good to see you.\n\nShe gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall\nin perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.\n\nLAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized\nmachines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific\nparaphernalia of every description.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nNice.  Who's your decorator -- Edward Teller?\n\nLAURIE\nDon't rub it in.  I live here.\n\nVEIDT\nAnd how's life with the walking H-bomb?\n\nLAURIE\nHe's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.\n\nShe takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT\nwanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A\nSMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:\n\nVEIDT\nHi, Jon.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)\n(a deep, booming voice)\nHello, Adrian.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under\nany circumstances, but at the moment he's downright gargantuan.\nForty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he's calmly adjusting a\ncalibration atop his particle accelerator.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\nI think I'm about to detect a gluino.\n\nIn case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just\nabout anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the\nphysical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of\ntime and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.\n\nAny government would be glad to have him.\n\nVEIDT\nSupersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann\ncaught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .\n\nLAURIE, who's just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.\n\nLAURIE\nPlease, you guys, no shop talk.\n(to DR. MANHATTAN)\nJon, you're being rude.  Why don't you shrivel on down and join us?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable\nsix-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist\n-- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nGood to see you, Adrian.  What's the occasion?\n\nHe tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO\nSURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.\n\nVEIDT\n. . . Are we being monitored?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the\nlittle red \"ON\" lights wink out.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThe bearer of bad news.\n\nVEIDT\nWe've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.\n\nLAURIE\nBlake?  Dead?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the\nfuneral as a matter of protocol.\n\nLAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first\nshe's heard about it.\n\nVEIDT\nRorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to\nthink that someone is \"stalking\" the Watchmen.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nOh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.\n\nVEIDT\nWhat's your theory?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nLife and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern\nme.\n\nVEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is\nconsiderably less amused.\n\nLAURIE\nI could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?\n\nVEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another\npart of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as\nwe watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and\nfloats off to one side.\n\nA module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of\nthe hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in\nmidair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn't lifted a finger; he's dismantling and\nreassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.\n\nVEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes\nthe conversation without missing a beat:\n\nVEIDT\nI guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYou mean Afghanistan?\n(beat)\nIt won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more\ninteresting.\n\nThe module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The\ncover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws\nitself shut.\n\nVEIDT\nWell . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as\nusual -- I can't tell you anything you don't already know.  Goodbye,\nJon.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds\nhis coat where LAURIE put it.  He's just about to leave when she\narrives with two stiff drinks in hand.\n\nLAURIE\nAdrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --\n\nVEIDT\nI'll take a raincheck, Laurie.\n\nLAURIE\nPlease.\n\nThere's a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his\nshoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who's forty feet tall again, playing\nwith his superaccelerator.\n\nVEIDT\nHe's a little farther gone every time.\n\nLAURIE\nStay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to\nsomeone human.\n(beat)\nHe doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I\nmean -- he even scares the research teams.\n\nVEIDT\nLaurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed\nthe world.\n\nLAURIE\n(embarrassed)\nI know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's\ndoing his work --\n\nVEIDT\nWhat about you?\n\nLAURIE\nI suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.\n(pause)\nI'll ring for the guards.\n\nShe goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her,\nconcerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest\npocket for a cigarette case:\n\nVEIDT\nNasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.\n(handing her a cigarette)\nDarling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give\nDaniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.\n\nLAURIE\nMaybe I'll do that.\n\nVEIDT\nI'm sorry about Blake.\n\nHe pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS\nappear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.\n\nLAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman\nlover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and\nWALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren't there.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT\nA decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood,\npopular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow\nstairway which dips well below street level.\n\n56. INT. HAPPY HARRY'S - NIGHT\nThe usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS\nhover at the entrance to the men's room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS\nstand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and\ngrind.  Suddenly there's a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.\n\nOver by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE\noff the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of\nvicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the\nbar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing\nglasses.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHarry.\n\nHARRY\n(petrified)\nR-Rorschach.\n\nRORSCHACH\nPhone's out of order.  Mind if I use yours?\n\nHe reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH\npicks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS\nand yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.\n\nHe turns and faces the assembled multitudes:\n\nRORSCHACH\nEdward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might've had\nhelp.\n(wandering through the room)\nThought maybe you could fill me in.\n\nENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as\nRORSCHACH strolls past.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nYou.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing?\n(moving on)\nJohnny Gobs.  What's new at the schoolyard?\n\nBehind RORSCHACH's back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively\ntoward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar,\nyanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nNicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?\n\nNICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH\nextends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --\n\n-- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He\ncloses a gloved fist around NICKY's pinky finger, twists it back and\nSNAPS IT.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nEdward Blake.  Who killed him?\n\nNo answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH\ngrabs his index finger and repeats the process.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nWho killed Edward Blake?\n\nNICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to\nthe floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He's standing poised to let\nfly at NICKY's ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.\n\nVOICE\nJESUS!  HE'S IN SHOCK!!\n\nRORSCHACH\nTHE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?\n\nBy now HARRY's pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar.\nWithout looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It\ncatches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of\nglassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the\nceiling.\n\nSILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH's next move.  He\nlooks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nSo many vermin . . . so little time.\n\nHe bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY's quivering frame, and tosses it\ncontemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long\nenough to HISS at the crowd:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nGo back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I'll be\naround.\n\n\nCUT TO:\n\n57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN\nThe bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller\nresearch complex.  It's not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and\nLAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over\nto where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is\nempty.\n\nLAURIE\n(muttering; groggy)\nJon . . . ?\n\nA LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE\ncloses her eyes and sighs.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm here, Laurie.\n\nLAURIE\nIs it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nNot yet, there's plenty of time.\n\nA SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly.\nDR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.\n\nLAURIE\nMmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?\n\nThe BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE's shoulder and arm,\ntoward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWould you like me to stay?\n\nLAURIE\nMm hmm.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI could stay and go.\n\nLAURIE\n. . . And just how would you manage that?\n\nShe leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its\ndownward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is\nmassaging LAURIE's thigh.\n\nThird blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE's eyes go suddenly\nwide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the\nfoot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.\n\nLAURIE\nAAAAAAAAAA!!\n\nDR. MANHATTAN I\nLaurie?  Are you --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN II\nDon't be upset.\n\nThis unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE's\nfragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a\ndressing gown.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, please.  I don't enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one\nperson again, please?\n\nThe big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical\ngestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN I\nLaurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN II\n-- you would find it erotic.\n\nLAURIE\nAll right, all right.  It's just -- my nerves, I'm going stir-crazy\nin this place, I --\n\nWhile fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance\nthrough a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment,\nshe sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an\nexperiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through\nthe door . . .\n\n58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER\n. . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:\n\nLAURIE\nYou've been out here all along, haven't you?  Running one of your\nstupid experiments --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN III\nYes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.\n\nLAURIE\nSo you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how\ncould you do this?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN III\nYou seem to feel I've been neglecting you.  Isn't that the case?\n(pause)\nI thought I'd solved the problem quite elegantly.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's all it is to you, isn't it?  Just another problem you\ncan --\n\nShe doesn't see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered\nthe room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:\n\nDR. MANHATTANS I & II\nLaurie, please --\n\nLAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back\nslowly, steadies herself on a lab table.\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I\ncould really use the time alone.\n\nShe storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I &\nII -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original\nDR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his\nequipment.\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\n1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nA pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard\nat work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly\nbeautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it's largely\nwasted on her preoccupied date.\n\nAt the moment, she's filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:\n\nLAURIE\nThe government's really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I\nguess it's no picnic being the world's only superhuman.\n(mock-macho)\nI have to keep him in line.\n\nShe flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to\nlaugh.  He doesn't.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has\nwandered off into a far corner of the room.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nExcuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?\n\nDREIBERG\nSorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think\nanyone's out to get us -- do you?\n\nLAURIE\nDan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no\nMother Teresa.\n\nDREIBERG\nPsychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .\n\nLAURIE\nNow wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the\ngovernment or do time.\n\nDREIBERG\nFine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty\ntricks -- political assassinations --\n\nNow he's got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then\nleans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:\n\nLAURIE\nOkay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us\nmade other choices.\n\nDREIBERG\n(shaking his head in disgust)\n\nYeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors\n. . . and I'm still in the psycho file with Rorschach.\n\nLAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nWhat's so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?\n\nLAURIE\nI'm just wondering what you would've said ten years ago if you could\nsee yourself right now.\n(raising her glass)\nWell, here's to the Comedian.  'Cause the fact is, he's dead . . .\nand we're not.\n\nDREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.\n\n1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace,\nwhich overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They're holding big snifters\nof brandy, and they're both pretty well drunk.\n\nDREIBERG\nThe pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I\nmean, we were heroes!\n\nLAURIE\nDamn straight.\n\nDREIBERG\nDamn straight!  We were heroes.\n\nLAURIE\nOf course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.\n\nDREIBERG\nWell, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the\nworld and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .\n\nLAURIE\n(smiling)\nHey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma?\nWhat was his name . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nOh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd\nbeat him up?\n\nLAURIE\nThat's the one.  Whatever happened to him?\n\nDREIBERG\n(deadpan)\nHe pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an\nelevator shaft.\n\nLAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to\nher mouth -- and like DREIBERG she's GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA\nPULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a\nstentorian VOICE over scene:\n\nCHAPLAIN (V.O.)\nIn the midst of life we are in death . . .\n\nCUT TO:\n\n59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY\nAN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.\n\nCHAPLAIN\n. . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall\nchange our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --\n\nTIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of\nmourners.  There's no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the\nattendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons\nof protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off\nwith the traditional twenty-one gun salute.\n\nCHAPLAIN (cont.)\n-- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all\nthings unto himself.\n\nA light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR.\nMANHATTAN, of course, doesn't need one -- the raindrops vanish\nmiraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the\ndistance, and he glances off at:\n\n60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT\nSENTRIES stand at attention.  They've blocked off the part of the\ncemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has\nbeen spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like\nwildfire.\n\nMOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the\ncemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due\nrespect for the dead, Arlington National's turning into a zoo:\ngawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their\nhands full managing the crowd.\n\nA KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to\njoin the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the\nVIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.\n\nIt's not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled\nmarble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward,\nand he's cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms,\nPieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze\nplaque bears the inscription:\n\nIN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS\nWHO GAVE THEIR LIVES\nTO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM\n\nBelow it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four\nhundred of them.\n\n61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\nThe Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE's home sweet\nhome.  Her car pulls up to the guard's booth and he waves her\nthrough.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind\nher, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.\n\n62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT\nLAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex,\nfumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the\ncard into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.\n\nShe tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls\nup behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps\nout.\n\nLAURIE\nMajor Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.\n\nADAMSON\nLaurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.\n\nLAURIE\nWhy?  What's the problem?\n\nADAMSON\nI can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.\n\nLAURIE\n(chuckling)\nI would like to use the bathroom --\n\nAs she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.\n\nADAMSON\nThe access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat?!\n\nADAMSON\nPlease.\n\nThe major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The\nGUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.\n\nADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE's climbing inside when she\nsees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.\n\nThe entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging\nfrom it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION\nSUITS.\n\n63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT\nLAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to\na team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard\nat the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white\ngown:\n\nNURSE\nMiss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat -- ?\n\nDOCTOR\nDrink this.\n\nThe DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She\nstares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.\n\nDOCTOR\nDrink it.\n\n64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT\nTECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are\nshifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of\na human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens\non:\n\n65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT\nWe're watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A\ndonut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot,\nfoot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to\nthe anteroom.\n\nThrough a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head\nwedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right\nas she wonders just what the hell is going on.\n\n66. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nA MAN'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.\n\nLAURIE (O.S.)\nThat's Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon's military liaison.\n\nLAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table\nsurrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent\nSCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken\nfrom a thick sheaf.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nDr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon's research teams.  The\nquantum-whatever.\n\nSCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It's a group shot of the\nWatchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE's closet.  LAURIE\nhesitates.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nThat's Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt.\n(long pause)\nRorschach . . .\n\nSCHMIDT\nTheir real names, please.\n\nLAURIE\nI don't know their real names.\n\nSCHMIDT\nYou're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.\n\nLAURIE\nI don't know their real names!\n\nSCHMIDT\nYou're not \"protecting\" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on\nthe answers you give.\n(holding up the sheaf of photos)\nThese are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --\n\nLAURIE\nThen why don't you ask him?!?\n\nFurious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby\nwindow.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced\ntorturers, they understand the value of patience.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nI want to get dressed.  -- And I'd like a cigarette.\n\nOne of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out\nfor LAURIE.  As he's lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door\nopens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.\n\nHe passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and\ntilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with\ncuriosity:\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nSomeone had better tell me what's going on here!\n\nSCHMIDT\nSit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file\nare all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else\nin common as well.\n(beat)\nThey've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?\n\nAll at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE's face goes\nbone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she\ntakes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she's read.\n\nSCHMIDT\nI'm terribly sorry.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat does this mean?  What does it --\n\nSCHMIDT\nSix to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can\nsee why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible\njoke to make me --\n\nShe scans the room.  No one's laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to\nhis comrades, and heads for the door.\n\nSCHMIDT\nTake a day or two.  If you \"remember\" any names . . . do give us a\ncall.\n\nThe AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches\nfor the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking,\nshe buries her face in her hands.\n\n67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nA darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a\ntwo-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who's been\nwatching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.\n\nADAMSON\nPoor kid.\n\nSCHMIDT\nWe'll keep her in isolation awhile.  She'll give us some names.\n\nADAMSON\nTo hell with those costumed idiots.  I'm worried about Doc\nManhattan.\n\nSCHMIDT\nWhat do you mean?\n\nADAMSON\nShe's his last link to humanity.  Once she's gone . . . God knows\nwhich way he'll jump.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY\nDR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He's wearing\na navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie\nwith an irregular mauve pattern.\n\nThe tie doesn't quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie\nmagically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal\ngold stripes.\n\nToo staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into\na handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for\ndecoration.\n\nIt does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the\nmirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.\n\n69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY\nTECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green\nroom, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.\n\nDIRECTOR\nWe're on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is\nthat big blue son of a --\n\nHe stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just\nrematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR's\nface.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm sorry.  Am I late?\n\nDIRECTOR\nNo problem.  We'll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I'm\nKent Turner, the director. . .\n\nThe DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN's hand and marches him down a\nhallway.  Within seconds they're joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.\n\nLIAISON\nDr. Osterman.  I've got a list of taboo areas here we'd like you to\nsteer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you'll\njust play it cool --\n\nDIRECTOR\nDoc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give\nus something a little darker . . . ?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWill this do?\n\nDIRECTOR\nPerfect.\n\nLIAISON\nNow Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --\n\nBut the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by\na cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are\nhurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON\nhangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The \"ABC NEWS\nSPECIAL REPORT\" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC\nunderneath.\n\n70. INSERT - TV MONITOR\nStock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for\ntheir lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right\nand takes in an extraordinary sight.\n\nA towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through\nthe jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the\ngreenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts\nof automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation\ncrew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads:\n\"VIETNAM.  1965.\"\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O.)\nDr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific\nmishap.  For more than twenty years the \"Manhattan Option\" has been\nthe linchpin of America's conventional strategy --\n\nWe CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad\nthoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds\na corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.\n\nHis EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey\ngunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM\nhisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met\nwith a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads:\n\"CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.\"\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)\n-- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a\none-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding\nthe Communist menace in check.\n\nDANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from\nAmerican Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake\nhands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a\nthree-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic\naccord.  Title: \"NICARAGUA.  1979.\"\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)\nIn the famous words of General William Westmoreland, \"Yes, Virginia,\nthere is a Superman -- and thank God, he's American.\"\n\n71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nA sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop\nof the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded\nnews vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host's chair:\n\nBRINKLEY\nFor this live question-and-answer session we'll be joined by\ncorrespondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating,\nI'll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy.\n(turning)\nNow let's welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better\nknown to the world as Dr. Manhattan.\n\nApplause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at\nBRINKLEY's right.  He nods in acknowledgement.\n\nBRINKLEY (cont.)\nI suppose the topic on everyone's mind this week is Afghanistan,\nwhere Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now\nsince you've dealt successfully with similar situations in the past .\n. . I'll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that\nyou intervene?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI will not intervene in Afghanistan.\n\nA HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.\n\n72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\nLooking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.\n\n73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN\nHANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience.\nBRINKLEY ignores them:\n\nBRINKLEY\nYou're saying you would refuse a direct request?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThere will be no request.  I will not intervene.\n\nBRINKLEY\nWell, Doctor, it's widely understood, or rumored, that you can\nactually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the\nhostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?\n\n74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\nHe's steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he's hanging on\nDR. MANHATTAN's every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE\nin the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:\n\nLIAISON\nI want a phone line to the booth.  Now.\n\n75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it.\n(long pause)\nI can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will\nnot intervene.\n\nHe sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.\n\nBRINKLEY\nWell, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I'll\nopen up the floor to questions now.  Doug?\n\nREPORTER\nDr. Osterman, I'm Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I'd like to read\nyou some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M.\nWeaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nAll friends, yes.  Associates of mine.\n\nROTH\nLet me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White.\nAre you aware that these \"friends\" and \"associates\" of yours have all\nbeen diagnosed with terminal cancer?\n\nThe CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY's taken aback.  He\ngapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face\nan unreadable mask.\n\n76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\neyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone\n\nLIAISON\nOh Jesus.\n(barking into phone)\nI want this broadcast killed.  I'll run out on that goddamn set if I\nhave to!\n\n77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN\nROTH\nI have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly\ndiagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a\nconnection?\n\nBy now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make\nhimself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who's just gotten a message\nfrom the booth, touches his headset and announces:\n\nBRINKLEY\nI'm told it's time for a break.  We'll be back after this brief\nmessage --\n\nWithin seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set,\nflanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.\n\nLIAISON\nTHAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW'S OVER!!\n\nThe three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then,\nPANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB\nTHE SET.\n\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\nDr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause\ncancer??\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI don't wish to answer any questions.\n\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\nYou see the future!  Did you know in advance --\n\nLIAISON\nThe Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP\nASIDE!!\n\nThe LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but\nthe mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.\n\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\nHow long have you known -- why is the government concealing this\ninformation --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nPlease get out of my way.\n\nThe LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor.\nSCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it's getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN\nlets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI said LEAVE ME ALONE!!\n\nIn the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no\nmicrophones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR.\nMANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.\n\nBRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later,\nthere's an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES,\nleaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT\nThe place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is\noverseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post\nquarantine notices at the entrances.  He's not altogether surprised\nwhen DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWhere's Laurie?\n\nADAMSON backs off slightly.  He's not wearing a radiation suit, and\nhe's understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely\nnecessary.\n\nADAMSON\nShe's been relocated, Jon.  It's strictly precautionary . . .\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThere's no need to lie.  I assume she's been tested.  Were the\nresults positive?\n\nADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\nDon't bother.  I already know what you'll say.\n\nHe watches impassively as what's left of his home is dismantled.  His\nmind is already a million miles away.\n\nADAMSON\nJon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . .\ncould you cure her?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI don't know.  I only know that I won't.\n(long pause)\nThere'd be no point.  It's finally begun.\n\nADAMSON\n\"Begun?\"  What's begun?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI've seen this day.  It's the day I've been dreading all these years.\n(pause)\nYou see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I\ncared for . . .\n\nADAMSON doesn't know what he's talking about, but a chill runs down\nhis spine nonetheless.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nMy work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.\n\nAnd with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves\nbehind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at\nthe Major's feet.\n\nADAMSON\nGood Lord --\n\nCUT TO:\n\n79. EXT. OUTER SPACE\n-- and it's about as exterior as you can get.  We're a few\nhundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily\napparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily\nbeautiful\n-- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white\nclouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing\nour planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.\n\nIt's DR. MANHATTAN.  He's in a lotus position, sitting on\nnothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage.\nStars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he's about to\nleave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.\n\n80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT\nBlack sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so\nbarren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is,\nuntil we see the residue of man's presence on the landscape: ruined\nquonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements,\nhalf-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than\nhusks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a\nrotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.\n\nA gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden\nRUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue\nlight.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift\nin the sky and descends gently to earth.\n\nThe rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once\nmore as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town\nof Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was\nonce a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long\nmahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.\n\nA desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We\nMOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY\nIt's twenty-odd years ago, and we're looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN\n-- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie\nand a white lab coat.  He's at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing\na dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:\n\nJANEY SLATER (O.S.)\nNineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You'd think they\ncould at least make us a decent hamburger.\n\nJON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He's utterly smitten\nwith DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she's a couple\nof years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just\nclose enough to LAURIE that you'd notice the resemblance.  And she's\nprobably the only one in the room who can't see just how bad a crush\nJON has on her.\n\nJON\nI'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna\nhead straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.\n\nJANEY\nWith lots of ketchup?\n\nSmiling, she indicates JON's plate.  He's emptied at least half a\nbottle on his french fries.\n\nJON\nNothing wrong with ketchup.\n\nJANEY\nJon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug\nlike you doing in a place like this?\n\nJON\nAnything for science, I guess.\n(long, hesitant pause)\nJaney, there's something --\n\nJANEY\n(simultaneously)\nWe should get back --\n(realizing she's cut him off)\nWhat?\n\nJON\nNothing.  What were you going to say?\n\nJANEY\nWe should get back to the lab.\n(staring at him; chuckling)\nYou okay, Jon?\n\nHe stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he\npipes up:\n\nJON\nOh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I'll be right behind you.\n\nThe lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads\nfor the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after\nJANEY.  She's paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.\n\nHis face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up\nbehind her.\n\nJANEY\nStupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --\n\nJON\n(blurting it out)\nJaney, will you marry me?\n\nShe turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He's wearing the\npained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the\nverdict.\n\nJANEY\nJon -- what?\n\nJON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes\nlocked.  For a moment it's as if they're the only souls in the\ncanteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the\ndoor, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and\none of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled\nJANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.\n\nThere's a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private\ntrance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.\n\nWALLY\nChrist, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.\n\nJANEY\nOh Wally, don't feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --\n\nJON\nI can fix it.\n\nJANEY\n-- What?\n\nJON\nMy dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better\nthan ever.\n\nHe holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.\n\nWALLY\nTake him up on it.  It'd make me feel better.\n\nChuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY\nhands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her\nwith basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he's still waiting for his\nanswer.\n\nBut before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket.\nHe thrusts it abruptly into JANEY's hands --\n\nJON\nHere.  I'll trade you.\n\n-- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING.\nWith a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but\nhe's already gone.\n\nShe stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.\n\n82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY\nJON's at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center\nof the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER'S\nTOOLS.\n\nIt's his lunch hour, and he's fixing JANEY's watch.  He tightens the\ncentral screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal\ninto its housing and gives it a light tap.\n\nWith a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy's in love,\nremember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed\nwith oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST\nCHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of\nit are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like\nanti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.\n\nHe stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and\nwalks over to grab it.  As he's putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK\nfrom the direction of the test chamber.\n\nMounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes,\nseconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it's 13:58 and change.  JON\neyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to\nthe reinforced steel door of the chamber.\n\nInside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a\nlow platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it\nhears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY's watch on the\nconcrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.\n\nJON\nC'mon, little guy, outta here . . .\n\nThe mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in\nhand.\n\nJON (cont.)\n. . . don't wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.\n\nHe stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he's left the watch\ninside.\n\nHe looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting.\nAgitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the\ndoorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of\nthe concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete\nblock, reaches for the watch --\n\n-- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.\n\nWhite-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete\nblock -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of\nthe support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.\n\nBefore his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place --\nTRAPPING HIM INSIDE.\n\nHe LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps\nsliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams\nshut.\n\n83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT\n1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One\nof them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of\nMILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the\nfacilities.\n\nSCIENTIST\n-- actually, we don't know what happens when you disrupt the\nintrinsic field.  All we've managed to do so far is blow a few\nconcrete blocks all to hell.\n\nGENERAL\n(joking, but worried)\nNo danger of . . . fallout, is there?\n\nSCIENTIST\nNo sir.  The chamber's radiation-proof once it's sealed.  That's why\nwe waited outside.\n\nThe translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a\ndull red.\n\nThe crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There's a dim, distant\nTHUMPING.\n\nThe SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect\nunison.\n\nGENERAL\nWhat's the matter?\n\nSCIENTIST\nSweet Jesus -- !\n\nWe DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of\nthe test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the\nterrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass,\nscreaming soundlessly.\n\nPandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left,\npunching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes\nto a belated and painfully obvious realization:\n\nGENERAL\nSay, there's a man in there!!\n\nThe coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One\nSCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --\n\nSCIENTIST I\nStay calm, Jon!  We'll try and kill the power!\n\n-- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:\n\nSCIENTIST II\nBuilding six!  Kill the power!  Osterman's trapped in the I.F.\nchamber!!\n\nThe GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.\n\nGENERAL\nWell -- why doesn't someone let him out??\n\nSCIENTIST III\nIt's a timelock.  It can't be opened once the sequence\nstarts.\n(to SCIENTIST II)\nWhat's the word?\n\nSCIENTIST II\n(covering the phone)\nThey're sending a crew to the generator building --\n\nSCIENTIST IV\nTWENTY SECONDS!\n\nIn a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions \"IN\nCASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.\"  WALLY WEAVER, Jon's friend from the\ncanteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the\nglass, and grabs the ax.\n\nSCIENTIST I\nWally!  What are you doing?\n\nWALLY\nThe power cables!!\n\nAnd now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY\nSLATER.\n\nJANEY\nAm I late for the --\n\nShe stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the\nlab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back\nthrough the door.\n\nSCIENTIST III\nJaney!  Get her out of here.  Get out!\n\nBut she resists.  She's just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to\ntake a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils\nhave just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.\n\nJANEY\nWhat in the name of -- where's Jon?\n\nSCIENTIST III\nJaney!  Please!  Go!!\n\nWALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a\nsudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a\nwall.\n\nSparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white\nlight.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look\nat the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.\n\nJANEY\nJon.\n\n84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\nJON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his\nface.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch,\nwhich he's been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters .\n. .\n\n. . . and everything in the room goes blue.\n\n85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT\nThe SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to\ntear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind\nthem.\n\nJANEY\nJon . . .\n(shrieking)\nJON!!!\n\n86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\nJON's back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of\nunbelievable agony.\n\nA moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a\nphotographic negative -- stands in his place.\n\nThen the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The\niridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to\npieces.\n\nAnd then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim,\nand we're looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of\nthe SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY,\nwho gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT\nThe desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall\nbehind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago\nat 11:48 PM.\n\nFor a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches\nthe rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the\ndoor of the canteen.\n\n88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.\n\n89. INT. MEN'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nTWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into\nthe mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous\nthing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal\ncord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous\nsystem.\n\nThey pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in\na haze of shimmering blue light.\n\n90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.\n\n91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nHORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A\npartially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS\nfor several seconds before vanishing altogether.\n\n92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.\n\n93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nDinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.\n\nJANEY\nI can't help it.  I'm going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it\nfeels haunted.\n\nWALLY\nIt'll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that's all.\n(tugging at his ear)\nDo you hear some kind of -- whistling?\n\nIndeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine.\nOdder yet, WALLY's hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY's.\nEveryone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish\nphenomenon.\n\nUTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without\nwarning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW\nsuffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .\n\n. . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them,\nnude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and\nutensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.\n\nJANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go\nto her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.\n\nJANEY\nJON-N-N-N!!!\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nTHE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns,\nstares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and\nbegins to dig.\n\nA couple of inches down, he finds what he's looking for: an ancient,\ntattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and\nJaney Slater.  She's holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new\nengagement ring.\n\nHis fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.\n\n95. SERIES OF SHOTS\nQuick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:\n\n-- JON's black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;\n\n-- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue\nlight;\n\n-- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper.\nThere's a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a\nterrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .\n\n-- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom\ncloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.\n\n96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN\nFists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in\nthe ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at\nfirst, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue\nstarburst a mile above the ground.\n\n97. EXT. OUTER SPACE\nAll at once, we're back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth\nat unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on\ntoward Mars.\n\nThe red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame\nas we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface.\nIndividual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct:\nvast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri.\nHerschel's famous canali.  And finally, the argyre\nplanitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling\ntwo jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular\nridge.\n\nTwo eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a\nhappy-face.\n\nMany miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian\natmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n98. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN\nThe late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN's press conference.\nAs the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on\nhis angered face:\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI said leave me alone!!\n\nThen there's a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same\npositions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they're all standing on\nthe White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.\n\nPULL BACK TO:\n\n99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT\nA restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair.\nShe's in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the\nbig metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy\nfurnished studio.\n\nTV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)\n-- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported\na crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania\nAvenue!\n\nTV ANCHORMAN (O.S.)\nWell, Katie, I know some politicians who'd like to learn that trick --\n\nLAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.  A moment later,\nSCHMIDT enters, followed by a pair of FEDERAL AGENTS.\n\nSCHMIDT\nAll right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.\n\nLAURIE\nAm I free to go?\n\nSCHMIDT\nYou're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move\nit.\n\nLAURIE\n(fed up; exploding)\nI don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit\n--\n\nSCHMIDT\nOh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan\nborder this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living\nsoul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic\nweapons has finally flipped out.\n\nLAURIE\nJon??  You mean he's --\n\nSCHMIDT\nThat's right.

A\nDRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight\nWOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and\noff as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging\ntipsy giggles.\n\n102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT\nA three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN\nushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY;\nhis is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed --\nwe'll call him MOLOCH.\n\nMOLOCH\nNow.  What was milady drinking?\n\nLUCY\nGin.  Straight up --\n(mock-ladylike)\n\n-- with a little twist of lime.\n\nShe laughs convulsively, as if she's just told the world's funniest\njoke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:\n\nMOLOCH\nI think I can oblige.\n\n103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nMOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The\ncontents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen\nfloor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It's a\ndisaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in\nthe doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.\n\nLUCY\nJeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?\n\nOn cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH.\nHe grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen\ntable.\n\nRORSCHACH\nMoloch.  Did you miss me?\n\nLUCY\nWillie!  Jesus!  What's going on?\n\nRORSCHACH\n(glancing up)\nWho's the welfare mother?\n\nMOLOCH\nI don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong\nguy.\n\nRORSCHACH\nEdgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.\n\nMOLOCH\nYou're making a big --\n\nRORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against\nthe table -- repeatedly, to the beat.\n\nRORSCHACH\nTerrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.\n\nMOLOCH\nALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?\n\nLUCY\nWillie, what's he talking about?\n\nRORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor.\nRORSCHACH kneels beside him.\n\nMOLOCH\nLook, I don't know what you want, but I been a private citizen for\nten years.  I --\n\nRORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH's chin and pulls him\nclose.  Then, for LUCY's benefit, he explains:\n\nRORSCHACH\nTurned state's witness in '75.  Earned himself a brand-new face.\n(twisting MOLOCH's head to one side, for a better look)\nHnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.\n\nHe shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There's a sugar\nbowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as\nMOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nComedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who's\nbehind it?\n\nMOLOCH\nRorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with\n--\n\nRORSCHACH\nWorked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.\n\nMOLOCH\nCTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --\n\nRORSCHACH\nDon't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.\n\nLUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH's side and grips his arm as\nRORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He's climbing through the frame when\nhe stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nWord of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.\n\n-- and he's out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously\nat MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don't know what he's talking\nabout.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY\nThe familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a\nbig round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world\nlooming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a\nMILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight\nPOINTER,\nhighlighting areas of strategic importance.\n\nANALYST\nOur projections show Pakistan falling within the week.  From there\nit's sixty percent certain they'll try to take Western Europe.\n\nGENERAL\nRespectfully, sir, out NATO allies are getting itchy.  They're\nquizzing us about the possibility of a first strike.\n\nMOVE IN on a tall chair at the head of the table -- the back of which\nbears the seal of the President of the United States.\n\nPRESIDENT\nFirst strike.\n(long pause)\nI'd like to view the simulation.\n\nThe ANALYST hits a button on a remote control device.\n\nANALYST\nOptimally . . . we could expect to wipe out some eighty percent of\ntheir retaliatory capability before they knew what hit 'em.\n\nOn the big board, BLUE ARROWS emanate from selected points in the\nPacific and the Arctic Circle and veer toward Russian turf --\nblossoming in yellow-and-black RADIATION\nSYMBOLS as they strike their targets.\n\nPRESIDENT\nWhat about our end?\n\nANALYST\nWell, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that\ntwenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.\n\nOn the board, RED ARROWS inch westward from Mother Russia.\n\nANALYST (cont.)\nBritain down -- Germany down --\n\nPRESIDENT\nWhat kind of time frame are we talking about?\n\nANALYST\nThirty minutes maximum.

Of course.\n\nBy now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a\ndedicated optimist, turns to announce:\n\nANALYST\nAs you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the\nfarm belt.\n\nPRESIDENT\nWhat about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . \"nuclear winter\"\ntheory?\n\nANALYST\nWe don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . .\nmay depend on a quirk of the weather.\n\nPRESIDENT\nThe weather.

I appreciate your honesty.\n\n106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK\nA greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near\nthe entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken\ntandoori.\n\nDREIBERG\nChrist yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a\ncouple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .\n(pause)\nHow about you, Laurie?\n\nLAURIE\n(lying -- with forced cheer)\nOh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the\nhell out.\n(shrugging)\nNo expense account.  No place to live.\n\nDREIBERG\nYou'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each\nother, someone might put two and two together . . .\n\nLAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.\n\nLAURIE\nThey're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're\nright on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the\nWatchmen.\n\nDREIBERG\nMaybe not, but why take chances?\n\nLAURIE\nDan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent\nall these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel --\nI feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own\nlife, and --\n\n-- and she's dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a\ndamper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts\nto get up.\n\nLAURIE\nI'm just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I'd better go find\nmyself a cheap room.\n\nDREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the\ndoor of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and\nchases her down:\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . .\n.\nLAURIE\nOh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --\n\nDREIBERG\nNo, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely\nright.  -- I'd love to have you stay.\n\nLAURIE\nYou're sure?\n\nHe nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the\nrestaurant.\n\nTHROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the\nstreet outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of\nframe, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of\nketchup.\n\nHe inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down\nquestion mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he\nopens it again, he's got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.\n\n107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET\nA SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant,\nthen disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls\ncasually down the alleyway.\n\nHe moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the\ncrumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a\nsmall recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a\nshifting INKBLOT MASK.\n\n108. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nThe guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style:\nflowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc.\nIt's small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative \"aah\" as\nDREIBERG ushers her in.\n\nLAURIE\nThis is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.\n\nDREIBERG's lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands\nthere for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nAre you . . . waiting for a tip?\n\nDREIBERG\nOh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I\nmean, if you need some aspirin, or --\n\nLAURIE\nI'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really\nsweet.  Sleep tight, okay?\n\nShe gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her\nunpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.\n\n109. INT. HALLWAY - ON DREIBERG\nAs he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE\nunbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door\nshut.\n\n110. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\nDREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds\nhis hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.\n\n111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE\nAnother quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it's SILK SPECTRE --\nLAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off\nvaliantly, but she's heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.\n\nAn oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into\nframe; he's clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP\noverhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE's path and\nsnatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.\n\n112. INT. BEDROOM - ON DREIBERG.\nHis head turns at the sound of WATER running in the bathroom\nadjacent.  He's going to be awake half the night thinking of\nLAURIE.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n113. EXT. STREET - DAY\nEarly morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in\nan alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and\ncrewcut.  He's got a definite CTU look about him.\n\nMOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA\nDINER.\n\n114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nA twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and\npulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the\nnose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges\nof his EYELIDS.\n\nHis eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper;\nbizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it\nup . . .\n\nThere's a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.\n\nA low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and\nsees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.\n\nHe GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH's arm snakes out and\nholds the stall door shut.\n\nRORSCHACH\nTwo things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational\ndrugs.\n\nMOLOCH\nNo, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got\nsomething for you.\n\nA long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let's have it.\n\nMOLOCH (cont.)\nThere's a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on\na case, trying to track 'em down.\n(beat)\nIt's big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That's all\nI've been able to find out.\n\nRORSCHACH\nDrug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh.\n(snarling)\nLet it go time.  In future -- just say no.\n\nWith that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits\nthere a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.  It won't\nopen.\n\nMOLOCH\nHEY!!\n\nRORSCHACH's stuck a broomstick through the door handles on the\nadjacent stalls. As MOLOCH POUNDS on the door in frustration, we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n115. INT. VEIDT'S PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY\nA plush RECEPTION ROOM in his Veidt Industries pyramid; it's\ndecorated in the same Egyptian motifs as his office.  VEIDT sits in\nan overstuffed chair, surrounded by VIDEO CAMERAS; he's in the\nprocess of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure\nwho's prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.\n\nJUSTINE\nNow Adrian, I guess there's one thing everyone wants to know.\nAre you the world's smartest man?\n\nVEIDT\nOh my, yes.  And the best-dressed.\n\nA round of chuckles from the video CREW.  Wotta smoothie!\n\nJUSTINE\nYou're certainly one of the richest.  Holder of over forty\nbasic patents -- including products that have changed our everyday\nlives.\n(pause)\nIf you had one achievement you were proudest of -- what would that be?\n\nVEIDT ponders for a second, then reaches into his jacket and pulls\nout his gold cigarette case.\n\nVEIDT\nSphinx brand.\n(opening the case)\nWhen I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . .\nhumanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good\nin the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco,\nthat no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs\nas you smoke it?\n(lighting up)\nIn fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?\n\nJUSTINE\nThanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your\nold colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --\n\nVEIDT\n(bristling)\nNo.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the\nWatchmen.\n\nJUSTINE\nOh sweetheart, just a quick one.\n\nVEIDT\nNo.  We laid out very careful ground rules --\n\nVEIDT is interrupted by a GROWLING NOISE from his office adjacent.\nHe glances quickly over his shoulder, then gets back to business.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\n-- we agreed specifically --\n\nMORE GROWLING from the next room over.  The CAMERA CREW's getting\ncurious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nExcuse me a second.\n\nHe goes to the office door and slips inside.  The usually-smiley\nJUSTINE shoots a look of disgust at her CREW: what a prick.\n\n116. INT. VEIDT'S OFFICE - DAY\nVEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with\nhis mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:\n\nVEIDT\nKITTY!!\n\nOne last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet --\nno visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his\ndignity.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nHow the hell did you get in here?\n\nThe curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.  He\nlooks up, sees a NEAT ROUND HOLE cut out of his plate-glass\nwindow.\n\nRORSCHACH\nNew information.\n\nVEIDT\n(pointing to the telephone)\nEver see one of these before?\n\nRORSCHACH\nToo important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked\nup.\n\nVEIDT\nWhat is that ungodly smell?\n\nRORSCHACH, abashed, lets out a timid version of his trademark\nHISS.\n\nRORSCHACH\nBigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .\n\nVEIDT\nYeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a\nroomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.\n(beat)\nAnd whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us\nall look bad.\n\nRORSCHACH\nFate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad\npress.\n\nHe makes for the window.  VEIDT frowns, adjusts his tie and exits.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n117. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE cooking dinner.  DREIBERG burns his fingers on a\nbroiling pan, which prompts a sudden round of stamping and\ncursing.\n\nLAURIE watches for a minute, then shakes her head.  She pours a full\nglass of wine and thrusts it at him.\n\nLAURIE\nDaniel -- drink this.  Immediately.\n(smiling)\nI swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.\n\nSucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.\n\nDREIBERG\nOkay, I'm nervous.  It's an odd sensation.  I've always had to think\nof you as Dr. Manhattan's --\n\nHe catches himself -- too late.  LAURIE glowers at him.\n\nLAURIE\nHis what?\n\nDREIBERG\nHis . . . whatever.\n\nLAURIE\nI'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?\n\nShe spears a couple of steaks, drops them on plates, and heads toward\nthe dining room.\n\nLAURIE\nLook, I just want to eat dinner and get drunk.  Let's not make it any\nmore difficult than we have to, huh?\n\n118.

DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nA DINING ROOM TABLE littered with crumpled napkins and dirty\ndishes.  DREIBERG and LAURIE have just finished dinner.  He stares in\ndismay at the TV screen as he opens a fresh bottle of wine.\n\nDREIBERG\nGood Lord.  With Jon out of the picture it's a whole new ball\ngame.\n\nLAURIE's already a little tipsy, and the broadcast doesn't much\ninterest her.  Wine glass in hand, she's wandered over to the stereo\ncabinet.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's right, Daniel.  A whole new ball game.\n(smiling)\nGod!  I haven't seen on of these in fifteen years.\n\nShe's referring to DREIBERG's ancient TURNTABLE.  Shelved beneath it\nare row upon row of LP's -- these days, they're obsolete collector's\nitems.\n\nDREIBERG\nI told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I\nlisten to -- it never came out on crystal.\n\nLAURIE\nI'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.\n(flipping through records)\nNellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these\npeople.\n\nDREIBERG\nPlay one.  Educate yourself.\n\nLAURIE chuckles.  Her head turns at the sound of a familiar\nCOMMERCIAL THEME.  On the TV, a young woman sits at her vanity and\ngazes lovingly at a WEDDING PICTURE framed in silver.\n\nLAURIE\nOh look.  It's Adrian's ad.\n\nTV CHORUS\n\"Oh my darling, it's incredible,\nThat someone so unforgettable . . .\"\n\n120. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT\nMOLOCH's apartment.  THE SAME COMMERCIAL is blaring from the TV as\nRORSCHACH lets himself in.\n\nTV CHORUS\n\". . . Should think I am unforgettable too.\"\n\nRORSCHACH\nMoloch?\n\nNo reply from MOLOCH, who sits in an easy chair, his back to camera,\nseemingly glued to the tube.  RORSCHACH casts a cautious glance\naround the room and advances stealthily toward the chair.  Onscreen,\nthe WOMAN at the vanity opens a jar and smear LIME-GREEN GOO on her\nface:\n\nTV ANNOUNCER\nThe years melt away with NOSTALGIA.  Use it once a week -- and\nwrinkles vanish overnight.  Medically tested, non-habit-forming\nNOSTALGIA is the patented beauty cream that actually reverses\nthe aging process . . .\n\nRORSCHACH\nMoloch?\n\nHe creeps up behind MOLOCH, lays a hand on his shoulder.\n\n121. REVERSE ANGLE - ON MOLOCH\nstaring at the TV screen with sightless eyes.  There's a NEAT ROUND\nBULLET-HOLE in the center of his forehead.  RORSCHACH sees it and\nspins on his heels, anticipating an ambush --\n\nTV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)\nFor the smooth young face he'll never forget --\n\n122. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nLAURIE is still flipping through records.  DREIBERG chuckles at the\nTV ad.\n\nTV ANNOUNCER\n-- turn back the clock with NOSTALGIA . . . from Veidt Industries.\n\nDREIBERG\nNo wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?\n\nLAURIE\nSure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm\nthirty-eight years old!\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide\nit?\n\nLAURIE\nI like the way you look.\n(beat)\nIt's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change.\nBut you, Daniel, you look . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nOld?\n\nLAURIE\nNot at all.  You look very -- dashing.\n(standing up)\nHere, you pick one.\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . What?\n\nLAURIE\nPick a record.  I feel like dancing.\n\nHer tone is unmistakably flirtatious.  DREIBERG hesitates -- then,\nwith a noncommittal smile, he moves to the record cabinet.\n\n123. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH making a hasty exit.  An AMPLIFIED VOICE booms out:\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nRORSCHACH!  THIS IS THE CIVIL TERRORISM UNIT.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO\nCOME OUT.\n\nHe goes to the window and peeks through the blinds.  On the street\noutside, BUBBLE CARS are massing, blocking off the intersection.  A\nCTU SWAT TEAM prepares to raid the building.\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nYOU WON'T BE HARMED.  COME OUT.  IT'S ALL OVER!\n\nHe's walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES\n-- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.\n\n124. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nThe PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG's stereo: an old Fats Waller\ntune, \"S'posin'.\"  He's slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces\nilluminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile\nshe reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt\npocket.\n\nDreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making\nhim nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her\nhands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so\nthat he can't avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on\nhis mouth.\n\nThe PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats' teasing vocal begins:\n\n\"S'posin' I should fall in love with you . . .\nDo you think that you could love me too . . .\"\n\n125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)\nSONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a\nhorrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying\na plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans --\nordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around\nunder the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid,\nrubbing alcohol, Drano.\n\nAlmost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the\nburners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.\n\n\"S'posin' I should hug you and caress you . . .\nWould it impress you . . .\"\n\n126. INT. TENEMENT - FRONT STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)\nA contingent of ARMED CTU MEN rushing silently up the stairs.\n\n\"Or would it distress you?  Hmm?\"\n\n127. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT (MOS)\nRORSCHACH dousing the living room carpet with charcoal lighter and\nrubbing alcohol.  There's a pile of bottles -- only half-emptied --\nresting next to the front door.  The CTU COPS are pounding on the\nfront door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the\nhallway just outside the living room.\n\nThe door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH\nstrikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN --\ncreating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the\npuddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF\nBOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.\n\n\"S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .\n(Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.)\nWould you think I'm speaking out of turn? . . .\"\n\n128. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE horizontal on the sofa, their clothes in\ndisarray.  LAURIE kisses him hungrily -- but he's distant, panicky,\nunable to respond.  It's been a long time for him.  It's not going\nwell.\n\n\"S'posin' I declare it\nWould you take my love and share it?\nI'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you . . .\"\n\nHe wriggles beneath her.  She takes his hand, presses it onto her\nbreast.\n\n129. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)\nINSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE continues UNDERNEATH as RORSCHACH backs through\nthe kitchen with his bucket.  SMOKE billows in from the living room.\n\nHe empties TWO BOTTLES OF COOKING OIL on the linoleum floor.  Then he\nducks through a door into the BACK STAIRWELL.\n\n130. INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)\nRORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper\ninto its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from\nthe smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov\ncocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.\n\nThe COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.  By the time they hit\nthe floor, the COOKING OIL has burst into flame.\n\nRORSCHACH bolts up the stairs; by now, another squad of CTU MEN is\ncoming up with back way behind him.\n\n131. INT.

TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)\nA GAPING HOLE blows open in the front of the building.  FIERY RUBBLE\nhails down on the CTU units outside.  Re-enter Fats on vocals:\n\n\"S'posin' I should hug you and caress you? . . .\nWould it impress you? . . .\"\n\n133. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nLAURIE is fumbling with DREIBERG's pants.  Finally he can't stand it\nanymore -- and with a pained, stricken look he pushes her away and\nsits up on the sofa.  His head sinks into his hands.  At first she\ndoesn't understand; then her face softens, and she moves to his side,\nembracing his shoulders, gently stroking his hair.\n\n\". . . Or would it distress you?\"\n\n134. INT. TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)\nRORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing, just below roof level.\nBy now the whole building is ablaze.  Two flights down, a pair of CTU\nCOPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.\n\nHe still has his mop bucket; it's half-full of water.  He reaches for\nhis last can -- a can of DRANO -- and empties it into the bucket,\nwhere it begins to HISS and SIZZLE.\n\n\"S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .\nWould you think I'm speaking out of turn . . .\"\n\nThe COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He\nsteps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their\nweapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.\n\nThe COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as\nRORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.\n\n135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH emerges -- and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the\nface.  Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP -- a\nblimp-like craft of the sort we saw earlier.  A spray of MACHINE-GUN\nFIRE peppers the roof.\n\n\"S'posin' I declare it.\nWould you take my love and share it? . . .\"\n\nRORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof, finds a rickety FIRE\nESCAPE, and dives over.  Unfortunately, he's now exposed on the front\nof the building -- pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on\nthe street.  TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows.  He turns and\ntries to climb back upward, but more COPS -- frm the just-landed\nAIRSHIP -- are already spilling over the edge of the roof.\n\n\"I ain't s'posin', I'm in love with you.\"\n\nThe song ends.  And on the last note, RORSCHACH emits an ungodly HOWL\nOF FURY -- diving over the metal railing, PLUNGING to the street\nbelow.\n\n136. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT\nThree stories down, he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans -- and\nlies there, spent, twisted, wracked with pain.  The CTU COPS are on\nhim instantly, kicking him, pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle\nbutts.\n\nCOPS\nGET HIM!  GET HIS MASK!  LET'S SEE THE LITTLE FUCKER'S FACE!!\n\nRORSCHACH\nGNAAAAHH!!  NO!! NO!!\n\nIn seconds the inkblot mask is off -- revealing a pocked, doughy face\ntopped off with a shock of MATTED RED HAIR.  It's a familiar\nface . . . the face of the STREET CRAZY who haunts the newsstand\nwith his placards announcing the end of the world.\n\nCOP\nChrist.  He's got five-inch heels.

LONG\nWalter --\n\nRORSCHACH\nDon't call me that.\n\nDR. LONG\nWalter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to\nhear.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWrong answers?\n\nDR. LONG\nThere's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest\nresponse, I can't help you.\n(pause)\nI want to help you.  I want to know all about you.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.\n\nLONG knows the standard procedure for intransigent cases like this.\nHe shrugs indifferently, reaches for his briefcase, then gropes under\nthe table and presses a buzzer to summon the guards.\n\nDR. LONG\nWell, then.  Have it your way, Walter.  Let me know when you decide\nto cooperate.\n\nTWO PRISON GUARDS enter through a steel door.  RORSCHACH gets up to\nleave.  He pauses in the doorway.\n\nRORSCHACH\nDoctor.  You don't want to help me.  You just want to find out what\nmakes me sick.\n(beat)\nYou'll find out.  -- You'll find out.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n141. INT. VEIDT INDUSTRIES PYRAMID - DAY\nA huge open atrium on the ground floor, with marble columns,\nfountains, eucalyptus trees -- an Egyptian pleasure garden.\nJUSTINE's hanging out with her video crew; they spot VEIDT on the\ncentral escalator and swing into action.\n\nJUSTINE\nAdrian!  Adrian!  Can you give us a comment of Rorschach?\n\nHe's not at all happy to see her.  His FLUNKIES -- bodyguards and\nsecretaries -- form a wedge around him as he tries to push past the\ncameras.\n\nVEIDT\nNo comment.\n\nJUSTINE\nDid you know he was back on the streets?\n\nVEIDT\nI did not.  Now get out of my way!\n\nJUSTINE\nIsn't it true that you --\n\nHe keeps walking, with JUSTINE in hot pursuit.  Then, wide-eyed, he\nSTOPS IN HIS TRACKS.  An ARMED GUNMAN has stepped out from behind a\npillar -- directly into VEIDT's path.\n\nASSASSIN\nVEIDT!\n\nVEIDT DIVES.  The ASSASSIN'S BULLET catches JUSTINE in the gut and\ncomes out the other side in a spray of blood.  With a gymnast's\nagility VEIDT rolls to the right -- and comes up with a BRASS ASHTRAY\nin his hands.\n\nHe swings it into the ASSASSIN'S RIBS, knocking him backward into a\nFOUNTAIN.  The GUN skitters off across the marble floor.\n\nAs the SECURITY STAFF races up, VEIDT steps INTO THE FOUNTAIN and\nslams the dazed ASSASSIN'S HEAD into a decorative bust of King\nTut.\n\nVEIDT\nSon of a bitch.  Who sent you?\n\nArms flying, the two men grapple.  VEIDT grabs hold of a ASSASSIN's\nhair and thrusts a HAND into his MOUTH.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nStand back, Mr. Veidt!  We'll handle it!\n\nVEIDT\nHe's got some kind of poison capsule.  Don't bite down, you\nscum, I want to know who sent you!\n\nThe ASSASSIN gags -- and GOES LIMP.  His lifeless body slumps down\ninto the water.  VEIDT steps out, shaken and breathless.\n\nVEIDT\nGoddammit . . .\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nWho'd wanna kill you, Mr. Veidt?\n\nVEIDT\nI don't know.  I don't know.  -- Get an ambulance for Miss James.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n142. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - DUSK\nTIGHT ON a portable TV tuned to the evening news.\n\nNEWSCASTER\n-- third day of rioting in major European capitals amid escalating\nfears of nuclear war.  In London, six people were trampled outside\nSt. Paul's cathedral when overflow crowds were turned away from\nmorning Mass --\n\nA PHONE RINGS.  DREIBERG, who's sprawled on his bed watching the TV,\nreaches for the receiver.\n\nDREIBERG\nYeah.\n(beat)\nAdrian!  What's up?\n\n143. INTERCUT VEIDT AND DREIBERG\nVEIDT\nIn have something to tell you.  I wanted to call before you heard it\non the news.\n(beat)\nSomeone tried to kill me today.\n\nFor a moment DREIBERG says nothing.  He's not altogether\nsurprised.\n\nDREIBERG\nWho?\n\nVEIDT\nI don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm\nstarting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?\n\nDREIBERG\nShe's with me.\n\nVEIDT\nGood.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.\n(beat)\nLook, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until\nall this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.\n\nDREIBERG\nThanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.\n\nHe hangs up and weighs his options while he stares at the box.\nLAURIE enters from the hallway, dressed in a bathrobe, toweling off\nher hair.\n\nLAURIE\nOhh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?\n\nDREIBERG\nOne more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.\n(beat)\n. . . First time I've ever heard him scared.\n\nHe doesn't say any more than that.  He doesn't have to.  LAURIE picks\nup on the implications immediately.  She exhales sharply, turns away\nfrom him and steadies herself against a bureau.\n\nDREIBERG\n-- What is it.\n\nLAURIE\nI know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't\naround.\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie --\n\nLAURIE\nI'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --\n\nDREIBERG\nWith any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.\n\nHis sour wisecrack starts her trembling -- almost crying.  DREIBERG,\nfed up with his own pessimism, climbs out of bed and walks over\nbehind her.\n\nLAURIE\nI shouldn't be here anyway, Daniel.  There's something I haven't told\nyou --\n\nBut before she does he shushes her, wraps his arms around her from\nbehind.\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie, I'm not afraid.  I want you with me.  I want it more than\nanything else in the world.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n144. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT\nCONVICTS lined up with metal trays at a long cafeteria-style serving\narea.  RORSCHACH enters in prison greys.  As he makes his way toward\nthe dinner line, we PICK UP a chorus of comments from the nearby\ntables:\n\nVOICE\nHey Rorschach.  You dead, man.  Just a matter of time now --\n\nVOICE II\nRorschach.  Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --\n\nLow, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH\npicks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The\nsmallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.\n\nGOON I\nDidn't know he was such a tiny little thing.\n\nGOON II\nLittle?  Naw, he's a big man.  Big man.\n\nRORSCHACH'S FACE shows no emotion.  He moves forward in the line.  A\nSERVER drops a gristly chunk of meat on his tin plate.\n\nGOON III\nI'd like to get his autograph.  I got my autograph book right here. .\n.\n\nGOON III reaches into his pocket and withdraws an ICEPICK.\n\nGOON III (cont.)\nNotched up some big names over the years.\n\nSuddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III's head with the edge of\nhis dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III\nfollows.\n\nThe others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving\ncounter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings\na KNEE up into GOON II's chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I's hair, and\ntumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I's head, face down,\ninto a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.\n\nLanding on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I's hair, RORSCHACH\nuses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER's gut.  GOON\nII lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby\nburner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with\nHOT COOKING FAT.\n\nAll this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two\ndisfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked\nand smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in\nwith billy clubs drawn.\n\nAs the GUARDS haul him off, RORSCHACH emits a ferocious HISS.  It\nsounds uncannily like the sizzle of boiling oil on human flesh.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n145. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - NIGHT\nA prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor --\ndelivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of\nthe cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are\ntotally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal\ndoors.\n\nAt a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door,\nthen throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of\nRORSCHACH.\n\nTRUSTY\nHey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they're dyin'\nman.\n(beat)\nTheir friends are talkin' 'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . .\nthis whole place blows.\n\nRORSCHACH emits his trademark HISS and turns from the door.  The\nTRUSTY chuckles in anticipation.\n\nTRUSTY (cont.)\nI'd hate to be you, man.  Locked in here with the likes of --\n\nRORSCHACH\nI'm not locked in here with them.  They're locked in here with me.\n\nWith that, the panel slides suddenly SHUT in the TRUSTY's face.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n146. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nLONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a\nsquare table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED\nWIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.\n\nThrough a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across\nthe table for RORSCHACH's inspection.  It's the same series of\ninkblots as before, the \"butterfly\" leading off.  But this time, the\nsubject has decided to cooperate:\n\nRORSCHACH\nA whore fucking.\n\nDR. LONG\nWho is she?  Do you know her?\n\nToo obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the \"nice\nflowers\":\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nMan's guts.  Falling out of his shirt.\n\nLONG clears his throat almost imperceptibly and nods.  Card #3:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nDoggy.  Big old floppy-eared dog --\n(pause; then, smiling)\n-- with his skull split open.\n\nDR. LONG\nAnd what -- split -- the dog's skull open?\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhy, doctor.  I did.\n(beat)\nHe was a bad dog.\n\nRORSCHACH is toying with him now.  DR. LONG gets down to brass\ntacks.\n\nDR. LONG\nWalter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In\nyour mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?\n\nRORSCHACH\nGod isn't there to do it.\n\nDR. LONG\nWe don't know that.\n\nRORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.\n\nDR. LONG\nSo the rest of the world is wrong, and you're right.  Is that it?\n(no response)\nYou tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why\nwould you want to kill a dog?\n\nWith LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:\n\nRORSCHACH\nOne night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.\n\n147. EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\nRuined buildings, broken windows.  The streets are silent except for\nthe distant sound of dogs BARKING.  RORSCHACH'S NARRATION continues\nOVER SCENE:\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O.)\n'75.  Kidnap case, the little Franco girl.  Weeks dragged by -- no\nword.  Thought of little child, alone, frightened . . . decided to\nintervene.\n\nThe lone figure of RORSCHACH emerges from the shadows and turns up\nhis collar.  He strides deliberately down the sidewalk past a\nramshackle wooden storm fence covered with obscene graffiti.\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\nGot a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.\n\nHe peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO\nHUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen\nobject.\n\n148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\nA DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file,\nflicks on a flashlight.\n\nMannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The\nlight shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders\nover.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and\non the floor, a ROPE.\n\nThere's a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it,\nsticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a\ncharred scrap of FABRIC from a child's pajamas, decorated with\nballoons and teddy bears.\n\nHe stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden\nCHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding\nparaphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher's\nknives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh\nWINDOW.\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\nDogs wouldn't shut up.  That's when I knew where the little girl had\ngone.\n\n149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\nThe German shepherds romp in the dying light.  We CLOSE IN ON the\ndogs until we see what it is they're tussling over: A BIG BLOODY KNOB\nOF BONE.\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\nDecided to wait for the owner . . .\n\n150. INT. FACTORY - ENTRY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\nKeys in the lock.  A moment later, the door swings wide;  a FAT MAN\nenters and whistles to the dogs.\n\nFAT MAN\nFred?  Barney?  Dinnerti--\n\nRORSCHACH steps out of the shadows and BASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD.\n\n151. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nRORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the\nstory.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his\nreply, asks:\n\nDR. LONG\nThen what happened?\n\nRORSCHACH\n. . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had\nto break in.\n\n152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\nThe FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He's\nhandcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a\nGROCERY SACK.\n\nHe kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off\nhis glove and reaches into the sack.\n\nFAT MAN\nWhat -- what are you d--\n\nRORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER\ninto his open mouth.  He's got several pounds of the stuff, and he\nspends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN's face,\nthroat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he's\ndone, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER\nBLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN's head.\n\nFRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door,\nand -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs\ninside.\n\nThen he stands back and enjoys the carnage.\n\n153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nDR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things\nup.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhen they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their\nskulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies.\n(leaning forward)\nSee, God didn't kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed\nher . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did,\nhe did't seem to mind.\n\nDR. LONG\nThat man, then, he was the first.  The first you --\n\nRORSCHACH\nSaw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make\nit that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.\n(slight smile)\nWhat else can I illuminate?\n\nLONG's had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the\nPRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he\npoints a finger at LONG's inkblot.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nNo right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . .\njust a man's face.\n(pause)\nSee it now?\n\nThe GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a\ncouple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a\nsecond he reaches for his briefcase; as he's gathering his cards, he\nSTOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern\non top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.\n\nLONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the\nRorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n154. EXT. BARN - TOWARD DUSK\nA rural tree-lined area outside the city.  A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls\nup outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to\nthe padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.\n\nAfter a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.\n\nLAURIE\nEnough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?\n\nDREIBERG\nMemory lane.\n\nHe opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.\n\n155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER\nInside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.\n\nLAURIE\nDaniel . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nGimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.\n\nShe goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull\nit back to reveal . . .\n\nTHE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL's high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It's a bit\ntarnished from years of disuse, but it's still an impressive sight.\nDREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around\nto join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.\n\nLAURIE\nThe Owlship.  I can't believe it.\n\nDREIBERG\n-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.\n\n156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on\nthe electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin,\nreliving days gone by.\n\nLAURIE\nWow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?\n\nDREIBERG\nI took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some\ncows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.\n\nLAURIE\nAntarctica??\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come\nalong.\n(pause)\nI've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a\nbad place to sit out a war.\n\nLAURIE\nWould you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be\nleft.\n\nDREIBERG\nYou and me.\n\nHe looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her\ngaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the\ncabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly\nrejected.\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . Yeah, you're right.  Probably wouldn't make it down there\nanyway.\n\nBehind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She's just\nopened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES\n-- their old superhero togs.\n\nLAURIE\nDan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.\n\nDREIBERG\nMe neither.  Mine barely even fits.\n(chuckling)\nThe thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping\npeople, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't\nknow.  It all seems so abstract.\n\nLAURIE's holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing\nherself in a small mirror above a sink.\n\nLAURIE\nGod, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat are you up to?\n\nLAURIE\nDon't look.  Turn around.\n\nSmirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the\ncabin.\n\nDREIBERG\nThis'd better not be what I think it is.\n\nLAURIE\nOkay!\n\nDREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE's in full costume, looking quite\nimposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns\nshock:\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nMy God, it's the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender\nof the weak!\n\nLAURIE\nIn the flesh.\n\nShe ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind,\nand strokes his thinning hair.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nPoor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don't you.\n\nDREIBERG\nSaving the world?  I guess I do.\n(smiling)\nMaybe we can still save ourselves . . .\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n157. EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - DUSK\nA massive PEACE RALLY downtown.  Thousands of citizens have turned\nout; PLACARDS and PROTEST SIGNS are everywhere.  Each remark is met\nby CHEERS and CHANTS, by raucous\nBOOS as well . . . and while the crowd is split between pacifists and\nhawks, they're all frightened as hell.\n\nThings are much the same in London, Berlin -- possibly even Moscow.\nThe end is nigh, and passions flare.  It's anarchy waiting to\nhappen.\n\nMAN ON STAGE\nYou know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff are doing right now?  They're\nsitting in the Pentagon talking about a first strike.  That's right --\na first strike!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD\nYou think the reds ain't doing the same thing?\n\nMAN ON STAGE\nThen for the love of God let's negotiate.  We can start a war.  But\nwe can't stop it!!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD II\nIt's pinko simps like you that drove Dr. Manhattan to Mars!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD III\nDr. Manhattan was an inhuman fascist!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD IV\nIt's God's judgment!  Jesus is the way!\n\nA HECKLER fights his way onstage and lunges for the microphone:\n\nHECKLER\nRussia's just been waiting for an opening.  They won't show us\nno mercy.  I say NUKE 'EM NOW!!\n\nMAN ON STAGE\nYou think this is some kind of grudge match??  We're talking the\nend of the world!!\n\nThe two of them grapple at the mike, and the HECKLER falls off the\nstage.  On cue, the crowd ERUPTS.  FIGHTS break out; COPS start\nswinging rifle butts.\n\nAs PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of\nHOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.  Their undersides --\noutfitted with heavy artillery on turrets -- bear the initials\n\"CTU\"\n\n158. INT.

WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE FORCE.\n\nA couple of COPS go down in the melee.  RIOTERS grab their rifles,\nturn them on the CTU ships overhead.

BARN - DUSK\nDREIBERG walks around to the front of the Owlship with a TOOLKIT,\nwiping his hands on an oily rag.  He calls inside to LAURIE:\n\nDREIBERG\nGuess that ought to do it.  Let's shut her down --  Laurie?\n\nNo reply.  Curious, he climbs aboard.\n\n161. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nLAURIE's standing by the monitor over the instrument console.  Her\nface is distraught, agonized.\n\nLAURIE\nDaniel, you ought to take a look at this.\n\nOnscreen, it's total screaming chaos.  CANNONS on the bellies of the\nCTU HOVERCRAFT swivel randomly, spitting AUTOMATIC FIRE at the mobs\nbelow.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat the hell -- ?\n\nLAURIE\nIt's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.\n\nDREIBERG\nOh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.\n\nHe turns away, paralyzed with horror.  LAURIE watches awestruck.\n\nLAURIE\nThey're just mowing 'em down.\n(pause)\nThis is it.  The end of the world.

FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE>\nWe're back in slo-mo sepia land, the Golden Age of Superheroes.  THE\nOWLSHIP emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame,\nlike the Seventh Cavalry arriving to save the day.  As it draws\ncloser, the perspex canopy coming into view, we can just make out\nNIGHT OWL at the helm, with SILK SPECTRE riding shotgun.\n\nThere's a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless\nmotions stylized and surreal.  They're beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as\nthe Owlship's powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy\nequivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --\n\n-- and suddenly, the footage we're watching undergoes a SUBTLE\nTRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the\naction QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we're in\nfull-color and real-time --\n\n163.

AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT\n-- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured\nship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets\nsputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against\nthe water.\n\n167.

IDENTIFY YOURSELF.\n\nOWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER\nBABY . . . WE'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.\n\nThe crowd's in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But\na dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the\nstrange sight overhead.\n\nVOICE IN CROWD\n. . . IT'S THE WATCHMEN!!\n\nEXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air,\nclumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging\nimmobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West\nshowdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate\ninto position.\n\n170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.\n\nDREIBERG\nWe're gonna have to shave this one close.\n\nAn instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle\nFULL-FORWARD.\n\n171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\nWith a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS\nCONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond\nbefore -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES\nFORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD\nCHEERS.\n\n172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nDREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the\naft view from the ship.\n\nLAURIE\nThey're following us.\n\nDREIBERG\nAll right.  Mission accomplished.\n\nHe's no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the\nship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.\n\n173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU\nSHIPS rip past on either side.\n\n174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT\nASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The\nOWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE\nblows a HOLE in its facade.\n\n175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\nfiring TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.\n\n176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar\nreadout:\n\nLAURIE\nMissed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.\n\nLAURIE\n(checking the monitor)\nThey're practically on us . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nThat Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.\n\nHe punches a button on the dash.  It's labelled \"TURBO.\"\n\n177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP\nThe turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving\nthe CTU craft in the dust.\n\n178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT\nA line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly,\nand -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.\n\nA moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The\nless-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and\nEXPLODES\n\nThe SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last\nmoment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP\nITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles\nfor the airborne route.\n\n179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER\nThe OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the\ncars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.\n\nThere's an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges\nUP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS\nagainst the roof of the tunnel.\n\n180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe end of the tunnel is coming up fast.\n\nDREIBERG\nFog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.\n\n181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an\nalmost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its\nwake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives --\nbut, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward\non a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the\nwater.\n\n182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nThey're in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of\nintense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.\n\nLAURIE\nWe lost him.\n\nHe flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she\nshakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nOh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\n183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT\nThe usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving\nline.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall\nand falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of\nhim.\n\nTRUSTY\nJust left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.\n\nThe CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes\nthrough the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds,\nit's reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named\nT-BONE.\n\nCON IN LINE\nOtis went down.\n\nT-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of\nSIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the\nbiggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET:\nLITTLE BIGGER.\n\nT-BONE\nJust heard, boss.  Otis bought it.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nFuckin' Rorschach.\n(nodding to himself)\nThis joint goes up.  Tonight.\n\n184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nDrifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship\nemerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale\nblue moonlight.\n\n185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nThrough the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then\ndisappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We're taking a dreamy tour\nof the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is\nsinging \"You're My Thrill.\"\n\nInstruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one's at the\ncontrols.\n\nThe ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the\nwidth of the cabin floor.  A woman's hand reaches for it, sets it\nright.\n\nIt's LAURIE, who's midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG.\nThe pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the\ncabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.\n\nLAURIE\nBetter.  Much better.\n\nDREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile\ninstead.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nI bet I know what made the difference this time.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat?\n\nLAURIE\n(smirking)\nThe costumes.  Am I right?\n\nDREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite\nhimself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nCome on.  Admit it!\n\nDREIBERG\nNo way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.\n\nLAURIE\nYes you are.\n\nDREIBERG\n(drily)\nNo offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.\n(pause; then, seriously)\nTonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's because --\n\nDREIBERG\nIt's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's\nabout to end.\n(a weird smile)\nI feel like I could save it.\n\nHe grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to\nthe instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship\nhard right.\n\nLAURIE\nYou're full of yourself.  What are you doing?\n\nDREIBERG\nLong as we're on the subject of perverts . . .\n(turning to face her)\nI miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.\n\nLAURIE\n. . . What??\n\nDREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches\nfor the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.\n\n186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT\nAFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through\nthe clouds above the city.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON\n-- and as Sly Stone once said, there's a riot goin' on.  SIRENS HOWL\nas we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild:\ndisabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons,\nthrowing food.\n\n188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG's eyes are\nriveted to a monitor over the controls:\n\nDREIBERG\nI think we're just a trifle late.\n\nLAURIE\nJesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .\n\nThe MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below\nthem.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire\nwith the guards in the watchtower.  It's an ugly, bloody mess.\n\nDREIBERG\nI know he's totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen\ntimes.\n\n189. INT. CELL - NIGHT\nSIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs\ndrawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.\n\n190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT\nSmoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past\nsprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR\nMENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It's the\npsychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE,\nand T-BONE.\n\nWheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop\noutside RORSCHACH's cell and GRIN in anticipation.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nFind an outlet for this thing\n(shouting)\nRorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It's payback time!\n\nRAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying\na big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH's\ndoor, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.\n\nCARLOS\nSee this, runt?  We're gonna take your puny little balls off . . .\nand pickle 'em!!\n(chortling)\nAww!  I think he just wet his pants!\n\nHILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place\nat the panel in the door:\n\nT-BONE\nLemme see.  Lemme see!\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nRelax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve.\n(to T-BONE)\nWhat's he doin' now?\n\nNo response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed\ntightly to the panel.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER (cont.)\nYou deaf?  I said, what's he --\n\nHe gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE's legs buckle and he topples over\nbackwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON\nquivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye\nsocket.\n\nRAFE\nBOSS!  JESUS!\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nSon of a bitch! -- WE'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE\nA GRAPE.\n(to RAFE)\nLight the torch.\n\nRAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of\nRORSCHACH's cage.\n\n191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT\nRORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the\ninside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic\nEARMUFFS.\n\nDREIBERG\nOkay, I'm turning on the screamers.  We'll have to hit the roof\nrunning . . .\n\nHe throws a switch on the control panel.\n\n193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nWINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH\nsplits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop\ntheir weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as\nthe Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .\n\n194. INT. RORSCHACH'S CELL - THAT MOMENT\nThe LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH'S\nFACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the\nwall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his\nTOILET.\n\nGrunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its\nmounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is\nFLOODED.\n\n195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER\nRAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.\n\nRAFE\nOkay, boss, that oughta do it.\n\nThey give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER\ncome gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nWHAT THE --\n\nRAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but\nthere's no trace of RORSCHACH.\n\nCARLOS\nRorschach.  Company's calling . . .\n\nRAFE\nWhere is the fuckin' runt?\n\nCARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his\nfist.\n\n196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT\nIn answer to RAFE's question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door.\nHe SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO's outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of\nthe LOCK catches CARLO'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .\n\n. . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS,\nmonkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide\nand an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.\n\nCARLOS\nYOU'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --\n\nFrom the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor\nBETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --\n\n-- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --\n\n-- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do\na herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --\n\n-- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock\nDIM and DIE.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down\noff his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies\nof the dead.\n\nRORSCHACH\nYour move . . . runt.\n\nThe midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor\nas fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.\n\n197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER\nDREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to\nget their bearings.\n\nLAURIE\nWhere are we?  What happened to the lights?\n\nDREIBERG\nGenerators'll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary .\n. .\n\nTheir heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND\nCORRIDOR crosses the one they're standing in.  As they watch, a\nSCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.\n\nDREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a\nfamiliar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . Rorschach??\n\nRORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second\nand a half -- then keeps on walking.\n\n198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER\nThe terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he's just hit a dead end.  He\nthrows a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him.\nDesperate, he ducks into a MEN'S ROOM.\n\nRORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him,\nLAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross\ncorridor.\n\nLAURIE\nRorschach!  Is that you??\n\nHe turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and\ndispassionate, he enters the MEN's room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand\nat the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat's he doing?\n\nDREIBERG\nI think he's going to the john.\n\nLAURIE\nMy God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and\nhe stops to take a --\n\nBefore she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a\npaper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a\n\"howdy.\"\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . That was quick.\n\nRORSCHACH\nToilet clogged.  Short fat turd.\n(beat)\nLet's get out of here.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT\nA well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky\nMountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.\n\nAir Force One is coming in for a landing.\n\n200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER\nLots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling\nabout.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and\nwhat looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal\nramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON's in the passenger seat, and there's an\nimposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating\na long stay.\n\nPRESIDENT NIXON\nHello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY\nShe's all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right\naway.\n\nLIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless\ncorridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY (cont.)\nWeatherman says we're lookin' good.  We've got a fourteen-hour\nwindow.\n\nPRESIDENT NIXON\nFourteen hours, huh?\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY\nFourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n201. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nLAURIE's following the Watchmen press coverage on an overhead screen\n. . .\n\nNEWSCASTER\n-- in a daring midnight jailbreak.  Earlier eyewitness reports place\nthe one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --\n\n. . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control\nconsole, occupied by other matters.\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his\nmangy cat on me.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat new information?\n\nRORSCHACH\nBlake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan\nsomehow involved . . .\n(scratching his chin)\n\nStrange that no one's tried to attack you, Daniel.\n\nThere's an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG,\nhighly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.\n\nDREIBERG\nI beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.\n\nLAURIE\nWill you two lovebirds keep it down?\n\nStill grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at\nthe monitor LAURIE's watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the\nscreen:\n\nNEWSCASTER\n. . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was\nunavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the\nAntarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.\n\nRORSCHACH\n\"Ozone layer\"?\n\nDREIBERG\n(rolling his eyes)\nChrist.  Couldn't he just admit that he's scared??\n\nCUT TO:\n\n202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT\nThe last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of\npristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous\nstrip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered\naround what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is\none.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT's Antarctic retreat.\n\n203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT\nThe entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian\nstyle as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad\nfigure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered\nLYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him.\nOne of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a\nsilver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back\nof the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.\n\nLACKEY\nWelcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.\n\nVEIDT\nFeed Bubastis.  I'll have dinner when I've looked in on the world.\n\nThey hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him\nto:\n\n204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT\nThe room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated\nREMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair,\nRED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.\n\nVEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal\na towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid,\npicking up transmissions from all over the world.  It's far more\ninformational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp,\na hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in\nand his eyes begin to rove.\n\n205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL\nPANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials,\nsitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled \"LONDON.\"\nVEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER'S VOICE\ncomes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense\nlogo . . .\n\nBBC NEWSCASTER\n-- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as\npossible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter\ncan be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --\n\nFLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT's gaze drifts several screens to\nthe right, to the monitor labelled \"WASHINGTON D.C.\"  Sound up:\n\nNEWSCASTER\n-- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have\nalready been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen\ninsist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing\nnegotiations --\n\nFLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the\nbottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT's antarctic\nretreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new\nangle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are\nclear.  FLICK --\n\n-- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we're\nwatching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from\ntwenty-some years ago; he's sitting at a table in the Gila Flas\ncanteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he's getting ready to\npropose.\n\n206. REVERSE ANGLE - ON VEIDT\neyeing young Osterman with a strange, grave smile.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n207. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT\nLOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds.\nOn its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.\n\n208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of\nthe city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS,\ngradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It's been cordoned off,\nPOLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.\n\nDREIBERG\nThey've got my building surrounded.\n(looking up at her)\nThey must've been following you all along.\n\nShe stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the\naccelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nSo much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.\n\nLAURIE\nWelcome back, Night Owl.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?\n\nRORSCHACH\nCTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat do you mean, frame-up?\n\nRORSCHACH\nObvious pattern -- all ties in --\n\nDREIBERG\nAre you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to\nget back at us?\n(spreading his hands)\nWhat about all those poor shits with cancer?\n\nTIGHT ON LAURIE, who's listening to all this with mounting\ndistress.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHow do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive\npropaganda scheme . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nCome on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --\n\nLAURIE\n(interrupting him)\nIt's not.\n\nRORSCHACH\nNot what?\n\nLAURIE\nNot \"propaganda.\"\n(pause; then, blurting it out --)\nChrist, I'm one of them!  I've got it.\n\nDREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face\nbone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her\ngrim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can\nthink of anything to say.\n\nThen RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the \"case,\" breaks the\nsilence.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHnrrr -- changes everything.  Let's get moving.\n\n209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he\npries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily\nat a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers\nabove.\n\n210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.\n\nLAURIE\nI should've told you, Dan.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted things between\nus to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --\n\nDREIBERG\nIt doesn't change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.\n\nHe tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up\nwith tears.\n\nLAURIE\nI love you too, Dan, I -- why don't you give me a minute to get\nmyself together, okay?\n\n211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nA distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP.\nRORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of\nsatisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees\nDREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.\n\nAbove their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.\n\n212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nLAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona\nresolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.\n\nLAURIE\nJon.  What are you doing here?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.\n\nLAURIE\nCollect me?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nIn the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye.\nYou're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .\n\nLAURIE\nJon, no -- I can't --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nIt will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us\ncan do anything to change it.\n\nDREIBERG's frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside\nthe cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR.\nMANHATTAN's hand.\n\nDREIBERG\nLAURIE!  DON'T --\n\nHands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and\nLAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.\n\nStunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There's obviously nothing he can\ndo.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhere's Laurie?\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't think she's coming with us.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT\nA BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian\nsurface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later\nLAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps,\nthen GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red\nsands.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN's gone several paces before he realizes there's a\nproblem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at\nthe air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back\nand extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by\na HALO OF OXYGEN.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThe atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.\n\nLAURIE\nJesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --\n\nIgnoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she\nstops in her tracks.\n\nBefore her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN's new abode: a\nPALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren\nsands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS,\nsurrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and\npendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering\ncrystalline castle.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI live here now.\n\nHe strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after\nhim.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nTIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the\nglow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHeading south.  What's the plan?\n\nDREIBERG\nWe're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're\nhightailing it down to Adrian's.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --\n\nDREIBERG\n(exploding)\nCases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to\nend.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't\nmatter.\n\nRORSCHACH\nCoward.  Giving up.\n\nDREIBERG\nSHUT UP, Rorschach.\n\nRORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.\n\nRORSCHACH\nSorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.\n(pause)\nSorry about Laurie.\n\nDREIBERG\n(choked voice)\nOkay, let's just . . . thank you.\n\nFor a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can't leave well\nenough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt's not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT\nLAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals\naround the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the\nenormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING\n-- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.\n\nLAURIE\nThis whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me\nyou're sleeping with Dreiberg.\n\nLAURIE\nYou -- you know about me and Dan?\n\nHe gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nTime is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I'll\nfinally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.\n\nLAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?\n(flustered)\nDan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks\nat me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of\natoms.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\n(startled)\nThen you're sleeping with Dreiberg?\n\nLAURIE\nWell, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThat's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even\nmy responses.\n(nodding)\nWe're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  --\nThirty seconds.\n\nShe GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle\nof the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles\nbelow them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent\nWIND whips across their faces.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'll be here for the next year or so.  Then I'm going to work my way\nout toward the edge of the universe.\n(staring out at the landscape)\nUtterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn't it beautiful?\n\nShe moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and\nfissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and\nfrightened.\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me\nonce?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.\n\nLAURIE\nYet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be\nbeing with me.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't\nknow what did.\n\nLAURIE\nBut you knew that I'd -- die.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nMemories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to\ndwell on the unpleasant ones . . .\n(pause)\nYou won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.\n\nLAURIE's blood runs cold as she realizes what he's telling her.\n\nLAURIE\nThen it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've\nalways known.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\n(nodding)\nAlways.  Ever since the day I died.\n\nHe walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the\nforbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in\nher hands.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\nDo you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it's been like for me\nthese last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be\ndestroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless\nagent of its destruction?\n\nLAURIE\n(sobbing)\nThen why don't you . . . do something about it!\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nBecause --\n\nLAURIE\nBecause you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.\n(angrily)\nJon.  This, this \"script\" you're following . . . who writes it?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six\nhundred years.\n\nThat about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the\nshoulders:\n\nLAURIE\nI can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to\ndie I want to be with -- other people.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nPlease, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a\nuniverse to explore.  I'll be alone.\n(reaching for her hand)\nYou're the last human being I'll ever see.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south\nAtlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and\nbegins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .\n\n217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro.\nFinally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH's taken a bad\ntumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhat happened?\n\nDREIBERG\nThe guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some\nkind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhat caused it?\n\nDREIBERG\nDon't know.  Nothing I can think of --\n(apprehensively)\n-- outside of a nuclear blast.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT\nVEIDT'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible\nthrough a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.\n\n219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nVEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled \u00b3MOSCOW\u00b2 and \u00b3WASHINGTON, D.C.\u00b2 -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.\n\nA second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.\n\n220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.\n\n221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThrough the cockpit, KARNAK\u00b9s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it\u00b9s lost in the snows again.\n\nDREIBERG\nI\u00b9m taking her down.\n(frantically throwing switches)\nRadar\u00b9s blown.  I\u00b9ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --\n\nThe SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.\n\n222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.\n\nA HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They\u00b9re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.\n\n223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nVEIDT\u00b9s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.\n\nAs he watches, the screens for \u00b3LONDON\u00b2 and \u00b3PARIS\u00b2 go WHITE.\n\n224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER\nDREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN\u00b9S VOICE announces:\n\nVOICE\nWelcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian!  It\u00b9s Dreiberg.  For God\u00b9s sake open the doors.\n\nNothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nAdrian!  We\u00b9re freezing to death out here!\n\nHe slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.\n\nRORSCHACH\n. . . He\u00b9s not coming, Daniel.\n\n225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nOn the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.\n\nThe wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, \u00b3PRAGUE\u00b2 goes white.\n\n226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT\nDREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.\n\nDREIBERG\nCan\u00b9t move . . . we\u00b9re done for.\n\nRORSCHACH\nCome on.  Found an exhaust vent.\n\nRORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nVeidt.  It\u00b9s been Veidt all along.  He\u00b9ll pay for this.\n\n227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT\nVEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.\n\nTWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.\n\nVEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX\ngrowls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal's\nneck: quiet, girl.\n\nRORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN\nFLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening\nscene.  Suddenly . . .\n\nRORSCHACH\nVEIDT!\n\nVEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall;\nit catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG\nbacks against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward\nhim, TEETH BARED.\n\nVEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a\nfuturistic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along --\npart of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?\n\nRORSCHACH\nHe's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --\n\nVEIDT\nYeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of\ncourse . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nThe missing scientists.\n\nVEIDT\nUh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked\nat Gila Flats.\n\nRORSCHACH\nGila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .\n\nVEIDT\nDr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save\nthe world.\n\n228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nGun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak.\nRORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping\nat his heels.\n\nVEIDT\nBlake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers\n-- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn't Russia.\n(tapping his chest)\nIt was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill\nhim.  The rest of it -- Rorschach's capture, my \"assassination\" --\nthat was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting\nrid of Dr. Manhattan.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat??\n\nVEIDT\nI couldn't let him interfere with my project.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt.  You're the one who started World War III.\n\nVEIDT\nNo.  I just hastened the inevitable.\n(smiling)\nHe's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a\nlittle push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates\ncancer.\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie?  You're responsible for --\n\nVEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls\nout a smoke and strikes it against the box.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nOne thing I've learned about cancer -- it's much easier to generate\nthan it is to cure.\n\nDREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the\nstun gun across DREIBERG's face, knocking him to the floor -- and\nLEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.\n\nVEIDT\nLet's get something straight.  If you try that again, I'll kill you\nwithout a moment's thought.\n\nThey've reached the entrance to VEIDT's information room.  200\nSCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them\ninside.\n\nRORSCHACH\nCall off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.\n\nVEIDT\nBefore you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking\nat.\n\n229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nVEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand\ncorner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila\nFlats, reassembling a WATCH.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat is this?  It looks like Jon.\n\nVEIDT\nIt is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr.\nManhattan.\n\nDREIBERG\nGood Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?\n\nVEIDT\nIt's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him,\nLAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she's\nhit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On\nMars.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can't die.  It's a\nmystery I'd like to penetrate.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, I do not want to hear it.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .\n\nLAURIE\n(shaking her head)\nOh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYou're the only human being I care for.\n\nLAURIE\nThen do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter\na bit.\n(pause)\nI want you to cure me.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI won't do that.\n\nLAURIE\nYou have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.\n\nLAURIE\nJon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you\n-- then do it.\n\nEyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her\nchest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.\n\nHer fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR.\nMANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he's got to make the\nhardest decision of his life.  And then . . .\n\nA BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN\nINTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian\nlandscape altogether.\n\nWith a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see\nthe figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great\nwhite VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the\nMartian desert gradually materialize around them.\n\nThe two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like\nstatues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what's happened.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat -- am I --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nCured, yes.\n\nUtterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a\nhandrail for support.  He looks like a man who's just had a heart\nattack.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, what is it?  What's the matter?\n\nWhen he looks up at her, he's DESOLATE -- his face filled with\nDREAD.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nSomething. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It's all gone blank on\nme.  -- I can't remember the future.\n\nSlowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around\nhim.\n\nLAURIE\nJon.  Let's go back to Earth.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT\nVEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F.\nroom at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring\nmachinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.\n\nInside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON\nOSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY's watch into\nits brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching\nhim from twenty-four years in the future.\n\nVEIDT\nGentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.\n(pause)\nStand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat is it?  How does it work?\n\nVEIDT\nIt's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow\nbackward in time.\n(smiling)\nThere are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing\nparallel to our own --\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian -- you've lost it.\n\nVEIDT\n(pointing at the tachyon bubble)\nI've seen them!  I've seen them in there.\n(pause)\n\nIn some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it\nsurvives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.\n\nHe draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nThe creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war.\n(wild-eyed)\nDo you understand now?  Do you see what I\u00b9m going to do?  I\u00b9m going to change the past!\n\n232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT\nDR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.\n\nLAURIE\nWe\u00b9re too late.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nIt\u00b9s very strange.  Time\u00b9s flowing backwards . . .\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- what??\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThe south pole.  Time\u00b9s flowing backwards.\n\n233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\nInside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY\u00b9s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.\n\nVEIDT\nAt first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.\n\nHe steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.\n\nVEIDT\nIt ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds.\n(turning to face them)\nIn a minute I\u00b9ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I\u00b9ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman\u00b9s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.\n\nDREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.\n\nRORSCHACH\n. . . And they call me a fucking nut.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian.  It\u00b9s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.\n\nVEIDT\nDon\u00b9t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won\u00b9t even be here, will we?\n\nDREIBERG\nAnd what if you\u00b9re wrong?\n\nVEIDT\nI\u00b9m not.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat if you\u00b9re wrong??\n\nVEIDT\nThen I\u00b9ve been a very bad boy and you\u00b9ll have to spank me.  Christ!\n(shouting)\nI\u00b9m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!\n\n234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nA POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThat\u00b9s it.  That\u00b9s the source of the time disturbance.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, where are we?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nVeidt\u00b9s complex.\n\n235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\n\nTwenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler\u00b9s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:\n\nVEIDT\nYour problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years\nchasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . .\nas if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.\n\nDREIBERG\nYou ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist\nbullshit is going to save the world?\n\nVEIDT\nWe'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.\n\nHe kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum.\nThen he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.\n\n236. VEIDT'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS\nIn the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears\na SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .\n\n237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\nA LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon\nbubble.  There's a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up\n--  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the\ntrigger . . .\n\n. . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.\nVEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .\n\n. . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with\nLAURIE at his side.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?\n\nVEIDT\nJon!  Get back!  You don't understand.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees\nhimself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of\nthe I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he's\nsurprised.\n\nIn the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to\nsidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN\nTHE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.\n\nVEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE's directly in his path.  He\nshoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and\npoints his STUN GUN directly at her --\n\n-- and a millisecond later, he\u00b9s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.\n\nVEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN\u00b9s outstretched finger --\n\nVEIDT\nNO!!!!\n\n-- and in the wink of an eye, he\u00b9s VAPORIZED.  All that\u00b9s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.\n\nDREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat was he doing?\n\nDREIBERG\nTrying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nHe was right.\n\nRORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nHe did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It\u00b9s so elegant.  It\u00b9s so obvious.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\u00b9s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.\n\nLAURIE\nJon --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nSpace and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- for God\u00b9s sake, what do you see?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!\n\nHe lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz\naround his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the\nroom dim; it's as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the\nworld into his own massive frame.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nMy work here is finished . . .\n\nThe others cower.  They sense that something large is about to\nhappen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the\ntest chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the\ntiny\nhole in time.\n\nHe does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS\ninto a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND\nSTEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.\n\n238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\nJON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter\nbewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling\ngloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nDon't be afraid, Jon.  I'll be here with you.\n\nA second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps\nforward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.\n\nFor a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN's frame\nsurrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR.\nMANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the\nchamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across\nthe shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he\nspreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding\nFLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging\nwith nothingness . . .\n\n. . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue\nlight dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he's\nalive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.\n\n239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER\nThe timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of\nhis awed colleagues, who've seen everything through the observation\npanel.\n\nSCIENTIST\nWhat in the name of God . . .\n\nThe SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY,\nsobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As\nshe clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he\nlooks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .\n\nJON\nYour watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --\n\nSCIENTIST II\nLOOK!!\n\nThe SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber .\n. . which isn't there.  Instead, there's a rippling, irregular\nRUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are\nthree odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and\nRORSCHACH.\n\n240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT'S LAB - THE PRESENT\nDREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the\nastounded SCIENTISTS.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat happened -- ?\n\nDREIBERG\nHe saved himself.  He changed the past.\n\nLAURIE\nWhere did he go?\n\nBefore DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to\nTHROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For\na moment everything's back to normal --\n\n-- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they're in begins to\nDISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.\n\nA sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around\nthem, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge\ninto . . .\n\n241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT\nDREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an\notherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time\ncould be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this\nwould be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate;\ntheir tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they\nknow it, they find themselves deposited --\n\n242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT\n-- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them\nmaterialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them,\nslamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the\nsame, knocking over a fire hydrant.\n\nLAURIE\nDan, is this -- is this New York??\n\nDREIBERG\nThose cars.  What year is this??\n\nLAURIE\nEverything's changed --\n\nIt's a disorienting world they've landed in.  In fact, it's\nour world, our New York, and everything -- the cars,\nthe clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of\nwhack . . .\n\nRORSCHACH\nHnrrrrr -- we never happened.\n\nBYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the\nobvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of\ncourse, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden\npresence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers:\nNuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?\n\nRORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too\nclose, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to\nseveral dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection\naltogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a\nshrill WHISTLE.\n\nDREIBERG\nOh my God, they still ride around on horses!\n\n243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT\nThe same newsstand we've seen all along -- but luckily, here in our\nworld, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: \"RUSSIAN SUMMIT\nTALKS COLLAPSE.\"  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR\nis gapin at the ruckus on the street.\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nJesus Christ, it must be Halloween.\n\nHis sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to\nthe befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.\n\nKID\nShit, man!  It's Rorschach!  And Night Owl!\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nWhat are you talkin' about?\n\nKID\nSuperheroes!  Check it out!\n\nHe thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR's hand and races off to\njoin the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares\ndown at the costumed characters in the comic book -- \"WATCHMEN\" --\nthen throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the\nstreet.\n\nKID\nAll right!  They must be on a case.\n\n244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nHORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed\nwith curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived\nto clear the streets and restore order.\n\nCOP I\nBreak it up!  Stand back!\n\nCOP II\nCome on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --\n\nDREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle.\nThey don't know what to expect and they're poised for a brawl.  The\ntaunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant\nto advance.\n\nLAURIE\nDan -- what do we do now?\n\nDREIBERG\n(panicked)\nWherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --\n\nLAURIE\nWe'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't\nthey -- ?\n\nRORSCHACH\nThey'd better.\n\nAnd on RORSCHACH's final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nTHE END1Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

It is my turn to recite the day's lesson. The Inspector's ruler points to me.\n\n\"Stand up. Recite the adventures of Columbus. What was the date of Columbus' landing in Jamaica? What were the names of his ships? Why was he in the Caribbean?\"\n\nMy heart pounds. The heat of the morning sun, soaking through the galvanised roof, is magnified inside the schoolroom. The stench of fear is in everyone's nostrils. Something tells me that my days of being hidden, disposed of, dispatched to the invisibility of the back row, are numbered.\n\nI stand up, my limbs shaking uncontrollably, sweat dripping from my armpits, my eyes inflamed. My belly aches. I am petrified. Words fail to come out. They are formed in my head, but my lips do not speak them. The Inspector's eyes pierce me through. They demand a response, demand to be respected and obeyed.\n\n\"What was Columbus doing here anyway?\" The trapped words inside my head tumble out. The rebel inside me is alive. The schoolroom becomes even quieter, if that is possible.\n\n\"You in for it,\" Patricia, sitting next to where I stand shaking, mutters without moving her lips. I know she is speaking the truth.\nThe Inspector's face is frozen. Miss Henderson, form six teacher, pounces with the ruler. Her face says she is sure she could not have heard what she thought she heard.\n\n\"What did you say, Hortense?\"\n\nFrom I don't know where, a power surges through me. My fists clench. My teeth lock into each other. Miss Henderson reads challenge in my face. I stand still, not daring to say any more.\n\n\"What did you say?\" she commands, challenging me to repeat my facetiness. And again it happens. Words gush out of my mouth. \"Is what Columbus did want? Who invite him here?\"\n\nBefore the last word has left my lips, the sharp sting of the ruler cracks my knuckles. Stupidly, I had left my clenched fist on the desk in front of me. The blow brings me back to the steam bath. Sweat now drips from my face, floods my armpits, drips from between my legs.\n\nI could kill this woman with her sharp pointed nose, mean eyes and frightened face. We cross eyes, and for an instant I see the fear which has trapped us in this rank, smelly room. Miss Henderson is afraid. She is as much afraid of the Inspector as I am.\n\nMy brains, what brains I have left, are bouncing around in my skull, goading me on. I will get more of the ruler. It is written across Miss Henderson's wrinkled forehead. My life is at an end! At least in this school. If Miss Henderson does not kill me with this ruler, my aunt is sure to finish me off when she  hears how I back-chat the Inspector and Teacher Henderson.\n\nMy parents are in England and living with my aunt is like walking a tight-rope. One little slip and I am in big trouble. Dis look and smell like big trouble to me.\n\nThe lunch bell echoes throughout the school. My salvation? For now, anyway.\n\nHungry bellies rumble in the steam bath, but we are still transfixed by the Inspector, paralysed by Miss Henderson's stare. Feet shuffle, fingers scratch prickly skin. From outside there is the freedom of released bodies bouncing against the partition and liberated voices rising. They magnify our imprisonment. But the walls have been breached. The jailers are quick to realise that this battle is lost. For now.\n\n\"Class dismissed,\" the Inspector grudgingly commands. Miss Henderson lowers her eyes.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Inspector. Good afternoon, Miss Henderson,\" we recite. Miss Henderson steps aside, stiffly. Fifty tense bodies scurry past, politely, straining to taste the fresh, if hot air of the noonday world and feed themselves from the lunch women under the cotton tree. But first there is Lorna Phillips to take care of. Somebody has to pay for this.\n\n\"Yo red pickney always sit a de front of de class. Unno t'ink is because yu pretty. Is only \u2018cause teacher frighten fi yu pupa,\" I curse Lorna, as we bundle down the steps, out of earshot of Miss Henderson and the Inspector.\n\"Is 'cause yu black and stupid why teacher meek yu sit a de back all de time,\" Lorna chirps in.\n\n\"Is who you calling stupid? Yo want yu bloody nose right here?\"\n\nThis is always the outcome of a tense morning in school. A fight often follows the Inspector's visits.\n\nLorna pushes past me and tries to make a break for the school gate. But I give chase, followed by Samuel, Tim, Patricia, Maud and Yvonne. Today she will pay for being teacher's favourite, for being \"red\", for being rich, for having everything I don't have.\n\n\"Look how fast she moving on dem marga foot,\" taunts Yvonne.\n\n\"Come, let we beat her up,\" I shout, and we surge forward, pursuing Lorna out of school.\n\nI might not know the answers, but I can fight.\n\nJust then, from behind the school gate, Teacher Edwards comes into view. He is big, sturdy and beautifully dark, with a baby moustache. He is handsomely dressed in his Dashiki suit. There is a kindness about this man that is not usually found among teachers. He would always listen to you, and not just take the teacher's side. He only beat you if he really feel you was out of order, rude, or you get catch with something you thief. We respected and even liked him.\n\nThe running stops, slows to a polite walk. The hot pursuit melts into fixed grins and prim steps.\n\n\"Good afternoon, children.\"\n\n\"Good afternoon, Teacher Edwards,\" we still the vengeance in our voices long enough to chant in unison.\n\nLorna makes the most of Teacher Edwards' presence.\n\nWalking as fast as she could, she says her polite good afternoon and makes a beeline for the hill which distances her from the rest of us. She is safe this time. We turn down the hill.\n\"Meek she gone. We'll get her tomorrow,\" we plot. My voice and limbs quiet down. For the first time that day, my heartbeat falls back into its normal silent rhythm. There is always tomorrow.\n\nIt is the pain of the Inspector that has fuelled my blood; the pain of the ruler was nothing. Chu, mi use to beatings. One little ruler slap a nothing. But dat renking, facety man. A way him come from? Dis warra warra man, jus' a bother people head. Him 'now de score. After all him is suppose to be black.\n\nMy uncle say all a dem collude to humiliate, not just me, but all a we, all de people who look like me. All de poor black people dem. Meek him no pick pan de red pickney dem, a meek him t'ink say is we alone no know nothing.\n\nI walk silently down the hill with the others. Each of us is distracted by our own thoughts and anger at the morning. Food hunger is temporarily forgotten. Lorna Phillips and de Inspector dem all de same. Have plenty of money and hate we.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill, we are nourished by a wealth of warm, familiar sights and smells. The lunch women come into view. They are always there, big and strong, jutting out from the base of the towering cotton tree. Miss Ivy, as always, has on her red tie-head. In the afternoon sun, as she sits on her three-legged stool, it makes her face glow. Her food box is secured between her legs.\n\nAunt Dine always smells of cinnamon. You know her smell, because if you dare to make her laugh and expose her bare toothless black gums, in quiet moments she will give you a big smothering hug. Her missing teeth give her face a funny, quaint look. She is never scary to us because she lives in our district and we know her.\n\nMiss Mavis always sits to the right of Aunt Dine, because, she says, she is practising to be on the right hand side of her Maker. Miss Mavis has the most beautifully oiled, ivory coloured skin in the whole world, and white, white eyes which twinkle and wink at you when she talks. She is never cross for long, but will cuss you out one minute and tell you scriptures the next. Her face is electric, whirling and changing as she speaks. Her eyes search your face for understanding.\n\nAnd then there is one-foot Herby who is always late with his sky-juice and snowball. He can argue, always on about \"de dam hot sun,\" which is \"good for nothing, and only melting him ice, quick, quick, o'clock.\"\n\nThe boxes are unwrapped. Our senses are assaulted by saltfish fritters, fried dumplings, red herring, cornmeal pudding, sweet potato pudding, oranges, plums, mangoes or sugar-cane, snowball and skyjuice. Smells mingle and whirl, creating a comfortable oasis under the gigantic cotton tree. That same tree serves as a lover's nest and gambling spot at nights. If trees could talk, what stories this one would tell!\n\nWe go down the hill. The gloom of humiliation, the pain of the assault on all of us, lifts. We search for our lunch money and think of food. Like swarming bees we descend, shouting our orders to the lunch women.\n\n\"Unny stop de noise and wait. How many han' yu t'ink we have?\" Miss Mavis quietly reprimands.\n\nThe shouts subside only for a moment as we change our orders and surge again.\n\n''Two penny worth of dumpling and saltfish, please Miss Mavis.\"\n\n\"Mi only want one fritters.\"\n\n\"Mi jus' want a piece of cornmeal pudding today.\"\n\n\"But Aunt Dine dat red herring so little bit.\"\n\n\"Yu have no crackers again Miss Ivy?\"\n\n\"How come Herby teck so long fi share de ice?\"\n\nThe clutter and bustle carry on until the sweat is running down the women's faces. Wash-rags, carried on shoulders like a uniform, mop brows, as they try to keep track of orders and change.\n\n\"Lord unny pickney is somet'ing else. Unny gone like nobody no feed unny. Dem mus' a wok unny hard a school today.\"\n\nThe chatter waves and heaves. The banter and retort goes backwards and forwards until the lunch money secured in pockets and knotted in handkerchiefs has been spent for the day.\n\nBoxes are empty. We mingle, swap and taste each other's purchases, eat, talk with mouths full. As we drift away, so do Aunt Mavis, Aunt Dine and Miss Ivy. Herby is the last to pack up and vacate the cotton tree. The forces have been spent for the day.\n\nWill I one day move from the back row? Would I be let off from reciting the day's lesson, because I know it, just once? Would it ever be my turn to sit at the front, and not have to answer the Inspector\u2019s questions?\n\nThe house is buzzing. A letter and a big, big parcel have arrived from England. \"Me mother sending for we. Me and me two brothers going to England.\" I sang, \"Me a go a Englan'. Me mumma and puppa send fi we.\" Oat will show Lorna Phillips. She have no people in a Englan'. Columbus can get lost. No more standing up in the middle of the class. No more hot, sweaty classroom. No more Teacher Henderson. No more Inspector. Me a go a EngIan'.\n\nNovember sixteenth. It is dark outside. Night creatures are going to sleep. Day animals still don't know it is time to wake up. Inside, the lamp is lit, casting its honey glow on our faces still dazed with sleep.\n\n\"Unno go wash, and put on unno clothes,\" Salna orders. Sleepily, we obey.\n\nThe sun is creeping over Easington hills, reflecting the honey glow inside. Its full power is still waiting to wake up. I cannot drink any tea, cannot eat what is to be my last piece of hard-dough bread and butter. My stomach is tight. My jaws are refusing to chew on this familiar taste.\n\n\"If yu don't want de tea, lef' it an go put on yu clothes. Dem all dey pon de chair, and don't mess up de hair,\" I am ordered again. I do as I am told. No time for backchatting.\n\nNow there is much coming and going. In the dim light of morning, not yet fully awake, neighbours come to say farewell. They bring parting gifts of mangoes, and presents for relatives in England, not seen or heard from in many years.\n\nLike a stranger, I greet my new clothes, gingerly feeling, inhaling the new cloth smells. I try to work out which piece to put on first without disturbing my newly crafted hairstyle.\n\nI dress in silence, only now beginning to fully realize. Today, my every action, in this dim morning light, is to be registered in the cosmos as my last in this familiar, tiny, two-roomed house.\n\nWe pile into the van just as the morning sun claims its place in the sky. It releases its passions and bums away the last stillness of the night. The silence of parting quiets the most active tongue. The drive to the airport is long and hot. Still, the pain of parting traps us in our silent world.\n\nWho will look after Cousy's grave? Who will make sure that the weeds do not choke her roses?\n\nCousy had not moved, as she always did, when the sun peeped over the hill top. Had not roused me to do my morning chores when night kiss morning awake. I thought Cousy's coldness was just the passing of night. So I slept on, not noticing that her \"old bones\", as she often referred to herself, had not stirred, that her limbs were stiff, that she got colder as the morning got warmer.\n\nLloyd banging on the door, ordering me to get up and feed de chickens, alerted the yard. I woke to find Cousy's gentle face tight and still, a trickle of tears running from her opened eyes.\n\n\"Why are you crying Cousy?\" I asked as I crept sleepily out of bed. There was no reply. And I found myself crying too. Her stillness, her unfocused stare, signalled a change.\n\nI opened the door to find the whole yard gathered outside, waiting. They understood the signals. Death had crept under the door and taken Cousy away in her sleep.\n\n\"I want Cousy,\" I hollered, as I fell into Miss Olive's arms.\n\nDoes this mean I won't ever again share Cousy's bed and snuggle into her warm bosom? Won't smell her old mysterious smells, and watch her crinkled face?\n\nNow, this thought forces out the hot salty tears which well up inside. I am leaving her behind. The tears flow freely, soiling my newly polished face. Bringing me back to the speeding van taking me away from Heartease, from Cousy, from my goats, from Lorna Phillips. Towards ... the gigantic, shimmering aeroplanes.\n\nThe sun releases all its enormous strength. The sea retaliates. It shimmers its bluest blue, a blue that envelops the airport and the parked aeroplanes.\n\nThe following hours are filled with a numbness. The only parallels I can think of are visits to the dentist with anaesthetic injected to deaden the pain or when you freshly buck your toe on a big rock stone. My inside is dead. I am cold in the blazing sunshine.\n\nNow, everybody is crying, some pretending that they aren't. Handkerchiefs flap goodbye and wipe streaming eyes. My brothers and I are ceremoniously handed over to a pretty, chocolate-coloured woman dressed in a blue uniform. We follow her, reluctantly, into places of strangeness, places with strange lights and strange demands. People smile knowingly and gather up our belongings.\n\nThen we are sitting in the belly of the gigantic metal bird, which we have only seen before from the ground, looking upwards. This is it. We are going to England.\n\nEngland brings my mother and father back to me. It drags them forward from the fragile recesses of my young memory. I remember snippets of incidents which had told me of their existence. How long have we been separated? Well, it is hard to know. It was hard, those days long ago, to understand what was going on. I cannot count how many days I was without my father's company, nor am I positive of the many years without my mother's embrace. But memory surges suggest seven years, perhaps, without father and five without mother.\n\nI was not to know then, that although I would return many times, that first departure was the beginning of my exile from Heartease.\n\nParaffin heaters\n\nsmell\n\nalways just coming\n\ninto cold dark places\n\nafraid and\n\nexcited at the same\n\ntime\n\ncold\n\nsmell\n\nwanting to be elsewhere\n\nin fact Jamaica\n\n\"Yes, Salna,\" I replied for the tenth time, to my mother's call from the kitchen. A pokey, steamy place at the back of a cold, cold house.\n\nAll the houses I see are stuck together, with no place to play outside, no yard. Do children not play outside in this England? Is it always so cold? Does it ever get warm? Does the sun shine here?\n\n\"Now, listen to me child,\" my mother's dark, youthful face smiles down at me, brings me back to the steamy place. I sit huddled in strange clothes, close to the paraffin heater. \"You had better decide what you are going to call me. You can choose from Mother, Mummy, Mum. The same goes for your father. You've got Dad, Daddy or Father to choose from.\"\n\nThis little talk put an end to days of nervous tension about deciding what to call my England parents. Having arrived, what do you call these newly acquired people? I dreaded answering to my mother\u2019s call. What do you answer when strangers call to you, but they are not strangers really, they are your mother and father? I fell back on old responses, familiar language.\n\nNo one told me I would need a new language in dis England.\n\n\"My mother who dey a England; my mother who a send fa me in a England.\" Here I was without a language to reply to her calls. Lorna Phillips, I still hate you, but oh I wish you were here. At least I know your name.\n\nMum came with me for my interview at Devon Spencer School. She sat right next to me as I read for the Headmistress. I read but did not know the words of this new language, could not read the words of this strange book. I did my best. I read until I was told to stop, being corrected by the Headmistress. The Headmistress was impressed. I was impressed. My Mum was impressed. My impressive reading enrolled me in one five, the hottest, baddest stream in the first year, only second to one six, the remedial stream.\n\nMy strategic location in one five has a familiar feel about it. There is no Lorna Phillips. In this group we have all recently arrived, from one island or another but mostly from Jamaica and all poor, clearly black and one rung from the back row, the bottom stream. This is home away from home. I simply settle down to school life and cultivate the culture of the back row. We graduate in hair plaiting, make up and cussing. Our section of the common-room is dominated by the smell of hair pomander, face powder and Woolworth's latest perfume fragrances.\n\n\"You know say Columbus enslave de Indian dem fine in the islands. De same one dem who save him life, and help him restock him ships and tell him say him no reach India yet.\" Joycelin is feeding us information as she leafs through her latest book, discovered at the local library.\n\n\u201dYou lie!\" The challenge comes from Fay Green. \"Because is Africans dem enslave and ship to de islands, to slave on sugar plantations, fi make sugar fi white people tea in a England.\"\n\nThe hair on the back of my neck stands up. The room is suddenly very hot. This man, Columbus keeps coming back to haunt me.\n\n\"With all de tea dem drink in dis place, is we still a fi meek sugar fi dem fi sweeten it,\" says Joycelin as she continues to leaf through the book, stopping every so often to throw out morsels about the exploits of slavers, life on plantations and the fights slaves and the indigenous Indians waged for their freedom. Conversations weave and heave. We move back and forth between anger, total disbelief and downright outrage.\n\n\"Is who write dat book you reading? 'Cause is foolishness you telling me. I don't believe a word of it,\u201d Fay Green finally bursts out.\n\nEach new piece of information is challenged and questioned. We discover heroes, rebels, guerrilla fighters. They help us assert our right to be. Toussaint L'Ouverture, Sojourner Truth, Nanny, Cudjoe, Paul Bogle. The books tell us they all come from our own back yard. Thoughts of them mingle with the hair oils, face powder, and self-affirmation lessons which claim space in our section of the common-room.\n\nGroup humiliation replaces individual humiliation here in England schools. This bottom from remedial class gets the meanest, most feared teachers in the school. Their sole intention seem to be to ensure that we know and keep our place. And Columbus keeps coming up. Today's lesson is to make sure we have learnt the lesson of conquest.\n\nThings mingle and whirl in my mind. Easington heat. Easington sweat. English cold. English ice. Frozen faces, frozen information, frozen places.\n\n\"Why did Columbus sail to the Indies in 1493, Hortense?\" The frozen face cracks momentarily. \u201cAnd while you are thinking of the answer, Fay Green you can be thinking of the commodities which Hawkins traded with the Portuguese of the Gold Coast of Africa.\"\n\nIndignantly, the back row comes into its own. \"Columbus was looking for a new route to India, so that when he landed in the Caribbean he was good and lost; he thought he was in India. The people who befriended him were massacred and the rest enslaved to mine gold and cultivate sugar. When they died from diseases Europeans brought to the islands, they were replaced by Africans stolen from the Gold Coast of Africa, Miss.\"\n\nI said all of this slowly, so that I would say it well. Some of it came out just as I had read it in a book that one of the others had taken from the local library. Slowly, but quickly, because my head was hot and heavy. I can feel the others in the back row feeling proud. We watch the frozen face thaw out. We watch her eyes travel right along the two rows at the back. We watch a stream of red blood rush from the neck to the top of her head.\n\nFay Green cannot hold her voice back. \"Hawkins traded trinkets for black African people, who were enslaved and shipped to the Caribbean to slave on sugar plantations, to make sugar for English people's tea, Miss.\"\n\nAll eyes are on the teacher. The back row is tense, wanting an explosion.\n\nThe school pips signal the end of the lesson and class five, unusually dignified, stands up and leaves the room. Miss remains fixed to her chair.\n\nWhoops and slaps are heard down the corridor. The back row claims a victory. \"She won't be asking us those stupid questions again, will she?\"\n\nVoices are raised, claiming, proclaiming, learning the new language in dis here England.1Embed"},

phat I cannot pass it by/ so peep it's history and appreciate it's vibe/ it started way back about 1962/ the Skatelites came out with a sound brand new/ rebellious Rude Boys caught on to the jive/ dug the Fun Boy 3 around 1965/ some time later Jamaica couldn't keep it/ it moved on to England and Europe got to peep it/ skankin in the clubs to a fresh new sound/ mixing European punk to the style that they found/ thrown in jail about this time was Mandella/ then the Rudis in England began a rebellion/ this cycle of sound mixed with social cause/ began to gain popularity and \u0435arn much applause/\n\nThat's what goes on in the place of skaville/ it's movin to the music and the way we feel/ stand up for what's right and fight against what's wrong/ then smile for life and sing a happy song/\n\nWelcome to skaville it's all about fun/ put on your zoot suit and we'll skank 'til one/ two-tone rude boys up in the front row/ don't matter which wave we'll still go/ Royal Ruckus can skank we like to move/ when there's a ska show we get into the groove/ feel the funk hit when we kick up our heels/ elbows flyin to music that's real/\n\nSka trudged on in the night clubs/ punkers and rudis together in the the pubs/ biases were low and people got along/ all in one accord singing the same song/ ska was going strong in it's 2nd wave/ there was respect for the first and that is my fave/ I love the sound of ska it is the best/ for movin and skankin or to sit back and rest/\n\nWelcome to skaville it's all about fun/ put on your zoot suit and we'll skank 'til one/ two-tone rude boys up in the front row/ don't matter which wave we'll still go/ Royal Ruckus can skank we like to move/ when there's a ska show we get into the groove/ feel the funk hit when we kick up our heels/ elbows flyin to music that's real/\n\nNow we come to a new wave this one's the 3rd/ birthed in the US for those who haven't heard/ distortion on guitar is taking the lead/ while mainstream peeps begin to take heed/ the jazzy beat will always stay the same/ and the upbeats were maintained so they kept the ska name/ and that brings us to the present ska is climbing the charts/ the boys from Supertones are winning girls hearts/ Five Iron Frenzy keeps it real for Yahweh/ Insyderz and the Hippos get my props today/ ska gets respect from the Royal Kings/ we can be seen at ska shows skanking/\nThat's what goes on in the place of skaville/ it's movin to the music and the way we feel/ stand up for what's right and fight against what's wrong/ then smile for life and sing a happy songYou might also

Cliff White examines the output of the sex machine inch by inch.Cathy McGowan, reminiscing on BBC's 'The Story of Pop':\n\n\"When he came here he was hailed as the great James Brown \u2013 and the show was awful. I mean he just couldn't produce the sound. It was terrible. I mean it was really awful. It was a bad, bad show. A disaster. And the only reason that they devoted the whole show to Brown was because of the following that he'd got here built up because of the hysteria on the part of the mods. You know, it was like everything else. It was like everybody's-gotta- say-you-like-James-Brown-week. So, of course, the demand for James Brown records was such that everyone was writing into the programme saying James Brown. Every mod you asked would say James Brown. So you imagined that he was so big that if you could just get this James Brown... And that's really where Ready Steady Go! fell flat on their face \u2013 because it was awful. And the worst thing of all was that when he actually did his numbers the mods didn't like him. When he actually came into the studio they didn't like him. The music and the records were so fantastic, but when they actually came there to the studio to do it live... something went.\"\n\nNow then, if you're the perceptive kind of reader that the editor like to thinks you are, you'll have begun to realize that Ms. McGowan and her mohair-suited friends were just a teeny bit disappointed with James Brown. What was that again? \"...when they actually came to the studio...something went.\" What \"went\", of course, on that memorable Friday evening in March 1966, was the cosy notion that here was simply another harmless jigaboo with a trendy kind of rhythm and a humble smile.\n\nThere were a lot of them about at the time. In return for the legion of guitar-playing boys next door that were flocking across the Atlantic, we were receiving an amazing array of American talent. Rockers (black and white assorted, some famous, some not so), bluesmen (rural and urban, old and ancient), and a diverse selection of \"soul\" singers were all suddenly turning up on our shores. And it was the soul stars who were the darlings of the young and hip.\n\nIn truth, they were a mixed bunch. Some, like Solomon Burke and Ben E. King, proved to be even greater than their records had suggested, others (choose your own) would have done better to stay home and be admired from afar. But at least they were all greeted warmly at RSG where things were super and smashing so long as they loved our wonderful country and performed their hit(s) adequately. And then came James Brown.\n\nBrown didn't so much appear on RSG as dominate an hour of television that just happened to fill the program's regular spot. He strutted and stamped and screamed, he sweated and grunted and fell on his knees (and screamed), he danced across the stage like he had skates on and then charged around the studio, through the audience, and back again (screaming). In short, he was quite uncontrollable, and he kept it up for the entire show, pouring out barely intelligible lyrics while his bloody great band hit chords that fractured nerves and hammered relentless riffs without mercy.\nAll in all, he was quite magnificent. Little old ladies in faraway places were moved to bombard TV Times with outraged invective, including, as I recall (although this may possibly be my fancy), a cry of \"why are these monkeys allowed on TV instead of our own great stars like Helen Shapiro?\" Even the oh-so-hipsters retreated behind a screen of confusion from where they still hurl the occasional brickbat. Yes indeed, Brown stirred reactions that had lain dormant since the hey-day of rock 'n' roll. Two years earlier Little Richard had perpetrated an hour of similar mayhem without any fuss, because even by 1964 rock had become comfortably old-hat, and anyway somehow it was always clear that really he was a sweet boy who just got carried away with himself. As far as the Ray Charles spectacular, screened shortly after \u2013 he was so acceptable, he was respectable. Brown was altogether more menacing. In fact, judging by the hysterical backlash you'd have thought he was some kind of revolutionary, bent on smashing the status quo. In a way, you'd have been right.\n\nFor the most part Brown has always been portrayed by the mass (i.e. predominantly white) media as a cunning opportunist. Energetic, certainly, sometimes even astute, but basically a musical bore who has achieved his success by understanding and using the mechanics of the industry to his great advantage. Part of this assessment is true enough \u2013 Brown has indeed skillfully manipulated his way to fame and fortune. It's the conclusion that this necessarily indicated musical poverty that's at fault.\n\nBefore Brown, black performers could either be true to themselves and accept the limited recognition/rewards that came their way, or bend to suit the mores of white establishment controlled show-biz. To a greater extent than is generally admitted this is still true, but at least black music and musicians are now an influential slice of the industry rather than an exploited sub-culture. It would be silly to promote Brown as the sole architect of this upheaval, there are too many other socio-political factors involved, but his has been the extreme example that defines the whole change. He has achieved more than any other single back entertainer, while continuing to produce music that is so intensely personal that it irritates many sensitive black souls, let alone white audiences.\n\nI'm not, here, going to attempt to examine how he achieved the hitherto impossible. Instead I urge you to take a fresh listen to the aural evidence of his defiant independence, for Brown's music has always been the clearest expression of the complex tangle of angry frustration, determination, raw energy and pride with which he has forged his career. Now, with other black bands beginning to break through with updated spin-offs from various Brown themes \u2013 and the Average White Band creating waves with a remarkably clever pastiche of what he was doing several years ago \u2013 there seem to be grounds for a calmer assessment than the old tooth 'n' nail \"he's fantastic/no he's trash\" arguments.\n\nAfter always deliberately vetoing any Greatest Hits/Best Of albums (because he's forever insisting that \"the best is yet to come\"), in the last couple of years Brown finally compromised by allowing American Polydor to put together two unsatisfactory compilations from his extensive repertoire, under the title Soul Classics. Malcolm Jones at British Polydor seized the opportunity to squeeze an extra four tracks onto each of the original volumes, and is now extending the series with a third album already issued and at least one more on the way.\n\nCompared to, say, Atlantic's Ray Charles Story or the recent Tamla Motown Anthology series, the Brown albums are a frustrating disappointment. The tracks have been drawn at random from all points of his long and complex career and jumbled illogically together without regard to recording dates or continuity of style and atmosphere; all of his extended performances have been issued in truncated form (usually 'Part One' only); and, perhaps the greatest sin, there has been no attempt to sketch in even the simplest of background details. The only sleevenote (500 words on Volume Three) suggests that Brown is probably \"the most important artist in the history of R&B music\" but does nothing about the packaging to contradict the usual impression of a prolific but shallow hit machine.\n\nHaving said that, it must be emphasised that there is far greater evidence of his talent in the grooves. With hardly a dud track amongst the 42 so far used, for the first time it's possible to obtain a meaty selection of Brown\u2019s important recordings without forking out for 20 or 30 albums or a shelf full of singles. Assuming that we'll have to wait until his death before someone takes the trouble to collate a better sampling of the man's work, I wholeheartedly recommend Soul Classics and offer the following notes as a guide around his maze of recordings.\n\nAlthough cut-and-dried divisions are necessarily an over-simplification, there have been several distinct phases in the revolution of Brown's music reflecting parallel changes I his career. Using these as a base, I have suffixed the album tracks A to F and then summarized the six ages of Brown, craftily headed by appropriate song titles from the relevant period. Included are some generalisations which ardent discographers may wish to pick holes. Don't write and tell me \u2013 I'm just trying to make an awkward job less difficult. The additional suffix 'X' indicates bastard tracks recorded without his own band.\n\nSoul Classics \u2013 Volume I\n\n(Polydor 2391.057)\n\nSex Machine (E), My Part/ Make It Funky \u2013 Part 3 (F), Cold Sweat (D) , Superbad (E), I Got You (I Feel Good) (C), Money Won't Change You (C), Night Train (B), Make It Funky \u2013 Part I (F), Papa's Got A Brand New Bag (C).

In case you don't and were about to be confused, here's a bit of background detail: At the beginning of 1956, Brown (and The Famous Flames) were signed by King Records of Cincinnati who issued his records on their subsidary, Fedral, until November 1960 when they were transferred to the parent label. By the end of 1963 Brown had clashed so often with his producers and King's boss Syd Nathan that he ignored his contract and sent his own recordings to Smash, a division of Mercury. Although he was eventually forced to return to Kind until 1971 when he joined Polydor, he retained complete control of his own recordings. He'd stopped using the Famous Flames on record by mid-1964, but kept them as part of the stage show for a couple more years.\n\nWhat d'ya mean you're still confused?\n\nAnd now, to the music....\n\n(A) Messing With The Blues (Feb 1956 \u2013 Jan. 1959)\n\nThe sharp-eyed among you will have noticed that there are no tracks suffixed (A). Brown's first eight sessions yielded 32 tracks with vocal group the Famous Flames, using studio musicians mainly supervised by King's A&R man Gene Redd. With the exception of the very first release 'Please, Please, Please', a beautifully adapted gospel song 'Try Me', and the last side from these sessions 'Bewildered', they were a commercial disaster. Stylistically they were nothing new, borrowing from earlier gospel-based R&B groups like the Dominoes and, in particular, the Five Royales. However Brown was never much of a singer in the accepted sense of the word so the overall sound was much rawer than the predecessors. As American writer Alan Leeds once observed, it was \"rather like Little Richard leading The Drifters\". When you consider that these are the only sides by Brown that year average '50s vocal group specialist deigns to collect, you'll realise how far removed they are from his later work.\n\nSo far Soul Classics ignores these formative sessions, but as well as the three tracks mentioned there are several other interesting examples of Brown's/the group's/the company's search for identity which ought to be aired again, including a frantic rocker 'Chonnie-On-Chon', a novelty song 'That Dood It', and an intense blues 'Why Does Everything Happen To Me'. Collectors who want to hear these and more should look out for Brown's first two LP's. Please, Please, Please (King 610, reissued 909) and Try Me/The Unbeatable JB (King 635, reissued 919), released here on London HA8231 and HA 8203 respectively. Long deleted, they still occasionally turn up in discount stores and oldies lists.\n\n(B) I Got The Money (June 1959 \u2013 Oct. 1963)\n\nIn the strength of his first national hit ('Try Me'), Brown was signed by a major booking agency, assembled a permanent road band, and began recording highly original, exciting hits. With each success he increased the size of his band and stage-show; by 1962 he'd become America's foremost R&B star. The following year he was awarded million dollar sales for Live At The Apollo, gained his first pop Top 20 entry ('Prisoner Of Love'), and prepared to divorce himself from King.\n\nWith a well-rehearsed tight little band punching in and around his unorthodox phrasing, each new record took him further away from his contemporaries and closer to a realistic expression of his own emotions. Unexpected changes of tempo; sudden stops between verses, or even within verses; and a three-sided interplay between Brown, the band, and the Famous Flames, were used on both the fast numbers \u2013 the foundation of his intricate dance routines \u2013 and the pleading love songs which he extended into hysterical sermons.\nSoul Classics includes a few of the best known uptempo tracks (although they've missed the finest of the lot, 'I Got Money'), but all the great wailers are omitted, including 'You've Got The Power', 'The Bells', 'I Don't Mind', 'Baby You're Right', 'Like A Baby', and the superb 'Lost Someone'. Hopefully, future volumes will do something about this. In the meantime Polydor are going one better by reissuing Live At The Apollo. A historic recording by anybody's standards, it captures the young emergent Brown at the precise moment of fruition, when all of his energy and ideas gelled in one cataclysmic performance. Never known to be self-effacing, Brown refers to it simply as \"a masterpiece\". I'm inclined to agree. BUY IT.\n\n(C) Brand New Bag (Jan. 1964 \u2013 Jan. 1967).\n\nThe triumphant expression of independent success. From now on Brown is solely responsible for his own recordings and cuts sides all over America, wherever he happens to be at the moment of inspiration. Results are erratic, not only artistically but technically (for instance, 'Money Won't Change You', cut at the Talent-Master studios in New York, is so badly mixed it's liable to shatter your stylus. Live At The Garden, recorded six months later in New Jersey, is even worse. It should never have been issued). But the best are by far the most unique recordings ever made by a \"rhythm & blues\" singer. Aided by his bandleader Nat Jones, Brown begins to break down traditional forms of song construction. Hits like 'Out Of Sight' (cut in Chicago), 'Papa's got a Brand New Bag (Charlotte, North Carolina), and 'I Got You' (Miami) introduce new concepts in rhythmic progression which owe nothing to King Records or indeed anyone else except Brown and his alter ego, the band.\n\nThis was JB's peak period of white acceptance; the years in which he scored his biggest \"pop\" hits. Although this was partly due to the compulsive attraction of his new style for dancers, it was as much a mood of the times, for this was during the first \"R&B boom\" when all black entertainers were suddenly the in thing. Being the most flamboyant, Brown got the lion's share of attention \u2013 until it was realised just how disturbing he really was. His most widely acclaimed hit from this time, 'It's A Man's, Man's Man's World' had little to do with the overall development of his music, being an intensely performed ballad, written by someone else and recorded with a large orchestra.\n\n(D) It's A New Day (May 1967 \u2013 Nov. 1969)\n\nAlfred Ellis takes over from Jones to help Brown complete his rejection of conventional music. The hits become loose two-part improvisations over which Brown is virtually scat singing. White audiences get confused and begin to lose interest, but his impact on black music is immense and can be heard today in a wide range of derivations, from street funk bands to calmer recordings like Ben E. King's 'Supernatural Thing'. At the same time, many of his lyrics reflect his involvement in social programmes and political manoeuvring.\n\nIn many ways this was Brown's peak. His music had become so individualistic that it defied categorization; personally he radiated the charisma of a crusading politician; he was expanding his small autonomous corporation to include various other business ventures; and there was seemingly nothing on the horizon to threaten him. In fact his conflicting, and often na\u00efve, political assertions started to backfire; some of his projects (a night club and a chain of restaurants) soon collapsed, and younger black musicians (Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone) were already making waves that would rock his boat.\n\nAlthough Soul Classics includes most of the essential tracks from the period, they destroy much of the evidence of his creativity by using Part One's only. A great many extended records, including some of Brown's, are indeed totally unnecessary \u2013 often just an easy alternative to finding a flip side. However, performances like \u2018Cold Sweat\u2019, \u2018Mother Popcorn\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s A New Day\u2019 have got to be heard in toto to be fully appreciated. You wouldn\u2019t expect to find the first couple of minutes of \u2018Sad Eyed Lady\u2019 on a Best Of Dylan album would you? Well Brown shouldn\u2019t have suffered similar treatment here. I realise that time is at a premium on a multi-track compilation; nevertheless, these were arguably some of the most important and influential black records of the '60s, and it\u2019s a pity Polydor haven\u2019t shown than appropriate respect.\n\n(E) Superbad (April 1970 - May 1971)\n\nA short but vital period when Brown employed younger black musicians to recover from political ambiguity and the sudden loss of the band that had supported him through the sixties. (They left to try for a solo career as Maceo & All The King\u2019s Men). In just over a year he recorded some of his finest sides \u2013 all dynamic Afro-rhythmic hits that reaffirmed his commitment to black roots and enhanced his, by then, legendary reputation.\n\nThe driving force behind this rejuvenation were the two Collins brothers (Phelps \"Cat Fish\" \u2013 gtr, William \" Bootsy\" \u2013 bass) who were groomed by Brown as part of the New Dapps, transferred to the major league in his own JB\u2019s, and then left to form their own group the House Guests before doing a stint with Funkadelic. Although they only appeared on about half a dozen sides, their fresh approach left its mark on many of Brown\u2019s subsequent recordings.\n\n(F) Make It Funky (July 1971 \u2013 present day)\n\nWith many new bands building successful careers on the styles that Brown introduced in the '60s, he adopts his \u2018Godfather\u2019 image. But although, as a personality, he has become something of a grand old man of black music, he has so far refused to abandon young black audiences and continues to aim his records at that market. Obviously aware that he is no longer ahead of the field, his music has become erratic again in search for a new direction. At his best he is still unapproachable: often he is just an imitation of younger musicians.\n\nPart of the trouble is that Brown got bored. After a decade and a half of challenge during which, step by determined step, he achieved more or less everything he could have hoped for, he had nothing left to fight \u2013 so his music reflected dulled emotions. Finding that he could still sell records without any greater effort he started playing games, including calling a nondescript flipside 'Parts 15 & 16' and issuing two versions of the same song as consecutive singles.\n\nAlso, modern techniques in recording have done nothing for the man whose greatest performances have stemmed from \"live-in-studio\" sessions with his own band. Increasing use of pre-recorded backing tracks, multi-overdubs, and various electronic gadgets have proved a poor substitute for spontaneous creativity.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t believe that Brown is about to fade gracefully away. Now that his box-office receipts are down, record sales are becoming unpredictable, and other bands are carrying on where he left off, he has something to prove again. I\u2019d hazard a guess that in another ten years someone else will be writing a similar piece about Soul Classics that have yet to be recorded.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 418, "api_path": "/songs/409534", "artist_names": "Radio Hamburg", "full_title": "Radio Hamburg TOP 825 by\u00a0Radio\u00a0Hamburg", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/f49913f3e174f82a90c64028ec7be8f4.300x291x1.gif", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f49913f3e174f82a90c64028ec7be8f4.1000x969x1.gif", "id": 409534, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 215579, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1529433042, "path": "/Radio-hamburg-radio-hamburg-top-825-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 4, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Radio-hamburg-radio-hamburg-top-825-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2014, "month": 4, "day": 19}, "release_date_for_display": "April 19, 2014", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Apr. 19, 2014", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/f49913f3e174f82a90c64028ec7be8f4.300x291x1.gif", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f49913f3e174f82a90c64028ec7be8f4.1000x969x1.gif", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 28631}, "title": "Radio Hamburg TOP 825", "title_with_featured": "Radio Hamburg TOP 825", "updated_by_human_at": 1529432894, "url": "https://genius.com/Radio-hamburg-radio-hamburg-top-825-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/169143", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f49913f3e174f82a90c64028ec7be8f4.1000x969x1.gif", "id": 169143, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f49913f3e174f82a90c64028ec7be8f4.1000x969x1.gif", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Radio Hamburg", "slug": "Radio-hamburg", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Radio-hamburg"}, "artist": "Radio Hamburg", "lyrics": "Radio Hamburg TOP 825 Lyrics825 ALL NIGHT \u2013 PAROV STELAR\n824 BIG JET PLANE \u2013 ANGUS & JULIA STONE\n823 SWINGS BOTH WAYS \u2013 ROBBIE WILLIAMS\nFEATURING RUFUS WAINWRIGHT\n822 GELOBTES LAND \u2013 PETER MAFFAY\n821 JUST LIKE YOU \u2013 ANDREAS K\u00dcMMERT\n820 SHOUT TO THE TOP \u2013 THE STYLE COUNCIL\n819 ONE DAY (VANDAAG) \u2013 BAKERMAT\n818 LA PASSION \u2013 GIGI D'AGOSTINO\n817 WE ARE THE PEOPLE \u2013 EMPIRE OF THE SUN\n816 SONGS F\u00dcR LIAM \u2013 KRAFTKLUB\n815 LUCKY \u2013 BRITNEY SPEARS\n814 FATHER AND SON \u2013 CAT STEVENS\n813 MAD WORLD \u2013 MICHAEL ANDREWS\nFEAT.

Love Lyrics[Intro]\nYeah, it's Young Kixx\nIt's yo' boy Robby, 'bout to be\nP.O.H.P\nOhhhh, ohhhhh, you ever had that Summer love, yeah, huh\nWell let me tell you about mine, yeah, yeah\nOooooh baby, oooooh baby, oooooh baby, yeah (Ahh)\nOooooh baby, oooooh baby, oooooh baby, yeah (It goes a little something like this)\n\n[Verse 1: Kixxie Siete]\nSee I remember you was fine in 2009\nAnd now that it's 2010 well you're looking like a dime, shorty,\nHey you looking like you're meant for me\nYou remember the first chapters of our story\nGot me to chick, even though I wasn't the religious type\nYou got me feelin' like you're heavin's inn\nIt's pretty evident that I was falling for you 'cause\nI would get excited everytime you was textin' me\nLong nights talkin' on the phone\nHomies tellin' me to party but I'd rather stay home, right\nAnd you remember, I was tryna kick it\nBut you told me that your boyfriend wouldn't really big it\nSo, even though you had a man at the time\nYou was the only girl I had on my mind\nAnd I ain't trippin' 'cause I had to get my mind right\nAnd get my grind right, knew that it would be me and you\nJust when the time's right\nAnd now it's 2010, one year later\nAnd you ain't with yo' man no more, and I ain't hatin' but\nI never thought ya'll was right together\nAnd you got me writin' songs like I'm writin' letters\nLove letters that are written for you, a couple miles away\nHopin' when you get 'em and read 'em I'll help you smile today\nAw, and I don't think I'll find another love\nThat got me feelin' like this Summer love\n[Chorus]\nEveryone has their own Summer love\nSomeone special that you cannot get enough\nLowkey gives you funny feelings inside\nAlways down for you and ready to ride, yeah\nMy Summer love, oh oh oh oh ohh ohh\nMy Summer love, ohhh oh oh oh ohhh\n\n[Verse 2: Robby]\nMy sexy own girl got me pickin' her up like everynight (Everynight)\nTellin' me that she likes having dinner by the candle light (Oh you fancy)\nNice hips, big thighs, girl you just top off alot, (Okay)\nSexy skin, pretty eyes, kind of girl that I might just wife, (Mmhh)\nOoooooooh, (aha aha) got me feelin' like this all the time\nOoooooooh, (tell 'em Robby) you're the only that's on my mind\nSo baby (aah), just baby (please), keep on being my lady\n'Cause without you I'll go crazy fosho, yeah, 'cause\n\n[Chorus]\nEveryone has their own Summer love\nSomeone special that you cannot get enough\nLowkey gives you funny feelings inside\nAlways down for you and ready to ride, yeah\nMy Summer love, oh oh oh oh ohh ohh\nMy Summer love, ohhh oh oh oh ohhh\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Kixxie Siete]\n(Check) And then came Fall, went from everyday shopping at malls\nTo you and me not talking at all\nThat makes me wonder, \"What the fuck happened to us?\"\nWas the magic not cracking enough, and I don't mean to sound desperate\nBut damn baby I'ma need you back\nI don't care how many rabbits I'm pullin' out of hats\nI don't care how many times I wave this magic wand\nI can't pretend like there's nothing wrong, come on\nI used to see you like all of the time\nAnd now the only time I see you is at night when I'm closin' my eyes\nWhen I'm dreamin', hopin' it'll come true\nDamn shorty I'm just hoping that you come through\nAnd if not, well ask me if I care\n'Cause I'm doin' quite fine while you're not here (ahh)\nAnd they told me that these Summer loves don't last long\nI guarantee this ain't the last song (yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nEveryone has their own Summer love\nSomeone special that you cannot get enough\nLowkey gives you funny feelings inside\nAlways down for you and ready to ride\nMy Summer love, ohhhh\nMy Summer love, ohhhh, yeah yeah, yeah\n[Outro]\nWho baby, who baby, who baby, yeah\nWho baby, who baby, who baby, yeahEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/2506862", "artist_names": "Country Genius", "full_title": "Songs of the South:

-\nBluegrass and String Band Music\n\nBluegrass and string band music has one of the most fiercely loyal audiences in American music.  Followers don't look at it so much as entertainment as they do a way of life.  You'll frequently see the makeup of these bands are family members, and many make it their life's work.  That kind of devotion says a lot about the values they see in the music. Whether it's history and tradition they hear, or that they hear it as a true expression of Americana, the performers and their audiences are passionate. You'll find a great presentation of this in a thesis by Leslie Blake Price entitled Bluegrass Nation: A Historical and Cultural Analysis of America's Truest Music.\n\nAny discussion of country or bluegrass music must acknow-ledge the contributions of the Carter Family.  They were one of the most influential groups in country music history, and they moved the emphasis from hillbilly instrumentals to \"folk stories in song\".  The original group consisted of A.P., his wife Sara, and her sister Maybelle.  They influenced all that followed in country and folk music, from Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Doc Watson all the way up to Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris and Ketch Secor.\n\nIt's unlikely that bluegrass music would exist today without the Carter Family's contributions. A.P. collected hundreds of Appalachian folk songs and rearranged them into the classics we have today.  They recorded hundreds of songs. but \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\", \"Wildwood Flower\", and \"Keep on the Sunny Side\" will give you a good sense of what their music did to build the folk tradition in country music.\n\nThat foundation work was built-up by those who followed.  In bluegrass, there are no better examples of where we are today today than Earl Skruggs' \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\", the Foggy Mountain Boys' \"Rollin' in My Sweet Baby's Arms\" or the Osborne Brothers' \"Rocky Top\", but here is a short list of more recent (and also great) examples of bluegrass and string music:Old Crow Medicine Show's \"Sweet Amarillo\"The SteelDrivers' \"Wearin' a Hole\"The Grascals' \"Old Friend of Mine\"Dailey & Vincent's \"Take Me Back (And Leave Me There)\"Aly Bain, Jerry Douglas and Russ Barenberg's\n\"St. Anne's Reel\"Wilson Banjo Company's \"95 Years\"Yonder Mountain String Band's \"Alison\"Top Ten Music Shrines in Tennessee\nIf you're into music and history, here are some great places to visit when you're in Tennessee:In the Coastal Plains region:Graceland - Memphis\nElvis promised his parents he'd build them the finest house in town, and put an end to years of struggle. Graceland was the fulfillment of that dream.Sun Studios - Memphis\nJohhny Cash, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis recorded here - all at the same time.Stax American Soul Music Museum - Memphis\nStax made hit soul music in the 50s and 60s, and this is one of only a few museums dedicated to soul.In the Nashville Basin region:Country Music Hall of Fame - Nashville\nThe museum\u2019s core exhibition is \"Sing Me Back Home: A Journey Through Country Music\". It's a full-immersion experience.Ryman Auditorium - Nashville\nThe first Grand Ole Opry started here in 1925. It's almost like being in a cathedral.Johnny Cash Museum - Nashville\nIt's captivating, real and raw - just like Cash himself.Jack Daniel's Distillery - Lynchburg\nWhat, you ask, does Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 have to do with Tennessee music?In the Cumberland/TN Valley/Unaka Mtns region:Cumberland Caverns - McMinnville\nBluegrass concerts are presented every month in the Volcano Room of Cumberland Caverns. They've been featured on NBC and PBS.Dollywood - Pigeon Forge\nThink of it as Disneyland with a bluegrass soundtrack.Birthplace of Country Music Museum - Bristol\nTells the story of the 1927 Bristol Sessions recordings that included the Carter Family and Jimmie RodgersTennessee Artists:Here's a list of some of the most famous musicians that were born in Tennessee or made the state their home. Each artist is listed with one - three songs to give you a sampler of their music. The list is long, but not comprehensive. Think of it as a primer.

They'd abounded with treasure?\nMan, that doesn't give me pleasure\nI don't know how to measure\nHow I feel about that shit\nBut that won't make me quit\nIn my quest, to scour the deep sea\nLike, you and me?\nSearching for an angle, mangled\nThe corpse in the Bermuda Triangle\nMaybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane\nWe're like \"oh, shit, what remains\"\nAnd\nThen we get to the bottom\nAmelia Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil\nAll my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal\nAnd you know, I am not gonna take a foil\nTo my head in a little tin cap shape\nBecause you know I'm great\nI popped the grape\nBut I'm not on some conspiracies\nI'm just trying to see what's up in the seas\nI believe that I will not cease and desist\nYou cannot resist\nWhen I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist\nI am in Manila, in Hong Kong\nIn San Francisco, doing a disco\nPop it hot like it's Crisco\nBut I gotta pace myself\nIf we're gonna raise this wealth\nThat's why I flow at this tempo\nHello, I do kempo\nIn my mind, that's a form of martial arts\nBut I take, partial starts\nAnd I just gave little partial farts\nWhen I'm shitting on the mic\n'Cause you know I got this heart\nAnd you know I got the K-Mart\nState-of-the-art mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never make the wrong call\nAnd you know, chicks dig the long ball!\nI am like (Ah)\nThey are like (Wow)\nWatsky, you cannot stop me\nI got no paparazzi\nI'm a fucking doorstep\nI'm gonna take one more step\nAnd then, take another\nWord, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'\nHere I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada\nJust keep rappin', yada yada yada\nHey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld\nMe and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld\nOr maybe it's more like Larry David\nBecause you know we're not playing\nShoutout to the Jews, the chosen people\nYou know that you cannot fuckin' lose\nBut also, shoutout to the Christians\nShoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions\nYou know you cannot stop it\nAlso, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith\nWho know we're gonna make way\nFor the Jehovah's Witnesses\nThey got their hit list-esses\nWalking up to the different fuckin' doors\nSaying \"Would you like to love God a little more?\"\nBut it kinda sucks, just because of COVID\nThey can't be making no bids\nI heard they're not doing that door-knockin'\nBut, you know, we're not stoppin'\nHowever you appraise 'em\nNo, we are fuckin' raising\nOn the mic I'm fuckin' blazing\nIf the sun is blazing\nI turn into a raisin\nI'm bringing this whole craze\nFor almost two whole days\nI don't think that's possible\nI don't think that's wise\nI don't think that's probable\nThat is what they say when they look in to my eyes\nMy momma was afraid for me\nShe busted in like the ma\u00eetre d\nShe said \"Hello umm\"\nI don't think you wanna sit here\nI don't think you wanna get here\n'Cause you might die\nYou know but then I was like \"I gotta try\"\nI gotta try to do the right thing\nShoutout to Spike Lee\nI'm gonna try to get the ring\nTry to get the bling\nTry to be the king of the long raps\nLike I was the dude with the ass raps\nDoesn't matter\nAs long as the people fuckin' clap\nAs long as we give a little joy\nGive em dat'\nThen I will cut the crap\nI guess I am a believer\nAnd I don't care that I got seizures\nI got my fuckin' pills\nI'm gonna take 'em right around midnight\nSo I can get right\nI think that's what I gotta do\nShout out to the medical commun-\nItty I just get gritty\nI hope my rhymes are not shitty\nUmm, mic check are you with me?\nShout-out Bobby and Whitney\nBut not shout out to the bad things he did\nI don't know if I'm gonna have a kid\nI don't know if I'm gonna raise a child\nBut it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild\nThey would make be fuckin' smile\nThey got fuckin' bile and some guts\nEverybody does\nEverybody got guts\nEverybody got nuts\nOr half the people maybe like 48.7%\nThat's about how it went\nI think that is the percentage-ish\nOf the gender fuckin' separation\nAlthough we know in this nation\nThings are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient\nIf you don't understand\nI got my fuckin' rhymes on demand\nI can run it back\nBut I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness\nIf I'm trying to fuckin' win this\nI will not get winded, I have not rescinded\nAnything that I've fucking said\nBy the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead\nI'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds\nThat is like Right Said Fred\nYou just gotta relax\nIf you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe\nI don't get lyrical cataracts\nSo I can see clearly, so I can be dearly\nReceived, I've got to achieve\nWhatever I've got up my sleeve\nWhatever I've got in my pouch\nShoutout to pouch, ouch\nI pricked my finger, that is not true\nBut on this mic I will linger for you\nAnd for my crew\nThis is what I've got to do\nI've got to drop it hot for you\n'Cause this is why I'm hot\nThis is why I'm not\nShoutout to Mims\nShoutout to Hims\nThat's that brand of underwear\nThat I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway\nI'm

Watsky\nSee?\nSittin' in the hot seat\nNo, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat\nBut that word, beats droppin' me\nAnd meha coppin'\nShoutout to Frank Macoppin\nPlayground\nIn the fuckin' San Francisco SFC\nBecause you know how this go\nWe are the best in Dolores Park\nWe have a chorus singin' in the dark\nHark, the angel\nShoutout to Chuck Rangel\nRangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but\nIn December maybe I will be dismembered\nBy a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa\nComin' down my chimney\nWavin' fuckin' butcher knives\nThat\u2019d be fucking crazy\nWho is he\nWho is this robotic crazy Santa\nOh my \u2018lanta\nI can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s tryna get me\nInstead of giving me presents\nI can't believe that he got me on the ground\nBut I'm like \"no I'm Watsky\"\nAnd Santa said \"oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude\"\nBut I'm like \"that's rude\nSanta you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'\nPlus I was in the nude\nHe got me tackled on the ground\nMy fuckin' whole brood around me\nAnd I got my whole butt out\nHe's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away\nCut-out\nCut it out like on Full House\nJohn Stamos\nJohn Stains-Most in his pants\nBut that's okay\nWe don't judge people who like to dance away the day\nIf they need a Pepto-Bismol\nMy throat is not abysmal\nThis all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt\nI will not repent\nAnd I\u2019m not demented\nBut I meant it\nWhen I sent it\nFrom my brain\nI'm not plain\nIm not fuckin' around\nI\u2019m not cluckin' the ground\nJust right there it\u2019s

fun\nI picked the fuckin' blue marble\nAnd my pick wasn't all garbled\nIt came down the shoot\nIt was going all fuckin' cool\nAnd then it fuckin scooted past the red one\nThat kid from The Shining

absorbent\nThat's a good fuckin' fuction\nMy girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it\nPut her hands in the air\nMaxi Pads doing what they do down there\nIf you are shaved or if you've got hair\nIt doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare\nDo what you wanna\nWord to your mama\nYour dude can't tell you what you gotta do\nGotta do what you wanna\nMake your own choice\nWith your body or your voice\nIf you are moist\nI know some people don't like that word\nPalabra\nBut you know you gotta like what you like\nThere was this one time this dude named Ike\nRan to be Prez\nAnd he fuckin' won\nEisenhower, that's what I said\nI's a power-rapper\nYes I am\nSo fuckin' dapper\nThe clapper\nDoesn't work on the lights on this green screen\nMan, that would be a dream scene\nIf I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want\nWhat I want, damn\nThat would be no scam\nI don't eat no Spam\nThat's 'cause I am a soft boy\nAnd I only eat Bok-Choy\n'Cause I'm a little veggie human\nAnd that's what I be doin'\nLet me clarify\nLike clarified butter\nAgain, word to your mother\nAnd also not to digress\nBut I gotta get it off of my chest\nWord to Mark Wahlberg\nWord to ballers\nWait, okay, let me make my main point\nAs I rap over this joint\nAnd that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy\nI also eat soy\nI also as a Jewish type dude not a goy\nGet lots of joy out of eatin' carrots\nOut of eatin' broccoli\nOut of eatin' lots of trees\nOut of smokin' lots of trees\nThat is true\nThat is not\nI don't smoke a lot\nBut I do when I party\nBut during COVID, I party hardly\nAnd I guess that's kinda sad\nBut I've had some calls with my dad\nPaul Watsky\nAnd Claire Watsky\nIt's rare, stop me\nIt's not, lots of Sundays\nI call my parentals\nAnd I just steal out my fuckin' mentals\nBut I don't pull out my dentals\nI go sometimes I do in a dream\nWhen I am on the scene\nAnd the ghost come and make me scream\nIt's like you are doing the most\nAnd I gotta fuckin' boast\nShout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast\nThat is some shit if you take a gander\nThat was said by Mr. Ned Flanders\nMr. Homer Simpson\nI'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on\nThey're like \u201cWatsky, I'll do everything for you\nI'll white knight for you and your fucking crew\u201d\nI'm like \u201cDude, don't be a simp\nActually, DO be a simp\nYou could be pimp\nYou could be wimp\nYou could fucking walk with a limp\nYou can have a crimp in your dimp-le\u201d\nI just get the whole tent pole\nUp in the sky cause I meant\nLots of people can come in\nCause I got a big tent\nSo if you are a lame\nFucking get bent\nAnd by lame, what I mean in this game\nIs the type of person who says that you're lame\nIs the type of person who judges\nIs the type of person who never budges\nWhen they get stubborn\nCause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard\n[?] 00:18:04\nWord!\nI think I got this whole thing turn-ed up\nBut that is bound to happen\n34 hours when you keep on rappin'\nSome words are going to collide like trains\nComing head to head, but it remains\nTo be seen that I get back on the track\nWith the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*\nWith my fucking clapping gums\nSo don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb\nSometimes\nCause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes\nBut it happens and I think that is the lesson\nThat you cannot achieve perfection\nAnd it's not even a worthy goal\nYou just gotta try to put that ball in the hole\nMore times than not\nThis is why I'm hot, as I said\nBut, you know Man's Not Hot?\nAlthough the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am\n'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham\nOn the microphone-o oh no\nCan't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno\nIce skatin' all over the beat\nMakin' it repeat\nI do not want to beat my meat, on the camera\nThat would be a bad fuckin' PR move\nWhen I'm all up in the groove with my meat out\nThey would be like \"oh, shout out\nThat will ruin my career\nIs that fuckin' clear?\nShowin' his whole rear?\nHe got fuckin' nakey\nMake me, take me\nYou cannot bake me\nIn my EZ bake oven\nNo Sara Lee\nI just keep on flowing, so merrily\nVerily, forsooth, did he do that shit\nOh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it\nHe's just Frank Coppin it\nAnd there is no halting' it\nI just put some fuckin malt in it\nMake it like some Yoo-hoo\nYoo-hoo!\nDid you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed\n[00:20:00]\n'Cause you could not rhyme\nLike I do, do the crime and you know that I'm\nJust puttin' lime on top of this shit\nAnd that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me\n'Cause you know when I put it on top\nThat I am going to make it drop\nTo the bottom of the urinal\nYou're all in my brain\nAnd I'm hearing y'all\nBut I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments\nI be too scared to see the tools\nBut I got to just remain bold\nAnd I've got to stay in the hold\nMy whole nuts life, oh, my nuts\nRemember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?\nRemember jungle?\n[00:20:41]\n\n[00:30:00]\nThey got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate\nVerbally, vocally, stoking the fire\nOf the couress I retired\nI feel one year\n'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear\nSee how I could sing, that took many years\nBefore I try to do with the din\nAnd now I only rapped\nAnd now I only try to cap, no cap\nI just try to get that back\nThat back, uh, back\nAnd I'm gone\nOver the fence\nNo shout out to my pens\n\nYou know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda\n\n[00:40:00]\nI'm sittin' on the veranda\nJust sippin'

have much fizz\nAlthough at some point I have to drink the redbull-y\nAnd then you will have to pull me\nUp\nOn my ass from the couch\nAnd I don't know if I doubt\nMyself\nI just drop these lyrical

They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him.

Overtones.\n\n(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!\n\nJOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father! Little father!\n\nTHE BABES AND SUCKLINGS\n\nClap clap hands till Poldy comes home,\nCakes in his pocket for Leo alone.\n\n\n(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)\n\n\nBABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.)

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!\n\n\nTHE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!\n\n\n(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.)

Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood.

I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)\n\nTHE ARTANE ORPHANS\n\nYou big, you bog, you dirty dog!\nYou think the ladies love you!\n\n\nTHE PRISON GATE GIRLS\n\nIf you see kay\nTell him he may\nSee you in tea\nTell him from me.\n\n\nHORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.\n\n(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)\n\nMESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.\n\nBLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!\n\n(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)\n\nREUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.\n\n(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)\n\nTHE CITIZEN Thank heaven!\n\nBLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.\n\n(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)\n\nTHE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.\n\n(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps.

Ahhkkk!\n\nELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\n\nZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.\n\nFLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.\n\nSTEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.\n\n(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)\n\nTHE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.\n\nLYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.\n\n(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom!

Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.)

The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo!

Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.)

Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches.

Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready.

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's.

R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware!

Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier.

Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers.

Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/117723", "artist_names": "The Beatles", "full_title": "There's a Place

1995, films about life in South Central had painted a bleak portrait of the hood that was largely covered in splashes of red. Colors (1988), Boyz N the Hood (1991), and Menace II Society (1993) all centered on themes of bloodshed and tragedy, which became synonymous with life in that part of the city, especially for people across the country who watched the L.A. riots play out on televisions in their living rooms exactly three years earlier.\n\nThe films illuminated real issues in the community, but violence wasn\u2019t the only thing those in South Central wanted to be known for. So, a trio of native Angelenos in their early 20s\u2014rapper-actor Ice Cube, DJ Pooh, and director F. Gary Gray\u2014set out to share a different, more lighthearted, flavor of neighborhood life. It involved a lost job, two friends, a porch, some weed, and an eventful day. Gray, who directed the music video for Cube\u2019s \u201cIt Was a Good Day\u201d in early 1993, had the perfect spot to film it: 126th and Normandie, the block he grew up on.\n\nProblem was, Cube had never acted in a comedy, Gray hadn\u2019t directed a feature-length movie, and they only had 20 days to shoot once New Line Studios signed on. The project was happening\u2014they just weren\u2019t sure what was going to come out on the other side.\n\nOn a modest estimated budget of $3.5 million, Friday made nearly $30 million at the box office and spawned two sequels. The film\u2019s strengths fell on the performances and improvisations of its mixed cast of new and veteran comedians, such as Bernie Mac, John Witherspoon, Anna Maria Horsford, Reynaldo Rey, Angela Means, Faizon Love, A.J. Johnson, and in particular, Chris Tucker, who co-starred as the bigmouth stoner Smokey and went on to star in three Rush Hour movies with Jackie Chan (but none of the Friday sequels). The film also helped propel the careers of a young Meagan Good and Michael Clarke Duncan.\n\nTwenty years after its release, Friday\u2019s impact is apparent every time the Internet generation tweets \u201cBye, Felicia\u201d\u2014a misspelling of Angela Means\u2019 character, Felisha\u2014or someone shouts a Smokey quote in a WorldStar video. These one-liners keep its popularity high, but it\u2019s the film\u2019s story about family and community, with characters who mirror people in our own lives, that has kept Friday burning on screens throughout the hood and beyond. Friday represents a coming-of-age moment for films that use life in South Central as their backdrop, and its attention to detail\u2014the slamming of metal screen doors, the sizzle of eggs in the morning, broken-down cars with alarms\u2014made it an authentic glimpse into family life, not just in South Central, but in neighborhoods around the country, during the \u201990s.\n\nThis is the oral history of Friday, a film about $200, shot in 20 days, that is still smoking 20 years later.Chapter 1: The ScriptDJ Pooh: It was in \u201994, I believe, when we started writing the Friday script. Cube and I were sitting in the Street Knowledge basement [Cube\u2019s old record production company] working on some tracks and we started talking about a movie.\nIce Cube: In the hood, they was doing movies like Boyz N the Hood, which I did, Menace II Society, South Central, and even Colors, going back that far. Everybody was looking at our neighborhood like it was hell on Earth, like the worst place you can grow up in America. And I\u2019m like, Why? I didn\u2019t see it all that way. I mean, I knew it was crazy around where I grew up but we had fun in the hood. We used to trip off the neighborhood. I was a fan of Cheech and Chong movies, of In Living Color, Robert Townsend\u2019s Hollywood Shuffle; we watched them all the time and laughed at them. DJ Pooh is not only a superproducer but also a fool and crazy as hell. We in the studio laughing all day, smoking weed, and we were just like, \u201cYo, we need to create something to show how the hood really is, from our vantage point.\u201d That\u2019s how it started.\n\nDJ Pooh: We came up with a rough idea of a movie that would take place in a day, a regular Friday in the hood. We started building around that. Me and Cube grew up around the same neighborhood, so we knew a lot of the same people. We started thinking about people we knew, what was going on, stuff that happened in our lives growing up, and just laughing and clowning about a bunch of different scenarios. Every hood has a Deebo or a Felisha.\n\nIce Cube: The script took a couple months to get together. Friday was the third script I wrote. I wrote one before called America Eats Its Young. After that I wrote a script called Fo\u2019 Life, a hardcore script about the hood and going to jail and shit like that. [Boyz N the Hood director] John Singleton had encouraged me to start writing scripts because I wrote vivid records. He was like, \u201cIf you can write a vivid record that can make me see it in my mind, you can write a script.\u201d The first two scripts I wrote were underdeveloped. Being self-taught, sometimes it takes a couple of tries to figure out what you need to do. By the time I wrote Friday, I was coming around, getting the whole structure of a script together. We had three acts and just had to have structure. I was on tour in Europe and [Pooh] was in L.A. and we would get on the phone and talk out stuff. I would be telling Pooh what I wrote and we\u2019d throw in the stuff he thought of that we could add and we would just go back and forth until we had a final script, a whole day of craziness.\n\nDJ Pooh: Cube is one of the hardest working guys I know. He\u2019d be on the road performing one night and then be up before me the next morning on the phone.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I was involved before Cube even started the script. I met Cube through WC while shooting a music video for \u201cDress Code.\u201d We all went to Washington High School. Cube didn\u2019t live too far away from me. Back in the day, he lived off Western near Imperial. Cube and I did a few videos after that: \u201cTrue to the Game,\u201d \u201cReally Doe,\u201d and \u201cIt Was a Good Day.\u201d I told him over the course of doing his music videos that I was doing a short film I wanted to finish and I needed a little support. He donated some money to help me out. A couple months later, he said, \u201cListen, I know you\u2019re doing your short film, but I have this idea about the neighborhood. Why don\u2019t you do a feature film?\u201d At the time, Matty Rich had shot this film Straight Out of Brooklyn on credit cards. Cube was like, \u201cWe should do our own film for $75,000, shoot it black and white, and it\u2019ll just be about guys from our neighborhood.\u201d I said, \u201cGreat idea, let\u2019s go.\u201d Cube went on tour and he started sending me pages from Europe and I\u2019d send him my thoughts.\n\nIce Cube: Everything in Friday happened on my block at one point or another. We had a little kid named Chris who would knock over the trashcans with his bike and we wanted to whoop his ass. We wanted to catch him on that bike, we never could. In the movie we finally caught him. That\u2019s why we put that in there.\n\nF. Gary Gray: He\u2019d describe some of these moments along the way, and I envisioned it in my neighborhood. What you see in Friday is a reflection of how I grew up, the house I grew up in, the neighbors that I had. I just delivered what I experienced. When I got the green light for the movie I took a camera and I shot the whole movie on video. My friend Andy played the role of Smokey for me as a stand-in. I went through the entire script and shot it with him and another friend. I wanted to see what the movie felt like and try to find creative ways to make it. A lot of times when you shoot a movie, hindsight is 20/20, and after you watch it you\u2019re like, \u201cDamn, I wish I did this, I wish I did that.\u201d Shooting it on video camera lets you watch it, even if it was real crude. It\u2019s like visuals or storyboards.\n\nDJ Pooh: I got some of that stuff up on my Instagram.\n\nF. Gary Gray: Friday fell apart because Cube was gonna do a sports movie called Defense, which I think he wrote. I wouldn\u2019t say I was devastated, but I was really looking forward to doing it. I went off to go do another project called Rollin 80s and he went out to go do Defense. Then both of those movies fell apart and we came back together for Friday. I was maybe 23 when production of Friday started. Knowing Cube and how determined he is, Friday probably would have been made at some point either way. But I\u2019m glad Defense fell apart. And the same with Rollin 80s. That would have been my first major movie, and it would have sent me on a different trajectory. Who knows\u2026.Chapter 2: The StudioIce Cube: We knew nobody in Hollywood would understand the comedy in Friday. Hollywood wasn\u2019t ready for it. When we wrote it, we intended to raise the money ourselves and do the movie\u2014it was always greenlit in our eyes. It was just about writing it and raising the money, keeping the budget low. Our manager, Pat Charbonnet, helped us flesh the script out and keep costs low.\n\nPatricia Charbonnet: You\u2019ll be surprised, as the idea was coming together and scripts were being written, by how many people weren\u2019t interested and turned it down. There was little to no interest, and fortunately for us, we opened up a pre-production office and brokered some money into the initial startup to get it going. There was a determination on all parts that, no matter who said yay or nay, the project had to be done\u2014it was a good, funny vehicle. It was right off of the heels of Robert Rodriguez doing El Mariachi, which was a super-low-budget independent film that took off so well. On the strength of the talent that Ice Cube possessed, I believed that certainly something like this could happen if we dedicated ourselves to moving mountains, even if we had not made a film before. There was a naive belief that if Rodriguez could do it, then for sure we could do it, too. If Cheech and Chong could make Up in Smoke, and the movies like that preceding it, certainly we could be part of a new paradigm. The script had many, many, many incarnations before it got to the point where a deal was struck with New Line Cinema.\n\nIce Cube: We thought it was a good bet because New Line was already in the business of doing these kind of movies. They had done House Party. They understood the black movie market. I wanted Gary to direct because he was a talented director from the hood. You didn\u2019t have to teach him these little nuances that were in the movie, like Big Worm\u2019s rollers and shit. He knew all the hood flavor that needed to be in the movie.Chapter 3: The CastF. Gary Gray: It being a comedy scared the shit out of me. Ice Cube was the nigga you loved to hate. He was like the toughest man in America, and when you take someone you\u2019re used to delivering on hard-hitting social issues in hardcore gangster rap, and who has a hardcore point of view on politics, you would never think comedy. I was excited to do my first film. I wasn\u2019t sure how it would turn out and how people would receive Cube. This is the beginning and possibly the end of my career all in one moment.\n\nPatricia Charbonnet: Cube has an incredible sense of humor. It\u2019s the intelligent dry wit of one-liners that can just nuke you. At the time, if you didn\u2019t know him, you didn\u2019t know about him and his one-liners, and, apart from the intensity of his lyrics, I don\u2019t think people knew that he just had so many extraordinary abilities.\n\nRegina King: I got to know Cube in between scenes on the set of Boyz N the Hood. Regardless of how you saw him in Boyz N the Hood, outside of that serious role, he laughed and cracked and bagged and did all those things that everyone else was doing their early 20s. He definitely has a comedic side\u2014I mean, he wrote the lyrics for \u201cGangsta\u2019s Fairytale,\u201d and that song is comedic, if you will. He definitely has his timing right. It felt natural to be there with him.\nAngela Means: I had appeared on Def Comedy Jam three times, got a standing ovation at the Apollo, had just done House Party 3, did Bernie Mac\u2019s pilot, Pearl\u2019s Place to Play, and I was with SOBG, the premiere black management company in the city. I was headlining, I was a host on the black comedy circuit. I knew I could steal the Felisha part because I knew Cube wanted stand-ups. I went in, read for it, and felt really good about it. I knew all of the actors from the comedy community. A week or so after the audition I called my agents and they said, \u201cWe passed on that. It\u2019s not for you, Angela. You\u2019re the \u2018pretty girl!\u2019\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m about to be the pretty girl that\u2019s a hood rat, and then I\u2019m going to go have a baby! And I\u2019m a wrap!\u201d I was pregnant at the time.\n\nDJ Pooh: Originally I was playing Smokey. A lot of the character was based on stuff that went on in my life. I sold weed when I was young and was unsuccessful because I was also a connoisseur. I\u2019d be like, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna smoke this sack right here, but if I break this sack down I can get the money back.\u201d It was a horrible idea.\n\nIce Cube: New Line felt I had screen experience but Pooh didn\u2019t have as much, so they didn\u2019t want him to play Smokey. Pooh was like, \u201cMan, how we going to let New Line come in and tell us how to put this movie together?\u201d A million dollars is the reason why, shit! [Laughs.] They ain\u2019t fuck with us on nothing but the cast, so we had to play ball to a certain degree. We had to find another co-star.\n\nDJ Pooh: One day we were sitting around watching Def Comedy Jam and we saw Chris [Tucker] perform and me and Cube couldn\u2019t stop laughing. We thought, \u201cThis dude would be able to play the hell out of Smokey. Let\u2019s see if we can get him to come in and read for him.\u201d And that\u2019s what happened and it was over like that.\n\nKim Hardin: Smokey was the most challenging role to cast, because someone had to have the energy to bounce off the calm demeanor that Cube has. Cube was laid-back with his comedy. I probably auditioned everybody who was on the [black comedy] circuit at the time for the role of Smokey. None of them were hitting what I knew Cube and Gary Gray were looking for. I had just hired Chris Tucker to do one scene opposite Eddie Griffin in The Walking Dead, so I brought Chris in and the first time he auditioned for me, he was horrible. It was a combination of things: He had just come off the road from doing a couple of stand-up gigs, hadn\u2019t read the script, and at the time he didn\u2019t know that comedians can improv, put their own thing on whatever the dialogue is. I knew Chris could do better. When a person isn\u2019t prepared, they can\u2019t do their best job. I allowed him to prepare and come back. Any other casting director may have been like, \u201cYou were horrible. Next!\u201d\n\nFaizon Love: Chris was frustrated. He had lost some roles to D.L. Hughley and some other comedians. He was like, \u201cFuck this shit.\u201d He half-heartedly went through the audition and didn\u2019t do good the first time. He didn\u2019t give a fuck. He was like, \u201cMan! Ain\u2019t nobody going to go see an Ice Cube movie!\u201d His exact words. I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you crazy, motherfucker?!\u201d\n\nAngela Means: Chris Tucker and I were comics in Atlanta together, coming up at the same time, and I always looked at him as my little brother, like a responsibility. I heard through the grapevine that they basically wrote the [Smokey] part for him. He goes in for his audition and they tell him to come back, to go study, get a coach, whatever. He called me from a payphone and was like, \u201cAng, I need your coach. They said to go away, that I wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d I was like, \u201cNigga, that\u2019s your part! You don\u2019t need no coach, they want you! What happened?\u201d He goes, \u201cI don\u2019t know, man!\u201d I was like, \u201cJust get over here, and bring all of your material!\u201d Me, Faizon, and A.J. had our jobs\u2014it was just Chris left. We were all a clique and Chris didn\u2019t have his part, so I told Faizon that Chris needed our help. I put a big pot of spaghetti on the stove and Chris and Faizon came over. We kept saying, \u201cSay the line! What do you think when you say that line?! When you hear the line, what does the line mean?! Now say something else! Say it, nigga, just say that shit! Say another line!\u201d\n\nFaizon Love: That\u2019s when we got the whole twitching shit. I said, \u201cYou should still be twitching from all that [sherm]. \u2019Cause you so fucked up from that shit.\u201d\n\nAngela Means: By the time that spaghetti was gone, Chris was Smokey.\n\nFaizon Love: He got that shit, then he went back in and nailed it.\n\nIce Cube: I wanted Chris. He had that funny stand-up on Def Comedy Jam and New Line had just put him in House Party 3 but he was underused in that movie. New Line suggested other actors, people off of In Living Color but I was like, \u201cNah, we need a new fresh face.\u201d\n\nF. Gary Gray: If you look at Pooh play Smokey in the tapes, he was hella funny. I just felt like Chris was a perfect fit with Cube. I go for authenticity. There have been times in my career where I hired real killers and thugs, and the moment you roll the camera it\u2019s like a deer in headlights. They can\u2019t even be themselves. Chris\u2019 brilliance is that he shines when the lights are on. We saw Tommy Davidson, who was hella funny too, and there was talk about Chris Rock playing Smokey because he had kind of a bigger name, but Chris Rock is very New York. Although Chris [Tucker] is from Georgia, he had kind of an L.A. vibe, so we just rolled the dice and scored. His instincts are amazing, and as much as I could want to take credit for Friday, I wouldn\u2019t. Friday is Friday because of Chris Tucker.\n\nIce Cube: Even Pooh will tell you that Chris blew that shit out the water. Ultimately it was the best move.\nDJ Pooh: Red was such a smaller role than Smokey. Cube said to me, \u201cIt\u2019s a small role, but it\u2019s as small or as big as you make it.\u201d At first, I was like, \u201cAh, this nigga. Cut that big-and-small shit out,\u201d \u2019cause I got a small role. But it was dope, it was perfect. He was right. And every actor that we went out to get, we basically got. We were working with some veterans, some legends, and we also had the opportunity to work with some new talent because New Line didn\u2019t make us go get the biggest black actor to get the film off the ground.\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: I was doing Amen at the time. I auditioned and one of the producers, Andre Robinson, said, \u201cI was shocked when you said you would come in!\u201d I asked why and he said, \u201cBecause you\u2019re on a hit show.\u201d Well, this seemed like fun. I heard afterward that I wasn\u2019t their first choice before I auditioned. They had somebody else in mind and she couldn\u2019t make it. So, by default, I got it. I know, I know. But to be honest, I didn\u2019t know Ice Cube\u2019s songs when I went in.\n\nTiny Lister: I auditioned for the [Deebo] role after I became Zeus in the WWF. I was already bigger than life as Zeus, wrestling Hulk Hogan in the movie No Holds Barred. I used to get real death threats from the white world. They saw this big black guy from Compton and Vince McMahon promoted that I was a killer and a gangster. He needed to sell pay-per-views, so since I\u2019m from Compton, he took the negative things about Compton and used them to scare the white WWF public. Zeus was larger than life. I was the biggest black character actor in Hollywood but I had to prove it to Pat Charbonnet, who was producing the movie with Ice Cube. Me and Nia Long went in together. Pat didn\u2019t know how big I was at the time. It took Gary Gray to make sure I got the role, because he knew the influence I already had. He knew how powerful and famous I was.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I fought for [Tiny] because his audition was off. Some of the stuff the producers were concerned about was stuff I was concerned about. There were some people that were nervous about what he would deliver. I wasn\u2019t sure how Tiny\u2019s performance was gonna come off. It\u2019s those times when we didn\u2019t understand what he was saying. He would say \u201cargooing\u201d [arguing] or \u201cwhoostle\u201d [whistle], and I was like, will the audience understand what the fuck just came out of his mouth? It was funny to us but I was trying to communicate a moment or a scene in the sequence and if you didn\u2019t understand what he was saying, you could lose an entire plot point. I was nervous about that, but Tiny is from Compton, big as hell, and he understands the culture. For us, it was just about what\u2019s funny, what\u2019s authentic.\n\nFaizon Love: Back then, I hated auditioning. I would only do it if I was in character and they called me by the character\u2019s name. When I came in the door, I was Big Worm, smoking a joint and talking shit. [Casting director] Kim Hardin was there, she was a pretty lady. Her feet were fucking gorgeous, I just wanted to fuck her feet. I was talking about how gorgeous her feet were. I walked out of there and they were like, \u201cYeah, you got it.\u201d\n\nKim Hardin: There was a whole thing with Mrs. Parker, who lives across the street and waters her lawn. I watched The Price Is Right and thought Kathleen [Bradley] was a beautiful woman, so I brought her in.\n\nKathleen Bradley: I was on The Price Is Right, as one of \u201cBarker\u2019s Beauties.\u201d I was actually the first black Barker Beauty.\n\nKim Hardin: I was so glad [Cube and Gary] liked her. She was perfect. Because they were going to be like \u201cDaaaamn!\u201d when she\u2019s bending over, she had to do that in the audition. She came in for Gary and he really wanted her to accentuate, just bend down low. I was like, really?!\n\nF. Gary Gray: I know we picked the right person. I\u2019m sure to this day Kathleen can\u2019t go anywhere without someone saying, \u201cHeyyy, Ms. Parker,\u201d which I\u2019m sure is a gift and a curse.\n\nKim Hardin: Then the midget! We hired [Tony Cox] from I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka because he played one of the midgets under the big hats. I brought him in for the audition, he did good. I brought in several midgets, but he\u2019s the one that stood out, because he had more experience.\n\nA.J. Johnson: Tommy Davidson was supposed to be Ezal but didn\u2019t end up doing it. Cube called me up and said he and DJ Pooh had a part for me in this movie. He asked if I wanted to play a crackhead. I said, \u201cYeah, no problem!\u201d [Laughs.] When I first seen the script, I didn\u2019t think the movie was going to do well. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWho\u2019s going to come see a movie about two dudes sitting on a porch smoking weed?\u201d I was trying to make the best of that from the jump.\n\nKim Hardin: Meagan Good came to my office to drop off her picture and resum\u00e9. She was scared and shy and said, \u201cHi, ma\u2019am, I just wanted to drop off my picture and I hope you bring me in for an audition.\u201d She read for me and I brought her back to read for Gary. He liked to give his notes to the casting director to redirect to the actor. His note to me was: \u201cTell her to do it again, but this time say a curse word.\u201d Mind you, she\u2019s like 13 at the time, so I told Gary that it wasn\u2019t cool to make her do that. We still gave her the part. That was her first speaking role in a film. In one of my classes, Meagan later said she was thankful that I protected her from having to curse at her age for her first movie. I felt like tearing up and shit.\n\nFaizon Love: Back then, there weren\u2019t a lot of projects for black actors. We was just paying our rent, to tell you the truth. If anybody tells you they was doing this movie because they wanted to work on their fucking acting, they are fuckin\u2019 bullshitting.Chapter 4: The ShootPatricia Charbonnet: The moment Gary walked on that set\u2014even during pre-production and casting\u2014he was a consummate professional at a very young age. With the atmosphere of clowning and fooling around, Gary was a serious anchor, like an old soul who knew that, in spite of all this camaraderie, there was a film that had to be delivered at the end of the day, and his neck was on the line. We absolutely, unequivocally believed in him and his ability to pull it off, which is why we chose him as director. You have just so much energy crackling, and at age 24 Gary had an astounding ability to steer that ship to shore.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I was totally nervous, I had 20 days to shoot a movie. I\u2019m glad I was naive back then. I didn\u2019t know 20 days wasn\u2019t enough time to shoot a movie. I just did what came natural because I didn\u2019t go to film school and I didn\u2019t have experience making feature films.\n\nPatricia Charbonnet: How are we going to get it done and delivered to New Line in 20 days, not really having any money? This was an extremely low-budget film at the time. A lot of money was spent on food trucks, food stations. The thought was, just have so much food around, make it good, and when people are feeling like, \u201cWhy am I still doing this?\u201d they\u2019ll have something good to eat and they\u2019ll still want to be there.\n\nF. Gary Gray: When you don\u2019t have a lot of money to pay people, you better feed them right. We fed them right.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: With Friday, I didn\u2019t make $5,000. There was no money made on that. It was all fun and getting to know each other. We were deep in the hood, too. I don\u2019t smoke weed or anything like that, so I didn\u2019t hang around to get any weed, but they would smoke weed.\n\nShawn Barton: I didn\u2019t want to make anyone look like a caricature or a clich\u00e9. They\u2019re all based on real people. Pretty much all of the clothes came from the Slauson Swap Meet. They knew me, like, \u201cYou\u2019re getting clothes for Friday, right? Tell Cube I rap.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do that after I get these flannels.\u201d\n\nFaizon Love: I knew exactly the look I wanted for Big Worm. Back in the day, dudes used to go get perms. Prince had the same perm. Billy Dee had a perm in Star Wars. Lionel Richie had a perm. Then I wore mine, like I was going to have one of the great perms. Somebody gotta bring it back.\n\nF. Gary Gray: The Orange Crush lowrider that Big Worm drives was famous in the hood. It was like a rolling billboard for Los Angeles. Our transportation person tracked it down because we thought it was a car that a guy who sells weed and rolls with rollers in his hair would drive. Something with so much personality captured who Big Worm was immediately. You know who that guy is if he\u2019s driving that car. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a dope car, but it definitely says, \u201cI\u2019m a specific type of person. Don\u2019t fuck with me.\u201d It worked perfectly for his character.\n\nFaizon Love: I\u2019m the one who brought the lowrider around and dudes were like, \u201cAw, man, that\u2019s the kind of car you using?\u201d And the neighbors were like, \u201cLet me show you mine!\u201d The orange lowrider belonged to this guy named Blaze. He was from the neighborhood. He later sold that car to Japan. Then Blaze got murdered.\n\nShawn Barton: For Smokey\u2019s character, Chris had on a blue T-shirt, blue hat, and blue Chuck Taylors. We shot in South Central, and being born and bred a South Central girl, I was sensitive to neighborhoods. I didn\u2019t put him in that suit to make it that he was a gang member or anything like that. I chose a lot of these darker colors because when you\u2019re dealing with lighter colors, like white and tans, it\u2019s a little harder for continuity to match, like when there\u2019s a sweat stain. I chose darker colors so it wouldn\u2019t be an issue for me. I probably would have had him in all-black, but the blue came in because of lighting and night shooting and Chris\u2019 darker skin tone.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I spotted Smokey\u2019s convertible Ford Pinto when I was driving down the street. I told my transportation guy to find this broken-down car off of Western Avenue, find who owns it, and put it on a flatbed, or tow it to the block. I saw that shit and I was like, that\u2019s an instant joke. That should be Smokey\u2019s car. I loved it because it was a convertible Pinto\u2014probably the only one that existed on planet Earth. That car never drove right. All the guys pushed it during the scenes it was in. The engine sputtering? All sound effects. We had to put license plates on it; it wasn\u2019t even registered. That shit should be in a museum right now. The alarm thing wasn\u2019t in the script. I did that in post-production. Chris just waved and I put an alarm sound effect on that. I did the same thing to Red\u2019s car. I thought it would be funny if those piece of shit cars had alarms on them. The \u201cchirp chirp\u201d was an extra joke.\n\nShawn Barton: I took inspiration for the look of Felisha from around the \u201980s, when we moved from South Central. One of the reasons why my mom moved away from there was when crack started taking over. We saw some of our neighbors get into that world. In that day, they were called \u201cstrawberries,\u201d and a strawberry was a girl who would prostitute or do things for drugs. Their clothes would look like they were wearing someone else\u2019s clothes and they would look a mess. I liked styling [Angela Means as Felisha] because she was a challenge as far as making her look bad; I had to turn this gorgeous girl into someone that was not so hot. But Gary would still say she looked too pretty. I was like, how do I this? Men\u2019s clothing that was the only way.\n\nF. Gary Gray: We shot it in South Central, so there was gonna be a lot of gang activity, but there was really only one neighbor who was an asshole, the kind who would scream during some of the takes. For the most part everybody was respectful.\n\nAngela Means: We were rolling with Cube, who was hip-hop royalty. We were with hood royalty in the hood in the mid \u201990s. It was lovely. Everyone was cool except for one dude who would get drunk, even during the day, and shout, \u201cFuck y\u2019all! Fuck you, motherfucker! I\u2019m a star! This is my neighborhood! This is my house! Fuck you! All you motherfuckers don\u2019t mean shit! Don\u2019t give a fuck about no Ice-T!\u201d\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: \u201cThis ain\u2019t no real movie! If it were, you wouldn\u2019t be shooting here!\u201d He would carry on, and then I guess they gave him an extra $25 and he would go back inside and shut up. His poor wife was so embarrassed.\n\nIce Cube: It\u2019s fun for the first few days, until the neighborhood gets mad at you. They can\u2019t walk up the street \u2019cause you got the shit blocked off, Mom can\u2019t pick up the groceries, all that stuff.\n\nTiny Lister: When I played the Deebo character I\u2019d become the character, so when they say cut, I didn\u2019t ever cut. Even in South Central, the streets loved me because I\u2019m from Compton. I would ride the bicycle and chase the fans around\u2014it would be like 500 fans around the set every day. It might be up to a thousand sometimes. The audience loved us so much. They played like I was the baddest guy in the world. [Laughs.] They know I\u2019m not a gangbanger, they know I like milk and cookies. They knew we loved them and they gave us love back. It was beautiful, but at the same time you keep your eyes open. There were fans around us who were just as bad as Deebo for real!\n\nJohn Witherspoon: We had the Crips gang on the outskirts there. They were kids and they were nice and we all took pictures with them.\n\nA.J. Johnson: The Crips were all cool. We were out all night, and they were out all night with us. The whole neighborhood was out. Gary Gray told them to be quiet when we finna shoot, and they\u2019d be quiet. Wasn\u2019t nobody making no noise. They see something funny and when they say cut, they all started laughing.\n\nF. Gary Gray: We had a couple of drive-bys around the corner but not on our set. When you\u2019re shooting in South L.A. and Compton, you gotta deal with what you gotta deal with.\n\nDJ Pooh: We were shooting on the block, and we needed some kids to go to Big Worm\u2019s ice cream truck. And when I see Meagan Good walking down I asked, \u201cHey, little girl, you wanna be at the ice cream truck in the movie? Get your mom to sign the papers and come down here.\u201d Next thing you know, she\u2019s an actress.\n\nFaizon Love: Chris was like my little brother. We drove to set together. We had a little raggedy Jetta that we shared. We would smoke weed on the way.\n\nNia Long (via AV Club): I bought myself a BMW. It was so cute. I was shooting Friday at the time, and Chris Tucker and I saw each other on the freeway, on the way to the set. I was going [Waves, imitates honking.] \u201cToot, toot!\u201d in my car. He had a busted window with a pizza box over it because he couldn\u2019t afford to fix the window! We get to work and he goes, \u201cWhen I grow up, I want to be just like you.\u201d\n\nDJ Pooh: It never felt like work, we were just having a good time. Chris and I shared a trailer. We\u2019d get there in the morning, light one up, and start the day. It was like part of the movie.\n\nIce Cube: We improvised probably 65 percent. It was that kind of movie.\n\nFaizon Love: I didn\u2019t use anything that was in the script, but they liked it. Me and Chris flipped our shit. I got that line \u201cPlaying with my money is like playing with my emotions,\u201d from a Peabo Bryson song, \u201cFeel the Fire.\u201d All of us just made our characters our own. You have to.\n\nPaula Jai Parker: I\u2019d lived in Washington D.C. when I was going to college and I had seen girls that reminded me of Joi. The blonde dookie braids became popular and, Lord, those nails. I did the nails, I created those and put those on. I don\u2019t know where I got that from. I was just young and inspired.\n\nPatricia Charbonnet: Probably the person who worked the hardest was the script supervisor when it came to lines. John Witherspoon always said his lines one way, then the next day he said them another way, then the next day he said it a different way. It wasn\u2019t always the same, it was free-flowing and fluid. Actors like Chris Tucker were allowed to display their own comedic skills. That\u2019s why the freedom that existed on the set shows up so easy on the film, and it makes people feel like they could be there.\n\nF. Gary Gray: A one-page scene could stretch to two pages after all the ad-libbing. Then you end up having a four-hour movie. I would tell them, \u201cHey, I want you to improvise, but I want you to be at least conscious of time.\u201d\n\nPatricia Charbonnet: Chris Tucker was like an electrical storm, every single day. He was also a difficult person for the script supervisor. When he went into improv, he was unstoppable, so the pressure was on and stuff had to be rewritten all of the time since there was so much electricity flowing on set. When he would break out into an improvisational piece, or even John Witherspoon, Gary just managed all of those competing energies so well.\n\nAngela Means: Chris wasn\u2019t originally in the \u201cYou got knocked the fuck out!\u201d scene. That shows you how on fire Chris was. He just ran in and said, \u201cYou got knocked the fuck out!\u201d Every single take that Chris Tucker did you had to hold your laugh, even if it was just a pickup line.\n\nChris Tucker (via 1994 Interview): You know in the neighborhood when you get in a fight, get beat up, there\u2019s always somebody that comes over. They don\u2019t ask you if you need help. They be like, \u201cMan, God, you got your butt kicked. Man, he knocked you out!\u201d Like you don\u2019t know what happened. You was right there, you were the one that got knocked out, he\u2019s telling you how you got knocked out. So I was just trying to bring that to the screen, man, let people see that this is what goes down in the neighborhood everyday. The good side of South Central, not what they see on the news.\n\nDJ Pooh: They had a trampoline out there and some big heavy cushion bags that stunt guys normally fall on. So they do the [Deebo] punch and I jump back off the thing in the air and land on the bag. I was stoked, like, \u201cI can do my own stunts! I got this!\u201d Then I jumped, missed the corner of that bag, and landed on my tailbone and my elbow. We did that scene about seven, eight times.\n\nIce Cube: Bernie was always the realest. He always had the best advice. He didn\u2019t talk a lot but when he did it was always potent. He\u2019d say stuff like \u201cYou hesitating a lot,\u201d as we\u2019re sitting there trying to figure out what we\u2019re going to shoot next. Bernie was an underused talent. I was so happy when he was down to do it and then he came and got busy.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: Bernie Mac was hilarious, boy. The reverend, he was funny. And the lady across the street with the big breasts.\n\nTony Cox: Running across that street wore me out. Gary was like, \u201cMan, I want that energy! I want energy!\u201d Man, my little stump legs were wearing out. I was so glad when that scene was over with. My legs were shaking. I\u2019ve never been through anything like that. That\u2019s the most I\u2019ve ever run in my life. That\u2019s like a whole year of walking for me. I kissed the ground when it was over.\n\nFaizon Love: We were all in honeywagons, which is unheard of now. They\u2019re these little dressing rooms that they normally put actors who are just beginning in. Pooh, me, Chris, Nia, and Angela Means were all on the steps of our honeywagon sharing a joint one day and I was like, \u201cDamn, this would be a dope-ass picture.\u201d\n\nA.J. Johnson: Michael Clarke Duncan was an extra shooting dice. Nobody knew him! Everybody on that set was brand new! Wasn\u2019t nobody really big but Ice Cube.\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: Cube\u2019s mother came on the set and said he always wanted to be in the business since he was a little boy. She was so impressed with me\u2014I was one of black people\u2019s superstars then because Amen was out\u2014but I said, \u201cNo, this is all your son.\u201d She looked at him and said, \u201cDo you know who this is?\u201d and he said, \u201cYeah, ma.\u201d [Laughs.] I was like, \u201cWait a minute, your son did all of this! This is his movie!\u201d\n\nJohn Witherspoon: I had my character in my head. I looked at my uncles, my daddy, and all the rest of the people that I know, them old crazy dudes. In the script, they first had that we had eggs and bacon for breakfast. But I told them you gotta say all the chitlins, all the collard greens, all the pigs feet, all the hog balls.\n\nF. Gary Gray: When Witherspoon came in, you knew he was going to give you something brilliant. Even shooting the bathroom sequence, as crass as it was. We put a chewed Snickers bar in the toilet for effect, so when Cube walked in we showed him this fake turd. I\u2019m not much into the toilet humor but it\u2019s low-hanging fruit with Witherspoon. We just put our foot on the gas pedal.\n\nAngela Means: During the scene where Craig says \u201cBye, Felisha,\u201d Gary was going to break down the set and do a reverse shot of me. I was supposed to walk up to the porch where Chris and Cube were and face the camera when I spoke to them, like everyone else did. I was like, no. If Felisha is going to invade people\u2019s space, then she is going to invade people\u2019s space. She\u2019s oblivious to personal space and boundaries. I told Gary, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just save a whole hour and let Felisha\u2019s ass just sit down in between them?\u201d Neither Cube or Chris knew I was going to sit down, and when I did Chris wasn\u2019t even acting, he was like, \u201cDAMN!\u201d He was pissed at me. [Laughs.] It made the scene better, and broke up the monotony of everyone coming to the porch. Her sitting down was a moment that we found together. Not that it was that big a deal, but it did save like a good hour, and it created that scene, the three sitting on the porch like that.\n\nA.J. Johnson: When Ezal sees Craig and Smokey, I was only supposed to ask for two dollars, but I ad-libbed and made up so much stuff, like jumping on the car and falling in the store. Gary loved it so much he kept it in there. My brother and sister were on crack, so I was just thinking about them and the stuff they did. When you think of them, it\u2019s easier to think of some crackhead stuff.\n\nF. Gary Gray: We had to shoot that store scene fast. We were off the 126th St. campus. Anything off of that block was \u201coff campus,\u201d so we had to deal with the elements. It was an area that was a cross section for a lot of gangs. Cube was a huge star, and with being a huge star in Los Angeles from the streets, comes street politics. To drive down Normandie towards 126th St., past El Segundo and into different neighborhoods, with this camera, car, and lights, we had to have armed security follow us, because we just didn\u2019t know what was gonna happen. We didn\u2019t know what the reaction was going to be. While we had a lot of love in my neighborhood, you just don\u2019t know if that love extended outside of that neighborhood. So when we shot the store scene, we were in another part of town. We had no issues, but it was something we were aware of.\n\nA.J. Johnson: When it came to making something up, if I went somewhere, Chris came right there with me. When I called to him, \u201cYou behind there taking a shit?\u201d he was like, \u201cDon\u2019t tell nobody.\u201d I was like, \u201cMan, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d but of course then I told everybody, \u201cHey, Smokey back there taking a shit!\u201d I wasn\u2019t supposed to do none of that. My father was in the theatre business and he always taught me, when the camera\u2019s on you, make sure you go as big as you can.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I directed my part [at the store]. I\u2019d put a stand-in there, take his place, and when it was done, take a look at the performance and determine how bad it was and then take the lesser of the evils and move on.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: Gary had to deal with all these comics tryna change the lines and saying, \u201cI wanna say this,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t wanna say this.\u201d He was very professional with that. He got everybody comfortable and everybody shot their scenes. They were happy to do them because of Gary and Cube. Everybody wants to be happy with Cube, because Cube is cool.\n\nF. Gary Gray: When you have brilliant people around, you get moments like \u201cBye, Felisha\u201d and \u201cDAAAAMN!\u201d and all that stuff. You can\u2019t write that. That just comes in the moment out of the electricity of all the artists and their collaboration. I love having my guys improv because it\u2019s natural and authentic. But when you\u2019re dealing with a comedian\u2019s instinct to perform on 10 at every moment, sometimes that interferes with what you have in mind and the rhythm and the pacing in telling the story. Sometimes you\u2019d have to convince a performer to tone it down just to preserve the sequence, to not swing for the fence in this moment because it\u2019s going to negatively affect everything around it. When you\u2019re 24 years old, you\u2019re not quite sure how to articulate that. It can come off a certain way and can be misunderstood.\n\nTiny Lister: I thought F. Gary Gray was somebody special. He was the new eager director, but he had his ear to the streets. He knew what was going on in the streets, and knew what they wanted. He was from the street we shot on. He came along at the right time, it was another young black director being born.\n\nAngela Means: I remember Gary wrestling with profanity and asking me to tone it down. Then it turned into Chris\u2019 film and he ran with it. Gary wanted to scale the profanity back, because it had become every other word. He was like, \u201cGuys, we\u2019re better than this.\u201d\n\nF. Gary Gray: A lot of times they said I was serious. I was just focused on the scene we were shooting and making sure I was prepared to answer questions. I was making sure people felt like I knew what I was doing. I was a little self-conscious about that, but like anything else it\u2019s a learning experience. You don\u2019t know what you know until you do it. And I had my moments where I laughed with my team.\n\nFaizon Love: Chris was always fucking around with Gary. At that time, Gary looked like one of the members of New Edition, so we would call him \u201cRonnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mikey, and Gary too.\u201d We would sit in the back of the van just fucking with Gary and he would be like, \u201cTake me seriously! I\u2019m the director!\u201d Like, yeah, right. It was fun because Gary would fire us every day. We were like kids in little league, like Bad News Bears. We were supposed to respect this director, and he was the first one we went after.\n\nAngela Means: When Gary put the \u201cF\u201d in front of his name, we were on the shuttle bus going somewhere and Chris kept saying, \u201cEff Gary Gray! I said, eff Gary Gray!\u201d\n\nF. Gary Gray: That still happens to this day. That\u2019s one of the ways that they would fuck with me, take the initial and fill in the blank. Tucker just naturally targeted everybody. Everybody was picked on, everybody was fair game. It\u2019s what gets you through those long days. People would bag on each other and Tiny was a big target. The name \u201cTiny,\u201d as big as he is, and he can only see out of one eye and he\u2019s loud\u2026. But he\u2019s like a teddy bear. He did the bully thing on the set but it was all funny to us. We would all talk about each other and that was just our way to say, \u201cI got love for you, man.\u201d If I talk about you, I\u2019m fucking with you. If I\u2019m quiet, you probably got something to worry about.\n\nTony Cox: What made it so much fun is that you had all of these comedians. People were going after people. Chris was going after Tiny. I was getting into it with Tiny. Chris was doing the same stuff he would do in the movie, behind Tiny\u2019s head. Tiny was like, \u201cI\u2019ll hurt you!\u201d Chris would say, \u201cHow can you hurt me? If I get on that bad eye side, you can\u2019t see nothing. I\u2019ll wrap you up.\u201d We were all out there shooting night scenes, laughing at 2 and 3 in the morning and they were trying to get us to keep the noise down because people were sleeping. But that shit was funny. Everybody was cracking on everybody. That\u2019s the most fun that I\u2019ve ever had. I couldn\u2019t wait to get to work. I\u2019ve never felt like that.\n\nA.J. Johnson: Bernie Mac was the funniest. When those cameras went off Bernie stayed on. Bernie Mac had everybody laughing on that set. Singing, cracking jokes, running around playing with people. If it was time to eat, he\u2019d make up songs about it\u2019s time to eat. He was incredible. Anything he said came out funny.\n\nFaizon Love: It was pretty much a functioning set, just with us idiots working.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I wish the fight sequence was a little better. There are a couple of things I would improve. There are moments where the fight didn\u2019t feel as real as I wanted it to. I\u2019ve always wanted to do action, so that was my moment to shine, and it felt a little staged. They\u2019re lumbering around with garbage cans and bricks and I didn\u2019t get the coverage I wanted to. Then you have the challenge of Tiny coming from the wrestling world and people associating [the fakeness of] wrestling with the scene. I wanted it to turn up. It felt a little slow. I just didn't have enough time.\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: When Deebo pulled out the knife to go after my character\u2019s son, I told Gary she can\u2019t stand there and watch someone try to kill her child and not jump in. That\u2019s your instinct as a mother. Gary came back 10 minutes later and said, \u201cOK, you go for him but let John [Witherspoon] hold you back.\u201d That\u2019s when John says, \u201cLet him be a man, let him be a man,\u201d and I respond, \u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s a man or not, I\u2019m not going to stand here and watch him hurt him.\u201d I was glad that stayed in the film. It\u2019s in the little moments that you have to be so clear in the people you\u2019re portraying because you have a responsibility to the people who are watching.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: The lesson about not using weapons made it a bit more serious for my character. You put yourself in the same place as the father. You just found a gun on your son. If this neighborhood\u2019s so bad, I\u2019d never have moved here. I told him use fists. You kids are weak, sissified. So use your fists, live to fight another day. That was poignant, and helped the film.\n\nF. Gary Gray: With all my work, as it relates to the streets, there\u2019s the element of how we need to think about our practices and come together. In Friday, I wish there was more of a transition to that message. It seems the movie crashes into that moment. You\u2019re experiencing all these fun moments and then all of a sudden there\u2019s this message. It grounds the movie but the execution is inelegant.\n\nShawn Barton: Between Ice Cube and Chris Tucker, I had like a hundred pairs of black and blue Converse that I gave away at the end of shooting. I was like the Converse peddler.\n\nF. Gary Gray: All the music in the movie is music Cube and I grew up with. On Saturday, when we had to do our chores, my mom would throw on \u201970s soul and it just felt warm. When you grow up poor, all you have is your friends, your family, and music.\n\nPatricia Charbonnet: When Gary dropped the music into the film it was a fantasy soundtrack. You can drop in all the great music that you want to, but if that film is going to be released, someone has to pay for it to be in the film. Toby Emmerich of New Line was such a believer that he put up so much money to allow us to have all of the music in that film. I will never forget that because Gary delivered a film with this music in it, and there was no money whatsoever to buy any of these songs.Chapter 5: The ReleaseF. Gary Gray: When I showed the first cut to Chris and Cube, they didn\u2019t like it. The first cut was long and I learned a lot, but after I watched it, I didn't know if I\u2019d ever work again.\n\nFaizon Love: When we first saw it, Chris thought that it sucked. He was like, \u201cWhat the fuck is this bullshit?\u201d He thought we\u2019d never work again.\n\nF. Gary Gray: Then when we played it for our audience it was like, \u201cOh yeah, this movie is good.\u201d\n\nFaizon Love: They sent Chris and me to Howard University to premiere it. We go there and we watch it and we\u2019re like, \u201cAy, let\u2019s get the fuck out of here before the movie ends.\u201d As we\u2019re leaving, the lady that\u2019s running it stops us, like, \u201cWhere you guys going?\u201d We hear the crowd erupt, like \u201cAaahhhh!\u201d We were like, \u201cDamn, do they want their money back? What the fuck?\u201d They loved the movie\u2014they started clapping and wanted us to sign autographs.\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: My manager went to a screening and he told me, \u201cAnna, this is going to be a hit. They were rolling in the aisle.\u201d I asked, \u201cWas it that funny?\u201d When I saw it, all I could do was look at my hips, how big they were.\n\nIce Cube: We knew we had something. It wasn\u2019t really understood by mainstream media but it was accepted by the hood. We were in a space that people rarely get in with neighborhood comedies. It was a proud moment. Everybody thought that I was Mr. Neighborhood Terror and all I could do was talk about all the bad shit that was going on. Coming out with a movie like Friday, to me, was like the vindication of coming out with a song like \u201cIt Was a Good Day,\u201d showing that Ice Cube ain\u2019t no animal.\n\nFaizon Love: The premiere at Mann\u2019s [Chinese Theater] was crazy! All of Cube\u2019s kids were babies and I held one of them. The whole auditorium was weed. It was smoked out. It. Was. Smoked. Out.\n\nDJ Pooh: I barely remember the premiere, I just remember that somebody with me got the L.A. Times and said, \u201cMan, they dissed your movie.\u201d The review was like, \u201cIf you\u2019re into watching a predominantly black film with everybody sitting around on the porch smoking weed, then this film is for you.\u201d He talked bad about it. I was mad as hell. But people were like, \u201cOh shit, sitting in the house and niggas smoking weed? That\u2019s my shit!\u201d I think niggas flocked out, they helped out.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I didn't read reviews, but I heard. We didn\u2019t go into this movie thinking we might get an Oscar nomination. It\u2019s not Oscar bait. It feels good, it\u2019s a guilty pleasure. You can let your hair down. I read an interview with Michael Jordan and the interviewer asked what his favorite movie was. He said Friday, and the interviewer hadn\u2019t heard of it. Jordan said, \u201cAnd you call yourself a film critic?\u201d\n\nIce Cube: It didn\u2019t make a lot of box office noise. It made $20\u201324 million in the box office.\n\nF. Gary Gray: In terms of return on investment, it was one of the most profitable films of 1995. The industry was surprised. It\u2019s this little movie that came out of nowhere and it was No. 2 at the box office. It was only in a small amount of theaters but the per-screen average was really high.\n\nFaizon Love: The movie was a huge bootleg on the street before it came out. We didn\u2019t know the extent of it. After we got our checks, we knew. It was a means to pay your rent. We didn\u2019t know bootlegging was a downfall for film and television or we would\u2019ve kicked them people\u2019s asses, like \u201cMotherfucka!\u201d But we were living the dream. Best pussy ever. We were great. This is the kind of guy Chris is: While we were filming, there was this hot truck out called a Land Cruiser\u2014it was like the Rolls-Royce back then. Chris and I didn\u2019t have no money, so we were going from dealership to dealership test driving it. [Laughs.] When Chris got his first check\u2014I don\u2019t know what it was\u2014he came to my apartment and he had the truck. He drops me the keys and he\u2019s like, \u201cYou drive.\u201d Because we used to share a car and that\u2019s how our relationship was.\n\nAngela Means: We knew it was Chris Tucker\u2019s breakout.\n\nKim Hardin: I had no idea that it was going to do as well as it did\u2014and cross over. It crossed over as far as people of all races could relate to the subject matter and think it was funny.\n\nAngela Means: I\u2019m a country girl, I\u2019m from a 175-acre farm, dirt road, and I have no star thing about me. When Friday first came out, people would come up to me. I ran into Malcolm-Jamal Warner and the first thing out of his mouth was: \u201cGary freaked it! Gary freaked it!\u201d and I was like, \u201cDidn\u2019t he?! Gary freaked that motherfucker!\u201d I was in a grocery store right after, with my little baby, and a group of girls bombarded me. They were loud, and there were a lot of them jumping up and down, and they were saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the crackhead! It\u2019s the crackhead!\u201d I was like, \u201cDon\u2019t call me a crackhead in front of my baby!\u201d I got put out of a mall in Ontario because they said I was creating a commotion. I told them I was just shopping but they said I had to go. I obeyed. I\u2019m not a gangster, I\u2019m a country girl; I learned how to drive on a tractor. [Laughs.]Chapter 6: The LegacyIce Cube: It made its noise on DVD. That\u2019s when it really started getting heavy.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: People pulled [VHS and DVD copies] off the shelves and wouldn\u2019t return them when they rented them.\n\nIce Cube: When the mainstream did eventually understand Friday, people started to try to emulate it in a lot of ways. When I saw There\u2019s Something About Mary, I was like, \u201cDamn, that\u2019s a lot like the middle of Friday right there.\u201d It had the same flavor. I started seeing people pluck a little bit from it\u2014you know you doing the right thing when you see that.\n\nFaizon Love: There were a plethora of roles afterward. The \u201990s was a movie every week. It was abuzz. Television shows, all kinds of shit. It was a different time. In the \u201990s, the music was growing too. Tupac was always around and Dr. Dre\u2014that\u2019s who we hung out with. I was shooting a television show and Chris called me like, \u201cC\u2019mon, man, we going to shoot a Tupac video\u201d and I\u2019m like \u201cI can\u2019t leave, I\u2019m doing a fucking TV show!\u201d But we got to shoot with Dre when we shot the Friday video for \u201cKeep Their Heads Ringin'.\u201d We shot that in an airplane hangar. That was a party! Dre landed in a helicopter. We was like, \u201cOh shit!\u201d\n\nA.J. Johnson: It opened a lot of doors for me. Robert Townsend said he seen me in Friday and he loved it, so that\u2019s why he hired me for BAPS. Master P hired me for I Got the Hook Up off of Friday, and then Cube gave me The Players Club from _Friday*.\n\nPaula Jai Parker: I\u2019ve been in over 100 television shows and movies over the last 20 years but no one shows me love as much as the people who love me from my very first film, Friday.\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: Twenty years ago, they weren\u2019t doing a lot of these movies, so being able to document the black middle class was really a delight. In most of the movies that were being done, they didn\u2019t have families. That\u2019s one of the reasons why this one was so welcoming, not just in the black community, but in every community\u2014you saw the characters as whole people. Even in Eddie Murphy movies we didn\u2019t see a family until The Nutty Professor.\n\nShawn Barton: I would never say Friday is an \u201cimportant\u201d film. What it\u2019s done is join everyone across the board. I like that it has reached so many demographics. It\u2019s joined us all in ways that I don\u2019t think we thought about while shooting. We were thinking a pocket of people will think this is funny, or a pocket who get high will relate to it.\n\nTiny Lister: I heard of people naming their animals and their kids Deebo. There\u2019s so many white people that name their animals and their kids that, and they live in different parts of the world\u2014you\u2019d think they wouldn't touch that.\n\nFaizon Love: I didn\u2019t know how big it was until \u201999. I was doing a movie in South Africa and this guy who looked like a bushman called me \u201cBig Worm.\u201d I was like, \u201cNO FUCKING WAY! This guy doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s seen an electric appliance all of his life!\u201d\n\nA.J. Johnson: Kids who weren\u2019t even born when we shot the movie come up to me and say, \u201cHey, Ezal! My neck! My back! My neck and my back!\u201d\n\nAnna Maria Horsford: Every TSA agent that I run into always asks, \u201cWhen are you going to do another Friday? We saw a poster online.\u201d They also say, \u201cThat\u2019s Cube\u2019s mother!\u201d Yes, I am. I am Ice Cube\u2019s mother. [Laughs.] It\u2019s interesting what you\u2019re known as. I\u2019ve done more than 100 movies and that\u2019s the one that everybody knows. Since Friday, I\u2019ve gotten to play most rappers\u2019 mother. I think that\u2019s God\u2019s joke on me, making me famous for being every rapper\u2019s mother. I say that because I don\u2019t know the rap music. Not that I dislike it, I just can\u2019t talk as fast as they can and I don\u2019t understand the things they\u2019re saying.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: I\u2019m Mr. Jones no matter where I\u2019m at. I said things in that movie I\u2019ll probably die with. \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody go in the bathroom for 35\u201345 minutes.\u201d People say that when I\u2019m in the airport, and I\u2019m in the airport all the time. When I do my show, that\u2019s the first thing I say when I come out. I do that line and they all repeat it with me. It\u2019s been that way for 20 years.\n\nAngela Means: I found out that #ByeFelicia was trending when my friend called to say congratulations on my son\u2019s first college offer. When we got off of the phone he said, \u201cBye, Felisha.\u201d I was like, \u201cHow ancient are you with that \u2018Bye, Felisha\u2019 shit?\u201d and he said, \u201cDude, #ByeFelicia is trending!\u201d I was like, \u201cTrending? What\u2019s \u2018trending\u2019?\u201d He told me to punch in \u201c#ByeFelicia\u201d and see what happens. My jaw dropped. I love the way Keith Olbermann says it.\n\nTiny Lister: This is what I see with my own eyes\u2014well, I\u2019m blind in one eye, so this is what I see with my working eye: I did a couple of comedy things for Chris Tucker, came on stage as Deebo on a bicycle. At the end of his comedy session, in front of 3,500 to 5,000 people, they were chanting, \u201cFriday! Friday! Friday!\u201d When I go with Ice Cube and watch him perform, at the end of his rap session, they talking about Friday. They not talking about when Chris did the thing with Jackie Chan. They not talking about Ice Cube when he did Three Kings. Michael Jordan wanted to do the second Friday\u2014it was his kids\u2019 favorite movie. When Chris pulled out, I guess he backed out. Deion Sanders wanted to be in Next Friday. Patti LaBelle wanted to play Chris Tucker\u2019s mother.\n\nJohn Witherspoon: It\u2019s annoying that Chris Tucker doesn\u2019t want to be associated with this character again. It\u2019s ridiculous \u2019cause [Smokey] made him. He wasn\u2019t doing that much before that. If he doesn\u2019t want to do it because of the marijuana, marijuana is being legalized all over the country. He\u2019s got some contradiction there, because marijuana\u2019s not a big deal anymore.\n\nFaizon Love: Chris is a fucking idiot. He does do sequels\u2014he did 900 Rush Hour movies. I even talked him into doing the first one. People have their own ways. I still love him as a brother but I just can\u2019t talk to him like you can\u2019t talk to an idiot.\n\nIce Cube: I don\u2019t understand to this day why [Chris] would want to run from something that made him a movie star. But you got to respect somebody wanting a life change. When you bring God into the equation, you can\u2019t say nothing against that.\n\nChris Tucker (via Sway in the Morning): Friday is a great movie, and I definitely don't regret doing that, and I love that people still love that movie. What I said years ago is to better myself\u2014I\u2019m a perfectionist. I always wanted not to be like every other comedian, and, at the time, just cuss, just to cuss for no reason. I said I want to better myself, and if I do cuss, it\u2019s for a reason and it doesn't take the place of the material or what I'm talking about.\n\nDJ Pooh: I was disappointed that Chris distanced himself but I respect his decision. That\u2019s that man\u2019s life. That\u2019s who that man is, so I respect that. But at the same time, his fans would love to see him back as Smokey in Last Friday. And I think there\u2019s a way to do it where it could still be funny, \u2019cause Chris is still funny.\n\nIce Cube: Smokey would be running a little rehab scam these days.\n\nChris Tucker (via Sway In the Morning): I\u2019m actually trying to help [the studio] come up with some ideas and be a part of the producing process with Cube to see if we can come up with something, so that might happen. If I do a movie like Friday again it has to evolve. I evolved from Smokey when I was that age when I did that movie.\n\nTiny Lister: It would cost a lot to bring everybody back. Ice Cube\u2019s numbers have changed, Chris\u2019 number have changed. F. Gary Gray\u2019s numbers have changed. All of ours have.\n\nFaizon Love: We\u2019re too old to do another Friday sequel. Ice Cube and I were at the airport six months ago and I asked, \u201cHow much do you get asked when we doing another Friday?\u201d and he\u2019s like \u201cMan, every fucking day.\u201d And he\u2019s putting out some good stuff! I can\u2019t see it working right now. Everybody is old and fat. Chris Tucker is my size! [Laughs.]\n\nIce Cube: It did everything we wanted it to do. We grew up on Car Wash, Let\u2019s Do It Again, Uptown Saturday Night, and Cheech and Chong. We wanted to make a hood classic that people could grow up on and be one of their favorite movies of all time. The movie is alive and kicking and people are still enjoying it like they did 20 years ago. Hearing Zach Randolph from the Memphis Grizzlies being called Zeebo and Stuart Scott quote Friday lines, it was like us saying Scarface lines.\n\nF. Gary Gray: I wasn\u2019t surprised that people liked it, I wasn\u2019t even surprised about the success of it. I am surprised about the legs that it still to this day and the cultural impact that it had on popular culture, the fact that it spawned a franchise. People say \u201cBye, Felisha\u201d and some people don\u2019t even know where it comes from. For that to ring loudly 20 years later? That was a small moment and it wasn\u2019t even a structured joke! Quotables coming from a process where a bunch of kids got together and made a movie, essentially about the block Cube, Pooh, and I grew up on, that surprises me. When you read the script, you couldn\u2019t say this was a guaranteed hit. We were lucky to have Mike De Luca over at New Line roll the dice, and to have Cube put his career on the line. All the moons and the stars aligned for us on this project.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/7277063", "artist_names": "Z.Z.

A Monodrama LyricsPART I\nI\nI.\nI hate the dreadful hollow behind the little wood,\nIts lips in the field above are dabbled with blood-red heath,\nThe red-ribb\u2019d ledges drip with a silent horror of blood,\nAnd Echo there, whatever is ask\u2019d her, answers \u2018Death.\u2019\n\nII.\nFor there in the ghastly pit long since a body was found,\nHis who had given me life\u2013O father! O God! was it well?\u2013\nMangled, and flatten\u2019d, and crush\u2019d, and dinted into the ground:\nThere yet lies the rock that fell with him when he fell.\nIII.\nDid he fling himself down? who knows? for a vast speculation had fail\u2019d,\nAnd ever he mutter\u2019d and madden\u2019d, and ever wann\u2019d with despair,\nAnd out he walk\u2019d when the wind like a broken worlding wail\u2019d,\nAnd the flying gold of the ruin\u2019d woodlands drove thro\u2019 the air.\n\nIV.\nI remember the time, for the roots of my hair were stirr\u2019d\nBy a shuffled step, by a dead weight trail\u2019d, by a whisper\u2019d fright,\nAnd my pulses closed their gates with a shock on my heart as I heard\nThe shrill-edged shriek of a mother divide the shuddering night.\n\nV.\nVillainy somewhere! whose? One says, we are villains all.\nNot he: his honest fame should at least by me be maintained:\nBut that old man, now lord of the broad estate and the Hall,\nDropt off gorged from a scheme that had left us flaccid and drain\u2019d.\n\nVI.\nWhy do they prate of the blessings of Peace? we have made them a curse,\nPickpockets, each hand lusting for all that is not its own;\nAnd lust of gain, in the spirit of Cain, is it better or worse\nThan the heart of the citizen hissing in war on his own hearth-stone?\n\nVII.\nBut these are the days of advance, the works of the men of mind,\nWhen who but a fool would have faith in a tradesman\u2019s ware or his word?\nIs it peace or war? Civil war, as I think, and that of a kind\nThe viler, as underhand, not openly bearing the sword.\nVIII.\nSooner or later I too may passively take the print\nOf the golden age\u2013why not? I have neither hope nor trust;\nMay make my heart as a millstone, set my face as a flint,\nCheat and be cheated, and die: who knows? we are ashes and dust.\n\nIX.\nPeace sitting under her olive, and slurring the days gone by,\nWhen the poor are hovell\u2019d and hustled together, each sex, like swine,\nWhen only the ledger lives, and when only not all men lie;\nPeace in her vineyard\u2013yes!\u2013but a company forges the wine.\n\nX.\nAnd the vitriol madness flushes up in the ruffian\u2019s head,\nTill the filthy by-lane rings to the yell of the trampled wife,\nAnd chalk and alum and plaster are sold to the poor for bread,\nAnd the spirit of murder works in the very means of life,\n\nXI.\nAnd Sleep must lie down arm\u2019d, for the villainous centre-bits\nGrind on the wakeful ear in the hush of the moonless nights,\nWhile another is cheating the sick of a few last gasps, as he sits\nTo pestle a poison\u2019d poison behind his crimson lights.\n\nXII.\nWhen a Mammonite mother kills her babe for a burial fee,\nAnd Timour-Mammon grins on a pile of children\u2019s bones,\nIs it peace or war? better, war! loud war by land and by sea,\nWar with a thousand battles, and shaking a hundred thrones.\nXIII.\nFor I trust if an enemy\u2019s fleet came yonder round by the hill,\nAnd the rushing battle-bolt sang from the three-decker out of the foam,\nThat the smooth-faced snubnosed rogue would leap from his counter and till,\nAnd strike, if he could, were it but with his cheating yardwand, home.\u2013\n\nXIV.\nWhat! am I raging alone as my father raged in his mood?\nMust I too creep to the hollow and dash myself down and die\nRather than hold by the law that I made, nevermore to brood\nOn a horror of shatter\u2019d limbs and a wretched swindler\u2019s lie?\n\nXV.\nWould there be sorrow for me? there was love in the passionate shriek,\nLove for the silent thing that had made false haste to the grave\u2013\nWrapt in a cloak, as I saw him, and thought he would rise and speak\nAnd rave at the lie and the liar, ah God, as he used to rave.\n\nXVI.\nI am sick of the Hall and the hill, I am sick of the moor and the main.\nWhy should I stay? can a sweeter chance ever come to me here?\nO, having the nerves of motion as well as the nerves of pain,\nWere it not wise if I fled from the place and the pit and the fear?\n\nXVII.\nWorkmen up at the Hall!\u2013they are coming back from abroad;\nThe dark old place will be gilt by the touch of a millionaire:\nI have heard, I know not whence, of the singular beauty of Maud;\nI play\u2019d with the girl when a child; she promised then to be fair.\n\nXVIII.\nMaud with her venturous climbings and tumbles and childish escapes,\nMaud the delight of the village, the ringing joy of the Hall,\nMaud with her sweet purse-mouth when my father dangled the grapes,\nMaud the beloved of my mother, the moon-faced darling of all,\u2013\n\nXIX.\nWhat is she now? My dreams are bad. She may bring me a curse.\nNo, there is fatter game on the moor; she will let me alone.\nThanks, for the fiend best knows whether woman or man be the worse.\nI will bury myself in myself, and the Devil may pipe to his own.\n\nII\nLong have I sigh\u2019d for a calm: God grant I may find it at last!\nIt will never be broken by Maud, she has neither savour nor salt,\nBut a cold and clear-cut face, as I found when her carriage past,\nPerfectly beautiful: let it be granted her: where is the fault?\nAll that I saw (for her eyes were downcast, not to be seen)\nFaultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null,\nDead perfection, no more; nothing more, if it had not been\nFor a chance of travel, a paleness, an hour\u2019s defect of the rose,\nOr an underlip, you may call it a little too ripe, too full,\nOr the least little delicate aquiline curve in a sensitive nose,\nFrom which I escaped heart-free, with the least little touch of spleen.\n\nIII\nCold and clear-cut face, why come you so cruelly meek,\nBreaking a slumber in which all spleenful folly was drown\u2019d,\nPale with the golden beam of an eyelash dead on the cheek,\nPassionless, pale, cold face, star-sweet on a gloom profound;\nWomanlike, taking revenge too deep for a transient wrong\nDone but in thought to your beauty, and ever as pale as before\nGrowing and fading and growing upon me without a sound,\nLuminous, gemlike, ghostlike, deathlike, half the night long\nGrowing and fading and growing, till I could bear it no more,\nBut arose, and all by myself in my own dark garden ground,\nListening now to the tide in its broad-flung shipwrecking roar,\nNow to the scream of a madden\u2019d beach dragg\u2019d down by the wave,\nWalk\u2019d in a wintry wind by a ghastly glimmer, and found\nThe shining daffodil dead, and Orion low in his grave.\n\nIV\nI.\nA million emeralds break from the ruby-budded lime\nIn the little grove where I sit\u2013ah, wherefore cannot I be\nLike things of the season gay, like the bountiful season bland,\nWhen the far-off sail is blown by the breeze of a softer clime,\nHalf-lost in the liquid azure bloom of a crescent of sea,\nThe silent sapphire-spangled marriage ring of the land?\n\nII.\nBelow me, there, is the village, and looks how quiet and small!\nAnd yet bubbles o\u2019er like a city, with gossip, scandal, and spite;\nAnd Jack on his ale-house bench has as many lies as a Czar;\nAnd here on the landward side, by a red rock, glimmers the Hall\nAnd up in the high Hall-garden I see her pass like a light;\nBut sorrow seize me if ever that light be my leading star!\n\nIII.\nWhen have I bow\u2019d to her father, the wrinkled head of the race?\nI met her to-day with her brother, but not to her brother I bow\u2019d:\nI bow\u2019d to his lady-sister as she rode by on the moor;\nBut the fire of a foolish pride flash\u2019d over her beautiful face.\nO child, you wrong your beauty, believe it, in being so proud;\nYour father has wealth well-gotten, and I am nameless and poor.\n\nIV.\nI keep but a man and a maid, ever ready to slander and steal;\nI know it, and smile a hard-set smile, like a stoic, or like\nA wiser epicurean, and let the world have its way:\nFor nature is one with rapine, a harm no preacher can heal;\nThe Mayfly is torn by the swallow, the sparrow spear\u2019d by the shrike,\nAnd the whole little wood where I sit is a world of plunder and prey.\n\nV.\nWe are puppets, Man in his pride, and Beauty fair in her flower;\nDo we move ourselves, or are moved by an unseen hand at a game\nThat pushes us off from the board, and others ever succeed?\nAh yet, we cannot be kind to each other here for an hour;\nWe whisper, and hint, and chuckle, and grin at a brother\u2019s shame;\nHowever we brave it out, we men are a little breed.\n\nVI.\nA monstrous eft was of old the Lord and Master of Earth,\nFor him did his high sun flame, and his river billowing ran,\nAnd he felt himself in his force to be Nature\u2019s crowning race.\nAs nine months go to the shaping an infant ripe for his birth,\nSo many a million of ages have gone to the making of man:\nHe now is first, but is he the last? is he not too base?\n\nVII.\nThe man of science himself is fonder of glory, and vain,\nAn eye well-practised in nature, a spirit bounded and poor;\nThe passionate heart of the poet is whirl\u2019d into folly and vice.\nI would not marvel at either, but keep a temperate brain;\nFor not to desire or admire, if a man could learn it, were more\nThan to walk all day like the sultan of old in a garden of spice.\n\nVIII.\nFor the drift of the Maker is dark, an Isis hid by the veil.\nWho knows the ways of the world, how God will bring them about?\nOur planet is one, the suns are many, the world is wide.\nShall I weep if a Poland fall? shall I shriek if a Hungary fail?\nOr an infant civilisation be ruled with rod or with knout?\nI have not made the world, and He that made it will guide.\n\nIX.\nBe mine a philosopher\u2019s life in the quiet woodland ways,\nWhere if I cannot be gay let a passionless peace be my lot,\nFar-off from the clamour of liars belied in the hubbub of lies;\nFrom the long-neck\u2019d geese of the world that are ever hissing dispraise\nBecause their natures are little, and, whether he heed it or not,\nWhere each man walks with his head in a cloud of poisonous flies.\n\nX.\nAnd most of all would I flee from the cruel madness of love,\nThe honey of poison-flowers and all the measureless ill.\nAh Maud, you milkwhite fawn, you are all unmeet for a wife.\nYour mother is mute in her grave as her image in marble above;\nYour father is ever in London, you wander about at your will;\nYou have but fed on the roses and lain in the lilies of life.\n\nV\nI.\nA voice by the cedar tree\nIn the meadow under the Hall!\nShe is singing an air that is known to me,\nA passionate ballad gallant and gay,\nA martial song like a trumpet\u2019s call!\nSinging alone in the morning of life,\nIn the happy morning of life and of May,\nSinging of men that in battle array,\nReady in heart and ready in hand,\nMarch with banner and bugle and fife\nTo the death, for their native land.\n\nII.\nMaud with her exquisite face,\nAnd wild voice pealing up to the sunny sky,\nAnd feet like sunny gems on an English green,\nMaud in the light of her youth and her grace,\nSinging of Death, and of Honour that cannot die,\nTill I well could weep for a time so sordid and mean,\nAnd myself so languid and base.\n\nIII.\nSilence, beautiful voice!\nBe still, for you only trouble the mind\nWith a joy in which I cannot rejoice,\nA glory I shall not find.\nStill! I will hear you no more,\nFor your sweetness hardly leaves me a choice\nBut to move to the meadow and fall before\nHer feet on the meadow grass, and adore,\nNot her, who is neither courtly nor kind,\nNot her, not her, but a voice.\n\nVI\nI.\nMorning arises stormy and pale,\nNo sun, but a wannish glare\nIn fold upon fold of hueless cloud,\nAnd the budded peaks of the wood are bow\u2019d\nCaught and cuff\u2019d by the gale:\nI had fancied it would be fair.\n\nII.\nWhom but Maud should I meet\nLast night, when the sunset burn\u2019d\nOn the blossom\u2019d gable-ends\nAt the head of the village street,\nWhom but Maud should I meet?\nAnd she touch\u2019d my hand with a smile so sweet,\nShe made me divine amends\nFor a courtesy not return\u2019d.\n\nIII.\nAnd thus a delicate spark\nOf glowing and growing light\nThro\u2019 the livelong hours of the dark\nKept itself warm in the heart of my dreams,\nReady to burst in a colour\u2019d flame;\nTill at last when the morning came\nIn a cloud, it faded, and seems\nBut an ashen-gray delight.\n\nIV.\nWhat if with her sunny hair,\nAnd smile as sunny as cold,\nShe meant to weave me a snare\nOf some coquettish deceit,\nCleopatra-like as of old\nTo entangle me when we met,\nTo have her lion roll in a silken net\nAnd fawn at a victor\u2019s feet.\n\nV.\nAh, what shall I be at fifty\nShould Nature keep me alive,\nIf I find the world so bitter\nWhen I am but twenty-five?\nYet, if she were not a cheat,\nIf Maud were all that she seem\u2019d,\nAnd her smile were all that I dream\u2019d,\nThen the world were not so bitter\nBut a smile could make it sweet.\n\nVI.\nWhat if tho\u2019 her eye seem\u2019d full\nOf a kind intent to me,\nWhat if that dandy-despot, he,\nThat jewell\u2019d mass of millinery,\nThat oil\u2019d and curl\u2019d Assyrian Bull\nSmelling of musk and of insolence,\nHer brother, from whom I keep aloof,\nWho wants the finer politic sense\nTo mask, tho\u2019 but in his own behoof,\nWith a glassy smile his brutal scorn\u2013\nWhat if he had told her yestermorn\nHow prettily for his own sweet sake\nA face of tenderness might be feign\u2019d,\nAnd a moist mirage in desert eyes,\nThat so, when the rotten hustings shake\nIn another month to his brazen lies,\nA wretched vote may be gain\u2019d.\n\nVII.\nFor a raven ever croaks, at my side,\nKeep watch and ward, keep watch and ward,\nOr thou wilt prove their tool.\nYea, too, myself from myself I guard,\nFor often a man\u2019s own angry pride\nIs cap and bells for a fool.\n\nVIII.\nPerhaps the smile and tender tone\nCame out of her pitying womanhood,\nFor am I not, am I not, here alone\nSo many a summer since she died,\nMy mother, who was so gentle and good?\nLiving alone in an empty house,\nHere half-hid in the gleaming wood,\nWhere I hear the dead at midday moan,\nAnd the shrieking rush of the wainscot mouse,\nAnd my own sad name in corners cried,\nWhen the shiver of dancing leaves is thrown\nAbout its echoing chambers wide,\nTill a morbid hate and horror have grown\nOf a world in which I have hardly mixt,\nAnd a morbid eating lichen fixt\nOn a heart half-turn\u2019d to stone.\n\nIX.\nO heart of stone, are you flesh, and caught\nBy that you swore to withstand?\nFor what was it else within me wrought\nBut, I fear, the new strong wine of love,\nThat made my tongue so stammer and trip\nWhen I saw the treasured splendour, her hand,\nCome sliding out of her sacred glove,\nAnd the sunlight broke from her lip?\n\nX.\nI have play\u2019d with her when a child;\nShe remembers it now we meet.\nAh well, well, well, I may be beguiled\nBy some coquettish deceit.\nYet, if she were not a cheat,\nIf Maud were all that she seem\u2019d,\nAnd her smile had all that I dream\u2019d,\nThen the world were not so bitter\nBut a smile could make it sweet.\n\nVII\nI.\nDid I hear it half in a doze\nLong since, I know not where?\nDid I dream it an hour ago,\nWhen asleep in this arm-chair?\n\nII.\nMen were drinking together,\nDrinking and talking of me;\n\u2018Well, if it prove a girl, the boy\nWill have plenty: so let it be.\u2019\n\nIII.\nIs it an echo of something\nRead with a boy\u2019s delight,\nViziers nodding together\nIn some Arabian night?\n\nIV.\nStrange, that I hear two men,\nSomewhere, talking of me;\n\u2018Well, if it prove a girl, my boy\nWill have plenty: so let it be.\u2019\n\nVIII\nShe came to the village church,\nAnd sat by a pillar alone;\nAn angel watching an urn\nWept over her, carved in stone;\nAnd once, but once, she lifted her eyes,\nAnd suddenly, sweetly, strangely blush\u2019d\nTo find they were met by my own;\nAnd suddenly, sweetly, my heart beat stronger\nAnd thicker, until I heard no longer\nThe snowy-banded, dilettante,\nDelicate-handed priest intone;\nAnd thought, is it pride, and mused and sigh\u2019d\n\u2018No surely, now it cannot be pride.\u2019\n\nIX\nI was walking a mile,\nMore than a mile from the shore,\nThe sun look\u2019d out with a smile\nBetwixt the cloud and the moor,\nAnd riding at set of day\nOver the dark moor land,\nRapidly riding far away,\nShe waved to me with her hand.\nThere were two at her side,\nSomething flash\u2019d in the sun,\nDown by the hill I saw them ride,\nIn a moment they were gone:\nLike a sudden spark\nStruck vainly in the night,\nThen returns the dark\nWith no more hope of light.\n\nX\nI.\nSick, am I sick of a jealous dread?\nWas not one of the two at her side\nThis new-made lord, whose splendour plucks\nThe slavish hat from the villager\u2019s head?\nWhose old grandfather has lately died,\nGone to a blacker pit, for whom\nGrimy nakedness dragging his trucks\nAnd laying his trams in a poison\u2019d gloom\nWrought, till he crept from a gutted mine\nMaster of half a servile shire,\nAnd left his coal all turn\u2019d into gold\nTo a grandson, first of his noble line,\nRich in the grace all women desire,\nStrong in the power that all men adore,\nAnd simper and set their voices lower,\nAnd soften as if to a girl, and hold\nAwe-stricken breaths at a work divine,\nSeeing his gewgaw castle shine,\nNew as his title, built last year,\nThere amid perky larches and pine,\nAnd over the sullen-purple moor\n(Look at it) pricking a cockney ear.\n\nII.\nWhat, has he found my jewel out?\nFor one of the two that rode at her side\nBound for the Hall, I am sure was he:\nBound for the Hall, and I think for a bride.\nBlithe would her brother\u2019s acceptance be.\nMaud could be gracious too, no doubt\nTo a lord, a captain, a padded shape,\nA bought commission, a waxen face,\nA rabbit mouth that is ever agape\u2013\nBought? what is it he cannot buy?\nAnd therefore splenetic, personal, base,\nA wounded thing with a rancorous cry,\nAt war with myself and a wretched race,\nSick, sick to the heart of life, am I.\n\nIII.\nLast week came one to the county town,\nTo preach our poor little army down,\nAnd play the game of the despot kings,\nTho\u2019 the state has done it and thrice as well:\nThis broad-brimm\u2019d hawker of holy things,\nWhose ear is cramm\u2019d with his cotton, and rings\nEven in dreams to the chink of his pence,\nThis huckster put down war! can he tell\nWhether war be a cause or a consequence?\nPut down the passions that make earth Hell!\nDown with ambition, avarice, pride,\nJealousy, down! cut off from the mind\nThe bitter springs of anger and fear;\nDown too, down at your own fireside,\nWith the evil tongue and the evil ear,\nFor each is at war with mankind.\n\nIV.\nI wish I could hear again\nThe chivalrous battle-song\nThat she warbled alone in her joy!\nI might persuade myself then\nShe would not do herself this great wrong,\nTo take a wanton dissolute boy\nFor a man and leader of men.\n\nV.\nAh God, for a man with heart, head, hand,\nLike some of the simple great ones gone\nFor ever and ever by,\nOne still strong man in a blatant land,\nWhatever they call him, what care I,\nAristocrat, democrat, autocrat\u2013one\nWho can rule and dare not lie.\n\nVI.\nAnd ah for a man to arise in me,\nThat the man I am may cease to be!\n\nXI\nI.\nO let the solid ground\nNot fail beneath my feet\nBefore my life has found\nWhat some have found so sweet;\nThen let come what come may,\nWhat matter if I go mad,\nI shall have had my day.\n\nII.\nLet the sweet heavens endure,\nNot close and darken above me\nBefore I am quite quite sure\nThat there is one to love me;\nThen let come what come may\nTo a life that has been so sad,\nI shall have had my day.\n\nXII\nI.\nBirds in the high Hall-garden\nWhen twilight was falling,\nMaud, Maud, Maud, Maud,\nThey were crying and calling.\n\nII.\nWhere was Maud? in our wood;\nAnd I, who else, was with her,\nGathering woodland lilies,\nMyriads blow together.\n\nIII.\nBirds in our wood sang\nRinging thro\u2019 the valleys,\nMaud is here, here, here\nIn among the lilies.\n\nIV.\nI kiss\u2019d her slender hand,\nShe took the kiss sedately;\nMaud is not seventeen,\nBut she is tall and stately.\n\nV.\nI to cry out on pride\nWho have won her favour!\nO Maud were sure of Heaven\nIf lowliness could save her.\n\nVI.\nI know the way she went\nHome with her maiden posy,\nFor her feet have touch\u2019d the meadows\nAnd left the daisies rosy.\n\nVII.\nBirds in the high Hall-garden\nWere crying and calling to her,\nWhere is Maud, Maud, Maud?\nOne is come to woo her.\n\nVIII.\n\nLook, a horse at the door,\nAnd little King Charley snarling,\nGo back, my lord, across the moor,\nYou are not her darling.\n\nXIII\nI.\nScorn\u2019d, to be scorn\u2019d by one that I scorn,\nIs that a matter to make me fret?\nThat a calamity hard to be borne?\nWell, he may live to hate me yet.\nFool that I am to be vext with his pride!\nI past him, I was crossing his lands;\nHe stood on the path a little aside;\nHis face, as I grant, in spite of spite,\nHas a broad-blown comeliness, red and white,\nAnd six feet two, as I think, he stands;\nBut his essences turn\u2019d the live air sick,\nAnd barbarous opulence jewel-thick\nSunn\u2019d itself on his breast and his hands.\n\nII.\n\nWho shall call me ungentle, unfair,\nI long\u2019d so heartily then and there\nTo give him the grasp of fellowship;\nBut while I past he was humming an air,\nStopt, and then with a riding whip\nLeisurely tapping a glossy boot,\nAnd curving a contumelious lip,\nGorgonised me from head to foot\nWith a stony British stare.\n\nIII.\nWhy sits he here in his father\u2019s chair?\nThat old man never comes to his place:\nShall I believe him ashamed to be seen?\nFor only once, in the village street,\nLast year, I caught a glimpse of his face,\nA gray old wolf and a lean.\nScarcely, now, would I call him a cheat;\nFor then, perhaps, as a child of deceit,\nShe might by a true descent be untrue;\nAnd Maud is as true as Maud is sweet:\nTho\u2019 I fancy her sweetness only due\nTo the sweeter blood by the other side;\nHer mother has been a thing complete,\nHowever she came to be so allied.\nAnd fair without, faithful within,\nMaud to him is nothing akin:\nSome peculiar mystic grace\nMade her only the child of her mother,\nAnd heap\u2019d the whole inherited sin\nOn that huge scapegoat of the race,\nAll, all upon the brother.\n\nIV.\nPeace, angry spirit, and let him be!\nHas not his sister smiled on me?\n\nXIV\nI.\nMaud has a garden of roses\nAnd lilies fair on a lawn;\nThere she walks in her state\nAnd tends upon bed and bower,\nAnd thither I climb\u2019d at dawn\nAnd stood by her garden-gate;\nA lion ramps at the top,\nHe is claspt by a passion-flower.\n\nII.\nMaud\u2019s own little oak-room\n(Which Maud, like a precious stone\nSet in the heart of the carven gloom,\nLights with herself, when alone\nShe sits by her music and books\nAnd her brother lingers late\nWith a roystering company) looks\nUpon Maud\u2019s own garden-gate:\nAnd I thought as I stood, if a hand, as white\nAs ocean-foam in the moon, were laid\nOn the hasp of the window, and my Delight\nHad a sudden desire, like a glorious ghost, to glide,\nLike a beam of the seventh Heaven, down to my side,\nThere were but a step to be made.\n\nIII.\nThe fancy flatter\u2019d my mind,\nAnd again seem\u2019d overbold;\nNow I thought that she cared for me,\nNow I thought she was kind\nOnly because she was cold.\n\nIV.\nI heard no sound where I stood\nBut the rivulet on from the lawn\nRunning down to my own dark wood;\nOr the voice of the long sea-wave as it swell\u2019d\nNow and then in the dim-gray dawn;\nBut I look\u2019d, and round, all round the house I beheld\nThe death-white curtain drawn;\nFelt a horror over me creep,\nPrickle my skin and catch my breath,\nKnew that the death-white curtain meant but sleep,\nYet I shudder\u2019d and thought like a fool of the sleep of death.\n\nXV\nSo dark a mind within me dwells,\nAnd I make myself such evil cheer,\nThat if I be dear to some one else,\nThen some one else may have much to fear;\nBut if I be dear to some one else,\nThen I should be to myself more dear.\nShall I not take care of all that I think,\nYea ev\u2019n of wretched meat and drink,\nIf I be dear,\nIf I be dear to some one else.\n\nXVI\nI.\nThis lump of earth has left his estate\nThe lighter by the loss of his weight;\nAnd so that he find what he went to seek,\nAnd fulsome Pleasure clog him, and drown\nHis heart in the gross mud-honey of town,\nHe may stay for a year who has gone for a week:\nBut this is the day when I must speak,\nAnd I see my Oread coming down,\nO this is the day!\nO beautiful creature, what am I\nThat I dare to look her way;\nThink I may hold dominion sweet,\nLord of the pulse that is lord of her breast,\nAnd dream of her beauty with tender dread,\nFrom the delicate Arab arch of her feet\nTo the grace that, bright and light as the crest\nOf a peacock, sits on her shining head,\nAnd she knows it not: O, if she knew it,\nTo know her beauty might half undo it.\nI know it the one bright thing to save\nMy yet young life in the wilds of Time,\nPerhaps from madness, perhaps from crime,\nPerhaps from a selfish grave.\n\nII.\nWhat, if she be fasten\u2019d to this fool lord,\nDare I bid her abide by her word?\nShould I love her so well if she\nHad given her word to a thing so low?\nShall I love her as well if she\nCan break her word were it even for me?\nI trust that it is not so.\n\nIII.\nCatch not my breath, O clamorous heart,\nLet not my tongue be a thrall to my eye,\nFor I must tell her before we part,\nI must tell her, or die.\n\nXVII\nGo not, happy day,\nFrom the shining fields\nGo not, happy day,\nTill the maiden yields.\nRosy is the West,\nRosy is the South,\nRoses are her cheeks,\nAnd a rose her mouth\nWhen the happy Yes\nFalters from her lips,\nPass and blush the news\nOver glowing ships;\nOver blowing seas,\nOver seas at rest,\nPass the happy news,\nBlush it thro\u2019 the West;\nTill the red man dance\nBy his red cedar-tree,\nAnd the red man\u2019s babe\nLeap, beyond the sea.\nBlush from West to East,\nBlush from East to West,\nTill the West is East,\nBlush it thro\u2019 the West.\nRosy is the West,\nRosy is the South,\nRoses are her cheeks,\nAnd a rose her mouth.\n\nXVIII\nI.\nI have led her home, my love, my only friend.\nThere is none like her, none.\nAnd never yet so warmly ran my blood\nAnd sweetly, on and on\nCalming itself to the long-wish\u2019d-for end,\nFull to the banks, close on the promised good.\n\nII.\nNone like her, none.\nJust now the dry-tongued laurels\u2019 pattering talk\nSeem\u2019d her light foot along the garden walk,\nAnd shook my heart to think she comes once more;\nBut even then I heard her close the door,\nThe gates of Heaven are closed, and she is gone.\n\nIII.\nThere is none like her, none.\nNor will be when our summers have deceased.\nO, art thou sighing for Lebanon\nIn the long breeze that streams to thy delicious East,\nSighing for Lebanon,\nDark cedar, tho\u2019 thy limbs have here increased,\nUpon a pastoral slope as fair,\nAnd looking to the South, and fed\nWith honey\u2019d rain and delicate air,\nAnd haunted by the starry head\nOf her whose gentle will has changed my fate,\nAnd made my life a perfumed altar-flame;\nAnd over whom thy darkness must have spread\nWith such delight as theirs of old, thy great\nForefathers of the thornless garden, there\nShadowing the snow-limb\u2019d Eve from whom she came.\n\nIV.\nHere will I lie, while these long branches sway,\nAnd you fair stars that crown a happy day\nGo in and out as if at merry play,\nWho am no more so all forlorn,\nAs when it seem\u2019d far better to be born\nTo labour and the mattock-harden\u2019d hand,\nThan nursed at ease and brought to understand\nA sad astrology, the boundless plan\nThat makes you tyrants in your iron skies,\nInnumerable, pitiless, passionless eyes,\nCold fires, yet with power to burn and brand\nHis nothingness into man.\n\nV.\nBut now shine on, and what care I,\nWho in this stormy gulf have found a pearl\nThe countercharm of space and hollow sky,\nAnd do accept my madness, and would die\nTo save from some slight shame one simple girl.\n\nVI.\nWould die; for sullen-seeming Death may give\nMore life to Love than is or ever was\nIn our low world, where yet \u2019tis sweet to live.\nLet no one ask me how it came to pass;\nIt seems that I am happy, that to me\nA livelier emerald twinkles in the grass,\nA purer sapphire melts into the sea.\n\nVII.\nNot die; but live a life of truest breath,\nAnd teach true life to fight with mortal wrongs.\nO, why should Love, like men in drinking-songs,\nSpice his fair banquet with the dust of death?\nMake answer, Maud my bliss,\nMaud made my Maud by that long loving kiss,\nLife of my life, wilt thou not answer this?\n\u2018The dusky strand of Death inwoven here\nWith dear Love\u2019s tie, makes Love himself more dear.\u2019\n\nVIII.\nIs that enchanted moan only the swell\nOf the long waves that roll in yonder bay?\nAnd hark the clock within, the silver knell\nOf twelve sweet hours that past in bridal white,\nAnd died to live, long as my pulses play;\nBut now by this my love has closed her sight\nAnd given false death her hand, and stol\u2019n away\nTo dreamful wastes where footless fancies dwell\nAmong the fragments of the golden day.\nMay nothing there her maiden grace affright!\nDear heart, I feel with thee the drowsy spell.\nMy bride to be, my evermore delight,\nMy own heart\u2019s heart, my ownest own, farewell;\nIt is but for a little space I go:\nAnd ye meanwhile far over moor and fell\nBeat to the noiseless music of the night!\nHas our whole earth gone nearer to the glow\nOf your soft splendours that you look so bright?\nI have climb\u2019d nearer out of lonely Hell.\nBeat, happy stars, timing with things below,\nBeat with my heart more blest than heart can tell,\nBlest, but for some dark undercurrent woe\nThat seems to draw\u2013but it shall not be so:\nLet all be well, be well.\n\nXIX\nI.\nHer brother is coming back to-night,\nBreaking up my dream of delight.\n\nII.\nMy dream? do I dream of bliss?\nI have walk\u2019d awake with Truth.\nO when did a morning shine\nSo rich in atonement as this\nFor my dark-dawning youth,\nDarken\u2019d watching a mother decline\nAnd that dead man at her heart and mine:\nFor who was left to watch her but I?\nYet so did I let my freshness die.\n\nIII.\nI trust that I did not talk\nTo gentle Maud in our walk\n(For often in lonely wanderings\nI have cursed him even to lifeless things)\nBut I trust that I did not talk,\nNot touch on her father\u2019s sin:\nI am sure I did but speak\nOf my mother\u2019s faded cheek\nWhen it slowly grew so thin,\nThat I felt she was slowly dying\nVext with lawyers and harass\u2019d with debt:\nFor how often I caught her with eyes all wet,\nShaking her head at her son and sighing\nA world of trouble within!\n\nIV.\nAnd Maud too, Maud was moved\nTo speak of the mother she loved\nAs one scarce less forlorn,\nDying abroad and it seems apart\nFrom him who had ceased to share her heart,\nAnd ever mourning over the feud,\nThe household Fury sprinkled with blood\nBy which our houses are torn:\nHow strange was what she said,\nWhen only Maud and the brother\nHung over her dying bed\u2013\nThat Maud\u2019s dark father and mine\nHad bound us one to the other,\nBetrothed us over their wine,\nOn the day when Maud was born;\nSeal\u2019d her mine from her first sweet breath.\nMine, mine by a right, from birth till death.\nMine, mine\u2013our fathers have sworn.\n\nV.\nBut the true blood spilt had in it a heat\nTo dissolve the precious seal on a bond,\nThat, if left uncancell\u2019d, had been so sweet:\nAnd none of us thought of a something beyond,\nA desire that awoke in the heart of the child,\nAs it were a duty done to the tomb,\nTo be friends for her sake, to be reconciled;\nAnd I was cursing them and my doom,\nAnd letting a dangerous thought run wild\nWhile often abroad in the fragrant gloom\nOf foreign churches\u2013I see her there,\nBright English lily, breathing a prayer\nTo be friends, to be reconciled!\n\nVI.\nBut then what a flint is he!\nAbroad, at Florence, at Rome,\nI find whenever she touch\u2019d on me\nThis brother had laugh\u2019d her down,\nAnd at last, when each came home,\nHe had darken\u2019d into a frown,\nChid her, and forbid her to speak\nTo me, her friend of the years before;\nAnd this was what had redden\u2019d her cheek\nWhen I bow\u2019d to her on the moor.\n\nVII.\nYet Maud, altho\u2019 not blind\nTo the faults of his heart and mind,\nI see she cannot but love him,\nAnd says he is rough but kind,\nAnd wishes me to approve him,\nAnd tells me, when she lay\nSick once, with a fear of worse,\nThat he left his wine and horses and play,\nSat with her, read to her, night and day,\nAnd tended her like a nurse.\n\nVIII.\nKind? but the deathbed desire\nSpurn\u2019d by this heir of the liar\u2013\nRough but kind? yet I know\nHe has plotted against me in this,\nThat he plots against me still.\nKind to Maud? that were not amiss.\nWell, rough but kind; why let it be so:\nFor shall not Maud have her will?\n\nIX.\nFor, Maud, so tender and true,\nAs long as my life endures\nI feel I shall owe you a debt,\nThat I never can hope to pay;\nAnd if ever I should forget\nThat I owe this debt to you\nAnd for your sweet sake to yours;\nO then, what then shall I say?\u2013\nIf ever I should forget,\nMay God make me more wretched\nThan ever I have been yet!\n\nX.\nSo now I have sworn to bury\nAll this dead body of hate,\nI feel so free and so clear\nBy the loss of that dead weight,\nThat I should grow light-headed, I fear,\nFantastically merry;\nBut that her brother comes, like a blight\nOn my fresh hope, to the Hall to-night.\n\nXX\nI.\nStrange, that I felt so gay,\nStrange, that I tried to-day\nTo beguile her melancholy;\nThe Sultan, as we name him,\u2013\nShe did not wish to blame him\u2013\nBut he vext her and perplext her\nWith his worldly talk and folly:\nWas it gentle to reprove her\nFor stealing out of view\nFrom a little lazy lover\nWho but claims her as his due?\nOr for chilling his caresses\nBy the coldness of her manners,\nNay, the plainness of her dresses?\nNow I know her but in two,\nNor can pronounce upon it\nIf one should ask me whether\nThe habit, hat, and feather,\nOr the frock and gipsy bonnet\nBe the neater and completer;\nFor nothing can be sweeter\nThan maiden Maud in either.\n\nII.\nBut to-morrow, if we live,\nOur ponderous squire will give\nA grand political dinner\nTo half the squirelings near;\nAnd Maud will wear her jewels,\nAnd the bird of prey will hover,\nAnd the titmouse hope to win her\nWith his chirrup at her ear.\n\nIII.\nA grand political dinner\nTo the men of many acres,\nA gathering of the Tory,\nA dinner and then a dance\nFor the maids and marriage-makers,\nAnd every eye but mine will glance\nAt Maud in all her glory.\n\nIV.\nFor I am not invited,\nBut, with the Sultan\u2019s pardon,\nI am all as well delighted,\nFor I know her own rose-garden,\nAnd mean to linger in it\nTill the dancing will be over;\nAnd then, oh then, come out to me\nFor a minute, but for a minute,\nCome out to your own true lover,\nThat your true lover may see\nYour glory also, and render\nAll homage to his own darling,\nQueen Maud in all her splendour.\n\nXXI\nRivulet crossing my ground,\nAnd bringing me down from the Hall\nThis garden-rose that I found,\nForgetful of Maud and me,\nAnd lost in trouble and moving round\nHere at the head of a tinkling fall,\nAnd trying to pass to the sea;\nO Rivulet, born at the Hall,\nMy Maud has sent it by thee\n(If I read her sweet will right)\nOn a blushing mission to me,\nSaying in odour and colour, \u2018Ah, be\nAmong the roses to-night.\u2019\n\nXXII\nI.\nCome into the garden, Maud,\nFor the black bat, night, has flown,\nCome into the garden, Maud,\nI am here at the gate alone;\nAnd the woodbine spices are wafted abroad,\nAnd the musk of the rose is blown.\n\nII.\nFor a breeze of morning moves,\nAnd the planet of Love is on high,\nBeginning to faint in the light that she loves\nOn a bed of daffodil sky,\nTo faint in the light of the sun she loves,\nTo faint in his light, and to die.\n\nIII.\nAll night have the roses heard\nThe flute, violin, bassoon;\nAll night has the casement jessamine stirr\u2019d\nTo the dancers dancing in tune;\nTill a silence fell with the waking bird,\nAnd a hush with the setting moon.\n\nIV.\nI said to the lily, \u2018There is but one\nWith whom she has heart to be gay.\nWhen will the dancers leave her alone?\nShe is weary of dance and play.\u2019\nNow half to the setting moon are gone,\nAnd half to the rising day;\nLow on the sand and loud on the stone\nThe last wheel echoes away.\n\nV.\nI said to the rose, \u2018The brief night goes\nIn babble and revel and wine.\nO young lord-lover, what sighs are those,\nFor one that will never be thine?\nBut mine, but mine,\u2019 so I sware to the rose,\n\u2018For ever and ever, mine.\u2019\n\nVI.\nAnd the soul of the rose went into my blood,\nAs the music clash\u2019d in the hall;\nAnd long by the garden lake I stood,\nFor I heard your rivulet fall\nFrom the lake to the meadow and on to the wood,\nOur wood, that is dearer than all;\n\nVII.\nFrom the meadow your walks have left so sweet\nThat whenever a March-wind sighs\nHe sets the jewel-print of your feet\nIn violets blue as your eyes,\nTo the woody hollows in which we meet\nAnd the valleys of Paradise.\n\nVIII.\nThe slender acacia would not shake\nOne long milk-bloom on the tree;\nThe white lake-blossom fell into the lake\nAs the pimpernel dozed on the lea;\nBut the rose was awake all night for your sake,\nKnowing your promise to me;\nThe lilies and roses were all awake,\nThey sigh\u2019d for the dawn and thee.\n\nIX.\nQueen rose of the rosebud garden of girls,\nCome hither, the dances are done,\nIn gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls,\nQueen lily and rose in one;\nShine out, little head, sunning over with curls,\nTo the flowers, and be their sun.\n\nX.\nThere has fallen a splendid tear\nFrom the passion-flower at the gate.\nShe is coming, my dove, my dear;\nShe is coming, my life, my fate;\nThe red rose cries, \u2018She is near, she is near;\u2019\nAnd the white rose weeps, \u2018She is late;\u2019\nThe larkspur listens, \u2018I hear, I hear;\u2019\nAnd the lily whispers, \u2018I wait.\u2019\n\nXI.\nShe is coming, my own, my sweet;\nWere it ever so airy a tread,\nMy heart would hear her and beat,\nWere it earth in an earthy bed;\nMy dust would hear her and beat,\nHad I lain for a century dead;\nWould start and tremble under her feet,\nAnd blossom in purple and red.\n\nPART II\nI\nI.\n\u2018The fault was mine, the fault was mine\u2019\u2013\nWhy am I sitting here so stunn\u2019d and still,\nPlucking the harmless wild-flower on the hill?\u2013\nIt is this guilty hand!\u2013\nAnd there rises ever a passionate cry\nFrom underneath in the darkening land\u2013\nWhat is it, that has been done?\nO dawn of Eden bright over earth and sky,\nThe fires of Hell brake out of thy rising sun,\nThe fires of Hell and of Hate;\nFor she, sweet soul, had hardly spoken a word,\nWhen her brother ran in his rage to the gate,\nHe came with the babe-faced lord;\nHeap\u2019d on her terms of disgrace,\nAnd while she wept, and I strove to be cool,\nHe fiercely gave me the lie,\nTill I with as fierce an anger spoke,\nAnd he struck me, madman, over the face,\nStruck me before the languid fool,\nWho was gaping and grinning by:\nStruck for himself an evil stroke;\nWrought for his house an irredeemable woe;\nFor front to front in an hour we stood,\nAnd a million horrible bellowing echoes broke\nFrom the red-ribb\u2019d hollow behind the wood,\nAnd thunder\u2019d up into Heaven the Christless code,\nThat must have life for a blow.\nEver and ever afresh they seem\u2019d to grow.\nWas it he lay there with a fading eye?\n\u2018The fault was mine,\u2019 he whisper\u2019d, \u2018fly!\u2019\nThen glided out of the joyous wood\nThe ghastly Wraith of one that I know;\nAnd there rang on a sudden a passionate cry,\nA cry for a brother\u2019s blood:\nIt will ring in my heart and my ears, till I die, till I die.\n\nII.\nIs it gone? my pulses beat\u2013\nWhat was it? a lying trick of the brain?\nYet I thought I saw her stand,\nA shadow there at my feet,\nHigh over the shadowy land.\nIt is gone; and the heavens fall in a gentle rain,\nWhen they should burst and drown with deluging storms\nThe feeble vassals of wine and anger and lust,\nThe little hearts that know not how to forgive:\nArise, my God, and strike, for we hold Thee just,\nStrike dead the whole weak race of venomous worms,\nThat sting each other here in the dust;\nWe are not worthy to live.\n\nII\nI.\nSee what a lovely shell,\nSmall and pure as a pearl,\nLying close to my foot,\nFrail, but a work divine,\nMade so fairily well\nWith delicate spire and whorl,\nHow exquisitely minute,\nA miracle of design!\n\nII.\nWhat is it? a learned man\nCould give it a clumsy name.\nLet him name it who can,\nThe beauty would be the same.\n\nIII.\nThe tiny cell is forlorn,\nVoid of the little living will\nThat made it stir on the shore.\nDid he stand at the diamond door\nOf his house in a rainbow frill?\nDid he push, when he was uncurl\u2019d,\nA golden foot or a fairy horn\nThro\u2019 his dim water-world?\n\nIV.\nSlight, to he crush\u2019d with a tap\nOf my finger-nail on the sand,\nSmall, but a work divine,\nFrail, but of force to withstand,\nYear upon year, the shock\nOf cataract seas that snap\nThe three decker\u2019s oaken spine\nAthwart the ledges of rock,\nHere on the Breton strand!\n\nV.\nBreton, not Briton; here\nLike a shipwreck\u2019d man on a coast\nOf ancient fable and fear\u2013\nPlagued with a flitting to and fro,\nA disease, a hard mechanic ghost\nThat never came from on high\nNor ever arose from below,\nBut only moves with the moving eye,\nFlying along the land and the main\u2013\nWhy should it look like Maud?\nAm I to be overawed\nBy what I cannot but know\nIs a juggle born of the brain?\n\nVI.\nBack from the Breton coast,\nSick of a nameless fear,\nBack to the dark sea-line\nLooking, thinking of all I have lost;\nAn old song vexes my ear;\nBut that of Lamech is mine.\n\nVII.\nFor years, a measureless ill,\nFor years, for ever, to part\u2013\nBut she, she would love me still;\nAnd as long, O God, as she\nHave a grain of love for me,\nSo long, no doubt, no doubt,\nShall I nurse in my dark heart,\nHowever weary, a spark of will\nNot to be trampled out.\n\nVIII.\nStrange, that the mind, when fraught\nWith a passion so intense\nOne would think that it well\nMight drown all life in the eye,\u2013\nThat it should, by being so overwrought,\nSuddenly strike on a sharper sense\nFor a shell, or a flower, little things\nWhich else would have been past by!\nAnd now I remember, I,\nWhen he lay dying there,\nI noticed one of his many rings\n(For he had many, poor worm) and thought\nIt is his mother\u2019s hair.\n\nIX.\nWho knows if he be dead?\nWhether I need have fled?\nAm I guilty of blood?\nHowever this may be,\nComfort her, comfort her, all things good,\nWhile I am over the sea!\nLet me and my passionate love go by,\nBut speak to her all things holy and high,\nWhatever happen to me!\nMe and my harmful love go by;\nBut come to her waking, find her asleep,\nPowers of the height, Powers of the deep,\nAnd comfort her tho\u2019 I die.\n\nIII\nCourage, poor heart of stone!\nI will not ask thee why\nThou canst not understand\nThat thou art left for ever alone:\nCourage, poor stupid heart of stone.\u2013\nOr if I ask thee why,\nCare not thou to reply:\nShe is but dead, and the time is at hand\nWhen thou shalt more than die.\n\nIV\nI.\nO that \u2019twere possible\nAfter long grief and pain\nTo find the arms of my true love\nRound me once again!\n\nII.\nWhen I was won't to meet her\nIn the silent woody places\nBy the home that gave me birth,\nWe stood tranced in long embraces\nMixt with kisses sweeter sweeter\nThan anything on earth.\n\nIII.\nA shadow flits before me,\nNot thou, but like to thee:\nAh Christ, that it were possible\nFor one short hour to see\nThe souls we loved, that they might tell us\nWhat and where they be.\n\nIV.\nIt leads me forth at evening,\nIt lightly winds and steals\nIn a cold white robe before me,\nWhen all my spirit reels\nAt the shouts, the leagues of lights,\nAnd the roaring of the wheels.\n\nV.\nHalf the night I waste in sighs,\nHalf in dreams I sorrow after\nThe delight of early skies;\nIn a wakeful doze I sorrow\nFor the hand, the lips, the eyes,\nFor the meeting of the morrow,\nThe delight of happy laughter,\nThe delight of low replies.\n\nVI.\n\u2019Tis a morning pure and sweet,\nAnd a dewy splendour falls\nOn the little flower that clings\nTo the turrets and the walls;\n\u2019Tis a morning pure and sweet,\nAnd the light and shadow fleet;\nShe is walking in the meadow,\nAnd the woodland echo rings;\nIn a moment we shall meet;\nShe is singing in the meadow\nAnd the rivulet at her feet\nRipples on in light and shadow\nTo the ballad that she sings.\n\nVII.\nDo I hear her sing as of old,\nMy bird with the shining head,\nMy own dove with the tender eye?\nBut there rings on a sudden a passionate cry,\nThere is some one dying or dead,\nAnd a sullen thunder is roll\u2019d;\nFor a tumult shakes the city,\nAnd I wake, my dream is fled;\nIn the shuddering dawn, behold,\nWithout knowledge, without pity,\nBy the curtains of my bed\nThat abiding phantom cold.\n\nVIII.\nGet thee hence, nor come again,\nMix not memory with doubt,\nPass, thou deathlike type of pain,\nPass and cease to move about!\n\u2019Tis the blot upon the brain\nThat will show itself without.\n\nIX.\nThen I rise, the eavedrops fall,\nAnd the yellow vapours choke\nThe great city sounding wide;\nThe day comes, a dull red ball\nWrapt in drifts of lurid smoke\nOn the misty river-tide.\n\nX.\nThro\u2019 the hubbub of the market\nI steal, a wasted frame,\nIt crosses here, it crosses there,\nThro\u2019 all that crowd confused and loud,\nThe shadow still the same;\nAnd on my heavy eyelids\nMy anguish hangs like shame.\n\nXI.\nAlas for her that met me,\nThat heard me softly call,\nCame glimmering thro\u2019 the laurels\nAt the quiet evenfall,\nIn the garden by the turrets\nOf the old manorial hall.\n\nXII.\nWould the happy spirit descend,\nFrom the realms of light and song,\nIn the chamber or the street,\nAs she looks among the blest,\nShould I fear to greet my friend\nOr to say \u2018Forgive the wrong,\u2019\nOr to ask her, \u2018Take me, sweet,\nTo the regions of thy rest\u2019?\n\nXIII.\nBut the broad light glares and beats,\nAnd the shadow flits and fleets\nAnd will not let me be;\nAnd I loathe the squares and streets,\nAnd the faces that one meets,\nHearts with no love for me:\nAlways I long to creep\nInto some still cavern deep,\nThere to weep, and weep, and weep\nMy whole soul out to thee.\n\nV\nI.\nDead, long dead,\nLong dead!\nAnd my heart is a handful of dust,\nAnd the wheels go over my head,\nAnd my bones are shaken with pain,\nFor into a shallow grave they are thrust,\nOnly a yard beneath the street,\nAnd the hoofs of the horses beat, beat,\nThe hoofs of the horses beat,\nBeat into my scalp and my brain,\nWith never an end to the stream of passing feet,\nDriving, hurrying, marrying, burying,\nClamour and rumble, and ringing and clatter,\nAnd here beneath it is all as bad,\nFor I thought the dead had peace, but it is not so;\nTo have no peace in the grave, is that not sad?\nBut up and down and to and fro,\nEver about me the dead men go;\nAnd then to hear a dead man chatter\nIs enough to drive one mad.\n\nII.\nWretchedest age, since Time began,\nThey cannot even bury a man;\nAnd tho\u2019 we paid our tithes in the days that are gone,\nNot a bell was rung, not a prayer was read;\nIt is that which makes us loud in the world of the dead;\nThere is none that does his work, not one;\nA touch of their office might have sufficed,\nBut the churchmen fain would kill their church,\nAs the churches have kill\u2019d their Christ.\n\nIII.\nSee, there is one of us sobbing,\nNo limit to his distress;\nAnd another, a lord of all things, praying\nTo his own great self, as I guess;\nAnd another, a statesman there, betraying\nHis party-secret, fool, to the press;\nAnd yonder a vile physician, blabbing\nThe case of his patient\u2013all for what?\nTo tickle the maggot born in an empty head,\nAnd wheedle a world that loves him not,\nFor it is but a world of the dead.\n\nIV.\nNothing but idiot gabble!\nFor the prophecy given of old\nAnd then not understood,\nHas come to pass as foretold;\nNot let any man think for the public good,\nBut babble, merely for babble.\nFor I never whisper\u2019d a private affair\nWithin the hearing of cat or mouse,\nNo, not to myself in the closet alone,\nBut I heard it shouted at once from the top of the house;\nEverything came to be known.\nWho told him we were there?\n\nV.\nNot that gray old wolf, for he came not back\nFrom the wilderness, full of wolves, where he used to lie;\nHe has gather\u2019d the bones for his o\u2019ergrown whelp to crack;\nCrack them now for yourself, and howl, and die.\n\nVI.\nProphet, curse me the blabbing lip,\nAnd curse me the British vermin, the rat;\nI know not whether he came in the Hanover ship,\nBut I know that he lies and listens mute\nIn an ancient mansion\u2019s crannies and holes:\nArsenic, arsenic, sure, would do it,\nExcept that now we poison our babes, poor souls!\nIt is all used up for that.\n\nVII.\nTell him now: she is standing here at my head;\nNot beautiful now, not even kind;\nHe may take her now; for she never speaks her mind,\nBut is ever the one thing silent here.\nShe is not of us, as I divine;\nShe comes from another stiller world of the dead,\nStiller, not fairer than mine.\n\nVIII.\nBut I know where a garden grows,\nFairer than aught in the world beside,\nAll made up of the lily and rose\nThat blow by night, when the season is good,\nTo the sound of dancing music and flutes:\nIt is only flowers, they had no fruits,\nAnd I almost fear they are not roses, but blood;\nFor the keeper was one, so full of pride,\nHe linkt a dead man there to a spectral bride;\nFor he, if he had not been a Sultan of brutes,\nWould he have that hole in his side?\n\nIX.\nBut what will the old man say?\nHe laid a cruel snare in a pit\nTo catch a friend of mine one stormy day;\nYet now I could even weep to think of it;\nFor what will the old man say\nWhen he comes to the second corpse in the pit?\n\nX.\nFriend, to be struck by the public foe,\nThen to strike him and lay him low,\nThat were a public merit, far,\nWhatever the Quaker holds, from sin;\nBut the red life spilt for a private blow\u2013\nI swear to you, lawful and lawless war\nAre scarcely even akin.\n\nXI.\nO me, why have they not buried me deep enough?\nIs it kind to have made me a grave so rough,\nMe, that was never a quiet sleeper?\nMaybe still I am but half-dead;\nThen I cannot be wholly dumb;\nI will cry to the steps above my head\nAnd somebody, surely, some kind heart will come\nTo bury me, bury me\nDeeper, ever so little deeper.\n\nPART III\nVI\nI.\nMy life has crept so long on a broken wing\nThro\u2019 cells of madness, haunts of horror and fear,\nThat I come to be grateful at last for a little thing:\nMy mood is changed, for it fell at a time of year\nWhen the face of night is fair on the dewy downs,\nAnd the shining daffodil dies, and the Charioteer\nAnd starry Gemini hang like glorious crowns\nOver Orion\u2019s grave low down in the west,\nThat like a silent lightning under the stars\nShe seem\u2019d to divide in a dream from a band of the blest,\nAnd spoke of a hope for the world in the coming wars\u2013\n\u2018And in that hope, dear soul, let trouble have rest,\nKnowing I tarry for thee,\u2019 and pointed to Mars\nAs he glow\u2019d like a ruddy shield on the Lion\u2019s breast.\n\nII.\nAnd it was but a dream, yet it yielded a dear delight\nTo have look\u2019d, tho\u2019 but in a dream, upon eyes so fair,\nThat had been in a weary world my one thing bright;\nAnd it was but a dream, yet it lighten\u2019d my despair\nWhen I thought that a war would arise in defence of the right,\nThat an iron tyranny now should bend or cease,\nThe glory of manhood stand on his ancient height,\nNor Britain\u2019s one sole God be the millionaire:\nNo more shall commerce be all in all, and Peace\nPipe on her pastoral hillock a languid note,\nAnd watch her harvest ripen, her herd increase,\nNor the cannon-bullet rust on a slothful shore,\nAnd the cobweb woven across the cannon\u2019s throat\nShall shake its threaded tears in the wind no more.\n\nIII.\nAnd as months ran on and rumour of battle grew,\n\u2018It is time, it is time, O passionate heart,\u2019 said I\n(For I cleaved to a cause that I felt to be pure and true),\n\u2018It is time, O passionate heart and morbid eye,\nThat old hysterical mock-disease should die.\u2019\nAnd I stood on a giant deck and mix\u2019d my breath\nWith a loyal people shouting a battle cry,\nTill I saw the dreary phantom arise and fly\nFar into the North, and battle, and seas of death.\n\nIV.\nLet it go or stay, so I wake to the higher aims\nOf a land that has lost for a little her lust of gold,\nAnd a love of a peace that was full of wrongs and shames,\nHorrible, hateful, monstrous, not to be told;\nAnd hail once more to the banner of battle unroll\u2019d!\nTho\u2019 many a light shall darken, and many shall weep\nFor those that are crush\u2019d in the clash of jarring claims,\nYet God\u2019s just wrath shall be wreak\u2019d on a giant liar;\nAnd many a darkness into the light shall leap,\nAnd shine in the sudden making of splendid names,\nAnd noble thought be fre\u00ebr under the sun,\nAnd the heart of a people beat with one desire;\nFor the peace, that I deem\u2019d no peace, is over and done,\nAnd now by the side of the Black and the Baltic deep,\nAnd deathful-grinning mouths of the fortress, flames\nThe blood-red blossom of war with a heart of fire.\n\nV.\nLet it flame or fade, and the war roll down like a wind,\nWe have proved we have hearts in a cause, we are noble still,\nAnd myself have awaked, as it seems, to the better mind;\nIt is better to fight for the good than to rail at the ill;\nI have felt with my native land, I am one with my kind,\nI embrace the purpose of God, and the doom assign\u2019d.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1555655",

He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy, a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In appearance he remained the flower of the family, being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper, made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain. He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes. He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that stood in his way he hated, even if it were she. When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Goodness, boy!\" she said, when he groaned about a master who, he said, hated him, \"if you don't like it, alter it, and if you can't alter it, put up with it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him, he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin. His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being, shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence, the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Dirty nuisance!\" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going straight out of the house when his father disgusted him. And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it. He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them, and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst of all.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous hatred of his children.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There's not a man tries harder for his family!\" he would shout. \"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog. But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard as he imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence. They loathed him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only come home at week-ends.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings, since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial peace in the house.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant. But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother. Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day. He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped at such a fabulous price.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Eight guineas!\" said Morel. \"More fool him! If he'd gen me some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Given YOU some of it!\" cried Mrs. Morel. \"Why give YOU some of it!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all, and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish. But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore; or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like great swells.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper. Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hello, mother!\" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine black-and-white check, and furs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Here's Gyp!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am afraid you will be hungry,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How should I?\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures, its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel came in.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hello, dad!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two shook hands, and William presented the lady. She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How do you do, Mr. Morel?\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morel bowed obsequiously.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself very welcome.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, thank you,\" she replied, rather amused.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You will like to go upstairs,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up this box.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up,\" said William to his betrothed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak, preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight. The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Shall I unstrap the box?\" asked Annie.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, thank you very much!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think she's rather tired, mother,\" said William. \"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Is there anything I can give her?\" asked Mrs. Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh no, she'll be all right.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress, very fine for the collier's kitchen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I told you you'd no need to change,\" said William to her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, Chubby!\" Then she turned with that sweetish smile to Mrs. Morel. \"Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Is he?\" said Mrs. Morel. \"That's not very nice of him.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It isn't, really!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You are cold,\" said the mother. \"Won't you come near the fire?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morel jumped out of his armchair.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Come and sit you here!\" he cried. \"Come and sit you here!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp,\" said William.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no!\" cried Morel. \"This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here, Miss Wesson.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you so much,\" said the girl, seating herself in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered, feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!\" she said, putting up her mouth to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone; which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people: they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her, certainly clownish\u2014in short, the working classes. How was she to adjust herself?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll go,\" said Annie.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken. But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief, she said: \"Oh, thank you!\" in a gracious way.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous, and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech, as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse, answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess. Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups, the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange, not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them. William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At about ten o'clock he said to her:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aren't you tired, Gyp?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Rather, Chubby,\" she answered, at once in the intimate tones and putting her head slightly on one side.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll light her the candle, mother,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Very well,\" replied the mother.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Good-night, Mrs. Morel,\" she said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share the room with the lady, because the house was full.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You wait a minute,\" said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round, to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William. In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore; he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart, in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, mother?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, my son?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated, for his sake.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you like her?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes,\" came the slow answer.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different from her aunt's house, you know.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She does.\" Then he frowned swiftly. \"If only she wouldn't put on her BLESSED airs!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That's it, mother,\" he replied gratefully. But his brow was gloomy. \"You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious, and she can't think.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She's young, my boy.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear. And her father was a rake. She's had no love.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No! Well, you must make up to her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And so\u2014you have to forgive her a lot of things.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY fond of me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Anybody can see that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But you know, mother\u2014she's\u2014she's different from us. Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem to have the same principles.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You mustn't judge too hastily,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he seemed uneasy within himself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round the house.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hello!\" he called, sitting on the stairs. \"Are you getting up?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes,\" her voice called faintly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Merry Christmas!\" he shouted to her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom. She did not come down in half an hour.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?\" he asked of Annie.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, she was,\" replied Annie.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Happy New Year,\" he called.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you, Chubby dear!\" came the laughing voice, far away.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Buck up!\" he implored.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her. Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, it's a winder!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went to the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?\" he called, rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came, looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?\" he asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it, Mrs. Morel?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected everybody to bow to the ground in admiration. And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road, watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes and princesses.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day or so she began to change her tune.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really DID admire \"Gipsy\" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the second day, when Lily said: \"Oh, Annie, do you know where I left my muff?\" William replied:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen, followed by his beloved.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Is it as late as that, mother?\" he said. She had been sitting alone.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Won't you go to bed, then?\" he asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Can't you trust us, mother?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven if you like, and I can read.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Go to bed, Gyp,\" he said to his girl. \"We won't keep mater waiting.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily,\" said Mrs. Morel; \"I think you will see.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs, and she went. He returned to the kitchen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Can't you trust us, mother?\" he repeated, rather offended.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother good-night.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his sweetheart endlessly with his mother.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then, when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's a queer sort of love to marry on,\" said Mrs. Morel, \"if she holds you no more than that!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It IS funny!\" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him. \"But yet\u2014there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know best,\" said Mrs. Morel. \"But if it is as you say, I wouldn't call it LOVE\u2014at any rate, it doesn't look much like it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings, to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother, to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think it will be a fine day.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looked up in surprise. This meant something.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm. Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers, and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I say, little woman, how lovely!\" he cried. \"And we'll go this afternoon?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green. And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust, splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still. The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside the warehouse all the morning, the boy had a vision of spring outside.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Are we going?\" he asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"When I'm ready,\" she replied.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently he got up.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Go and get dressed while I wash up,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes. But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they had been flowers.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly. She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, my stars!\" he exclaimed. \"What a bobby-dazzler!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!\" she replied. \"It's very quiet.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well,\" she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high and mighty, \"do you like it?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He went and surveyed her from the back.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well,\" he said, \"if I was walking down the street behind you, I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!\"'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, she doesn't,\" replied Mrs. Morel. \"She's not sure it suits her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending to know better.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well,\" she said, \"it's cost me just three shillings. You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I should think you couldn't,\" he replied.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And, you know, it's good stuff.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Awfully pretty,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid,\" she said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Too young for you!\" he exclaimed in disgust. \"Why don't you buy some false white hair and stick it on your head.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I s'll soon have no need,\" she replied. \"I'm going white fast enough.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, you've no business to,\" he said. \"What do I want with a white-haired mother?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad,\" she said rather strangely.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now look at that!\" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck, and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens. At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You sit a minute, mother,\" he said, and she took a seat on a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked, looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among their greenness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The world is a wonderful place,\" she said, \"and wonderfully beautiful.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And so's the pit,\" he said. \"Look how it heaps together, like something alive almost\u2014a big creature that you don't know.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes,\" she said. \"Perhaps!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts to be fed,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And very thankful I am they ARE standing,\" she said, \"for that means they'll turn middling time this week.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I like the feel of MEN on things, while they're alive. There's a feel of men about trucks, because they've been handled with men's hands, all of them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They went along under the trees of the highroad. He was constantly informing her, but she was interested. They passed the end of Nethermere, that was tossing its sunshine like petals lightly in its lap. Then they turned on a private road, and in some trepidation approached a big farm. A dog barked furiously. A woman came out to see.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Is this the way to Willey Farm?\" Mrs. Morel asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul hung behind in terror of being sent back. But the woman was amiable, and directed them. The mother and son went through the wheat and oats, over a little bridge into a wild meadow. Peewits, with their white breasts glistening, wheeled and screamed about them. The lake was still and blue. High overhead a heron floated. Opposite, the wood heaped on the hill, green and still.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's a wild road, mother,\" said Paul. \"Just like Canada.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Isn't it beautiful!\" said Mrs. Morel, looking round.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"See that heron\u2014see\u2014see her legs?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He directed his mother, what she must see and what not. And she was quite content.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But now,\" she said, \"which way? He told me through the wood.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wood, fenced and dark, lay on their left.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I can feel a bit of a path this road,\" said Paul. \"You've got town feet, somehow or other, you have.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They found a little gate, and soon were in a broad green alley of the wood, with a new thicket of fir and pine on one hand, an old oak glade dipping down on the other. And among the oaks the bluebells stood in pools of azure, under the new green hazels, upon a pale fawn floor of oak-leaves. He found flowers for her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Here's a bit of new-mown hay,\" he said; then, again, he brought her forget-me-nots. And, again, his heart hurt with love, seeing her hand, used with work, holding the little bunch of flowers he gave her. She was perfectly happy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But at the end of the riding was a fence to climb. Paul was over in a second.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Come,\" he said, \"let me help you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, go away. I will do it in my own way.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stood below with his hands up ready to help her. She climbed cautiously.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What a way to climb!\" he exclaimed scornfully, when she was safely to earth again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hateful stiles!\" she cried.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Duffer of a little woman,\" he replied, \"who can't get over 'em.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In front, along the edge of the wood, was a cluster of low red farm buildings. The two hastened forward. Flush with the wood was the apple orchard, where blossom was falling on the grindstone. The pond was deep under a hedge and overhanging oak trees. Some cows stood in the shade. The farm and buildings, three sides of a quadrangle, embraced the sunshine towards the wood. It was very still.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mother and son went into the small railed garden, where was a scent of red gillivers. By the open door were some floury loaves, put out to cool. A hen was just coming to peck them. Then, in the doorway suddenly appeared a girl in a dirty apron. She was about fourteen years old, had a rosy dark face, a bunch of short black curls, very fine and free, and dark eyes; shy, questioning, a little resentful of the strangers, she disappeared. In a minute another figure appeared, a small, frail woman, rosy, with great dark brown eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh!\" she exclaimed, smiling with a little glow, \"you've come, then. I AM glad to see you.\" Her voice was intimate and rather sad.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two women shook hands.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now are you sure we're not a bother to you?\" said Mrs. Morel. \"I know what a farming life is.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh no! We're only too thankful to see a new face, it's so lost up here.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They were taken through into the parlour\u2014a long, low room, with a great bunch of guelder-roses in the fireplace. There the women talked, whilst Paul went out to survey the land. He was in the garden smelling the gillivers and looking at the plants, when the girl came out quickly to the heap of coal which stood by the fence.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I suppose these are cabbage-roses?\" he said to her, pointing to the bushes along the fence.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She looked at him with startled, big brown eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I suppose they are cabbage-roses when they come out?\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't know,\" she faltered. \"They're white with pink middles.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Then they're maiden-blush.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miriam flushed. She had a beautiful warm colouring.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't know,\" she said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You don't have MUCH in your garden,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This is our first year here,\" she answered, in a distant, rather superior way, drawing back and going indoors. He did not notice, but went his round of exploration. Presently his mother came out, and they went through the buildings. Paul was hugely delighted.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And I suppose you have the fowls and calves and pigs to look after?\" said Mrs. Morel to Mrs. Leivers.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No,\" replied the little woman. \"I can't find time to look after cattle, and I'm not used to it. It's as much as I can do to keep going in the house.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I suppose it is,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently the girl came out.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tea is ready, mother,\" she said in a musical, quiet voice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, thank you, Miriam, then we'll come,\" replied her mother, almost ingratiatingly. \"Would you CARE to have tea now, Mrs. Morel?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Of course,\" said Mrs. Morel. \"Whenever it's ready.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul and his mother and Mrs. Leivers had tea together. Then they went out into the wood that was flooded with bluebells, while fumy forget-me-nots were in the paths. The mother and son were in ecstasy together.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When they got back to the house, Mr. Leivers and Edgar, the eldest son, were in the kitchen. Edgar was about eighteen. Then Geoffrey and Maurice, big lads of twelve and thirteen, were in from school. Mr. Leivers was a good-looking man in the prime of life, with a golden-brown moustache, and blue eyes screwed up against the weather.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The boys were condescending, but Paul scarcely observed it. They went round for eggs, scrambling into all sorts of places. As they were feeding the fowls Miriam came out. The boys took no notice of her. One hen, with her yellow chickens, was in a coop. Maurice took his hand full of corn and let the hen peck from it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Durst you do it?\" he asked of Paul.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Let's see,\" said Paul.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had a small hand, warm, and rather capable-looking. Miriam watched. He held the corn to the hen. The bird eyed it with her hard, bright eye, and suddenly made a peck into his hand. He started, and laughed. \"Rap, rap, rap!\" went the bird's beak in his palm. He laughed again, and the other boys joined.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She knocks you, and nips you, but she never hurts,\" said Paul, when the last corn had gone. \"Now, Miriam,\" said Maurice, \"you come an 'ave a go.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No,\" she cried, shrinking back.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ha! baby. The mardy-kid!\" said her brothers.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It doesn't hurt a bit,\" said Paul. \"It only just nips rather nicely.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No,\" she still cried, shaking her black curls and shrinking.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She dursn't,\" said Geoffrey. \"She niver durst do anything except recite poitry.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Dursn't jump off a gate, dursn't tweedle, dursn't go on a slide, dursn't stop a girl hittin' her. She can do nowt but go about thinkin' herself somebody. 'The Lady of the Lake.' Yah!\" cried Maurice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miriam was crimson with shame and misery.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I dare do more than you,\" she cried. \"You're never anything but cowards and bullies.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, cowards and bullies!\" they repeated mincingly, mocking her speech.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Not such a clown shall anger me,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A boor is answered silently,\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he quoted against her, shouting with laughter.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She went indoors. Paul went with the boys into the orchard, where they had rigged up a parallel bar. They did feats of strength. He was more agile than strong, but it served. He fingered a piece of apple-blossom that hung low on a swinging bough.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I wouldn't get the apple-blossom,\" said Edgar, the eldest brother. \"There'll be no apples next year.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I wasn't going to get it,\" replied Paul, going away.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The boys felt hostile to him; they were more interested in their own pursuits. He wandered back to the house to look for his mother. As he went round the back, he saw Miriam kneeling in front of the hen-coop, some maize in her hand, biting her lip, and crouching in an intense attitude. The hen was eyeing her wickedly. Very gingerly she put forward her hand. The hen bobbed for her. She drew back quickly with a cry, half of fear, half of chagrin.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It won't hurt you,\" said Paul.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She flushed crimson and started up.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I only wanted to try,\" she said in a low voice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"See, it doesn't hurt,\" he said, and, putting only two corns in his palm, he let the hen peck, peck, peck at his bare hand. \"It only makes you laugh,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She put her hand forward and dragged it away, tried again, and started back with a cry. He frowned.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, I'd let her take corn from my face,\" said Paul, \"only she bumps a bit. She's ever so neat. If she wasn't, look how much ground she'd peck up every day.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He waited grimly, and watched. At last Miriam let the bird peck from her hand. She gave a little cry\u2014fear, and pain because of fear\u2014rather pathetic. But she had done it, and she did it again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There, you see,\" said the boy. \"It doesn't hurt, does it?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She looked at him with dilated dark eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No,\" she laughed, trembling.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then she rose and went indoors. She seemed to be in some way resentful of the boy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He thinks I'm only a common girl,\" she thought, and she wanted to prove she was a grand person like the \"Lady of the Lake\".\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul found his mother ready to go home. She smiled on her son. He took the great bunch of flowers. Mr. and Mrs. Leivers walked down the fields with them. The hills were golden with evening; deep in the woods showed the darkening purple of bluebells. It was everywhere perfectly stiff, save for the rustling of leaves and birds.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But it is a beautiful place,\" said Mrs. Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes,\" answered Mr. Leivers; \"it's a nice little place, if only it weren't for the rabbits. The pasture's bitten down to nothing. I dunno if ever I s'll get the rent off it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He clapped his hands, and the field broke into motion near the woods, brown rabbits hopping everywhere.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Would you believe it!\" exclaimed Mrs. Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She and Paul went on alone together.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Wasn't it lovely, mother?\" he said quietly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A thin moon was coming out. His heart was full of happiness till it hurt. His mother had to chatter, because she, too, wanted to cry with happiness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now WOULDN'T I help that man!\" she said. \"WOULDN'T I see to the fowls and the young stock! And I'D learn to milk, and I'D talk with him, and I'D plan with him. My word, if I were his wife, the farm would be run, I know! But there, she hasn't the strength\u2014she simply hasn't the strength. She ought never to have been burdened like it, you know. I'm sorry for her, and I'm sorry for him too. My word, if I'D had him, I shouldn't have thought him a bad husband! Not that she does either; and she's very lovable.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0William came home again with his sweetheart at the Whitsuntide. He had one week of his holidays then. It was beautiful weather. As a rule, William and Lily and Paul went out in the morning together for a walk. William did not talk to his beloved much, except to tell her things from his boyhood. Paul talked endlessly to both of them. They lay down, all three, in a meadow by Minton Church. On one side, by the Castle Farm, was a beautiful quivering screen of poplars. Hawthorn was dropping from the hedges; penny daisies and ragged robin were in the field, like laughter. William, a big fellow of twenty-three, thinner now and even a bit gaunt, lay back in the sunshine and dreamed, while she fingered with his hair. Paul went gathering the big daisies. She had taken off her hat; her hair was black as a horse's mane. Paul came back and threaded daisies in her jet-black hair\u2014big spangles of white and yellow, and just a pink touch of ragged robin.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now you look like a young witch-woman,\" the boy said to her. \"Doesn't she, William?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lily laughed. William opened his eyes and looked at her. In his gaze was a certain baffled look of misery and fierce appreciation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Has he made a sight of me?\" she asked, laughing down on her lover.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That he has!\" said William, smiling.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looked at her. Her beauty seemed to hurt him. He glanced at her flower-decked head and frowned.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You look nice enough, if that's what you want to know,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she walked without her hat. In a little while William recovered, and was rather tender to her. Coming to a bridge, he carved her initials and his in a heart.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0L. L. W. W. M.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She watched his strong, nervous hand, with its glistening hairs and freckles, as he carved, and she seemed fascinated by it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the time there was a feeling of sadness and warmth, and a certain tenderness in the house, whilst William and Lily were at home. But often he got irritable. She had brought, for an eight-days' stay, five dresses and six blouses.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, would you mind,\" she said to Annie, \"washing me these two blouses, and these things?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Annie stood washing when William and Lily went out the next morning. Mrs. Morel was furious. And sometimes the young man, catching a glimpse of his sweetheart's attitude towards his sister, hated her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On Sunday morning she looked very beautiful in a dress of foulard, silky and sweeping, and blue as a jay-bird's feather, and in a large cream hat covered with many roses, mostly crimson. Nobody could admire her enough. But in the evening, when she was going out, she asked again:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Chubby, have you got my gloves?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Which?\" asked William.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My new black SUEDE.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a hunt. She had lost them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Look here, mother,\" said William, \"that's the fourth pair she's lost since Christmas\u2014at five shillings a pair!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You only gave me TWO of them,\" she remonstrated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And in the evening, after supper, he stood on the hearthrug whilst she sat on the sofa, and he seemed to hate her. In the afternoon he had left her whilst he went to see some old friend. She had sat looking at a book. After supper William wanted to write a letter.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Here is your book, Lily,\" said Mrs. Morel. \"Would you care to go on with it for a few minutes?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, thank you,\" said the girl. \"I will sit still.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But it is so dull.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0William scribbled irritably at a great rate. As he sealed the envelope he said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Read a book! Why, she's never read a book in her life.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, go along!\" said Mrs. Morel, cross with the exaggeration,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's true, mother\u2014she hasn't,\" he cried, jumping up and taking his old position on the hearthrug. \"She's never read a book in her life.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"'Er's like me,\" chimed in Morel. \"'Er canna see what there is i' books, ter sit borin' your nose in 'em for, nor more can I.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But you shouldn't say these things,\" said Mrs. Morel to her son.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But it's true, mother\u2014she CAN'T read. What did you give her?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I gave her a little thing of Annie Swan's. Nobody wants to read dry stuff on Sunday afternoon.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I'll bet she didn't read ten lines of it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You are mistaken,\" said his mother.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the time Lily sat miserably on the sofa. He turned to her swiftly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"DID you read any?\" he asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I did,\" she replied.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How much?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't know how many pages.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tell me ONE THING you read.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She could not.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She never got beyond the second page. He read a great deal, and had a quick, active intelligence. She could understand nothing but love-making and chatter. He was accustomed to having all his thoughts sifted through his mother's mind; so, when he wanted companionship, and was asked in reply to be the billing and twittering lover, he hated his betrothed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, mother,\" he said, when he was alone with her at night, \"she's no idea of money, she's so wessel-brained. When she's paid, she'll suddenly buy such rot as marrons glaces, and then I have to buy her season ticket, and her extras, even her underclothing. And she wants to get married, and I think myself we might as well get married next year. But at this rate\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A fine mess of a marriage it would be,\" replied his mother. \"I should consider it again, my boy.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, well, I've gone too far to break off now,\" he said, \"and so I shall get married as soon as I can.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Very well, my boy. If you will, you will, and there's no stopping you; but I tell you, I can't sleep when I think about it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, she'll be all right, mother. We shall manage.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And she lets you buy her underclothing?\" asked the mother.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well,\" he began apologetically, \"she didn't ask me; but one morning\u2014and it WAS cold\u2014I found her on the station shivering, not able to keep still; so I asked her if she was well wrapped up. She said: 'I think so.' So I said: 'Have you got warm underthings on?' And she said: 'No, they were cotton.' I asked her why on earth she hadn't got something thicker on in weather like that, and she said because she HAD nothing. And there she is\u2014a bronchial subject! I HAD to take her and get some warm things. Well, mother, I shouldn't mind the money if we had any. And, you know, she OUGHT to keep enough to pay for her season-ticket; but no, she comes to me about that, and I have to find the money.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's a poor lookout,\" said Mrs. Morel bitterly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was pale, and his rugged face, that used to be so perfectly careless and laughing, was stamped with conflict and despair.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I can't give her up now; it's gone too far,\" he said. \"And, besides, for SOME things I couldn't do without her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My boy, remember you're taking your life in your hands,\" said Mrs. Morel. \"NOTHING is as bad as a marriage that's a hopeless failure. Mine was bad enough, God knows, and ought to teach you something; but it might have been worse by a long chalk.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He leaned with his back against the side of the chimney-piece, his hands in his pockets. He was a big, raw-boned man, who looked as if he would go to the world's end if he wanted to. But she saw the despair on his face.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I couldn't give her up now,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well,\" she said, \"remember there are worse wrongs than breaking off an engagement.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I can't give her up NOW,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The clock ticked on; mother and son remained in silence, a conflict between them; but he would say no more. At last she said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, go to bed, my son. You'll feel better in the morning, and perhaps you'll know better.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He kissed her, and went. She raked the fire. Her heart was heavy now as it had never been. Before, with her husband, things had seemed to be breaking down in her, but they did not destroy her power to live. Now her soul felt lamed in itself. It was her hope that was struck.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so often William manifested the same hatred towards his betrothed. On the last evening at home he was railing against her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well,\" he said, \"if you don't believe me, what she's like, would you believe she has been confirmed three times?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Nonsense!\" laughed Mrs. Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Nonsense or not, she HAS! That's what confirmation means for her\u2014a bit of a theatrical show where she can cut a figure.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I haven't, Mrs. Morel!\" cried the girl\u2014\"I haven't! it is not true!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What!\" he cried, flashing round on her. \"Once in Bromley, once in Beckenham, and once somewhere else.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Nowhere else!\" she said, in tears\u2014\"nowhere else!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It WAS! And if it wasn't why were you confirmed TWICE?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Once I was only fourteen, Mrs. Morel,\" she pleaded, tears in her eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Morel; \"I can quite understand it, child. Take no notice of him. You ought to be ashamed, William, saying such things.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But it's true. She's religious\u2014she had blue velvet Prayer-Books\u2014and she's not as much religion, or anything else, in her than that table-leg. Gets confirmed three times for show, to show herself off, and that's how she is in EVERYTHING\u2014EVERYTHING!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The girl sat on the sofa, crying. She was not strong.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As for LOVE!\" he cried, \"you might as well ask a fly to love you! It'll love settling on you\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, say no more,\" commanded Mrs. Morel. \"If you want to say these things, you must find another place than this. I am ashamed of you, William! Why don't you be more manly. To do nothing but find fault with a girl, and then pretend you're engaged to her!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Morel subsided in wrath and indignation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0William was silent, and later he repented, kissed and comforted the girl. Yet it was true, what he had said. He hated her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When they were going away, Mrs. Morel accompanied them as far as Nottingham. It was a long way to Keston station.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, mother,\" he said to her, \"Gyp's shallow. Nothing goes deep with her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"William, I WISH you wouldn't say these things,\" said Mrs. Morel, very uncomfortable for the girl who walked beside her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But it doesn't, mother. She's very much in love with me now, but if I died she'd have forgotten me in three months.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Morel was afraid. Her heart beat furiously, hearing the quiet bitterness of her son's last speech.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How do you know?\" she replied. \"You DON'T know, and therefore you've no right to say such a thing.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He's always saying these things!\" cried the girl.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In three months after I was buried you'd have somebody else, and I should be forgotten,\" he said. \"And that's your love!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Morel saw them into the train in Nottingham, then she returned home.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There's one comfort,\" she said to Paul\u2014\"he'll never have any money to marry on, that I AM sure of. And so she'll save him that way.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So she took cheer. Matters were not yet very desperate. She firmly believed William would never marry his Gipsy. She waited, and she kept Paul near to her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All summer long William's letters had a feverish tone; he seemed unnatural and intense. Sometimes he was exaggeratedly jolly, usually he was flat and bitter in his letter.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah,\" his mother said, \"I'm afraid he's ruining himself against that creature, who isn't worthy of his love\u2014no, no more than a rag doll.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He wanted to come home. The midsummer holiday was gone; it was a long while to Christmas. He wrote in wild excitement, saying he could come for Saturday and Sunday at Goose Fair, the first week in October.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You are not well, my boy,\" said his mother, when she saw him. She was almost in tears at having him to herself again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, I've not been well,\" he said. \"I've seemed to have a dragging cold all the last month, but it's going, I think.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was sunny October weather. He seemed wild with joy, like a schoolboy escaped; then again he was silent and reserved. He was more gaunt than ever, and there was a haggard look in his eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You are doing too much,\" said his mother to him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was doing extra work, trying to make some money to marry on, he said. He only talked to his mother once on the Saturday night; then he was sad and tender about his beloved.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And yet, you know, mother, for all that, if I died she'd be broken-hearted for two months, and then she'd start to forget me. You'd see, she'd never come home here to look at my grave, not even once.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, William,\" said his mother, \"you're not going to die, so why talk about it?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But whether or not\u2014\" he replied.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And she can't help it. She is like that, and if you choose her\u2014well, you can't grumble,\" said his mother.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the Sunday morning, as he was putting his collar on:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Look,\" he said to his mother, holding up his chin, \"what a rash my collar's made under my chin!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just at the junction of chin and throat was a big red inflammation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It ought not to do that,\" said his mother. \"Here, put a bit of this soothing ointment on. You should wear different collars.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He went away on Sunday midnight, seeming better and more solid for his two days at home.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On Tuesday morning came a telegram from London that he was ill. Mrs. Morel got off her knees from washing the floor, read the telegram, called a neighbour, went to her landlady and borrowed a sovereign, put on her things, and set off. She hurried to Keston, caught an express for London in Nottingham. She had to wait in Nottingham nearly an hour. A small figure in her black bonnet, she was anxiously asking the porters if they knew how to get to Elmers End. The journey was three hours. She sat in her corner in a kind of stupor, never moving. At King's Cross still no one could tell her how to get to Elmers End. Carrying her string bag, that contained her nightdress, a comb and brush, she went from person to person. At last they sent her underground to Cannon Street.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was six o'clock when she arrived at William's lodging. The blinds were not down.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How is he?\" she asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No better,\" said the landlady.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She followed the woman upstairs. William lay on the bed, with bloodshot eyes, his face rather discoloured. The clothes were tossed about, there was no fire in the room, a glass of milk stood on the stand at his bedside. No one had been with him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, my son!\" said the mother bravely.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He did not answer. He looked at her, but did not see her. Then he began to say, in a dull voice, as if repeating a letter from dictation: \"Owing to a leakage in the hold of this vessel, the sugar had set, and become converted into rock. It needed hacking\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was quite unconscious. It had been his business to examine some such cargo of sugar in the Port of London.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How long has he been like this?\" the mother asked the landlady.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He got home at six o'clock on Monday morning, and he seemed to sleep all day; then in the night we heard him talking, and this morning he asked for you. So I wired, and we fetched the doctor.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Will you have a fire made?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Morel tried to soothe her son, to keep him still.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doctor came. It was pneumonia, and, he said, a peculiar erysipelas, which had started under the chin where the collar chafed, and was spreading over the face. He hoped it would not get to the brain.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Morel settled down to nurse. She prayed for William, prayed that he would recognise her. But the young man's face grew more discoloured. In the night she struggled with him. He raved, and raved, and would not come to consciousness. At two o'clock, in a dreadful paroxysm, he died.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Morel sat perfectly still for an hour in the lodging bedroom; then she roused the household.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At six o'clock, with the aid of the charwoman, she laid him out; then she went round the dreary London village to the registrar and the doctor.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At nine o'clock to the cottage on Scargill Street came another wire:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"William died last night. Let father come, bring money.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annie, Paul, and Arthur were at home; Mr. Morel was gone to work. The three children said not a word. Annie began to whimper with fear; Paul set off for his father.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a beautiful day. At Brinsley pit the white steam melted slowly in the sunshine of a soft blue sky; the wheels of the headstocks twinkled high up; the screen, shuffling its coal into the trucks, made a busy noise.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I want my father; he's got to go to London,\" said the boy to the first man he met on the bank.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tha wants Walter Morel? Go in theer an' tell Joe Ward.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul went into the little top office.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I want my father; he's got to go to London.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thy feyther? Is he down? What's his name?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mr. Morel.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What, Walter? Is owt amiss?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He's got to go to London.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The man went to the telephone and rang up the bottom office.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Walter Morel's wanted, number 42, Hard. Summat's amiss; there's his lad here.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then he turned round to Paul.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He'll be up in a few minutes,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul wandered out to the pit-top. He watched the chair come up, with its wagon of coal. The great iron cage sank back on its rest, a full carfle was hauled off, an empty tram run on to the chair, a bell ting'ed somewhere, the chair heaved, then dropped like a stone.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul did not realise William was dead; it was impossible, with such a bustle going on. The puller-off swung the small truck on to the turn-table, another man ran with it along the bank down the curving lines.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And William is dead, and my mother's in London, and what will she be doing?\" the boy asked himself, as if it were a conundrum.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He watched chair after chair come up, and still no father. At last, standing beside a wagon, a man's form! the chair sank on its rests, Morel stepped off. He was slightly lame from an accident.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Is it thee, Paul? Is 'e worse?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You've got to go to London.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two walked off the pit-bank, where men were watching curiously. As they came out and went along the railway, with the sunny autumn field on one side and a wall of trucks on the other, Morel said in a frightened voice:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"'E's niver gone, child?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"When wor't?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Last night. We had a telegram from my mother.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morel walked on a few strides, then leaned up against a truck-side, his hand over his eyes. He was not crying. Paul stood looking round, waiting. On the weighing machine a truck trundled slowly. Paul saw everything, except his father leaning against the truck as if he were tired.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morel had only once before been to London. He set off, scared and peaked, to help his wife. That was on Tuesday. The children were left alone in the house. Paul went to work, Arthur went to school, and Annie had in a friend to be with her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On Saturday night, as Paul was turning the corner, coming home from Keston, he saw his mother and father, who had come to Sethley Bridge Station. They were walking in silence in the dark, tired, straggling apart. The boy waited.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mother!\" he said, in the darkness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Morel's small figure seemed not to observe. He spoke again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Paul!\" she said, uninterestedly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She let him kiss her, but she seemed unaware of him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the house she was the same\u2014small, white, and mute. She noticed nothing, she said nothing, only:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The coffin will be here to-night, Walter. You'd better see about some help.\" Then, turning to the children: \"We're bringing him home.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then she relapsed into the same mute looking into space, her hands folded on her lap. Paul, looking at her, felt he could not breathe. The house was dead silent.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I went to work, mother,\" he said plaintively.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you?\" she answered, dully.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After half an hour Morel, troubled and bewildered, came in again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Wheer s'll we ha'e him when he DOES come?\" he asked his wife.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In the front-room.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Then I'd better shift th' table?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"An' ha'e him across th' chairs?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know there\u2014Yes, I suppose so.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morel and Paul went, with a candle, into the parlour. There was no gas there. The father unscrewed the top of the big mahogany oval table, and cleared the middle of the room; then he arranged six chairs opposite each other, so that the coffin could stand on their beds.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You niver seed such a length as he is!\" said the miner, and watching anxiously as he worked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul went to the bay window and looked out. The ash-tree stood monstrous and black in front of the wide darkness. It was a faintly luminous night. Paul went back to his mother.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At ten o'clock Morel called:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He's here!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everyone started. There was a noise of unbarring and unlocking the front door, which opened straight from the night into the room.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Bring another candle,\" called Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annie and Arthur went. Paul followed with his mother. He stood with his arm round her waist in the inner doorway. Down the middle of the cleared room waited six chairs, face to face. In the window, against the lace curtains, Arthur held up one candle, and by the open door, against the night, Annie stood leaning forward, her brass candlestick glittering.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was the noise of wheels. Outside in the darkness of the street below Paul could see horses and a black vehicle, one lamp, and a few pale faces; then some men, miners, all in their shirt-sleeves, seemed to struggle in the obscurity. Presently two men appeared, bowed beneath a great weight. It was Morel and his neighbour.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Steady!\" called Morel, out of breath.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He and his fellow mounted the steep garden step, heaved into the candlelight with their gleaming coffin-end. Limbs of other men were seen struggling behind. Morel and Burns, in front, staggered; the great dark weight swayed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Steady, steady!\" cried Morel, as if in pain.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the six bearers were up in the small garden, holding the great coffin aloft. There were three more steps to the door. The yellow lamp of the carriage shone alone down the black road.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now then!\" said Morel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The coffin swayed, the men began to mount the three steps with their load. Annie's candle flickered, and she whimpered as the first men appeared, and the limbs and bowed heads of six men struggled to climb into the room, bearing the coffin that rode like sorrow on their living flesh.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, my son\u2014my son!\" Mrs. Morel sang softly, and each time the coffin swung to the unequal climbing of the men: \"Oh, my son\u2014my son\u2014my son!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mother!\" Paul whimpered, his hand round her waist.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She did not hear.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, my son\u2014my son!\" she repeated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul saw drops of sweat fall from his father's brow. Six men were in the room\u2014six coatless men, with yielding, struggling limbs, filling the room and knocking against the furniture. The coffin veered, and was gently lowered on to the chairs. The sweat fell from Morel's face on its boards.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My word, he's a weight!\" said a man, and the five miners sighed, bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again, closing the door behind them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box. William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses. It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves in the warmth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off. All the way home in the train she had said to herself: \"If only it could have been me!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting, her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight. Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch of a colliery at work was beautiful.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove him almost insane to have her thus. At last:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What's a-matter, mother?\" he asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She did not hear.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What's a-matter?\" he persisted. \"Mother, what's a-matter?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know what's the matter,\" she said irritably, turning away.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The lad\u2014he was sixteen years old\u2014went to bed drearily. He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December. His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him, and her heart stood still.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What's the matter?\" she asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm badly, mother!\" he replied. \"Mr. Jordan gave me five shillings for a Christmas-box!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You aren't glad!\" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Where hurts you?\" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was the old question.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I feel badly, mother.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously, the doctor said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let him go to Nottingham?\" was one of the first things she asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He might not have been so bad,\" said the doctor.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I should have watched the living, not the dead,\" she told herself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him; they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached. One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last flare of struggle, like madness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I s'll die, mother!\" he cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, my son\u2014my son!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease of her for love.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"For some things,\" said his aunt, \"it was a good thing Paul was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile. His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips. They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had a letter at the New Year.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there, and I enjoyed myself thoroughly,\" said the letter. \"I had every dance\u2014did not sit out one.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze, staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state. But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone, past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided the cemetery.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/2850001", "artist_names": "Unknown Author (Ft.

The characters and events which it celebrates are altogether of native origin, nor has any parallel or counterpart been discovered in any other language.\n\nIt abounds in allusions to traditions of personages and incidents belonging to a remote period, and, though it is true that some few of these have now become obscure or unintelligible, yet many are, even to the present day, current in the principality. Of a much greater number, though all distinct recollection has ceased to exist, yet the frequent references made to them in Bardic and other remains, prove that, to our ancestors at least, they were well known; and so numerous are the instances we meet with of this class, that we may safely infer that all the allusions this Mabinogi contains were generally familiar to those for whom it was designed.\n\nBeyond the adventures here ascribed to him, no particulars of the hero Kilhwch mab Kilydd mab Kelyddon have come down to us.\n\n\n217b ANLAWDD WLEDIG.--Page 217.\nTHE name of this prince occurs in the Pedigrees as being father of Tywynwedd the mother of Tyvrydog mab Arwystli Gloff. Tyvrydog was a saint who flourished in the sixth century. (Rees's Welsh Saints, p. 276.) In the Pedigrees, Tywynwedd is mentioned as the mother of Caradawc Vreichvras, of Gwyn ab Nudd, and Gwallawc ab Lleenawg.\n\nEigr, the fair Ygraine of romance and mother of King Arthur, is likewise said to have been the daughter of Anlawdd, by Gwen, the daughter of Cunedda Wledig. This explains the relationship between Kilhwch and Arthur.\n\n\n\n218a KING DOGGED.--Page 218.\n\nTHE name of this most unfortunate king is enrolled among the number of the Saints of Wales, and he is recorded as the founder or the church of Llauddogged in Denbighshire. King Dogged was the son of Cedig ab Ceredig 1 ab Cunedda. Wledig, and brother of Avan Buallt, a bishop, whose tomb still remains at the church of Llanavan Fawr, in Breconshire, which he founded. The date assigned to these brothers is from 500 to 542.--Rees's Welsh Saints, p. 209.\n\n\n\n219a OLWEN.--Page 219.\n\nOF Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr, but little is now known beyond what is related concerning her in the present tale; but with the bards of old her beauty had passed into a proverb. Amongst those who made frequent allusion to her charms, we may instance Davydd ap Gwilym, the Petrarch of Wales; and Sion Brwynog, a poet who flourished in the sixteenth century, commences some complimentary verses addressed to a young damsel, by comparing her to\n\n\"Olwen of slender eyebrow, pure of heart.\"\n\n\n\n219b CUT THY HAIR.--Page 219.\n\nIN the eighth century, it was the custom of people of consideration to have their children's hair cut the first time by persons for whom they had a particular honour and esteem, who in virtue of this ceremony were reputed a sort of spiritual parents, or godfathers to them. This practice appears, however, to have been still more ancient, inasmuch as we read that Constantine sent the Pope the hair of his son Heraclius, as a token that he desired him to be his adoptive father.--See Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia.\n\n\n219c A HUNDRED KINE.--Page 219.\n\nIT appears that in early times cows formed the standard of currency among the Welsh; for in the laws of Howel Dda, after a certain enactment concerning the payment of fines, the following remark is added, \"For with cows all payments were made formerly.\" And the price of a cow is stated to be forty pence.\n\nThe Liber Landavensis furnishes numerous examples of the custom of resorting to this method of valuation. Amongst others may be instanced the case of Brychan, the son of Gwyngon, who bought three uncias of land, on which three villages were situated, \"for seven horses of the value of twenty-eight cows, and the whole apparel of one man of the value of fourteen cows, and a sword of the value of twelve cows, and a hawk of the value of six cows, with four dogs of the value of fourteen cows,\" p. 456. This property, consisting of about 324 acres, was purchased by him to present to the Church of Llandaff, in the time of Bishop Trychan, who is supposed to have lived about the early part of the seventh century.\n\n\n\n220a PENGWAED IN CORNWALL.--Page 220.\n\nPENGWAED is the Land's End. In the Triad on the three divisions of Britain, it is named as the extreme point to the south of the island, which was distant nine hundred miles from Penrhyn Blathaon, supposed to be Caithness in North Britain.--Triad ii.\n\n\n\n222a SAVE ONLY MY SHIP AND MY MANTLE.--Page 222.\n\nARTHUR'S ship is mentioned several times in the course of the present tale. Its name was Prydwen, and under that appellation it is alluded to by Taliesin in his Preidden Annwn, 1 the Spoils of Hell. In that mystical poem, which appears to be full of allusions to traditions now no longer intelligible, various expeditions, consisting of as many warriors as would have thrice filled Prydwen, are represented as setting forth on different enterprises, from each of which only seven returned.\n\nThe ancient chroniclers speak of these treasures of Arthur's with due reverence. Sometimes, however, they bestow the name of Prydwen on his shield instead of his ship. Thus old Robert of Gloucester, in the following quaint description,\n\n\u00dee kynn, was aboue yarmed wy\u00fe haubert noble & r\u1e8fche,\nw\u1e8f\u00fe helm of gold on ys heued, (nas nour h\u1e8fm \u1e8fl\u1e8fche)\n\u00dee fourme of a dragon \u00feeron was ycast.\nHys sseld, \u00feat het Prydwen, was \u00feanne \u1e8fhonge wast\nAboute ys ssoldren, and \u00feeron \u1e8fpeynt was and \u1e8fwort\n\u00dee \u1e8fmage of our Lady, inwan was al ys \u00feo\u0292t.\nM\u1e8fd \u1e8fs suerd he was \u1e8fgurd, \u00feat so strong was & kene,\nCal\u1e8fbourne yt was \u1e8fcluped, nas nour no such ye wene.\nIn ys r\u1e8f\u0292t hond \u1e8fs lance he nom, pat ycluped was Ron,\nLong & gret & strong ynow, hym ne m\u1e8f\u0292t atsytte non.\nI. 174.\nGruffydd ab Arthur's account of King Arthur's arms agrees with this; but respecting his sword Caledvwlch, or Caleburn, he adds the information that it was formed in the Isle of Avallon. 1 It has already been detailed in a previous portion of this work (p. 32), how Arthur finding himself mortally wounded at the battle of Camlan, confided his sword to one of his knights, charging him to cast it into the lake, and how when the knight proceeded to fulfil his behest, a hand and arm arose from the water, and seizing the precious weapon, brandished it three times, and disappeared with it in the lake. This circumstance must have been unknown to Richard the First, or he would hardly have sent to Tancred, King of Sicily, as a valuable present, a sword which was supposed to have been the, sword of Arthur. 2\n\nThe Llenn, here rendered, the Mantle, but which appears to have served sometimes as a covering, and sometimes as a carpet, was celebrated as one of the thirteen precious things of the Island of Britain. Its property was to render invisible any one who was either under or upon it, while everything around was visible to him. In another Mabinogi it is said to have been called Gwenn.\n\n\n\n223a GREIDAWL GALLDONYD, OR GALLDOVYDD.--Page 223.\n\nONE of the three architects of the island of Britain, whose privilege it was to go wheresoever they would, so that they did not go unlawfully.--Triad 32.\n\n\n\n223b GWYTHYR THE SON OF GREIDAWL.--Page 223.\n\nThis warrior, whose grave is noticed in the Englynion Beddau, (see p. 33), was father to one of the three wives of Arthur, who all bore the name of Gwenhwyvar. 1\n\nIt is he that fights with Gwyn ab Nudd, for the fair Cordelia, every first of May. 2\n\n\n\n223c GWYN THE SON OF NUDD.--Page 223.\n\nIN Gwyn ab Nudd, we become acquainted with one of the most poetical characters of Welsh romance. He is no less a personage than the King of Faerie, a realm, the extent and importance of which is nowhere better appreciated, or held in greater reverence, than in Wales. Very numerous indeed are the subjects of Gwyn ab Nudd, and very various are they in their natures. He is the sovereign of those beneficent and joyous beings, the Tylwyth Teg, or Family of Beauty (sometimes also called Bendith i Mammau, or Blessing of Mothers), who dance in the moonlight on the velvet sward, in their airy and flowing robes of blue or green, or white or scarlet, and who delight in showering benefits on the more favoured of the human race; and equally does his authority extend over the fantastic, though no less picturesque class of Elves, who in Welsh bear the name of Ellyllon, and who, on the other hand, enjoy nothing so much as to mislead and torment the inhabitants of earth. Indeed, if Davydd ap Gwylim may be believed, Gwyn ab Nudd himself is not averse to indulging in a little mischievous amusement of this kind; for one dark night the bard, having ridden into a turf bog on the mountain, calls it the \"Fishpond of Gwyn ab Nudd, a palace for goblins and their tribe,\" to whom he evidently gives credit for having decoyed him into its mire. Perhaps he may have been tempted to exclaim like Shakespeare,\n\n\"Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy.\"\n\nAccording to the same testimony, the Owl was more particularly considered as the bird of Gwyn ab Nudd.\n\nThere is, in the Myvyrian Archaiology, a dialogue between Gwyn ab Nudd, and Gwyddno Garanhir, 3 in which he is represented as a victorious warrior. Gwyddno apostrophizes him thus,\n\n\"Gwyn, son of Nudd, the hope of armies, legions fall before thy conquering arm, swifter than broken rushes to the ground.\"\n\nIn the same composition, Gwyn ab Nudd styles himself the lover of Cordelia the daughter of Ludd, or Lear, for whom his contest with Gwythyr mab Greidawl, on every first of May till the day of doom, is recorded in the text; he also mentions that Karngrwn was the name of his horse.\n\nThe Triads commemorate Gwyn ab Nudd, as one of the three distinguished astronomers of the Island of Britain, who by their knowledge of the nature and qualities of the stars, could predict whatever was wished to be known to the end of the world. 1\n\nA very curious legend, in which Gwynn ab Nudd bears a conspicuous part, is contained in the Life of St. Collen (Buchedd Collen), which is printed in a collection of Welsh remains, entitled the Greal. 2 This Saint was the son of Gwynawc, ab Caledawc, ab Cawrdav, ab Caradawc Vreichvras, and having distinguished himself greatly in foreign countries 3 by his zeal and piety, be returned to Britain and became Abbot of Glastonbury; after a time Collen desired to lead a life of greater austerity than his high office at Glastonbury permitted; so he departed thence, and went forth to preach to the people. The impiety, however, which he met with distressed him so much, that at length he withdrew to a mountain, \"where he made himself a cell under the shelter of a rock, in a remote and secluded spot.\n\n\"And as he was one day in his cell, he heard two men conversing about Gwyn ab Nudd, and saying that he was king of Annwn and of the Fairies. And Collen put his head out of his cell, and said to them, 'Hold your tongues quickly, those are but Devils.'--Hold thou thy tongue,' said they, I thou shalt receive a reproof from him.' And Collen shut his cell as before.\n\n\"And, soon after, he heard a knocking at the door of his cell, and some one inquired if he were within. Then said Collen, 'I am; who is it that asks?' 'It is I, a messenger from Gwyn ab Nudd, the king of Annwn, to command thee to come and speak with him on the top of the hill at noon.' 4\n\n\"But Collen did not go. And the next day behold the same messenger came, ordering Collen to go and speak with the king on the top of the hill at noon.\n\n\"But Collen did not go. And the third day behold the same messenger came, ordering Collen to go and speak with the king on the top of the hill at noon. 'And if thou dost not go, Collen, thou wilt be the worse for it.'\n\n\"Then Collen, being afraid, arose, and prepared some holy water, and put it in a flask at his side, and went to the top of the hill. And when he came there, he saw the fairest castle he had ever beheld, and around it the best appointed troops, and numbers of minstrels, and every kind of music of voice and string, and steeds with youths upon them the comeliest in the world, and maidens of elegant aspect, sprightly, light of foot, of graceful apparel, and in the bloom of youth; and every magnificence becoming the court of a puissant sovereign. And he beheld a courteous man on the top of the castle, who bade him enter, saying that the king was waiting for him to come to meat. And Collen went into the castle, and when he came there, the king was sitting in a golden chair. And he welcomed Collen honourably and desired him to eat, assuring him that, besides what he saw, he should have the most luxurious of every dainty and delicacy that the mind could desire, and should be supplied with every drink and liquor that his heart could wish; and that there should be in readiness for him every luxury of courtesy and service, of banquet and of honourable entertainment, of rank and of presents: and every respect and welcome due to a man of his wisdom.\n\n\"'I will not eat the leaves of the trees,' said Collen. 'Didst thou ever see men of better equipment than those in red and blue?' asked the king.\n\n\"'Their equipment is good enough,' said Collen, 'for such equipment as it is.'\n\n\"'What kind of equipment is that?' said the king.\n\n\"Then said Collen, 'The red on the one part signifies burning, and the blue on the other signifies coldness.' And with that Collen drew out his flask, and threw the holy water on their heads, whereupon they vanished from his sight, so that there was neither castle, nor troops, nor men, nor maidens, nor music, nor song, nor steeds, nor youth, nor banquet, nor the appearance of any thing whatever, but the green hillocks.\"\n\n\n\n223d EDEYRN THE SON OF NUDD.--Page 223.\n\nSee Page 195.\n\n\n\n223e GADWY THE SON OF GERAINT.--Page 223.\n\nGADWY MAB GERAINT was noticed for his courtesy to guests and strangers, as we learn from Triad xc.\n\n\n223f FFLEWDDUR FFLAM.--Page 223.\n\nA NOTICE concerning Flewddur Flam, occurs in Triad 114, where under the appellation of Fleidur Flam mab Godo he is ranked as one of the three sovereigns of Arthur's Court who preferred remaining with him as knights, although they had territories and dominion, of their own.--For this Triad, see the note on Cadyrnerth mab Porthawr Gandwy, p. 191.\n\n\n\n223g RHUAWN PEBYR.--Page 223.\n\nRHUAWN or Rhuvawn Pebyr stands conspicuous amongst those who distinguished themselves in the battle of Cattraeth. Aneurin says,--\n\n\"The warriors went to Caltraeth with marshalled array and shout of war,\nWith powerful steeds and dark blue harness, and with shields.\nThe spears were mustered--the piercing lances,\nThe glittering breastplates, and the swords.\nThe chieftain would penetrate through the host\nFive battalions fell before his blade.\nRhuvawn Hir--he gave gold to the altar,\nAnd gifts and precious jewels to the minstrel.\"\nGododin, Myv. Arch. I. p. 6.\n\nHis name occurs again in the same poem, as having approved himself an intrepid warrior, standing firm in the hour of battle.--Myv. Arch. I. p. 12.\n\nIt is said that he fell in battle, and that it is owing to the circumstance of his body having been redeemed for its weight in gold that he became recorded as one of the three golden corpses of the Island of Britain. 1\n\nHe is also spoken of with Rhun ab Maelgwn, and Owain ab Urien, as one of the Three blessed Kings; 2 and another Triad ranks him with the three imperious ones. 3 Other versions, however, of the same triad, read Rhun mab Einiawn, in the place of Rhuvawn Pebyr.\n\nThere is extant a poem composed by Hywel, the son of Owain Gwynedd, about 1160, and printed in the Myvyrian Archaiology, I. p. 277, which commences with these lines,--\n\nThe white wave mantled with foam, bedews the grave,\nThe resting place of Rhuvawn Pebyr, chief of kings.\"\n\nUpwards of a century after this, we find the grave of Rhuvawn mentioned by the bard, Gwilym Ddu, in a manner that makes it evident that its locality was then well known.--Myv.

It is there related that Coll ab Collfrewi was one of the three powerful swineherds of the Island of Britain, and that he kept the swine of Dallweir Dallben, in the valley of Dallwyr in Cornwall. And one of these swine, named Henwen, was with young, and it was prophesied that this circumstance would bring evil to the Island of Britain. So Arthur assembled his host and sought to destroy the swine; but she went burrowing along till she came to Penhyn Austin, where she plunged into the sea, and she landed again at Aberdarogi, in Gwent Iscoed. And all the way she went Coll ab Collfrewi held by her bristles, both by sea and by land, and at Maes Gwenith (Wheatfield) in Gwent, she left three grains of wheat and three bees, since which time the best wheat and the best honey have been in Gwent. And thence she went into Dyved, and there, at Llonnio Llonnwen, she left a grain of barley and a little pig; and Dyved has produced the best pigs and barley from that time to this. And from Dyved she went into Arvon, and she left a grain of rye at Lleyn in Arvon, and thenceforth the best rye has been found at Lleyn, and at Eivionydd. And by the side of Rhiwgyverthwch, she left a wolf cub and a young eaglet, and the wolf was given to Brynach Wyddel, of Dinas Affaraon, and the eagle to Benwaedd, the lord of Arllechwedd, and there was much talk concerning the wolf of Brynach, and the eagle of Benwaedd. And when she came to Maen Du in Arvon she left there a kitten, and Coll ab Collfrew, took it, and threw it into the Menai. But the sons of Palug in Mona (Anglesey), reared this kitten, to their cost; for it became the Palug Cat, which, we are told, was one of the three plagues of the Isle of Mona which were reared therein, the second being Daronwy, and the third, Edwin king of England.\n\nThese particulars are collected from the three series of Triads, printed in the Myvyrian Archaiology. The version given in the second series is the fullest of them.--Triad lvi.\n\nThis story is supposed to have a figurative meaning, and, under the appellation of Henwen, the sow of Dallweir Dallpen, to allude to some vessel that brought to this island various sorts of grain and animals not previously known here. Indeed, there is another triad, which attributes to Coll ab Collfrewi the introduction of wheat and barley into Britain, where only oats and rye were cultivated before his time.--Triad 56.\n\nColl ab Collfrewi, the keeper of this marvellous sow, was one of the chief enchanters of this island, and his magical arts were taught him by Rhuddlwm Gawr. It has already been suggested as probable that it is to him that Chaucer refers in his House of Fame, under the title of Coll Tragetour, or Coll the Juggler.--See p. 213.\n\n\n\n223o MENW THE SON OF TEIRGWAEDD.--Page 223.\n\nTHE part assigned to Menw ab Teirgwaedd in the present tale, is in precise accordance with the character in which he appears in the Triads, and other legendary remains of the Welsh. He is there commemorated as one of the three men of Phantasy and Illusion in the Island of Britain, and it is said that be taught his enchantments to Uthyr Pendragon, the father of King Arthur.--See p. 213.\n\nIn the Abergavenny Prize Essay, 1 on the Genuineness of the Coelbren y Beirdd, or Bardic Alphabet, by Mr. Taliesin Williams (Ab Iolo), there is a curious allegorical tale, which connects Menw with the discovery of that alphabet. The substance of the tale is as follows.--Einigan Gawr saw three rays of light, on which were inscribed all knowledge and science. And he took three rods of mountain ash, and inscribed all the sciences upon them, as it should seem in imitation of the three rays of light. And those who saw them, deified the rods, which so grieved Einigan, that he broke the rods and died. And after the space of a year and a day, Menw ab Teirgwaedd saw three rods growing out of the mouth of Einigan, and upon them was every kind of knowledge and science written. Then Menw took the three rods, and learned all the sciences, and taught them all, except the name of God, which has originated the Bardic secret, and blessed is he who possesses it.--P. 6.\n\nIt may be remarked that the Bardic symbol is formed of three radiating lines  which, it is said, are intended to represent the three diverging rays of light, which Einigan Gawr saw descending towards the earth; and it is somewhat curious that these three lines contain all the elements of the Bardic alphabet, as there is not a single letter in it that is not formed from them. No less singular is it, that this alphabet, which is alleged to have been only used upon wood (perhaps also implied by the three rods), is so constructed as altogether to avoid horizontal or circular lines, which could not be cut on wooden rods without splintering or running, on account of the grain of the wood.\n\nFor the proofs of the genuineness of this alphabet the reader is referred to the Essay itself.\n\n\n\n223p DRUDWAS THE SON OF TRYFFIN.--Page 223.\n\nCONCERNING Drudwas mab Tryffin, a curious tradition is presented in an interesting letter from the celebrated antiquary, Robert Vaughan, to Mr. Meredydd Lloyd, dated July 24th, 1655. It is printed in the Cambrian Register (III. p. 311). In the following extract we have that portion of it which relates to Drudwas.\n\n\"The story (or rather fable) of Adar Llwch guin, I have, but cannot finde it. The birds were two griffins, which were Drudwas ab Tryffin's birds, whoe had taught them to seise upon the first man that should enter into a certain fielde, and to kill him. It chanced, that having appointed a day to meete with King Arthur to fight a duell in the same fielde, he himselfe protracting the tyme of his coming soe long that he thought surely Arthur had come there long before, came first to the place, whereupon the birds presently fell upon him, and killed him; and they perceiving that he, whom they had killed was theire master, much lamented his death with fearfull screechings and mournfull cryings a long tyme; in memory whereof there is a lesson to be played upon the crowde, the which I have often heard played, which was made then, called Caniad Adar llwchgwin; and, to confirm this history in some parte, there's a British epigram extant, which I cannot remember, but, if you have the story and it, I pray you send it me.\"\n\nAccording to the Triads, Drudwas mab Tryffin was one of the three Golden-tongued Knights, whom no one could refuse whatsoever they might ask; Gwalchmai, and Eliwlod ab Madawc ab Uthur were the other two.--Triad 115.\n\n\n\n224a CAERDATHAL.--Page 224.\n\nCAERDATHAL, which the Mabinogion assign as a residence to Math ab Mathonwy, is in Caernarvonshire, and crowns the summit of all eminence near Llanrwst. It is peculiar for having large stones set upright to guard its entrance.\n\nThe name of this place occurs in Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr's Elegy on the death of his patron Owain Gwynedd, circa 1160. The passage in the Myvyrian Archaiology, I. p. 206, is imperfect, but the Cambro-Briton, II. p. 3, gives it in the following manner:--\n\n\"Around the region of Caer Dathal\nLay those whom the vultures had mangled,\nReddening the hill and the headland and the dale.\"\n\n\n\n224b KAW.--Page 224.\n\nCONSIDERABLE variations exist in the different catalogues which axe extant of the numerous sons of Kaw. In that, however, given by Jones, in his Welsh Bards, II. p. 22, the names exactly correspond with those in the text. Some of these personages are enumerated amongst the Saints of Wales, but of the individual history of the greater number little is known. Some account has already been given of one of the most eminent of them, Gildas mab Kaw, p. 1913. Huail, another of the brothers, obtained a less honourable notoriety for his vices which eventually cost him his life. Jones details the circumstances of his ignominious death, from the authority of Edward Llwyd, who derived them from a Welsh MS. in the handwriting of John Jones, of Gelli Lyfdy, dated June the 27th, 1611.\n\nFrom this account, it appears that Huail was imprudent enough to court a lady of whom Arthur was enamoured. The monarch's suspicions being aroused, and his jealousy excited, he armed himself secretly, and determined to observe the movements of his rival. Having watched him going to the lady's house, some angry words passed between them, and they fought. After a sharp combat, Huail got the better of Arthur, and wounded him severely in the thigh, whereupon the contest ceased, and reconciliation was made upon condition that Huail, under the penalty of losing his head, should never reproach Arthur with the advantage he had obtained over him. Arthur retired to his palace, which was then at Caerwys, in Flintshire, to be cured of his wound. He recovered, but it caused him to limp a little ever after.\n\nA short time after his recovery, Arthur fell in love with a lady at Rhuthyn, in Denbighshire, and, in order the more frequently to enjoy the pleasure of her society, he disguised himself in female attire. One day he was dancing with this lady, and her companions, when Huail happened to see him. He recognized him on account of his lameness, and said, \"This dancing might do very well, but for the thigh.\" It chanced that Arthur overheard his remark; he withdrew from the dance, and summoning Huail before him, upbraided him angrily for the breach of his promise and oath, and commanded him to be beheaded upon a stone, which lay in the street of the town, and which, from this event, acquired the appellation of Maen Huail. 1 This stone is still to be seen in the town of Rhuthyn.\n\nIn the Triads, Huail the son of Kaw of North Britain, Lord of Cwm Cawlwyd, is represented as one of the three Diademed Chiefs of Battle (Triad 69) and the Englynion y Clyweid appropriate a stanza to one of his Sayings--\n\nHast thou, heard what was Sung by Huail\nThe son of Kaw, whose saying was just?\nOften will a curse fall from the bosom.\"--\nMyv. Arch. I. p. 173.\n\n\n\n224c TALIESIN, THE CHIEF OF THE BARDS.--Page 224.\n\nTHE history of Taliesin, which is exceedingly wild and interesting, forms the subject of a separate Mabinogi, and as such will be given in its proper place.\n\n\n\n224d MANAWYDDAN THE SON OF LLYR.--Page 224.\n\nTHIS chieftain, who figures in the Triads, will be alluded to hereafter in the notes to one of the Mabinogion more particularly relating to him.\n\n\n\n224e GERAINT THE SON, OF ERBIN.--Page 224.\n\nOF this chieftain a full account has been given in the notes to the Mabinogi bearing his name.--It may be added that a saying of his is preserved in the Englynion y Clyweid: it is as follows:--\n\n\"Hast thou heard what Geraint sang,\nThe son of Erbin just and Skilful?\nShort-lived is the hater of the saints.\"--\nMyv. Arch. 1. p 172.\n\nGeraint's own designation of \"the friend of the saints\" (C\u00e2r i Saint) appears to be alluded to in this Englyn.--See Llyw. H\u00ean's Elegies.\n\n\n\n224f DYVEL THE SON OF ERBIN.--Page 224.\n\nTHE death of Dyvel mab Erbin is mentioned in the dialogue between Myrddin Wyllt and Taliesin, where the former says:--\n\n\"Through and through with rush and bound they came,\nYonder and still beyond, were Bran and Melgan seen approaching,\nAnd by them, at the battle's close,\nDyvel ab Erbin and his hosts were slain.\"--\nMyv. Arch. I. p. 48.\n\nHis grave was in the plains of Gwesledin.--Ib. I. p. 80.\n\n\n\n224g LLAWNRODDED VARVAWC.--Page 224.\n\nIN days when, as we have already seen (p. 219), the value of articles, even of luxury and ornament, was estimated by the number of cows they were worth, we cannot be surprised that the herdsmen were sometimes men of rank and distinction, and considered worthy to occupy a place in the Triads. Accordingly we find that the subject of the present note figured in those curious records, as one of the three Tribe Herdsmen of the Island of Britain. He tended the kine of Nudd Hael, the son of Senyllt, in whose herd were twenty-one thousand milch cows. The other two herdsmen (and they had each a like number of cows under their care) were Bennren, who kept the herd of Caradawc the son of Br\u00e2n and big tribe, in Gorwenydd in Glamorganshire; and Gwdion the son of Don, the celebrated enchanter, who kept the herd of the tribe of Gwynedd, above the Conwy.--Triad 85.\n\nHis own cow went by the name of Cornillo, and was one of the three chief cows of the Island.--Trioedd y Meirch, xi.\n\nOf the no less remarkable personages, who tended the swine of the Island of Britain, an account has already been given, p. 268.\n\nLlawnrodded's knife was one of the thirteen precious things possessing marvellous properties. It would serve four-and-twenty men at once with meat.\n\n\n\n224h MORVRAN THE SON OF TEGID.--Page 224.\n\nTHIS circumstance of the three warriors escaping from the battle of Camlan is related in the Triads, in words very nearly corresponding With those in the text. The two accounts differ only as regards the name of the third man, whom the Triad-, instead of Kynwyl Sant, represent to have been Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr, to whom, as King Arthur's Porter, we have already been introduced.--Triad 83.\n\nFrom the Hanes Taliesin, we learn that Morvran was the son of Tegid Voel and Ceridwen.\n\n\n225a LLENLLEAWG WYDDEL.--Page 225.\n\nTHIS name occurs in the Englynion y Clyweid.--\n\nHast thou heard what Llenlleawg Gwyddel sang,\nThe noble chief wearing the golden torques?\nThe grave is better than a life of want.\"--\nMyv.

There are four Triads relating to him, in all of which he is represented as a great benefactor to his people. 1 In one of these he is styled one of the three National Pillars of the Island: in another, one of the three Primary Inventors: and in a third, one of the beneficent Sovereigns of the Cymry, because he had first reduced to a system, and improved, and extended their laws, institutions, customs, and privileges, \"so that right and justice might be obtained by every one in Britain, under the protection of God and His peace, and under the protection of the country, and the nation.\" Again we find him designated as one of three chief System-formers of Royalty, by reason of the excellency of his mode of government.\n\nHowel Dda, the Welsh Legislator, in compiling his celebrated Welsh Code, in the tenth century, made great use of the laws of Dyvynwal Moelmud, some of the Triads and institutes ascribed to whom are to be found in the third volume of the Myvyrian Archaiology, and are very curious and interesting remains.\n\n\n\n225c GWYSTYL THE SON OF RHUN THE SON OF NWYTHON.--Page 225.\n\nRHUN the father of Gwystyl, was one of the chieftains mentioned by Gruffydd ab Arthur, 2 as being present at King Arthur's Coronation, at Caerlleon upon Usk.--Both he and Nwython are named in Taliesin's poem addressed to Gwallawg. 3\n\n\n\n225d DREM THE SON OF DREMIDYD.--Page 225.\n\nIN addition to the notice already given (p. 187), of this fantastic personage, who was so sharp-sighted, that he could descry a mote in the sunbeam in the four corners of the world, we may remark that in the Englynion y Clyweid, he is represented to have pronounced the very sensible opinion recorded in the following lines:--\n\n\"Hast thou heard what Dremhidydd sang,\nAn ancient watchman on the castle walls!\nA refusal is better than a promise unperformed.\"--\nMyv. Arch. I. p. 174.\n\n\n\n225e GELLI WIC.--Page 225.\n\nOF Gelli Wic (or, as it is generally written, Gelliwig), in Cornwall, frequent mention is made in the Triads, where it is named as one of the three national thrones of the Island of Britain, 1 and one of King Arthur's chief seats of empire, in which he was used to celebrate the high festivals of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide. At the time of Arthur's sovereignty, when he was Supreme Ruler (Penrhaith as it is called in Welsh), Bedwin was the chief Bishop, and Caradawc Vreichvras was the chief Elder, of Gelliwig. It was one of the three Archbishoprics of Britain. 2 When Medrawd, Arthur's wicked nephew, usurped the government of the island during his uncle's absence, he went to Gelliwig, and dragged Gwenhwyvar from her throne with contumely, and left neither meat nor drink in the court, \"not even so much as would feed a fly,\" but consumed and wasted all. 3 The fatal battle of Camlan was fought to avenge this insult.\n\nThe site of Gelliwig is now a matter of some doubt. Hals places it at Callington (Kellington or Killiwick), as we learn from the following extract from his MS. quoted by Polwhele:--\n\n\"I take this to be the same place mentioned by the Welsh poets or bards, and called by them Kellywick, and Kinge Arthur's palace or court, viz., his court-leet or baylywick. Such in his time vndoubtedly it was, as Duke of Cornwall or Kinge of Britaine; for this manor of land with its appurtenances was, by act of Parliament, given to Edward the Black Prince as parcell of the lands of the ancient kinges or earles of Cornwall, then translated into a dutchy or dukedom.\" 4\n\nIt may be taken as some confirmation of this opinion with regard to the locality of Gelliwig, that there is a place in the vicinity of Callington still bearing the appellation of Arthur's Hall. It is on a rocky tor in the parish of North-hill, which is in the same hundred as Callington, and within a short distance of it. Norden gives the following description of the spot:--\"It is a square Plott, about 60 foote long and about 3.5 foote broade situate in a playne Mountayne, wrowghte some 3 foote in the grounds and by reason of the depression of the place there standeth a otarige or poole of water, the place (being) sett round about with flat stones.\" Near to the Hall are many rocky basins, called by the common people Arthur's Troughs, and in which, according to tradition, that monarch used to feed his dogs; for (says Gilbert, from whom this account is taken) it is \"the custom in Cornwall to ascribe everything that is great and whose use is unknown to that immortal hero.\" 1\n\n\n\n225f PEN BLATHAON IN NORTH BRITAIN.--Page 225.\n\nPEN or Penrhyn Blathaon (supposed to be Caithness in Scotland) has already been noticed 2 as the extreme point from Penwaeth or Pengwaed, in Cornwall, from which it was distant nine hundred miles. 3 The distance between these two places was determined by the British Legislator, Dyvynwal Moelmud. In the Welsh Laws is given the following passage, relating to the admeasurement of the island made by him:--\n\n\"Before the Saxons seized the crown of London and the sceptre, Dyvynwal Moelmud was King of this Island; and he was the Earl of Cornwall, by the daughter of the King of Lloegr. And after the male line of inheritance became extinct, he came into the possession of the kingdom, by the distaff (that is by the female line), as being the grandson of the King. Now he was a man of great wisdom, and he first made laws for this Island, and those laws continued to the time of Rowel Dda, the son of Cadell. And afterwards Rowel Dda made new laws, and changed some of the laws of Dyvynwal. But Howel did not alter the measurements of the lands of this Island, but left them as Dyvynwal framed them; for he was an excellent measurer. He measured this Island from the Promontory of Blathaon, in North Britain, to the Promontory of Pengwaed, in Cornwall, which is nine hundred miles, and that is the length of the Island, and from Crugyll, in Anglesey, to Sorram (Shoreham) on the shore of the sea of Udd (the Channel), that is the breadth of the island. And the reason of his measuring it was to know the number of miles in his journeys.\n\n\"And this measurement Dyvynwal made by a grain of barley. Three lengths of a barley corn in an inch, three inches in a handbreadth, three handbreadths in a foot, three feet in a step, three steps in a jump, three jumps in a land, which is in later Welsh a ridge, and a thousand lands or ridges make a mile, and this measure is used here till now.\"\n\n\n\n226a THE THREE ISLANDS ADJACENT.--Page 226.\n\nORKNEY, the Isle of Wight, and the Isle of Man, are the three primary islands lying adjacent to Britain, according to the authority of the Triads, which proceed to mention, that subsequently Anglesey was separated from the main land, and became an island, and that in like manner the Island of Orkney was divided, and became a multitude of islands, and that other parts of Wales and Scotland became islands likewise.--Triad 67.\n\nThis coincides with Nennius's account of the three islands adjacent to Britain, which is given in these words:--\n\n\"Tres magnas insulas habet [Britannia], quarum, una vergit contra Armoricas, et vocatur Inisgueith; secunda sita est in umbilico maris inter Hiberniam et Brittanniam, et vocatur nomen ejus Eubonia, id est, Manau, alia sita est in extremo limits orbis Brittanni\u00e6 ultra Pictos, et vocatur Orc. Sic in proverbio, antiquo dicitar, quando de judicibus vel regibus sermo fuit, 'Judicavit Brittanniam cum tribus insulis.'\"--P. 7, ed. 1838.\n\n\n\n226b GWYNN GODYVRON.--Page 226.\n\nMENTIONED in the dialogue between Arthur, Kai, and Glewlwyd see p. 42, where the passage is given.\n\n\n\n226c GARSELIT WYDDEL.--Page 226.\n\n\"Hast thou heard what Garselit sang,\nThe Irishman whom it is safe to follow?\nSin is bad when long pursued.\"--\nEnglynion y Clyweid. 1\n\n\n226d THE NINTH MAN THAT RALLIED THE BATTLE OF CAMLAN.--Page 226.\n\nTHIS is very probably an allusion to the disposition made by Arthur of his forces, previous to the battle of Camlan. Geoffrey of Monmonth states that he arranged his army in nine divisions, with a commander over each, of whom Gwynnhyvar was possibly one.\n\n\n\n227a GWARE GWALLT EURYN.--Page 227.\n\nGWARE GWALLT EURYN was the son of Pwyll and Rhianon. The mysterious circumstances connected with his birth are detailed in another Mabinogi.\n\n\n\n228a KYNVELYN KEUDAWD PWYLL, THE HALF MAN.--Page 228.\n\nTHE Welsh have a fable on the subject of the Hanner Dyn or Half Man, taken to be illustrative of the force of habit. In this allegory Arthur is supposed to be met by a sprite, who appears at first in a small and indistinct form, but who on approaching nearer increases in size, and, assuming the semblance of half a man, endeavours to provoke the king to wrestle. Despising his weakness, and considering that he should gain no credit by the encounter, Arthur refuses to do so, and delays the contest, until at length the Half Man (Habit) becomes so strong that it requires his utmost efforts to overcome him.\n\n\n\n228b SAWYL BEN UCHEL.--Page 228.\n\nSAWYL BEN UCHEL is accused of being one of those whose arrogance produced anarchy in the Island of Britain; and the lawless party united with the Saxons, and themselves became Saxons at last.--Triad 74.\n\n\n\n228c GWRHYR GWASTAWD IETTHOEDD.--Page 228.\n\nIOLO GOCH'S allusion to Gwrhyr's extraordinary aptitude for acquiring languages has already been noticed, in the notes to Geraint ab Erbin. The Englynion y Clyweid refer in like manner to the singular talent by which he was characterised:--\n\nHast thou heard what Gwrhyr Gwalstawt sang,\nHe who was perfect in all languages?\nWho practises deceit will be deceived.\"--\nMyv. Arch. I. p. 172.\n\n\nBEDWINI was Bishop of Gelliwig in Cornwall, and as such is spoken of in the Triads, 1 and in the British Chronicles. One of his sayings is preserved in the Englynion y Clyweid:--\n\nHast thou heard what Bedwini sung,\nA gifted Bishop of exalted rank?\nConsider thy word before it is given.\" 2\n\n\n\n229a INDEG.--Page 229.\n\nSOME of the ladies here adjured are celebrated in the Triads, and others figure in the writings of the Romancers of the Middle Ages.\n\nIndeg, the daughter of Garwy or Afarwy hir, of Maelienydd, was one of the three ladies best beloved by Arthur. 3 Her beauty is often the theme of the bards.\n\nMorvudd was the daughter of Urien Rheged, the twin sister of Owain, and the beloved of Cynon the son of Clydno Eiddyn. Her mother's name was Modron, the daughter of Avallach. 4\n\nCreiddylad is no other than Shakespeare's Cordelia, whose father, King Lear, is, by the Welsh authorities, called indiscriminately Llyr and Lludd Law Ereint. All the old chroniclers, from the Brut to Milton, give the story of her devotion to her aged parent, but none of them seem to have been aware that she is destined to remain with him until the day of doom, whilst Gwyn ab Nudd, the King of the Fairies, and Gwythyr mab Greidiawl, fight for her every first of May; and whichever of them may be fortunate enough to be the conqueror at that time, will obtain her as his bride. She is quoted in the Englynion y Clyweid:--\n\nHast thou heard what Creiddylad sang,\nThe daughter of Lludd, the constant maiden?\nMuch will the faithful messenger effect.\"--\nMyv. Arch. I. p. 174.\n\nEssyllt Vinwen or Fyngwen, the daughter of Culvanawyd Prydain, and sister of Owain's faithless wife Penarwen, is mentioned very disparagingly in the Triads. 5 She was married to March ab Meirchion, and acquired a very undesirable celebrity for her attachment to her husband's nephew Tristan ab Tallwch, the renowned Sir Tristan of the Romancers, who bestow upon Essyllt the appellation of Yseult La Belle.\n\nEssyllt Vingul, we may presume to be the Yseullt aux Blanche Mains of romantic fiction, whom Sir Tristan, although at the same time deeply enamoured of her fairer namesake, married out of gratitude for her having effected his cure, when wounded by a poisoned arrow.\n\n\n\n230a DRYCH AIL KIBDDAR.--Page 230.\n\nONLY the first series of the Triads, printed in the Myvyrian Archaiology, takes notice of Drych ail Kibddar, and there be is classed among the dealers in phantasy or enchantment.--Triad xxxiii.\n\n\n\n236a AMAETHON THE SON OF DON.--Page 236.\n\nAMAETHON, the signification of whose name is \"husbandman,\" would seem to have been a very proper person to send for to perform the office. required by Yspaddaden Penkawr. He was brother to the celebrated illusionist or enchanter, Gwydion ab Don, and he appears to have had himself some dealings with the powers of darkness; for it is fabled that he brought from Annwn (the Lower Regions), a white roebuck, and a whelp, which were the occasion of the Cad Goddeu, or Battle of the Trees. Taliesin has a long mystical poem on the subject of this battle; and some curious lines relative to it are given in the Myvyrian Archaiology. 1 These, with the prose heading that accompanies them, are as follows:--\n\nThese are the Englyns that were sung at the C\u00e2d Goddeu (the Battle of the Trees), or, as others call it, the Battle of Achren, which was on account of a white roebuck, and a whelp; and they came from Hell, and Amathaon ab Don brought them. And therefore Amathaon ab Don, and Arawn, King of Annwn (Hell), fought. And there was a man in that battle, unless his name were known he could not be overcome; and there was on the other side a woman called Achren, and unless her name were known her party could not be overcome. And Gwydion ab Don guessed the name of the man, and sang the two Englyns following:--\n\n'Sure-hoofed is my steed impelled by the spur;\nThe high sprigs of alder are on thy shield:\nBr\u00e2n art thou called, of the glittering branches.'\n\nAnd thus,\n'Sure-hoofed is my steed in the day of battle\nThe high sprigs of alder are on thy hand:\nBr\u00e2n.............by the branch thou bearest\nHas Amathaon the good prevailed.'\"\n\nThese lines have the appearance of being transcribed from a very ancient and probably mutilated manuscript. Some of the words are scarcely intelligible; but perhaps the foregoing will be found not very remote from the meaning of the original.\n\nThis battle, in the Triads, is styled one of the three frivolous battles (ofergad) of the Island of Britain, and is said to have been on account of a bitch, a hind, and a lapwing; and it is added that it cost the lives of seventy-one thousand men.--Triad 50.\n\nThe brothers, Gwydion and Amaethon, are mentioned as being efficient of counsel, in Taliesin's Elegy on Aeddon of Mon. 1\n\n\n\n236b OXEN OF GWLWLYD.--Page 236.\n\nTHESE animals, to which some fabulous story probably attached, are spoken of in the Triads, together with those required by Yspaddaden in the subsequent paragraph.--Tr. y Meirch x.\n\nOne of these is alluded to in Taliesin's mystical poem, entitled Preiddeu Annwn, the spoils of Hell. 2\n\n\"They know not the brindled ox with the broad headband Seven score handbreadths are in his yoke.\"\n\n\n\n236c NYNNIAW AND PEBIAW.--Page 236.\n\nON turning to the ancient records, we meet with kings bearing the names of those who were turned into oxen for their crimes.\n\nNynniaw was a prince of Glamorgan, and his descendants appear to have profited by the lesson which his disastrous fate afforded; for we find that Marchell, his great grand-daughter, was the mother of the celebrated and canonized Brychan Brycheiniog, 3 who had himself the happiness of being father to no less than forty-eight saints, twenty-three of whom were sons, and five-and-twenty daughters.\n\nAccording to the Liber Landavensis, King Pebiaw, who was the son of Erb, was equally fortunate in the character of his descendants, one of whom was Saint Dubricius himself, the particulars of whose miraculous birth are there given in the following words.\n\n\"There was a certain king of the region of Ergyng 1 (Archenfield) of the name of Pebiau, called, in the British language, Claforawg, and in Latin, Spumosus, who undertook an expedition against his enemies, and returning from thence be ordered his daughter Eurddil to wash his head.\" The legend then goes on to state that circumstances led him to suspect that Eurddil was pregnant, and that \"the King, therefore, being angry, ordered her to be put into a sack, and cast headlong into the river, that she might suffer whatever might befall; which, however, happened contrary to what was expected, for as often as she was placed in the river, so often was she, through the guidance of God, impelled to the bank. Her father, then, being indignant because he could not drown her in the river, resolved to destroy her with fire. A funeral pile was therefore prepared, into which his daughter was thrown alive. In the following morning, the messengers who had been sent by her father to ascertain whether any of the bones of his daughter remained, found her holding her son in her lap, at a spot where a stone is placed in testimony of the wonderful nativity of the boy; and the place is called Madle, 2 because therein was born the holy man. The father, bearing this, ordered his daughter with her son to be brought to him; and when they came he embraced the infant with paternal affection, as is usual, and kissing him, from the restlessness of infancy, he touched with his hands the face and mouth of his grandfather, and that not without divine appointment; for by the contact of the hands of the infant, he was healed of the incurable disease wherewith be was afflicted, for he incessantly emitted foam from his mouth which two persons who constantly attended him could scarcely wipe off with handkerchiefs.\n\n\"Who, when he knew that he had been healed by the touch of the infant, rejoiced greatly, like one who had come to a harbour after having suffered shipwreck. And he, who at first was as a roaring lion, was now turned to a lamb, and he began to love the infant above all his sons and grandsons; and of that place, Madle (that is, Mad, good, lle, place, and whence Madle, a good place), he made him heir, and also of the whole island, which took its name from his mother Eurddil, that is, Ynys Eurddyl, which by others is called Maes Mail Lecheu.\" 3\n\nWhether these events took place before or after King Pebiaw's distressing transformation does not appear. All the further information concerning him, in the Liber Landavensis, consists of the due. recital of sundry grants of land which be made to the Church, \"being penitent, with an humble heart, and mindful of his evil deeds.\"\n\nLewis, in his \"History of Great Britain,\" printed in 1729, mentions Pebiaw as King of Erchenfield, and states that in a parish church in Herefordshire is a picture of a king, with a man on each side of him, wiping his face with napkins, \"which king the country people call King Dravellor.\"\n\nThe insane arrogance of these wicked kings is recorded in a curious Welsh legend, a translation of which is printed by Mr. Taliesin Williams, in the notes to his poem of Colyn Dolphyn. It is as follows:--\n\n\"There were two Kings, formerly in Britain, named Nynniaw and Peibiaw. As these two ranged the fields one starlight night, 'See,' said Nynniaw, 'what a beautiful and extensive field I possess!' 'Where is it?' said Peibiaw; 'the whole Firmament,' said Nynniaw, 'far as vision can extend.' 'And do thou see,' said Peibiaw, 'what countless herds and flocks of cattle and sheep I have depasturing thy field.' 'Where are they?' said Nynniaw; 'why the whole host of stars which thou seest,' said Peibiaw, 'and each of golden effulgence, with the Moon for their shepherdess, to superintend their wanderings.' 'They shall not graze in MY pasture,' said Nynniaw; 'They shall,' said Peibiaw; 'They shall not,' said one: 'They shall.' said the other, repeatedly, in bandied contradiction, until at last it arose to wild contention between them, and from contention it came to furious war; until the armies and subjects of both were nearly annihilated in the desolation. RHITTA, the Giant, King of Wales, hearing of the carnage committed by these two maniac kings, determined on hostility against them; and, having previously consulted the laws and his people, he arose and marched against them because they had, as stated, followed the courses of depopulation and devastation, under the suggestions of phrenzy. He vanquished them, and then cut off their beards. But, when the other Sovereigns included in the twenty-eight kings of the island of Britain, heard these things, they combined all their legions to revenge the degradation committed on the two disbearded kings, and made a fierce onset on Rhitta the Giant, and his forces; and furiously bold was the engagement, But Rhitta the Giant won the day. 'This is my extensive field,' said he, then, and immediately disbearded the other kings. When the kings of the surrounding countries heard of the disgrace inflicted on all these disbearded kings, they armed themselves against Rhitta. the Giant and his men; and tremendous was the conflict; but Rhitta the Giant achieved a most decisive victory, and then exclaimed: 'This is MY immense field!' and at once the kings were disbearded by him and his men. Then pointing to the irrational monarchs, 'These,' said he, 'are the animals that grazed my field, but I have driven them out: they shall no longer depasture there.' After that he took up all the beards, and made out of them a mantle for himself that extended from head to heel; and Rhitta was twice as large as any other person ever seen.\"\n\nThis Rhitta Gawr is none other than King Ryons of North Wales, who appears to have been almost as presumptuous as the unfortunate monarchs whom he so deservedly chastised. The Morte d'Arthur represents him as sending to demand the beard of Arthur himself, which it need hardly be added that he failed to obtain. 1\n\nWe are told that Nynniaw and Pebiaw were the names of the horned oxen (Ychain Banawg) employed by Hu Gadarn 2 to draw the Avanc out of the Lake of Floods, so that the lake burst no more. This bursting of the lake is considered to bear reference to the universal Deluge, as it is said in the same Triad, that when that occurrence took place, the male and the female of every living thing were preserved in the ship of Nevydd Nav Neivion. It would be useless to follow all the theories which have been founded on the name of Hu Gadarn, and his connexion with that important event. For these, reference may be made to Davies's Mythology of the Druids, and Celtic Researches, Dr. Owen Pughe, in his Dictionary, and Cambrian Biography, &c. &c. Suffice it to say, that Hu Gadarn or the Mighty is looked upon as a patriarch, and that there are seven 1 Triads commemorative of the benefits which he is said to have conferred upon \"the Cymry,\" whom he is recorded to have instructed in the useful arts of agriculture, before their arrival in Britain, and while they remained in the Summer country, which an ancient commentator has described to be that part of the East now called Constantinople. The next benefit that he conferred on the people, of whom he thus appears to have been the head, was the dividing of them into various tribes, and directing them at the same time to unity of action, for which he is represented as one of the three primary System-formers of the nation of the Cymry. In addition to this, he is further commemorated as having been the first who devised the application of song to the preservation of record and invention, and as having contributed thereby to the institution of Bardism. The occurrence, last in succession, appears to have been his arrival in the Isle of Britain, with the nation of the Cymry, whom he is stated, in two Triads, to have conducted from the Summer country already noticed, here called Deffrobani, and a colony of whom he is also said to have fixed at the same time in Armorica, on the coast of Gaul. And his landing in this country, as we find from another of these ancient documents, was not marked by any characteristics of violence; for he is described as not desirous of obtaining dominion by war and bloodshed, but by justice and peace, for which reason his followers are ranked among the three gentle tribes of the Isle of Britain. 2\n\n\n\n237a THE BASKET OF GWYDDNEU GARANHIR.--Page 237.\n\nTHIS marvellous basket is reckoned amongst the thirteen precious things of the Island of Britain. In the following catalogue of these treasures, which is copied from an old MS. in the collection of Mr. Justice Bosanquet, its properties are, however, made to differ slightly from those assigned to it by Yspaddaden:--\n\n1. Dyrnwyn the sword of Rhydderch Hael; if any man drew it except himself, it burst into a flame from the cross to the point, and all who asked it received it; but because of this property all shunned it: and therefore was he called Rhydderch Hael.\n\n2. The basket of Gwyddno Garanhir; if food for one man were put into it, when opened it would be found to contain food for one hundred.\n\n3. The horn of Bran Galed; what liquor soever was desired was found therein.\n\n4. The chariot of Morgan Mwynvawr; whoever sat in it would be immediately wheresoever he wished.\n\n5. The halter of Clydno Eiddyn, which was in a staple below the feet of his bed; and whatever horse he wished for in it, he would find it there.\n\n6. The knife of Llawfrodded Farchawg; which would serve four-and-twenty men at meat all at once.\n\n7. The cauldron of Tyrnog; if meat were put in it to boil for a coward it would never be boiled, but if meat were put in it for a brave man it would be boiled forthwith.\n\n8. The whetstone of Tudwal Tudclud; if the sword of a brave man were sharpened thereon, and any one were wounded therewith, he would be sure to die, but if it were that of a coward that was sharpened on it, he would be none the worse.\n\n9. The garment of Padarn Beisrudd; if a man of gentle birth put it on, it suited him well, but if a churl it would not fit him.\n\n10, 11. The pan and the platter of Rhegynydd Ysgolhaig; whatever food was required was found therein.\n\n12. The chessboard of Gwenddolen; when the men were placed upon it, they would play of themselves. The chessboard was of gold, and the men of silver.\n\n13. The mantle of Arthur; whosoever was beneath it could see everything, while no one could see him.\n\nThis version is rather different from that given by Jones, in his Welsh Bards, 1 which omits the halter of Clydno Eiddyn, but adds the mantle of Tegau Eurvron, which would only fit such ladies as were perfectly correct in their conduct, and the ring of Luned, by which she effected the release of Owain the son of Urien, as bas already been seen in the story of the Lady of the Fountain; whoever concealed the stone of this ring became invisible.\n\nGwyddno Garanhir, the possessor of the basket, was the Prince of Cantref y Gwaelod, which was overflowed by the sea. This event will be detailed hereafter in the notes to another Mabinogi, where it is more particularly referred to.\n\n\n\n237b THE HARP OF TEIRTU.--Page 237.\n\nTHE harp of Teirtu appears to be alluded to by Davydd ab Edmwnt, a bard who flourished about the middle of the fifteenth century. In an elegy which he composed on a celebrated harper, named Sion E\u00f4s, or John the Nightingale (who suffered death for manslaughter, although his weight in gold was offered to redeem his life), the bard, addressing Reinallt, a once rival harper, says:--\n\n\"His companion has become silent,\nThe turtle-dove of the Harp of Teirtud.\" 1\n\nThis passage has generally been considered to refer to the Triple Harp; and it is likely that Teirtu, who was probably the inventor as well as the possessor of this harp, may have derived his name or cognomen from the instrument's triple row of strings.\n\nSt. Dunstan's harp is said to have been endued with the same miraculous powers as that of Teirtu; when suspended against the walls of his cell, it was wont to pour forth the most harmonious sounds, without the intervention of any visible hand.\n\nI have heard that a Welsh nursery tale is still current, of a harp possessing equally wonderful properties. This harp belonged to a giant; and a dwarf, named Dewryn Fychan, endeavoured to purloin it; but as he carried it off the harp, commenced playing, and aroused the giant, who immediately set off in pursuit of the offender. A similar tale exists in English.\n\nThere is a place called Castell Teirtud, mentioned in the Liber Landavensis, as being in Breconshire, in the hundred of Builth.--P. 374.\n\n\n\n239a TWRCH TRWYTH.--Page 239.\n\nIT may be a matter of controversy, which in the present imperfect state of Welsh MSS. might be difficult to determine, whether certain lines of Aneurin's Gorchan Cynvelyn (Incantation of Cynvelyn) were intended to refer to the very ancient tradition of the Twrch Trwyth.--Myv. Arch. I. p. 60.\n\nDavies, in his \"Mythology of the Druids,\" 2 and Jones, in his \"Relies of the Welsh Bards,\" 3 appear to have no doubt upon the subject, and in that spirit quote the passage, which the learned Dr. Owen Pughe has also thus translated. 4\n\n\"Were I to compose the strain--were I to sing--magic spell, would spring, like those produced by the circle and wand of Twrch Trwyth.\"\n\nSuch authority is of great weight, when we consider the mass of information possessed by Dr. O. Pughe, on matters of this kind, and his facilities for consulting the various readings of different MSS. between which important variations sometimes exist.\n\nDavies states that he considers that a passage in a very old and curious MS. of Aneurin, now in the possession of the Rev. Thomas Price, of Crickhowel, alludes to objects represented on the ancient British coins; and when the description contained in his translation is compared with the figures referred to, it must be acknowledged that the coincidence appears very striking. The Gorchegin, high shoots, appear on several coins, but more particularly do we remark the Trychetin Trychinffwrch, or monstrous horse cut off from the haunches; the Carn Caffan, or hoof with the capped stick; the Esgyrnvyr, short bones, of the legs separated from the body; yr vach varchogion, the diminutive riders (beads or circles on the mane and the back); the ysfach, bird's beak, instead of the horse's head: and when we add to this the Incantation of Cynvelyn, corresponding with the name of Cunobeline on the coin, we can hardly suppose that the whole is the effect of accident; if the connexion is so far established, we may perhaps be allowed to suggest that the figure of the boar on some of the coins is referred to in the words Trychdrwyt in the third line of the poem.\n\nSome have supposed that the distorted figure of the horse is merely the result of want of skill in the artist, but it is evidently a mistake, as the other parts of the coins are finished in such a manner as totally to preclude any such idea. Even the bird's beak, and the small object which it holds, are executed with considerable attention, and no small care seems to have been taken to preserve the separation between the bones of the legs and the body of the animal. All this occurring on coins of different dies, clearly Shows an uniformity of design, and tends greatly to corroborate Davies's hypothesis.\n\nBesides the specimens in the British Museum, there is a beautiful gold coin of this class in the possession of the Rev. John Jones (Tegid), found near Oxford, which shows the above characteristics very distinctly.\n\nDuring the middle ages, the story of the Twrch Trwyth was current amongst the Welsh, and Lewis Glyn Cothi alludes to him in these words,\n\n\"He would destroy the towns with wrath, wounds, and violence he would tear down all the towers like the Twrch Trwyth.\" 1\n\nWe find a direct reference to the hunt of the Twrch Trwyth in the catalogue of the marvels of the Island of Britain, which in some copies is appended to the \"Historia Britonum\" of Nennius. The MS. from which the passage is copied into this place is preserved in the British Museum (Harleian MSS. 3859), and is pronounced by the learned editor of \"Nennius\" to be of the tenth century. 2\n\n\"Est aliud mirabile in regione qu\u00e6 dicitur Buelt. Est ibi cumulus lapidum, et unus lapis superpositus super congestum, cum vestigio canis in eo. Quando venatus est porcum Troynt, impressit Cabal, qui erat canis Arthuri militis, vestigium in lapide, et Arthur postea congregavit congestum lapidum sub lapide in quo erat vestigium canis sui, et vocatur Carn Cabal. Et veniunt homines et tollunt lapidem in manibus suis per spacium diei et noctis, et in crastino die invenitur super congestum suum.\"--P. 60.\n\n--There is another wonder in the region called Buelt. There is a heap of stones, and one stone laid on the heap having upon it the footmark of a dog. When he hunted the swine Troynt, 3 Cabal, which was a dog of the warrior Arthur, impressed the stone with the print of his foot, and Arthur afterwards collected a heap of stones beneath the stone in which was the print of his dog's foot, and it is called Carn Cabal. And people come and take away the stone in their hands for the space of a day and a night, and on the next day it is found on its heap.--\n\nThe fact of this story of the Twrch Trwyth being found in a MS. of so early a date, appeared at once so interesting and important that a facsimile of the whole passage relating to the event was taken from the venerable document, and inserted in my edition of the Mabinogion, II. 1840. But if we are surprised to find this singular hunt thus recorded, and even the name of Arthur's dog Cavall preserved in connection with it, much more may we be astonished to learn that Carn Cavall is no fabulous mound, the creation of the poet or romancer's fancy, but is actually a mountain in the district of Builth, to the south of Rhayader Gwy, and within sight of that town. Such was the interest excited in my mind by the discovery of the existence of such a remarkable piece of evidence, corroborative of the great antiquity of the traditions contained in the Mabinogi of Kilhwch, that I prevailed upon a gentleman to undertake a pilgrimage for me to the summit of Cefn Carn Cavall. The following is the account he wrote me of his expedition; whether he has succeeded in finding the stone itself, bearing the imprint of Cavall's footstep, I must leave to others to determine.\n\n\"Carn Cavall, or, as it is generally pronounced, Corn Cavall, is a lofty and rugged mountain, in the upper part of the district anciently called Buellt, now written Builth, in Breconshire. Scattered over this mountain are several carns of various dimensions, some of which are of very considerable magnitude, being at least a hundred and fifty feet in circumference. On one of these carns may still be seen a stone, so nearly corresponding with the description in Nennius, as to furnish strong presumption that it is the identical object referred to. It is near two feet in length, and not quite a foot wide, and such as a man might without any great exertion, carry away in his hands. On the one side is an oval indentation, rounded at the bottom, nearly four inches long by three wide, about two inches deep, and altogether presenting such an appearance as might, without any great strain of imagination, be thought to resemble the print of a dog's foot; on a more minute inspection it will be found that although there is towards the middle part a slight mark corresponding with the ball of the foot, yet the divisions of the toes and marks of the nails are wanting; but when we make allowance for the effect of a thousand winters in this high and stormy region, it is not too much to suppose that at one time the resemblance was still more striking.\n\n\"As the stone is a species of conglomerate, it is possible that some unimaginative geologist may persist in maintaining that this footprint is nothing more than the cavity, left by the removal of a rounded pebble, which was once imbedded in the stone; such all opinion scarcely requires a remark. The following sketch will give an idea of the stone.\"\n\n\n240a MABON THE SON OF MODRON.--Page 240.\n\nBOTH the Triads relating to Mabon's mysterious captivity having already been cited in this volume, p. 192, it is considered unnecessary to repeat them in this place. One of them (Triad 61), places his prison among the Gwyddyl Ffichti in Alban, and represents his whole kindred as having shared it with him. In the Graves of the Warriors we find,\n\nThe grave in the upland of Nanllau;\nHis story no one knows,\nMabon the son of Modron the sincere.\"--Myv. Arch. I. p. 78.\n\nHe would seem to be alluded to, as Mab a Mydron, the servant of Uthir Pendragon, in the dialogue between Arthur, Kai, and Glewlwyd, where Mabon ab Mellt is also mentioned.--See p. 267.\n\n\n\n246a OUSEL OF CILGWRI.--Page 246.\n\nDAVYDD AP GWILYM was acquainted with the tradition of these ancient animals, as is proved by his poem entitled \"Yr Oed.\" He has, however, altered their localities. His mistress having disappointed him in keeping an engagement, he complains that the delay was so tedious to him that he might be compared to the inhabitant of Gwernabwy; for though it was true he was no Eagle, still, having waited for three generations, he had, through long tarrying, come to resemble that venerable bird; and he adds that for love he had grown as infirm as the stag of Cilgwri, and as grey as the owl of Cwm Cawlwyd.\n\nThe Cwm Cawlwyd is probably the territory which belonged to Caw and his descendants, who are always styled Lords of Cwm Cawlywd, in North Britain. There is a place of this name in Caernarvonshire, and another in Carmarthenshire. Cilgwri is in Flintsbire.\n\n\n\n248a LLUDD LLAW EREINT.--Page 248.\n\nLLUDD LLAW EREINT, an ancient king of Britain, will be better known to the English reader by the name of King Lear, or Llyr, as it is written by the Welsh, who celebrate him under the appellation of Lludd and Llyr, indiscriminately.\n\n\n\n251a LLAMREI.--Page 251.\n\nTHIS Mare of Arthur's was very celebrated. Her name implies bounding or curvetting. Taliesin speaks of her in his C\u00e2n y Meirch, as \"Llamrei full of vigour.\"--Myv. Arch. I. p. 44.\n\n\n\n253a PORTH KERDDIN.--Page 253.\n\nTHE precise position of this harbour is not easily ascertained. The proximity of places called Pen Arthyr and Trelethin (probably, Tre Lwydden ap Kelcoed), would induce a conjecture of Porthmawr, near St. David's Head, Pembrokeshire, being the site of Porth Kerddin. The words in the text, however, \"And there is the measure of the cauldron,\" would favour the supposition of Porth Kerddin being another place in the same county, now called Pwll Crochan (the pool of the cauldron), about five miles westward from the town of Fishguard. It may not be irrelevant to remark that the whole surrounding district abounds with Druidical and other ancient remains. Not far from it is a small village alleged to have been the birthplace of the celebrated Asser Menevensis, whose name it bears; and about two miles from Tre Asser is a place where an ancient British town is said to have been founded by the hero of the present tale, and after him called Tref Kilhwch, the only remains of which are some foundations of houses occasionally met with in ploughing.\n\n\n\n253b THE SUMMER COUNTRY (GWLAD YR HAF).--Page 253.\n\nTHIS name stands translated in the text as the Summer Country, which is its literal meaning. This is the way in which it is usually rendered with reference to Triad 4, where it is said that Hu Gadarn came over with the race of the Cymry from the Gwlad yr H\u00e2v, considered to be somewhere near Constantinople. In the present instance, however, it may have been intended to allude to Somersetshire, of which Gwlad yr H\u00e2v is the Welsh appellation, and with which the etymology of the Havren (Severn) is probably connected.\n\n\n\n254a PORTH CLEIS.--Page 254.\n\nTHIS place, at which the Twrch Trwyth landed, and commenced his devastating expedition through the Principality, is a small but well-known harbour in Pembrokeshire, at the estuary of the river Alun: Although it is only capable of affording accommodation to what are now termed small craft, it was, in times past, a much frequented port, and was the landing-place in several marauding excursions of the Gwyddyl Ffichti, one of whom, named Boia, is recorded in the Liber Landavensis as having been the source of great annoyance to St. David and St. Telliaw. The former of these saints is traditionally reputed to have been a native of Porth Cleis, and to have been baptized at a holy well in its immediate vicinity.\n\nMynyw, or St. David's, is the next place mentioned in the progress of the Twrch Trwyth, and we thence trace him to Aber deu Gleddyf, or Milford Haven, On leaving Aber deu Gleddyf, we find him overtaken by Arthur while destroying the herds of Kynwas Kwrr y Vagyl, and this we may conjecture to have occurred at a place still called Kynwaston or Canaston, not far from Narberth. Blaengwaith Noe ab Arthur, near Lampeter Velfrey, and Buarth Arthur, and the Cromlech of Gwal y Filast, or Bwrdd Arthur (Arthur's Table), in the parish of Llanboipy, probably mark the course of this singular hunt to the Preselly Mountains, the highest range in Pembrokeshire. At the eastern extremity of these mountains rises the river Nyver, or Nevern, on the banks of which the British warriors drew themselves up in array, and close to the highest peak of the range, named Preselly Top, is the dingle of Cwm Kerwyn, where the Twrch Trwyth is said to have committed such dreadful havoc among Arthur's champions. Within a distance of two miles, Arthur's name is again perpetuated in the rugged summit of Carn Arthur, whence the imagination may easily trace some remembrance of the Twrch Trwyth and his progeny, in the names of the opposite eminence, Moel Dyrch; and of Tre Dyrch, the adjacent farm.\n\nLeaving the Preselly Mountains, and passing through Aberteivi or Cardigan town, the Twrch Trwyth again appears in Dyffryn Llychwr, or Loughor, on the confines of Carmarthenshire and Glamorgan. The Dyffryn Amanw of the tale is identical with the valley of the river Amman, which falls into the Llychwr some few miles from the sea. In the Mynydd Amanw we recognize the lofty heights, which form a natural boundary between the counties of Brecon and Carmarthen, called Mynydd Du, and Bannau S\u00eer Gaer, or the Black Mountain and Carmarthenshire Vans. On this range tradition has assigned to Arthur a resting-place of the most ample dimensions, called Gwely Arthur, or Arthur's Bed, and near to the spot where the river Amman rises is an elevated knoll, called Twyn y Moch, at the foot of which is Llwyn y Moch, both of which names may bear some allusion to the adventures detailed in the text. The same remark may be said to apply to the adjacent river Twrch, which rises on the Van, and runs into the Tawy, below Ystradgynlais. Another singular coincidence may be traced between the name of 'a brook in this neighbourhood, called Echel, and the Echel Forddwyttwl, who is recorded in the tale as having been slain at this period of the chase. On the Llangadock side of the Black Mountain we meet with fresh reminiscences of the British monarch in Pen Arthur, and Coiten Arthur. The latter is one of two large rocks in the bed of the Sawdde river, said to have been the hero's quoit, which be flung from the summit of Pen Arthur to its present position; a distance of about a mile. The rock beside the Coiten was thrown into the stream from the same eminence by a lady of those days, being a pebble in her shoe which gave her some annoyance. As there are several localities on the Tywi bearing the appellation of Dinas, it would be difficult to determine to which of them Din Tywi is intended to refer.\n\nAt Ystrad Yw, we find ourselves once more on well-known ground, and hence we may conjecture that the course of the Twrch Trwyth lay across Carn Cavall and the Brecon Mountains 1 to Abergwy, where the Wye falls into the Severn below Chepstow, and where the princely monster also dashes into the flood, to appear again but for a moment in Cornwall, before he vanishes entirely from our view.\n\n\n\n256a LLYN LLIWAN.--Page 256.\n\nWHETHER the immersion of the boar Trwyth into the Severn near Llyn Lliwan, or Llinlivan, as it is generally called, has any reference to the wonders that characterise that remarkable spot, does not appear, but it would seem reasonable to suppose that something more than a natural cause must have led to the marvellous results thus related in the tract De Mirabilibus Britanni\u00e6, attached to some of the copies of Nennius.\n\n\"There is another wonder, which is Oper Linn Liuan, 2 the mouth of which river opens into the Severn; and when the tide flows into the Severn, the sea in the like manner flows into the mouth of the above-named river, and is received into a pool at its mouth, as into a gulf, and does not proceed higher up. And there is a beach near the river, and when the tide is in the Severn, that beach is not covered; and when the sea and the Severn recede, then the pool Liuan disgorges all that it had swallowed from the sea, and that beach is covered therewith, and it discharges and pours it out in one wave, in size like to a mountain. And if there should be the whole army of all that country there, and they should turn their faces towards the wave, it would draw the army to it by force, their clothes being full of moisture, and their horses would be drawn in like manner. But should the army turn their backs towards the wave, it will not injure them. And when the sea has receded, then the whole beach which the wave had covered is left bare again, and the sea retires from it. 3\n\nIn an expedition of Arthur's to the North, the Scots fled before him, and betook themselves to the Lake Llumonyw (probably Loch Lomond), in which were sixty islands and sixty rocks, and on each an eagle's nest. Every first of May these came together, and from the sound of their voices the men of that country knew what should befall during the coming year. And sixty rivers fell into this remarkable lake, but only one river ran from the lake to the sea.\n\nArthur soon dislodged his opponents from their stronghold, the singular nature of which excited great surprise in the mind of Howel the son of Emyr Llydaw, who accompanied him. But when Howel expressed his wonder at it, Arthur told him that there was a still more marvellous lake not far thence, which was twenty feet long and twenty feet broad, and consequently square; and it contained four different races of fishes, and a fish was never found in a part of the lake occupied by a race to which it did not belong. 1 And he told him also that there was another lake in Wales near the Severn, which the men of that country called Llyn Llivan; and that lake, when the sea flowed, received water into it, and swallowed it as though it had been a mountain, until it overflowed its banks; and if it chanced that any stood with their faces towards the lake, and any of the spray of the water touched their clothes, it was hard for them to avoid being drawn into the lake; but if their backs were towards it, how near soever they might stand to its edge, it would have no effect upon them.

DE CHARLUS IN SOCIETY. \u2014 A PHYSICIAN. \u2014 TYPICAL PHYSIOGNOMY OF MME. DE VAUGOUBERT. \u2014 MME. D\u2019ARPAJON, THE HUBERT ROBERT FOUNTAIN AND THE MERRIMENT OF THE GRAND DUKE VLADIMIR. \u2014 MMES. D\u2019AMONCOURT, DE CITRI, DE SAINT-EUVERTE, ETC. \u2014 CURIOUS CONVERSATION BETWEEN SWANN AND THE PRINCE DE GUERMANTES. \u2014 ALBERTINE ON THE TELEPHONE. \u2014 MY SOCIAL LIFE IN THE INTERVAL BEFORE MY SECOND AND FINAL VISIT TO BALBEC. ARRIVAL AT BALBEC\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I was in no haste to arrive at this party at the Guermantes\u2019, to which I was not certain that I had been invited, I remained sauntering out of doors; but the summer day seemed to be in no greater haste than myself to stir. Albeit it was after nine o\u2019clock, it was still the light of day that on the Place de la Concorde was giving the Luxor obelisk the appearance of being made of pink nougat. Then it diluted the tint and changed the surface to a metallic substance, so that the obelisk not only became more precious but seemed to have grown more slender and almost flexible. You imagined that you might have twisted it in your fingers, had perhaps already slightly distorted its outline. The moon was now in the sky like a section of orange delicately peeled although slightly bruised. But presently she was to be fashioned of the most enduring gold. Sheltering alone behind her, a poor little star was to serve as sole companion to the lonely moon, while she, keeping her friend protected, but bolder and striding ahead, would brandish like an irresistible weapon, like an Oriental symbol, her broad and marvellous crescent of gold\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outside the mansion of the Princesse de Guermantes, I met the Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault; I no longer remembered that half an hour earlier I had still been persecuted by the fear \u2014 which, for that matter, was speedily to grip me again \u2014 that I might be entering the house uninvited. We grow uneasy, and it is sometimes long after the hour of danger, which a subsequent distraction has made us forget, that we remember our uneasiness. I greeted the young Duke and made my way into the house. But here I must first of all record a trifling incident, which will enable us to understand something that was presently to occur\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was one person who, on that evening as on the previous evenings, had been thinking a great deal about the Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault, without however suspecting who he was: this was the usher (styled at that time the aboyeur) of Mme. de Guermantes. M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault, so far from being one of the Princess\u2019s intimate friends, albeit he was one of her cousins, had been invited to her house for the first time. His parents, who had not been on speaking terms with her for the last ten years, had been reconciled to her within the last fortnight, and, obliged to be out of Paris that evening, had requested their son to fill their place. Now, a few days earlier, the Princess\u2019s usher had met in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es a young man whom he had found charming but whose identity he had been unable to establish. Not that the young man had not shewn himself as obliging as he had been generous. All the favours that the usher had supposed that he would have to bestow upon so young a gentleman, he had on the contrary received. But M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault was as reticent as he was rash; he was all the more determined not to disclose his incognito since he did not know with what sort of person he was dealing; his fear would have been far greater, although quite unfounded, if he had known. He had confined himself to posing as an Englishman, and to all the passionate questions with which he was plied by the usher, desirous to meet again a person to whom he was indebted for so much pleasure and so ample a gratuity, the Duke had merely replied, from one end of the Avenue Gabriel to the other: \u201cI do not speak French.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albeit, in spite of everything \u2014 remembering his cousin Gilbert\u2019s maternal ancestry \u2014 the Duc de Guermantes pretended to find a touch of Courvoisier in the drawing-room of the Princesse de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, the general estimate of that lady\u2019s initiative spirit and intellectual superiority was based upon an innovation that was to be found nowhere else in her set. After dinner, however important the party that was to follow, the chairs, at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s, were arranged in such a way as to form little groups, in which people might have to turn their backs upon one another. The Princess then displayed her social sense by going to sit down, as though by preference, in one of these. Not that she was afraid to pick out and attract to herself a member of another group. If, for instance, she had remarked to M. D\u00e9taille, who naturally agreed with her, on the beauty of Mme. de Villemur\u2019s neck, of which that lady\u2019s position in another group made her present a back view, the Princess did not hesitate to raise her voice: \u201cMadame de Villemur, M. D\u00e9taille, with his wonderful painter\u2019s eye, has just been admiring your neck.\u201d Mme. de Villemur interpreted this as a direct invitation to join in the conversation; with the agility of a practiced horsewoman, she made her chair rotate slowly through three quadrants of a circle, and, without in the least disturbing her neighbours, came to rest almost facing the Princess. \u201cYou don\u2019t know M. D\u00e9taille?\u201d exclaimed their hostess, for whom her guest\u2019s nimble and modest tergiversation was not sufficient. \u201cI do not know him, but I know his work,\u201d replied Mme. de Villemur, with a respectful, engaging air, and a promptitude which many of the onlookers envied her, addressing the while to the celebrated painter whom this invocation had not been sufficient to introduce to her in a formal manner, an imperceptible bow. \u201cCome, Monsieur D\u00e9taille,\u201d said the Princess, \u201clet me introduce you to Mme. de Villemur.\u201d That lady thereupon shewed as great ingenuity in making room for the creator of the Dream as she had shewn a moment earlier in wheeling round to face him. And the Princess drew forward a chair for herself; she had indeed invoked Mme. de Villemur only to have an excuse for quitting the first group, in which she had spent the statutory ten minutes, and bestowing a similar allowance of her time upon the second. In three quarters of an hour, all the groups had received a visit from her, which seemed to have been determined in each instance by impulse and predilection, but had the paramount object of making it apparent how naturally \u201ca great lady knows how to entertain.\u201d But now the guests for the party were beginning to arrive, and the lady of the house was seated not far from the door \u2014 erect and proud in her semi-regal majesty, her eyes ablaze with their own incandescence \u2014 between two unattractive Royalties and the Spanish Ambassadress\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I stood waiting behind a number of guests who had arrived before me. Facing me was the Princess, whose beauty is probably not the only thing, where there were so many beauties, that reminds me of this party. But the face of my hostess was so perfect; stamped like so beautiful a medal, that it has retained a commemorative force in my mind. The Princess was in the habit of saying to her guests when she met them a day or two before one of her parties: \u201cYou will come, won\u2019t you?\u201d as though she felt a great desire to talk to them. But as, on the contrary, she had nothing to talk to them about, when they entered her presence she contented herself, without rising, with breaking off for an instant her vapid conversation with the two Royalties and the Ambassadress and thanking them with: \u201cHow good of you to have come,\u201d not that she thought that the guest had shewn his goodness by coming, but to enhance her own; then, at once dropping him back into the stream, she would add: \u201cYou will find M. de Guermantes by the garden door,\u201d so that the guest proceeded on his way and ceased to bother her. To some indeed she said nothing, contenting herself with shewing them her admirable onyx eyes, as though they had come merely to visit an exhibition of precious stones\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The person immediately in front of me was the Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having to respond to all the smiles, all the greetings waved to him from inside the drawing-room, he had not noticed the usher. But from the first moment the usher had recognised him. The identity of this stranger, which he had so ardently desired to learn, in another minute he would know. When he asked his \u2018Englishman\u2019 of the other evening what name he was to announce, the usher was not merely stirred, he considered that he was being indiscreet, indelicate. He felt that he was about to reveal to the whole world (which would, however, suspect nothing) a secret which it was criminal of him to force like this and to proclaim in public. Upon hearing the guest\u2019s reply: \u201cLe duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault,\u201d he felt such a burst of pride that he remained for a moment speechless. The Duke looked at him, recognised him, saw himself ruined, while the servant, who had recovered his composure and was sufficiently versed in heraldry to complete for himself an appellation that was too modest, shouted with a professional vehemence softened by an emotional tenderness: \u201cSon Altesse Monseigneur le duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault!\u201d But it was now my turn to be announced. Absorbed in contemplation of my hostess, who had not yet seen me, I had not thought of the function \u2014 terrible to me, although not in the same sense as to M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault \u2014 of this usher garbed in black like a headsman, surrounded by a group of lackeys in the most cheerful livery, lusty fellows ready to seize hold of an intruder and cast him out of doors. The usher asked me my name, I told him it as mechanically as the condemned man allows himself to be strapped to the block. At once he lifted his head majestically and, before I could beg him to announce me in a lowered tone so as to spare my own feelings if I were not invited and those of the Princesse de Guermantes if I were, shouted the disturbing syllables with a force capable of bringing down the roof\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The famous Huxley (whose grandson occupies an unassailable position in the English literary world of to-day) relates that one of his patients dared not continue to go into society because often, on the actual chair that was pointed out to her with a courteous gesture, she saw an old gentleman already seated. She could be quite certain that either the gesture of invitation or the old gentleman\u2019s presence was a hallucination, for her hostess would not have offered her a chair that was already occupied. And when Huxley, to cure her, forced her to reappear in society, she felt a moment of painful hesitation when she asked herself whether the friendly sign that was being made to her was the real thing, or, in obedience to a non-existent vision, she was about to sit down in public upon the knees of a gentleman in flesh and blood. Her brief uncertainty was agonising. Less so perhaps than mine. From the moment at which I had taken in the sound of my name, like the rumble that warns us of a possible cataclysm, I was bound, to plead my own good faith in either event, and as though I were not tormented by any doubt, to advance towards the Princess with a resolute air\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She caught sight of me when I was still a few feet away and (to leave me in no doubt that I was the victim of a conspiracy), instead of remaining seated, as she had done for her other guests, rose and came towards me. A moment later, I was able to heave the sigh of relief of Huxley\u2019s patient, when, having made up her mind to sit down on the chair, she found it vacant and realised that it was the old gentleman that was a hallucination. The Princess had just held out her hand to me with a smile. She remained standing for some moments with the kind of charm enshrined in the verse of Malherbe which ends:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo do them honour all the angels rise.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She apologised because the Duchess had not yet come, as though I must be bored there without her. In order to give me this greeting, she wheeled round me, holding me by the hand, in a graceful revolution by the whirl of which I felt myself carried off my feet. I almost expected that she would next offer me, like the leader of a cotillon, an ivory-headed cane or a watch-bracelet. She did not, however, give me anything of the sort, and as though, instead of dancing the boston, she had been listening to a sacred quartet by Beethoven the sublime strains of which she was afraid of interrupting, she cut short the conversation there and then, or rather did not begin it, and, still radiant at having seen me come in, merely informed me where the Prince was to be found\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I moved away from her and did not venture to approach her again, feeling that she had absolutely nothing to say to me and that, in her vast kindness, this woman marvellously tall and handsome, noble as were so many great ladies who stepped so proudly upon the scaffold, could only, short of offering me a draught of honeydew, repeat what she had already said to me twice: \u201cYou will find the Prince in the garden.\u201d Now, to go in search of the Prince was to feel my doubts revive in a fresh form\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any case I should have to find somebody to introduce me. One could hear, above all the din of conversation, the interminable chatter of M. de Charlus, talking to H. E. the Duke of Sidonia, whose acquaintance he had just made. Members of the same profession find one another out, and so it is with a common vice. M. de Charlus and M. de Sidonia had each of them immediately detected the other\u2019s vice, which was in both cases that of soliloquising in society, to the extent of not being able to stand any interruption. Having decided at once that, in the words of a famous sonnet, there was \u2018no help,\u2019 they had made up their minds not to be silent but each to go on talking without any regard to what the other might say. This had resulted in the confused babble produced in Moli\u00e8re\u2019s comedies by a number of people saying different things simultaneously. The Baron, with his deafening voice, was moreover certain of keeping the upper hand, of drowning the feeble voice of M. de Sidonia; without however discouraging him, for, whenever M. de Charlus paused for a moment to breathe, the interval was filled by the murmurs of the Grandee of Spain who had imperturbably continued his discourse. I could easily have asked M. de Charlus to introduce me to the Prince de Guermantes, but I feared (and with good reason) that he might be cross with me. I had treated him in the most ungrateful fashion by letting his offer pass unheeded for the second time and by never giving him a sign of my existence since the evening when he had so affectionately escorted me home. And yet I could not plead the excuse of having anticipated the scene which I had just witnessed, that very afternoon, enacted by himself and Jupien. I suspected nothing of the sort. It is true that shortly before this, when my parents reproached me with my laziness and with not having taken the trouble to write a line to M. de Charlus, I had violently reproached them with wishing me to accept a degrading proposal. But anger alone, and the desire to hit upon the expression that would be most offensive to them had dictated this mendacious retort. In reality, I had imagined nothing sensual, nothing sentimental even, underlying the Baron\u2019s offers. I had said this to my parents with entire irresponsibility. But sometimes the future is latent in us without our knowledge, and our words which we suppose to be false forecast an imminent reality\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus would doubtless have forgiven me my want of gratitude. But what made him furious was that my presence this evening at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s, as for some time past at her cousin\u2019s, seemed to be a defiance of his solemn declaration: \u201cThere is no admission to those houses save through me.\u201d A grave fault, a crime that was perhaps inexpiable, I had not followed the conventional path. M. de Charlus knew well that the thunderbolts which he hurled at those who did not comply with his orders, or to whom he had taken a dislike, were beginning to be regarded by many people, however furiously he might brandish them, as mere pasteboard, and had no longer the force to banish anybody from anywhere. But he believed perhaps that his diminished power, still considerable, remained intact in the eyes of novices like myself. And so I did not consider it well advised to ask a favour of him at a party at which the mere fact of my presence seemed an ironical denial of his pretentions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was buttonholed at that moment by a man of a distinctly common type, Professor E\u2014\u2014. He had been surprised to see me at the Guermantes\u2019. I was no less surprised to see him there, for nobody had ever seen before or was ever to see again a person of his sort at one of the Princess\u2019s parties. He had just succeeded in curing the Prince, after the last rites had been administered, of a septic pneumonia, and the special gratitude that Mme. de Guermantes felt towards him was the reason for her thus departing from custom and inviting him to her house. As he knew absolutely nobody in the rooms, and could not wander about there indefinitely by himself, like a minister of death, having recognised me, he had discovered, for the first time in his life, that he had an infinite number of things to say to me, which enabled him to assume an air of composure, and this was one of the reasons for his advancing upon me. There was also another. He attached great importance to his never being mistaken in his diagnoses. Now his correspondence was so numerous that he could not always bear in mind, when he had seen a patient once only, whether the disease had really followed the course that he had traced for it. The reader may perhaps remember that, immediately after my grandmother\u2019s stroke, I had taken her to see him, on the afternoon when he was having all his decorations stitched to his coat. After so long an interval, he no longer remembered the formal announcement which had been sent to him at the time. \u201cYour grandmother is dead, isn\u2019t she?\u201d he said to me in a voice in which a semi-certainty calmed a slight apprehension. \u201cAh! Indeed! Well, from the moment I saw her my prognosis was extremely grave, I remember it quite well.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was thus that Professor E\u2014\u2014-learned or recalled the death of my grandmother, and (I must say this to his credit, which is that of the medical profession as a whole), without displaying, without perhaps feeling, any satisfaction. The mistakes made by doctors are innumerable. They err habitually on the side of optimism as to treatment, of pessimism as to the outcome. \u201cWine? In moderation, it can do you no harm, it is always a tonic. . . . Sexual enjoyment? After all it is a natural function. I allow you to use, but not to abuse it, you understand. Excess in anything is wrong.\u201d At once, what a temptation to the patient to renounce those two life-givers, water and chastity. If, on the other hand, he has any trouble with his heart, albumen, and so forth, it never lasts for long. Disorders that are grave but purely functional are at once ascribed to an imaginary cancer. It is useless to continue visits which are powerless to eradicate an incurable malady. Let the patient, left to his own devices, thereupon subject himself to an implacable regime, and in time recover, or merely survive, and the doctor, to whom he touches his hat in the Avenue de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, when he supposed him to have long been lying in P\u00e8re Lachaise, will interpret the gesture as an act of insolent defiance. An innocent stroll, taken beneath his nose and venerable beard, would arouse no greater wrath in the Assize Judge who, two years earlier, had sentenced the rascal, now passing him with apparent impunity, to death. Doctors (we do not here include them all, of course, and make a mental reservation of certain admirable exceptions), are in general more displeased, more irritated by the quashing of their sentence than pleased by its execution. This explains why Professor E\u2014 \u2014 despite the intellectual satisfaction that he doubtless felt at finding that he had not been mistaken, was able to speak to me only with regret of the blow that had fallen upon us. He was in no hurry to cut short the conversation, which kept him in countenance and gave him a reason for remaining. He spoke to me of the great heat through which we were passing, but, albeit he was a well-read man and capable of expressing himself in good French, said to me: \u201cYou are none the worse for this hyperthermia?\u201d The fact is that medicine has made some slight advance in knowledge since Moli\u00e8re\u2019s days, but none in its vocabulary. My companion went on: \u201cThe great thing is to avoid the sudations that are caused by weather like this, especially in superheated rooms. You can remedy them, when you go home and feel thirsty, by the application of heat\u201d (by which he apparently meant hot drinks)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Owing to the circumstances of my grandmother\u2019s death, the subject interested me, and I had recently read in a book by a great specialist that perspiration was injurious to the kidneys, by making moisture pass through the skin when its proper outlet was elsewhere. I thought with regret of those dog-days at the time of my grandmother\u2019s death, and was inclined to blame them for it. I did not mention this to Dr. E\u2014 \u2014 but of his own accord he said to me: \u201cThe advantage of this very hot weather in which perspiration is abundant is that the kidney is correspondingly relieved.\u201d Medicine is not an exact science\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keeping me engaged in talk, Professor E\u2014\u2014-asked only not to be forced to leave me. But I had just seen, making a series of sweeping bows to right and left of the Princesse de Guermantes, stepping back a pace first, the Marquis de Vaugoubert. M. de Norpois had recently introduced me to him and I hoped that I might find in him a person capable of introducing me to our host. The proportions of this work do not permit me to explain here in consequence of what incidents in his youth M. de Vaugoubert was one of the few men (possibly the only man) in society who happened to be in what is called at Sodom the \u201cconfidence\u201d of M. de Charlus. But, if our Minister to the Court of King Theodosius had certain defects in common with the Baron, they were only a very pale reflexion. It was merely in an infinitely softened, sentimental and simple form that he displayed those alternations of affection and hatred through which the desire to attract, and then the fear \u2014 equally imaginary \u2014 of being, if not scorned, at any rate unmasked, made the Baron pass. Made ridiculous by a chastity, a \u2018pla-tonicism\u2019 (to which as a man of keen ambition he had, from the moment of passing his examination, sacrificed all pleasure), above all by his intellectual nullity, these alternations M. de Vaugoubert did, nevertheless, display. But whereas in M. de Charlus the immoderate praises were proclaimed with a positive burst of eloquence, and seasoned with the subtlest, the most mordant banter which marked a man for ever, by M. de Vaugoubert, on the other hand, the affection was expressed with the banality of a man of the lowest intelligence, and of a public official, the grievances (worked up generally into a complete indictment, as with the Baron) by a malevolence which, though relentless, was at the same time spiritless, and was all the more startling inasmuch as it was invariably a direct contradiction of what the Minister had said six months earlier and might soon perhaps be saying again: a regularity of change which gave an almost astronomic poetry to the various phases of M. de Vaugoubert\u2019s life, albeit apart from this nobody was ever less suggestive of a star\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The greeting that he gave me had nothing in common with that which I should have received from M. de Charlus. To this greeting M. de Vaugou-bert, apart from the thousand mannerisms which he supposed to be indicative of good breeding and diplomacy, imparted a cavalier, brisk, smiling air, which should make him seem on the one hand to be rejoicing at being alive \u2014 at a time when he was inwardly chewing the mortification of a career with no prospect of advancement and with the threat of enforced retirement \u2014 and on the other hand young, virile and charming, when he could see and no longer ventured to go and examine in the glass the lines gathering upon a face which he would have wished to keep full of seduction. Not that he would have hoped for effective conquests, the mere thought of which filled him with terror on account of what people would say, scandals, blackmail. Having passed from an almost infantile corruption to an absolute continence dating from the day on which his thoughts had turned to the Quai d\u2019Orsay and he had begun to plan a great career for himself, he had the air of a caged animal, casting in every direction glances expressive of fear, appetite and stupidity. This last was so dense that he did not reflect that the street-arabs of his adolescence were boys no longer, and when a newsvendor bawled in his face: \u201cLa Presse!\u201d even more than with longing he shuddered with terror, imagining himself recognised and denounced\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But in default of the pleasures sacrificed to the ingratitude of the Quai d\u2019Orsay, M. de Vaugoubert \u2014 and it was for this that he was anxious still to attract \u2014 was liable to sudden stirrings of the heart. Heaven knows with how many letters he would overwhelm the Ministry (what personal ruses he would employ, the drafts that he made upon the credit of Mme. de Vaugoubert, who, on account of her corpulence, her exalted birth, her masculine air, and above all the mediocrity of her husband, was reputed to be endowed with eminent capacities and to be herself for all practical purposes the Minister), to introduce without any valid reason a young man destitute of all merit into the staff of the Legation. It is true that a few months, a few years later, the insignificant attach\u00e9 had only to appear, without the least trace of any hostile intention, to have shown signs of coldness towards his chief for the latter, supposing himself scorned or betrayed, to devote the same hysterical ardour to punishing him with which he had showered favours upon him in the past. He would move heaven and earth to have him recalled and the Director of Political Affairs would receive a letter daily: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hurry up and rid me of that lascar. Give him a dressing down in his own interest. What he needs is a slice of humble pie.\u201d The post of attach\u00e9 at the court of King Theodosius was on this account far from enjoyable. But in all other respects, thanks to his perfect common sense as a man of the world, M. de Vaugoubert was one of the best representatives of the French Government abroad. When a man who was reckoned a superior person, a Jacobin, with an expert knowledge of all subjects, replaced him later on, it was not long before war broke out between France and the country over which that monarch reigned\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Vaugoubert, like M. de Charlus, did not care to be the first to give a greeting. Each of them preferred to \u2018respond,\u2019 being constantly afraid of the gossip which the person to whom otherwise they might have offered their hand might have heard about them since their last meeting. In my case, M. de Vaugoubert had no need to ask himself this question, I had as a matter of fact gone up of my own accord to greet him, if only because of the difference in our ages. He replied with an air of wonder and delight, his eyes continuing to stray as though there had been a patch of clover on either side of me upon which he was forbidden to graze. I felt that it would be more becoming to ask him to introduce me to Mme. de Vaugoubert, before effecting that introduction to the Prince which I decided not to mention to him until afterwards. The idea of making me acquainted with his wife seemed to fill him with joy, for his own sake as well as for hers, and he led me at a solemn pace towards the Marquise. Arriving in front of her, and indicating me with his hand and eyes, with every conceivable mark of consideration, he nevertheless remained silent and withdrew after a few moments, in a sidelong fashion, leaving me alone with his wife. She had at once given me her hand, but without knowing to whom this token of friendship was addressed, for I realised that M. de Vaugoubert had forgotten my name, perhaps even had failed to recognise me, and being unwilling, from politeness, to confess his ignorance had made the introduction consist in a mere dumb show. And so I was no further advanced; how was I to get myself introduced to my host by a woman who did not know my name? Worse still, I found myself obliged to remain for some moments talking to Mme. de Vaugoubert. And this annoyed me for two reasons. I had no wish to remain all night at this party, for I had arranged with Albertine (I had given her a box for Ph\u00e8dre) that she was to pay me a visit shortly before midnight. Certainly I was not in the least in love with her; I was yielding, in making her come this evening, to a wholly sensual desire, albeit we were at that torrid period of the year when sensuality, evaporating, visits more readily the organ of taste, seeks above all things coolness. More than for the kiss of a girl, it thirsts for orangeade, for a cold bath, or even to gaze at that peeled and juicy moon which was quenching the thirst of heaven. I counted however upon ridding myself, in Albertine\u2019s company \u2014 which, moreover, reminded me of the coolness of the sea \u2014 of the regret that I should not fail to feel for many charming faces (for it was a party quite as much for girls as for married women that the Princess was giving. On the other hand, the face of the imposing Mme. de Vaugoubert, Bourbonian and morose, was in no way attractive)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People said at the Ministry, without any suggestion of malice, that in their household it was the husband who wore the petticoats and the wife the trousers. Now there was more truth in this saying than was supposed. Mme. de Vaugoubert was really a man. Whether she had always been one, or had grown to be as I saw her, matters little, for in either case we have to deal with one of the most touching miracles of nature which, in the latter alternative especially, makes the human kingdom resemble the kingdom of flowers. On the former hypothesis \u2014 if the future Mme. de Vaugoubert had always been so clumsily manlike \u2014 nature, by a fiendish and beneficent ruse, bestows on the girl the deceiving aspect of a man. And the youth who has no love for women and is seeking to be cured greets with joy this subterfuge of discovering a bride who figures in his eyes as a market porter. In the alternative case, if the woman has not originally these masculine characteristics, she adopts them by degrees, to please her husband, and even unconsciously, by that sort of mimicry which makes certain flowers assume the appearance of the insects which they seek to attract. Her regret that she is not loved, that she is not a man, virilises her. Indeed, quite apart from the case that we are now considering, who has not remarked how often the most normal couples end by resembling each other, at times even by an exchange of qualities? A former German Chancellor, Prince von B\u00f9low, married an Italian. In the course of time, on the Pincio, it was remarked how much the Teutonic husband had absorbed of Italian delicacy, and the Italian Princess of German coarseness. To turn aside to a point without the province of the laws which we are now tracing, everyone knows an eminent French diplomat, whose origin was at first suggested only by his name, one of the most illustrious in the East. As he matured, as he grew old, there was revealed in him the Oriental whom no one had ever suspected, and now when we see him we regret the absence of the fez that would complete the picture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To revert to habits completely unknown to the ambassador whose profile, coarsened by heredity, we have just recalled, Mme. de Vaugoubert realised the acquired or predestined type, the immortal example of which is the Princess Palatine, never out of a riding habit, who, having borrowed from her husband more than his virility, championing the defects of the men who do not care for women, reports in her familiar correspondence the mutual relations of all the great noblemen of the court of Louis XIV. One of the reasons which enhance still farther the masculine air of women like Mme. de Vaugoubert is that the neglect which they receive from their husbands, the shame that they feel at such neglect, destroy in them by degrees everything that is womanly. They end by acquiring both the good and the bad qualities which their husbands lack. The more frivolous, effeminate, indiscreet their husbands are, the more they grow into the effigy, devoid of charm, of the virtues which their husbands ought to practise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Traces of abasement, boredom, indignation, marred the regular features of Mme. de Vaugoubert. Alas, I felt that she was regarding me with interest and curiosity as one of those young men who appealed to M. de Vaugoubert, and one of whom she herself would so much have liked to be, now that her husband, growing old, shewed a preference for youth. She was gazing at me with the close attention shewn by provincial ladies who from an illustrated catalogue copy the tailor-made dress so becoming to the charming person in the picture (actually, the same person on every page, but deceptively multiplied into different creatures, thanks to the differences of pose and the variety of attire). The instinctive attraction which urged Mme. de Vaugoubert towards me was so strong that she went the length of seizing my arm, so that I might take her to get a glass of orangeade. But I released myself, alleging that I must presently be going, and had not yet been introduced to our host\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This distance between me and the garden door where he stood talking to a group of people was not very great. But it alarmed me more than if, in order to cross it, I should have to expose myself to a continuous hail of fire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A number of women from whom I felt that I might be able to secure an introduction were in the garden, where, while feigning an ecstatic admiration, they were at a loss for an occupation. Parties of this sort are as a rule premature. They have little reality until the following day, when they occupy the attention of the people who were not invited. A real author, devoid of the foolish self-esteem of so many literary people, if, when he reads an article by a critic who has always expressed the greatest admiration for his works, he sees the names of various inferior writers mentioned, but not his own, has no time to stop and consider what might be to him a matter for astonishment: his books are calling him. But a society woman has nothing to do and, on seeing in the Figaro: \u201cLast night the Prince and Princesse de Guermantes gave a large party,\u201d etc., exclaims: \u201cWhat! Only three days ago I talked to Marie-Gilbert for an hour, and she never said a word about it!\u201d and racks her brains to discover how she can have offended the Guermantes. It must be said that, so far as the Princess\u2019s parties were concerned, the astonishment was sometimes as great among those who were invited as among those who were not. For they would burst forth at the moment when one least expected them, and summoned in people whose existence Mme. de Guermantes had forgotten for years. And almost all the people in society are so insignificant that others of their sort adopt, in judging them, only the measure of their social success, cherish them if they are invited, if they are omitted detest them. As to the latter, if it was the fact that the Princess often, even when they were her friends, did not invite them, that was often due to her fear of annoying \u2018Palamede,\u2019 who had excommunicated them. And so I might be certain that she had not spoken of me to M. de Charlus, for otherwise I should not have found myself there. He meanwhile was posted between the house and the garden, by the side of the German Ambassador, leaning upon the balustrade of the great staircase which led from the garden to the house, so that the other guests, in spite of the three or four feminine admirers who were grouped round the Baron and almost concealed him, were obliged to greet him as they passed. He responded by naming each of them in turn. And one heard an incessant: \u201cGood evening, Monsieur du Hazay, good evening, Madame de la Tour du Pin-Verclause, good evening, Madame de la Tour du Pin-Gouvernet, good evening, Philibert, good evening, my dear Ambassadress,\u201d and so on. This created a continuous barking sound, interspersed with benevolent suggestions or inquiries (to the answers to which he paid no attention), which M. de Charlus addressed to them in a tone softened, artificial to shew his indifference, and benign: \u201cTake care the child doesn\u2019t catch cold, it is always rather damp in the gardens. Good evening, Madame de Brantes. Good evening, Madame de Mecklembourg. Have you brought your daughter? Is she wearing that delicious pink frock? Good evening, Saint-Geran.\u201d Certainly there was an element of pride in this attitude, for M. de Charlus was aware that he was a Guermantes, and that he occupied a supreme place at this party. But there was more in it than pride, and the very word f\u00eate suggested, to the man with aesthetic gifts, the luxurious, curious sense that it might bear if this party were being given not by people in contemporary society but in a painting by Carpaccio or Veronese. It is indeed highly probable that the German Prince that M. de Charlus was must rather have been picturing to himself the reception that occurs in Tannh\u00e4user, and himself as the Margrave, standing at the entrance to the Warburg with a kind word of condescension for each of his guests, while their procession into the castle or the park is greeted by the long phrase, a hundred times renewed, of the famous March\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I must, however, make up my mind. I could distinguish beneath the trees various women with whom I was more or less closely acquainted, but they seemed transformed because they were at the Princess\u2019s and not at her cousin\u2019s, and because I saw them seated not in front of Dresden china plates but beneath the boughs of a chestnut. The refinement of their setting mattered nothing. Had it been infinitely less refined than at Oriane\u2019s, I should have felt the same uneasiness. When the electric light in our drawing-room fails, and we are obliged to replace it with oil lamps, everything seems altered. I was recalled from my uncertainty by Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. \u201cGood evening,\u201d she said as she approached me. \u201cHave you seen the Duchesse de Guermantes lately?\u201d She excelled in giving to speeches of this sort an intonation which proved that she was not uttering them from sheer silliness, like people who, not knowing what to talk about, come up to you a thousand times over to mention some bond of common acquaintance, often extremely slight. She had on the contrary a fine conducting wire in her glance which signified: \u201cDon\u2019t suppose for a moment that I haven\u2019t recognised you. You are the young man I met at the Duchesse de Guermantes. I remember quite well.\u201d Unfortunately, this protection, extended over me by this phrase, stupid in appearance but delicate in intention, was extremely fragile, and vanished as soon as I tried to make use of it. Madame de Souvr\u00e9 had the art, if called upon to convey a request to some influential person, of appearing at the same time, in the petitioner\u2019s eyes, to be recommending him, and in those of the influential person not to be recommending the petitioner, so that her ambiguous gesture opened a credit balance of gratitude to her with the latter without placing her in any way in debt to the former. Encouraged by this lady\u2019s civilities to ask her to introduce me to M. de Guermantes, I found that she took advantage of a moment when our host was not looking in our direction, laid a motherly hand on my shoulder, and, smiling at the averted face of the Prince who was unable to see her, thrust me towards him with a gesture of feigned protection, but deliberately ineffective, which left me stranded almost at my starting point. Such is the cowardice of people in society\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That of a lady who came to greet me, addressing me by my name, was greater still. I tried to recall her own name as I talked to her; I remembered quite well having met her at dinner, I could remember things that she had said. But my attention, concentrated upon the inward region in which these memories of her lingered, was unable to discover her name there. It was there, nevertheless. My thoughts began playing a sort of game with it to grasp its outlines, its initial letter, and so finally to bring the whole name to light. It was labour in vain, I could more or less estimate its mass, its weight, but as for its forms, confronting them with the shadowy captive lurking in the inward night, I said to myself: \u201cIt is not that.\u201d Certainly my mind would have been capable of creating the most difficult names. Unfortunately, it had not to create but to reproduce. All action by the mind is easy, if it is not subjected to the test of reality. Here, I was forced to own myself beaten. Finally, in a flash, the name came back to me as a whole: \u2018Madame d\u2019Arpajon.\u2019 I am wrong in saying that it came, for it did not, I think, appear to me by a spontaneous propulsion. I do not think either that the many slight memories which associated me with the lady, and to which I did not cease to appeal for help (by such exhortations as: \u201cCome now, it is the lady who is a friend of Mme. de Souvr\u00e9, who feels for Victor Hugo so artless an admiration, mingled with so much alarm and horror,\u201d)\u2014 I do not believe that all these memories, hovering between me and her name, served in any way to bring it to light. In that great game of hide and seek which is played in our memory when we seek to recapture a name, there is not any series of gradual approximations. We see nothing, then suddenly the name appears in its exact form and very different from what we thought we could make out. It is not the name that has come to us. No, I believe rather that, as we go on living, we pass our time in keeping away from the zone in which a name is distinct, and it was by an exercise of my will and attention which increased the acuteness of my inward vision that all of a sudden I had pierced the semi-darkness and seen daylight. In any case, if there are transitions between oblivion and memory, then, these transitions are unconscious. For the intermediate names through which we pass, before finding the real name, are themselves false, and bring us nowhere nearer to it. They are not even, properly speaking, names at all, but often mere consonants which are nol to be found in the recaptured name. And yet, this operation of the mind passing from a blank to reality is so mysterious, that it is possible after all that these false consonants are really handles, awkwardly held out to enable us to seize hold of the correct name. \u201cAll this,\u201d the reader will remark, \u201ctells us nothing as to the lady\u2019s failure to oblige; but since you have made so long a digression, allow me, gentle author, to waste another moment of your time in telling you that it is a pity that, young as you were (or as your hero was, if he be not yourself), you had already so feeble a memory that you could not recall the name of a lady whom you knew quite well.\u201d It is indeed a pity, gentle reader. And sadder than you think when one feels the time approaching when names and words will vanish from the clear zone of consciousness, and when one must for ever cease to name to oneself the people whom one has known most intimately. It is indeed a pity that one should require this effort, when one is still young, to recapture names which one knows quite well. But if this infirmity occurred only in the case of names barely known, quite naturally forgotten, names which one would not take the trouble to remember, the infirmity would not be without its advantages. \u201cAnd what are they, may I ask?\u201d Well, Sir, that the malady alone makes us remark and apprehend, and allows us to dissect the mechanism of which otherwise we should know nothing. A man who, night after night, falls like a lump of lead upon his bed, and ceases to live until the moment when he wakes and rises, will such a man ever dream of making, I do not say great discoveries, but even minute observations upon sleep? He barely knows that he does sleep. A little insomnia is not without its value in making us appreciate sleep, in throwing a ray of light upon that darkness. A memory without fault is not a very powerful incentive to studying the phenomena of memory. \u201cIn a word, did Mme. d\u2019Arpajon introduce you to the Prince?\u201d No, but be quiet and let me go on with my story\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. d\u2019Arpajon was even more cowardly than Mme. de Souvr\u00e9, but there was more excuse for her cowardice. She knew that she had always had very little influence in society. This influence, such as it was, had been reduced still farther by her connexion with the Duc de Guermantes; his desertion of her dealt it the final blow. The resentment which she felt at my request that she should introduce me to the Prince produced a silence which, she was artless enough to suppose, conveyed the impression that she had not heard what I said. She was not even aware that she was knitting her brows with anger. Perhaps, on the other hand, she was aware of it, did not bother about the inconsistency, and made use of it for the lesson which she was thus able to teach me without undue rudeness; I mean a silent lesson, but none the less eloquent for that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from this, Mme. d\u2019Arpajon was extremely annoyed; many eyes were raised in the direction of a renaissance balcony at the corner of which, instead of one of those monumental statues which were so often used as ornaments at that period, there leaned, no less sculptural than they, the magnificent Marquise de Surgis-le-Duc, who had recently succeeded Mme. d\u2019Arpajon in the heart of Basin de Guermantes. Beneath the flimsy white tulle which protected her from the cool night air, one saw the supple form of a winged victory. I had no recourse left save to M. de Charlus, who had withdrawn to a room downstairs which opened on the garden. I had plenty of time (as he was pretending to be absorbed in a fictitious game of whist which enabled him to appear not to notice people) to admire the deliberate, artistic simplicity of his evening coat which, by the merest trifles which only a tailor\u2019s eye could have picked out, had the air of a \u2018Harmony in Black and White\u2019 by Whistler; black, white and red, rather, for M. de Charlus was wearing, hanging from a broad ribbon pinned to the lapel of his coat, the Cross, in white, black and red enamel, of a Knight of the religious Order of Malta. At that moment the Baron\u2019s game was interrupted by Mme. de Gallardon, leading her nephew, the Vicomte de Cour-voisier, a young man with an attractive face and an impertinent air. \u201cCousin,\u201d said Mme. de Gallardon, \u201callow me to introduce my nephew Adalbert. Adalbert, you remember the famous Palam\u00e8de of whom you have heard so much.\u201d \u201cGood evening, Madame de Gallardon,\u201d M. de Charlus replied. And he added, without so much as a glance at the young man: \u201cGood evening, Sir,\u201d with a truculent air and in a tone so violently discourteous that everyone in the room was stupefied. Perhaps M. de Charlus, knowing that Mme. de Gallardon had her doubts as to his morals and guessing that she had not been able to resist, for once in a way, the temptation to allude to them, was determined to nip in the bud any scandal that she might have embroidered upon a friendly reception of her nephew, making at the same time a resounding profession of indifference with regard to young men in general; perhaps he had not considered that the said Adalbert had responded to his aunt\u2019s speech with a sufficiently respectful air; perhaps, desirous of making headway in time to come with so attractive a cousin, he chose to give himself the advantage of a preliminary assault, like those sovereigns who, before engaging upon diplomatic action, strengthen it by an act of war\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not so difficult as I supposed to secure M. de Charlus\u2019s consent to my request that he should introduce me to the Prince de Guermantes. For one thing, in the course of the last twenty years, this Don Quixote had tilted against so many windmills (often relatives who, he imagined, had behaved badly to him), he had so frequently banned people as being \u2018impossible to have in the house\u2019 from being invited by various male or female Guermantes, that these were beginning to be afraid of quarrelling with all the people they knew and liked, of condemning themselves to a lifelong deprivation of the society of certain newcomers whom they were curious to meet, by espousing the thunderous but unexplained rancours of a brother-in-law or cousin who expected them to abandon for his sake, wife, brother, children. More intelligent than the other Guermantes, M. de Charlus realised that people were ceasing to pay any attention, save once in a while, to his veto, and, looking to the future, fearing lest one day it might be with his society that they would dispense, he had begun to make allowances, to reduce, as the saying is, his terms. Furthermore, if he had the faculty of ascribing for months, for years on end, an identical life to a detested person \u2014 to such an one he would not have tolerated their sending an invitation, and would have fought, rather, like a trooper, against a queen, the status of the person who stood in his way ceasing to count for anything in his eyes; on the other hand, his explosions of wrath were too frequent not to be somewhat fragmentary. \u201cThe imbecile, the rascal! We shall have to put him in his place, sweep him into the gutter, where unfortunately he will not be innocuous to the health of the town,\u201d he would scream, even when he was alone in his own room, while reading a letter that he considered irreverent, or upon recalling some remark that had been repeated to him. But a fresh outburst against a second imbecile cancelled the first, and the former victim had only to shew due deference for the crisis that he had occasioned to be forgotten, it not having lasted long enough to establish a foundation of hatred upon which to build. And so, I might perhaps \u2014 despite his ill-humour towards me \u2014 have been successful when I asked him to introduce me to the Prince, had I not been so ill-inspired as to add, from a scruple of conscience, and so that he might not suppose me guilty of the indelicacy of entering the house at a venture, counting upon him to enable me to remain there: \u201cYou are aware that I know them quite well, the Princess has been very kind to me.\u201d \u201cVery well, if you know them, why do you need me to introduce you?\u201d he replied in a sharp tone, and, turning his back, resumed his make-believe game with the Nuncio, the German Ambassador and another personage whom I did not know by sight\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, from the depths of those gardens where in days past the Duc d\u2019Aiguillon used to breed rare animals, there came to my ears, through the great, open doors, the sound of a sniffing nose that was savouring all those refinements and determined to miss none of them. The sound approached, I moved at a venture in its direction, with the result that the words good evening were murmured in my ear by M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, not like the rusty metallic-sound of a knife being sharpened on a grindstone, even less like the cry of the wild boar, devastator of tilled fields, but like the voice of a possible saviour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Less influential than Mme. de Souvr\u00e9, but less deeply ingrained than she with the incapacity to oblige, far more at his ease with the Prince than was Mme. d\u2019Arpajon, entertaining some illusion perhaps as to my position in the Guermantes set, or perhaps knowing more about it than myself, I had nevertheless for the first few moments some difficulty in arresting his attention, for, with fluttering, distended nostrils, he was turning in every direction, inquisitively protruding his monocle, as though he found himself face to face with five hundred matchless works of art. But, having heard my request, he received it with satisfaction, led me towards the Prince and presented me to him with a relishing, ceremonious, vulgar air, as though he had been handing him, with a word of commendation, a plate of cakes. Just as the greeting of the Duc de Guermantes was, when he chose, friendly, instinct with good fellowship, cordial and familiar, so I found that of the Prince stiff, solemn, haughty. He barely smiled at me, addressed me gravely as \u2018Sir.\u2019 I had often heard the Duke make fun of his cousin\u2019s stiffness. But from the first words that he addressed to me, which by their cold and serious tone formed the most entire contrast with the language of Basin, I realised at once that the fundamentally disdainful man was the Duke, who spoke to you at your first meeting with him as \u2018man to man,\u2019 and that, of the two cousins, the one who was really simple was the Prince. I found in his reserve a stronger feeling, I do not say of equality, for that would have been inconceivable to him, but at least of the consideration which one may shew for an inferior, such as may be found in all strongly hierarchical societies; in the Law Courts, for instance, in a Faculty, where a public prosecutor or dean, conscious of their high charge, conceal perhaps more genuine simplicity, and, when you come to know them better, more kindness, true simplicity, cordiality, beneath their traditional aloofness than the more modern brethren beneath their jocular affectation of comradeship. \u201cDo you intend to follow the career of Monsieur, your father?\u201d he said to me with a distant but interested air. I answered his question briefly, realising that he had asked it only out of politeness, and moved away to allow him to greet the fresh arrivals\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I caught sight of Swann, and meant to speak to him, but at that moment I saw that the Prince de Guermantes, instead of waiting where he was to receive the greeting of \u2014 Odette\u2019s husband, had immediately, with the force of a suction pump, carried him off to the farther end of the garden, in order, as some said, \u2018to shew him the door.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So entirely absorbed in the company that I did not learn until two days later, from the newspapers, that a Czech orchestra had been playing throughout the evening, and that Bengal lights had been burning in constant succession, I recovered some power of attention with the idea of going to look at the celebrated fountain of Hubert Robert\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a clearing surrounded by fine trees several of which were as old as itself, set in a place apart, one could see it in the distance, slender, immobile, stiffened, allowing the breeze to stir only the lighter fall of its pale and quivering plume. The eighteenth century had refined the elegance of its lines, but, by fixing the style of the jet, seemed to have arrested its life; at this distance one had the impression of a work of art rather than the sensation of water. The moist cloud itself that was perpetually gathering at its crest preserved the character of the period like those that in the sky assemble round the palaces of Versailles. But from a closer view one realised that, while it respected, like the stones of an ancient palace, the design traced for it beforehand, it was a constantly changing stream of water that, springing upwards and seeking to obey the architect\u2019s traditional orders, performed them to the letter only by seeming to infringe them, its thousand separate bursts succeeding only at a distance in giving the impression of a single flow. This was in reality as often interrupted as the scattering of the fall, whereas from a distance it had appeared to me unyielding, solid, unbroken in its continuity. From a little nearer, one saw that this continuity, apparently complete, was assured, at every point in the ascent of the jet, wherever it must otherwise have been broken, by the entering into line, by the lateral incorporation of a parallel jet which mounted higher than the first and was itself, at an altitude greater but already a strain upon its endurance, relieved by a third. Seen close at hand, drops without strength fell back from the column of water crossing on their way their climbing sisters and, at times, torn, caught in an eddy of the night air, disturbed by this ceaseless flow, floated awhile before being drowned in the basin. They teased with their hesitations, with their passage in the opposite direction, and blurred with their soft vapour the vertical tension of that stem, bearing aloft an oblong cloud composed of a thousand tiny drops, but apparently painted in an unchanging, golden brown which rose, unbreakable, constant, urgent, swift, to mingle with the clouds in the sky. Unfortunately, a gust of wind was enough to scatter it obliquely on the ground; at times indeed a single jet, disobeying its orders, swerved and, had they not kept a respectful distance, would have drenched to their skins the incautious crowd of gazers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of these little accidents, which could scarcely occur save when the breeze freshened for a moment, was distinctly unpleasant. Somebody had told Mme. d\u2019Arpajon that the Duc de Guermantes, who as a matter of fact had not yet arrived, was with Mme. de Surgis in one of the galleries of pink marble to which one ascended by the double colonnade, hollowed out of the wall, which rose from the brink of the fountain. Now, just as Mme. d\u2019Arpajon was making for one of these staircases, a strong gust of warm air made the jet of water swerve and inundated the fair lady so completely that, the water streaming down from her open bosom inside her dress, she was soaked as if she had been plunged into a bath. Whereupon, a few feet away, a rhythmical roar resounded, loud enough to be heard by a whole army, and at the same time protracted in periods as though it were being addressed not to the army as a whole but to each unit in turn; it was the Grand Duke Vladimir, who was laughing wholeheartedly upon seeing the immersion of Mme. d\u2019Arpajon, one of the funniest sights, as he was never tired of repeating afterwards, that he had ever seen in his life. Some charitable persons having suggested to the Muscovite that a word of sympathy from himself was perhaps deserved and would give pleasure to the lady who, notwithstanding her tale of forty winters fully told, wiping herself with her scarf, without appealing to anyone for help, was stepping clear in spite of the water that was maliciously spilling over the edge of the basin, the Grand Duke, who had a kind heart, felt that he must say a word in season, and, before the last military tattoo of his laughter had altogether subsided, one heard a fresh roar, more vociferous even than the last. \u201cBravo, old girl!\u201d he cried, clapping his hands as though at the theatre. Mme. d\u2019Arpajon was not at all pleased that her dexterity should be commended at the expense of her youth. And when some one remarked to her, in a voice drowned by the roar of the water, over which nevertheless rose the princely thunder: \u201cI think His Imperial Highness said something to you.\u201d \u201cNo! It was to Mme. de Souvr\u00e9,\u201d was her reply\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I passed through the gardens and returned by the stair, upon which the absence of the Prince, who had vanished with Swann, enlarged the crowd of guests round M. de Charlus, just as, when Louis XIV was not at Versailles, there was a more numerous attendance upon Monsieur, his brother. I was stopped on my way by the Baron, while behind me two ladies and a young man came up to greet him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is nice to see you here,\u201d he said to me, as he held out his hand. \u201cGood evening, Madame de la Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, good evening, my dear Herminie.\u201d But doubtless the memory of what he had said to me as to his own supreme position in the H\u00f4tel Guermantes made him wish to appear to be feeling, with regard to a matter which annoyed him but which he had been unable to prevent, a satisfaction which his high-and-mighty impertinence and his hysterical excitement immediately invested in a cloak of exaggerated irony. \u201cIt is nice,\u201d he repeated, \u201cbut it is, really, very odd.\u201d And he broke into peals of laughter which appeared to be indicative at once of his joy and of the inadequacy of human speech to express it. Certain persons, meanwhile, who knew both how difficult he was of access and how prone to insolent retorts, had been drawn towards us by curiosity, and, with an almost indecent haste, took to their heels. \u201cCome, now, don\u2019t be cross,\u201d he said to me, patting me gently on the shoulder, \u201cyou know that I am your friend. Good evening, Antioche, good evening, Louis-Ren\u00e9. Have you been to look at the fountain?\u201d he asked me in a tone that was affirmative rather than questioning. \u201cIt is quite pretty, ain\u2019t it? It is marvellous. It might be made better still, naturally, if certain things were removed, and then there would be nothing like it in France. But even as it stands, it is quite one of the best things. Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 will tell you that it was a mistake to put lamps round it, to try and make people forget that it was he who was responsible for that absurd idea. But after all he has only managed to spoil it a very little. It is far more difficult to deface a great work of art than to create one. Not that we had not a vague suspicion all the time that Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 was not quite a match for Hubert Robert.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I drifted back into the stream of guests who were entering the house. \u201cHave you seen my delicious cousin Oriane lately?\u201d I was asked by the Princess who had now deserted her post by the door and with whom I was making my way back to the rooms. \u201cShe\u2019s sure to be here to-night, I saw her this afternoon,\u201d my hostess added. \u201cShe promised me to come. I believe too that you will be dining with us both to meet the Queen of Italy, at the Embassy, on Thursday. There are to be all the Royalties imaginable, it will be most alarming.\u201d They could not in any way alarm the Princesse de Guermantes, whose rooms swarmed with them, and who would say: \u2018My little Coburgs\u2019 as she might have said \u2018my little dogs.\u2019 And so Mme. de Guermantes said: \u201cIt will be most alarming,\u201d out of sheer silliness, which, among people in society, overrides even their vanity. With regard to her own pedigree, she knew less than a passman in history. As for the people of her circle, she liked to shew that she knew the nicknames with which they had been labelled. Having asked me whether I was dining, the week after, with the Marquise de la Pommeli\u00e8re, who was often called \u2018la Pomme,\u2019 the Princess, having elicited a reply in the negative, remained silent for some moments. Then, without any other motive than a deliberate display of instinctive erudition, banality, and conformity to the prevailing spirit, she added: \u201cShe\u2019s not a bad sort, the Pomme!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the Princess was talking to me, it so happened that the Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes made their entrance. But I could not go at once to greet them, for I was waylaid by the Turkish Ambassadress, who, pointing to our hostess whom I had just left, exclaimed as she seized me by the arm: \u201cAh! What a delicious woman the Princess is! What a superior being! I feel sure that, if I were a man,\u201d she went on, with a trace of Oriental servility and sensuality, \u201cI would give my life for that heavenly creature.\u201d I replied that I did indeed find her charming, but that I knew her cousin, the Duchess, better. \u201cBut there is no comparison,\u201d said the Ambassadress. \u201cOriane is a charming society woman who gets her wit from M\u00eame and Babal, whereas Marie-Gilbert is somebody.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I never much like to be told like this, without a chance to reply, what I ought to think about people whom I know. And there was no reason why the Turkish Ambassadress should be in any way better qualified than myself to judge of the worth of the Duchesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand (and this explained also my annoyance with the Ambassadress), the defects of a mere acquaintance, and even of a friend, are to us real poisons, against which we are fortunately \u2018mithridated.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, without applying any standard of scientific comparison and talking of anaphylaxis, let us say that, at the heart of our friendly or purely social relations, there lurks a hostility momentarily cured but recurring by fits and starts. As a rule, we suffer little from these poisons, so long as people are \u2018natural.\u2019 By saying \u2018Babal\u2019 and \u2018M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 to indicate people with whom she was not acquainted, the Turkish Ambassadress suspended the effects of the \u2018mithridatism\u2019 which, as a rule, made me find her tolerable. She annoyed me, which was all the more unfair, inasmuch as she did not speak like this to make me think that she was an intimate friend of \u2018M\u00e9m\u00e9,\u2019 but owing to a too rapid education which made her name these noble lords according to what she believed to be the custom of the country. She had crowded her course into a few months, and had not picked up the rules. But, on thinking it over, I found another reason for my disinclination to remain in the Ambassadress\u2019s company. It was not so very long since, at Oriane\u2019s, this same diplomatic personage had said to me, with a purposeful and serious air, that she found the Princesse de Guermantes frankly antipathetic. I felt that I need not stop to consider this change of front: the invitation to the party this evening had brought it about. The Ambassadress was perfectly sincere when she told me that the Princesse de Guermantes was a sublime creature. She had always thought so. But, having never before been invited to the Princess\u2019s house, she had felt herself bound to give this non-invitation the appearance of a deliberate abstention on principle. Now that she had been asked, and would presumably continue to be asked in the future, she could give free expression to her feelings. There is no need, in accounting for three out of four of the opinions that we hold about other people, to go so far as crossed love or exclusion from public office. Our judgment remains uncertain: the withholding or bestowal of an invitation determines it. Anyhow, the Turkish Ambassadress, as the Baronne de Guermantes remarked while making a tour of inspection through the rooms with me, \u2018was all right.\u2019 She was, above all, extremely useful. The real stars of society are tired of appearing there. He who is curious to gaze at them must often migrate to another hemisphere, where they are more or less alone. But women like the Ottoman Ambassadress, of quite recent admission to society, are never weary of shining there, and, so to speak, everywhere at once. They are of value at entertainments of the sort known as soir\u00e9e or rout, to which they would let themselves be dragged from their deathbeds rather than miss one. They are the supers upon whom a hostess can always count, determined never to miss a party. And so, the foolish young men, unaware that they are false stars, take them for the queens of fashion, whereas it would require a formal lecture to explain to them by virtue of what reasons Mme. Standish, who, her existence unknown to them, lives remote from the world, painting cushions, is at least as great a lady as the Duchesse de Doudeauville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the ordinary course of life, the eyes of the Duchesse de Guermantes were absent and slightly melancholy, she made them sparkle with a. flame of wit only when she had to say how-d\u2019ye-do to a friend; precisely as though the said friend had been some witty remark, some charming touch, some titbit for delicate palates, the savour of which has set on the face of the connoisseur an expression of refined joy. But upon big evenings, as she had too many greetings to bestow, she decided that it would be tiring to have to switch off the light after each. Just as an ardent reader, when he goes to the theatre to see a new piece by one of the masters of the stage, testifies to his certainty that he is not going to spend a dull evening by having, while he hands his hat and coat to the attendant, his lip adjusted in readiness for a sapient smile, his eye kindled for a sardonic approval; similarly it was at the moment of her arrival that the Duchess lighted up for the whole evening. And while she was handing over her evening cloak, of a magnificent Tiepolo red, exposing a huge collar of rubies round her neck, having cast over her gown that final rapid, minute and exhaustive dressmaker\u2019s glance which is also that of a woman of the world, Oriane made sure that her eyes, just as much as her other jewels, were sparkling. In vain might sundry \u2018kind friends\u2019 such as M. de Janville fling themselves upon the Duke to keep him from entering: \u201cBut don\u2019t you know that poor Mama is at his last gasp? He had had the Sacraments.\u201d \u201cI know, I know,\u201d answered M. de Guermantes, thrusting the tiresome fellow aside in order to enter the room. \u201cThe viaticum has acted splendidly,\u201d he added, with a smile of pleasure at the thought of the ball which he was determined not to miss after the Prince\u2019s party. \u201cWe did not want people to know that we had come back,\u201d the Duchess said to me. She never suspected that the Princess had already disproved this statement by telling me that she had seen her cousin for a moment, who had promised to come. The Duke, after a protracted stare with which he proceeded to crush his wife for the space of five minutes, observed: \u201cI told Oriane about your misgivings.\u201d Now that she saw that they were unfounded, and that she herself need take no action in the attempt to dispel them, she pronounced them absurd, and continued to chaff me about them. \u201cThe idea of supposing that you were not invited! Besides, wasn\u2019t I there? Do you suppose that I should be unable to get you an invitation to my cousin\u2019s house?\u201d I must admit that frequently, after this, she did things for me that were far more difficult; nevertheless, I took care not to interpret her words in the sense that I had been too modest. I was beginning to learn the exact value of the language, spoken or mute, of aristocratic affability, an affability that is happy to shed balm upon the sense of inferiority in those persons towards whom it is directed, though not to the point of dispelling that sense, for in that case it would no longer have any reason to exist. \u201cBut you are our equal, if not our superior,\u201d the Guermantes seemed, in all their actions, to be saying; and they said it in the most courteous fashion imaginable, to be loved, admired, but not to be believed; that one should discern the fictitious character of this affability was what they called being well-bred; to suppose it to be genuine, a sign of ill-breeding. I was to receive, as it happened, shortly after this, a lesson which gave me a full and perfect understanding of the extent and limitations of certain forms of aristocratic affability. It was at an afternoon party given by the Duchesse de Montmorency to meet the Queen of England; there was a sort of royal procession to the buffet, at the head of which walked Her Majesty on the arm of the Duc de Guermantes. I happened to arrive at that moment. With his disengaged hand the Duke conveyed to me, from a distance of nearly fifty yards, a thousand signs of friendly invitation, which appeared to mean that I need not be afraid to approach, that I should not be devoured alive instead of the sandwiches. But I, who was becoming word-perfect in the language of the court, instead of going even one step nearer, keeping my fifty yards\u2019 interval, made a deep how, but without smiling, the sort of bow that I should have made to some one whom I scarcely knew, then proceeded in the opposite direction. Had I written a masterpiece, the Guermantes would have given me less credit for it than I earned by that bow. Not only did it not pass unperceived by the Duke, albeit he had that day to acknowledge the greetings of more than five hundred people, it caught the eye of the Duchess, who, happening to meet my mother, told her of it, and, so far from suggesting that I had done wrong, that I ought to have gone up to him, said that her husband had been lost in admiration of my bow, that it would have been impossible for anyone to put more into it. They never ceased to find in that bow every possible merit, without however mentioning that which had seemed the most priceless of all, to wit that it had been discreet, nor did they cease either to pay me compliments which I understood to be even less a reward for the past than a hint for the future, after the fashion of the hint delicately conveyed to his pupils by the headmaster of a school: \u201cDo not forget, my boys, that these prizes are intended not so much for you as for your parents, so that they may send you back next term.\u201d So it was that Mme. de Marsantes, when some one from a different world entered her circle, would praise in his hearing the discreet people whom \u201cyou find at home when you go to see them, and who at other times let you forget their existence,\u201d as one warns by an indirect allusion a servant who has an unpleasant smell, that the practice of taking a bath is beneficial to the health\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While, before she had even left the entrance hall, I was talking to Mme. de Guermantes, I could hear a voice of a sort which, for the future, I was to be able to classify without the possibility of error. It was, in this particular instance, the voice of M. de Vaugoubert talking to M. de Charlus. A skilled physician need not even make his patient unbutton his shirt, nor listen to his breathing, the sound of his voice is enough. How often, in time to come, was my ear to be caught in a drawing-room by the intonation or laughter of some man, who, for all that, was copying exactly the language of his profession or the manners of his class, affecting a stern aloofness or a coarse familiarity, but whose artificial voice was enough to indicate: \u2018He is a Charlus\u2019 to my trained ear, like the note of a tuning fork. At that moment the entire staff of one of the Embassies went past, pausing to greet M. de Charlus. For all that my discovery of the sort of malady in question dated only from that afternoon (when I had surprised M. de Charlus with Jupien) I should have had no need, before giving a diagnosis, to put questions, to auscultate. But M. de Vaugoubert, when talking to M. de Charlus, appeared uncertain. And yet he must have known what was in the air after the doubts of his adolescence. The invert believes himself to be the only one of his kind in the universe; it is only in later years that he imagines \u2014 another exaggeration \u2014 that the unique exception is the normal man. But, ambitious and timorous, M. de Vaugoubert had not for many years past surrendered himself to what would to him have meant pleasure. The career of diplomacy had had the same effect upon his life as a monastic profession. Combined with his assiduous fr\u00e9quentation of the School of Political Sciences, it had vowed him from his twentieth year to the chastity of a professing Christian. And so, as each of our senses loses its strength and vivacity, becomes atrophied when it is no longer exercised, M. de Vaugoubert, just as the civilised man is no longer capable of the feats of strength, of the acuteness of hearing of the cave-dweller, had lost that special perspicacy which was rarely at fault in M. de Charlus; and at official banquets, whether in Paris or abroad, the Minister Plenipotentiary was no longer capable of identifying those who, beneath the disguise of their uniform, were at heart his congeners. Certain names mentioned by M. de Charlus, indignant if he himself was cited for his peculiarities, but always delighted to give away those of other people, caused M. de Vaugoubert an exquisite surprise. Not that, after all these years, he dreamed of profiting by any windfall. But these rapid revelations, similar to those which in Racine\u2019s tragedies inform Athalie and Abner that Joas is of the House of David, that Esther, enthroned in the purple, comes of a Yiddish stock, changing the aspect of the X\u2014\u2014-Legation, or of one or another department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rendered those palaces as mysterious, in retrospect, as the Temple of Jerusalem or the Throne-room at Susa. At the sight of the youthful staff of this Embassy advancing in a body to shake hands with M. de Charlus, M. de Vaugoubert assumed the astonished air of Elise exclaiming, in Esther: \u201cGreat heavens! What a swarm of innocent beauties issuing from all sides presents itself to my gaze! How charming a modesty is depicted on their faces!\u201d Then, athirst for more definite information, he cast at M. de Charlus a smiling glance fatuously interrogative and concupiscent. \u201cWhy, of course they are,\u201d said M. de Charlus with the knowing air of a learned man speaking to an ignoramus. From that instant M. de Vaugoubert (greatly to the annoyance of M. de Charlus) could not tear his eyes from these young secretaries whom the X\u2014\u2014-Ambassador to France, an old stager, had not chosen blindfold. M. de Vaugoubert remained silent, I could only watch his eyes. But, being accustomed from my childhood to apply, even to what is voiceless, the language of the classics, I made M. de Vaugoubert\u2019s eyes repeat the lines in which Esther explains to Elise that Mardoch\u00e9e, in his zeal for his religion, has made it a rule that only those maidens who profess it shall be employed about the Queen\u2019s person. \u201cAnd now his love for our nation has peopled this palace with daughters of Sion, young and tender flowers wafted by fate, transplanted like myself beneath a foreign sky. In a place set apart from profane eyes, he\u201d (the worthy Ambassador) \u201cdevotes his skill and labour to shaping them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At length M. de Vaugoubert spoke, otherwise than with his eyes. \u201cWho knows,\u201d he said sadly, \u201cthat in the country where I live the same thing does not exist also?\u201d \u201cIt is probable,\u201d replied M. de Charlus, \u201cstarting with King Theodosius, not that I know anything definite about him.\u201d \u201cOh, dear, no! Nothing of that sort!\u201d \u201cThen he has no right to look it so completely. Besides, he has all the little tricks. He had that \u2018my dear\u2019 manner, which I detest more than anything in the world. I should never dare to be seen walking in the street with him. Anyhow, you must know what he is, they all call him the White Wolf.\u201d \u201cYou are entirely mistaken about him. He is quite charming, all the same. The day on which the agreement with France was signed, the King kissed me. I have never been so moved.\u201d \u201cThat was the moment to tell him what you wanted.\u201d \u201cOh, good heavens! What an idea! If he were even to suspect such a thing! But I have no fear in that direction.\u201d A conversation which I could hear, for I was standing close by, and which made me repeat to myself: \u201cThe King unto this day knows not who I am, and this secret keeps my tongue still enchained.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This dialogue, half mute, half spoken, had lasted but a few moments, and I had barely entered the first of the drawing-rooms with the Duchesse de Guermantes when a little dark lady, extremely pretty, stopped her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere. D\u2019Annunzio saw you from a box in the theatre, he has written the Princesse de T\u2014\u2014-a letter in which he says that he never saw anything so lovely. He would give his life for ten minutes\u2019 conversation with you. In any case, even if you can\u2019t or won\u2019t, the letter is in my possession. You must fix a day to come and see me. There are some secrets which I cannot tell you here. I see you don\u2019t remember me,\u201d she added, turning to myself; \u201cI met you at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s\u201d (where I had never been). \u201cThe Emperor of Russia is anxious for your father to be sent to Petersburg. If you could come in on Monday, Isvolski himself will be there, he will talk to you about it. I have a present for you, by dear,\u201d she went on, returning to the Duchess, \u201cwhich I should not dream of giving to anyone but you. The manuscripts of three of Ibsen\u2019s plays, which he sent to me by his old attendant. I shall keep one and give you the other two.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duc de Guermantes was not overpleased by these offers. Uncertain whether Ibsen and D\u2019Annunzio were dead or alive, he could see in his mind\u2019s eye a tribe of authors, playwrights, coming to call upon his wife and putting her in their works. People in society are too apt to think of a book as a sort of cube one side of which has been removed, so that the author can at once \u2018put in\u2019 the people he meets. This is obviously disloyal, and authors are a pretty low class. Certainly, it would not be a bad thing to meet them once in a way, for thanks to them, when one reads a book or an article, one can \u2018read between the lines,\u2019 \u2018unmask\u2019 the characters. After all, though, the wisest thing is to stick to dead authors. M. de Guermantes considered \u2018quite all right\u2019 only the gentleman who did the funeral notices in the Gaulois. He, at any rate, confined himself to including M. de Guermantes among the people \u2018conspicuous by their presence\u2019 at funerals at which the Duke had given his name. When he preferred that his name should not appear, instead of giving it, he sent a letter of condolence to the relatives of the deceased, assuring them of his deep and heartfelt sympathy. If, then, the family sent to the paper \u201camong the letters received, we may mention one from the Duc de Guermantes,\u201d etc., this was the fault not of the ink-slinger but of the son, brother, father of the deceased whom the Duke thereupon described as upstarts, and with whom he decided for the future to have no further dealings (what he called, not being very well up in the meaning of such expressions, \u2018having a crow to pick\u2019). In any event, the names of Ibsen and D\u2019Annunzio, and his uncertainty as to their survival, brought a frown to the brows of the Duke, who was not far enough away from us to escape hearing the various blandishments of Mme. Timol\u00e9on d\u2019Amoncourt. This was a charming woman, her wit, like her beauty, so entrancing that either of them by itself would have made her shine. But, born outside the world in which she now lived, having aspired at first merely to a literary salon, the friend successively \u2014 and nothing more than a friend, for her morals were above reproach \u2014 and exclusively of every great writer, who gave her all his manuscripts, wrote books for her, chance having once introduced her into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, these literary privileges were of service to her there. She had now an established position, and no longer needed to dispense other graces than those that were shed by her presence. But, accustomed in times past to act as go-between, to render services, she persevered in them even when they were no longer necessary. She had always a state secret to reveal to you, a potentate whom you must meet, a water colour by a master to present to you. There was indeed in all these superfluous attractions a trace of falsehood, but they made her life a comedy that scintillated with complications, and it was no exaggeration to say that she appointed prefects and generals\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she strolled by my side, the Duchesse de Guermantes allowed the azure light of her eyes to float in front of her, but vaguely, so as to avoid the people with whom she did not wish to enter into relations, whose presence she discerned at times, like a menacing reef in the distance. We advanced between a double hedge of guests, who, conscious that they would never come to know \u2018Oriane,\u2019 were anxious at least to point her out, as a curiosity, to their wives: \u201cQuick, Ursule, come and look at Madame de Guermantes talking to that young man.\u201d And one felt that in another moment they would be clambering upon the chairs, for a better view, as at the Military Review on the 14th of July, or the Grand Prix. Not that the Duchesse de Guermantes had a more aristocratic salon than her cousin. The former\u2019s was frequented by people whom the latter would never have been willing to invite, principally on account of her husband. She would never have been at home to Mme. Alphonse de Rothschild, who, an intimate friend of Mme. de la Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle and of Mme. de Sagan, as was Oriane herself, was constantly to be seen in the house of the last-named. It was the same with Baron Hirsch, whom the Prince of Wales had brought to see her, but not to the Princess, who would not have approved of him, and also with certain outstandingly notorious Bonapartists or even Republicans, whom the Duchess found interesting but whom the Prince, a convinced Royalist, would not have allowed inside his house. His anti-semitism also being founded on principle did not yield before any social distinction, however strongly accredited, and if he was at home to Swann, whose friend he had been since their boyhood, being, however, the only one of the Guermantes who addressed him as Swann and not as Charles, this was because, knowing that Swann\u2019s grandmother, a Protestant married to a Jew, had been the Duc de Berri\u2019s mistress, he endeavoured, from time to time, to believe in the legend which made out Swann\u2019s father to be a natural son of that Prince. By this hypothesis, which incidentally was false, Swann, the son of a Catholic father, himself the son of a Bourbon by a Catholic mother, was a Christian to his finger-tips\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, you don\u2019t know these glories?\u201d said the Duchess, referring to the rooms through which we were moving. But, having given its due meed of praise to her cousin\u2019s \u2018palace,\u2019 she hastened to add that she a thousand times preferred her own \u2018humble den.\u2019 \u201cThis is an admirable house to visit. But I should die of misery if I had to stay behind and sleep in rooms that have witnessed so many historic events. It would give me the feeling of having been left after closing-time, forgotten, in the Ch\u00e2teau of Blois, or Fontainebleau, or even the Louvre, with no antidote to my depression except to tell myself that I was in the room in which Monaldeschi was murdered. As a sedative, that is not good enough. Why, here comes Mme. de Saint-Euverte. We\u2019ve just been dining with her. As she is giving her great annual beanfeast to-morrow, I supposed she would be going straight to bed. But she can never miss a party. If this one had been in the country, she would have jumped on a lorry rather than not go to it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact, Mme. de Saint-Euverte had come this evening, less for the pleasure of not missing another person\u2019s party than in order to ensure the success of her own, recruit the latest additions to her list, and, so to speak, hold an eleventh hour review of the troops who were on the morrow to perform such brilliant evolutions at her garden party. For, in the long course of years, the guests at the Saint-Euverte parties had almost entirely changed. The female celebrities of the Guermantes world, formerly so sparsely scattered, had \u2014 loaded with attentions by their hostess \u2014 begun gradually to bring their friends. At the same time, by an enterprise equally progressive, but in the opposite direction, Mme. de Saint-Euverte had, year by year, reduced the number of persons unknown to the world of fashion. You had ceased to see first one of them, then another. For some time the \u2018batch\u2019 system was in operation, which enabled her, thanks to parties over which a veil of silence was drawn, to summon the in\u00e9ligibles separately to entertain one another, which dispensed her from having to invite them with the nice people. What cause had they for complaint? Were they not given (panem et circenses) light refreshments and a select musical programme? And so, in a kind of symmetry with the two exiled duchesses whom, in years past, when the Saint-Euverte salon was only starting, one used to see holding up, like a pair of Caryatides, its unstable crest, in these later years one could distinguish, mingling with the fashionable throng, only two heterogeneous persons, old Mme. de Cambremer and the architect\u2019s wife with a fine voice who was always having to be asked to sing. But, no longer knowing anybody at Mme. de Saint-Euverte\u2019s, bewailing their lost comrades, feeling that they were in the way, they stood about with a frozen-to-death air, like two swallows that have not migrated in time. And so, the following year, they were not invited; Mme. de Fran-quetot made an attempt on behalf of her cousin, who was so fond of music. But as she could obtain for her no more explicit reply than the words: \u201cWhy, people can always come in and listen to music, if they like; there is nothing criminal about that!\u201d Mme. de Cambremer did not find the invitation sufficiently pressing, and abstained\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such a transformation having been effected by Mme. de Saint-Euverte, from a leper hospice to a gathering of great ladies (the latest form, apparently in the height of fashion, that it had assumed), it might seem odd that the person who on the following day was to give the most brilliant party of the season should need to appear overnight to address a last word of command to her troops. But the fact was that the pre-eminence of Mme. de Saint-Euverte\u2019s drawing-room existed only for those whose social life consists entirely in reading the accounts of afternoon and evening parties in the Gaulois or Figaro, without ever having been present at one. To these worldlings who see the world only as reflected in the newspapers, the enumeration of the British, Austrian, etc., Ambassadresses, of the Duchesses d\u2019Uz\u00e8s, de la Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, etc., etc., was sufficient to make them instinctively imagine the Saint-Euverte drawing-room to be the first in Paris, whereas it was among the last. Not that the reports were mendacious. The majority of the persons mentioned had indeed been present. But each of them had come in response to entreaties, civilities, services, and with the sense of doing infinite honour to Mme. de Saint-Euverte. Such drawing-rooms, shunned rather than sought after, to which people are so to speak roped in, deceive no one but the fair readers of the \u2018Society\u2019 column. They pass over a really fashionable party, the sort at which the hostess, who could have had all the duchesses in existence, they being athirst to be \u2018numbered among the elect,\u2019 invites only two or three and does not send any list of her guests to the papers. And so these hostesses, ignorant or contemptuous of the power that publicity has acquired to-day, are considered fashionable by the Queen of Spain but are overlooked by the crowd, because the former knows and the latter does not know who they are\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Saint-Euverte was not one of these women, and, with an eye to the main chance, had come to gather up for the morrow everyone who had been invited. M. de Charlus was not among these, he had always refused to go to her house. But he had quarrelled with so many people that Mme. de Saint-Euverte might put this down to his peculiar nature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assuredly, if it had been only Oriane, Mme. de Saint-Euverte need not have put herself to the trouble, for the invitation had been given by word of mouth, and, what was more, accepted with that charming, deceiving grace in the exercise of which those Academicians are unsurpassed from whose door the candidate emerges with a melting heart, never doubting that he can count upon their support. But there were others as well. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente, would he come? And Mme. de Durfort? And so, with an eye to business, Mme. de Saint-Euverte had thought it expedient to appear on the scene in person. Insinuating with some, imperative with others, to all alike she hinted in veiled words at inconceivable attractions which could never be seen anywhere again, and promised each that he should find at her party the person he most wished, or the personage he most wanted to meet. And this sort of function with which she was invested on one day in the year \u2014 like certain public offices in the ancient world \u2014 of the person who is to give on the morrow the biggest garden-party of the season conferred upon her a momentary authority. Her lists were made up and closed, so that while she wandered slowly through the Princess\u2019s rooms to drop into one ear after another: \u201cYou won\u2019t forget about me to-morrow,\u201d she had the ephemeral glory of turning away her eyes, while continuing to smile, if she caught sight of some horrid creature who was to be avoided or some country squire for whom the bond of a schoolboy friendship had secured admission to Gilbert\u2019s, and whose presence at her garden-party would be no gain. She preferred not to speak to him, so as to be able to say later on: \u201cI issued my invitations verbally, and unfortunately I didn\u2019t see you anywhere.\u201d And so she, a mere Saint-Euverte, set to work with her gimlet eyes to pick and choose among the guests at the Princess\u2019s party. And she imagined herself, in so doing, to be every inch a Duchesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be admitted that the latter lady had not, either, whatever one might suppose, the unrestricted use of her greetings and smiles. To some extent, no doubt, when she withheld them, it was deliberately. \u201cBut the woman bores me to tears,\u201d she would say, \u201cam I expected to talk to her about her party for the next hour?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A duchess of swarthy complexion went past, whom her ugliness and stupidity, and certain irregularities of behaviour, had exiled not from society as a whole but from certain small and fashionable circles. \u201cAh!\u201d murmured Mme. de Guermantes, with the sharp, unerring glance of the connoisseur who is shewn a false jewel, \u201cso they have that sort here?\u201d By the mere sight of this semi-tarnished lady, whose face was burdened with a surfeit of moles from which black hairs sprouted, Mme. de Guermantes gauged the mediocre importance of this party. They had been brought up together, but she had severed all relations with the lady; and responded to her greeting only with the curtest little nod. \u201cI cannot understand,\u201d she said to me, \u201chow Marie-Gilbert can invite us with all that scum. You might say there was a deputation of paupers from every parish. M\u00e9lanie Pourtal\u00e8s arranged things far better. She could have the Holy Synod and the Oratoire Chapel in her house if she liked, but at least she didn\u2019t invite us on the same day.\u201d But, in many cases, it was from timidity, fear of a scene with her husband, who did not like her to entertain artists and such like (Marie-Gilbert took a kindly interest in dozens of them, you had to take care not to be accosted by some illustrious German diva), from some misgivings, too, with regard to Nationalist feeling, which, inasmuch as she was endowed, like M. de Charlus, with the wit of the Guermantes, she despised from the social point of view (people were now, for the greater glory of the General Staff, sending a plebeian general in to dinner before certain dukes), but to which, nevertheless, as she knew that she was considered unsound in her views, she made liberal concessions, even dreading the prospect of having to offer her hand to Swann in these anti-semitic surroundings. With regard to this, her mind was soon set at rest, for she learned that the Prince had refused to have Swann in the house, and had had \u2018a sort of an altercation\u2019 with him. There was no risk of her having to converse in public with \u2018poor Charles,\u2019 whom she preferred to cherish in private\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd who in the world is that?\u201d Mme. de Guermantes exclaimed, upon seeing a little lady with a slightly lost air, in a black gown so simple that you would have taken her for a pauper, greet her, as did also the lady\u2019s husband, with a sweeping bow. She did not recognise the lady and, in her insolent way, drew herself up as though offended and stared at her without responding. \u201cWho is that person, Basin?\u201d she asked with an air of astonishment, while M. de Guermantes, to atone for Oriane\u2019s impoliteness, was bowing to the lady and shaking hands with her husband. \u201cWhy, it is Mme. de Chaussepierre, you were most impolite.\u201d \u201cI have never heard of anybody called Chaussepierre.\u201d \u201cOld mother Chanlivault\u2019s nephew.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea what you\u2019re talking about. Who is the woman, and why does she bow to me?\u201d \u201cBut you know her perfectly, she\u2019s Mme. de Charleval\u2019s daughter, Henriette Montmorency.\u201d \u201cOh, but I knew her mother quite well, she was charming, extremely intelligent. What made her go and marry all these people I never heard of? You say that she calls herself Mme. de Chaussepierre?\u201d she said, isolating each syllable of the name with a questioning air, and as though she were afraid of making a mistake. \u201cIt is not so ridiculous as you appear to think, to call oneself Chaussepierre! Old Chaussepierre was the brother of the aforesaid Chan-livault, of Mme. de Sennecour and of the Vicomtesse de Merlerault. They\u2019re a good family.\u201d \u201cOh, do stop,\u201d cried the Duchess, who, like a lion-tamer, never cared to appear to be allowing herself to be intimidated by the devouring glare of the animal. \u201cBasin, you are the joy of my life. I can\u2019t imagine where you picked up those names, but I congratulate you on them. If I did not know Chaussepierre, I have at least read Balzac, you are not the only one, and I have even read Labiche. I can appreciate Chanlivault, I do not object to Charleval, but I must confess that Merlerault is a masterpiece. However, let us admit that Chaussepierre is not bad either. You must have gone about collecting them, it\u2019s not possible. You mean to write a book,\u201d she turned to myself, \u201cyou ought to make a note of Charleval and Merlerault. You will find nothing better.\u201d \u201cHe will find himself in the dock, and will go to prison; you are giving him very bad advice, Oriane.\u201d \u201cI hope, for his own sake, that he has younger people than me at his disposal if he wishes to ask for bad advice; especially if he means to follow it. But if he means to do nothing worse than write a book!\u201d At some distance from us, a wonderful, proud young woman stood out delicately from the throng in a white dress, all diamonds and tulle. Madame de Guermantes watched her talking to a whole group of people fascinated by her grace. \u201cYour sister is the belle of the ball, as usual; she is charming to-night,\u201d she said, as she took a chair, to the Prince de Chimay who went past. Colonel de Froberville (the General of that name was his uncle) came and sat down beside us, as did M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, while M. de Vaugou-bert, after hovering about us (by an excess of politeness which he maintained even when playing tennis when, by dint of asking leave of the eminent personages present before hitting the ball, he invariably lost the game for his partner) returned to M. de Charlus (until that moment almost concealed by the huge skirt of the Comtesse Mole, whom he professed to admire above all other women), and, as it happened, at the moment when several members of the latest diplomatic mission to Paris were greeting the Baron. At the sight of a young secretary with a particularly intelligent air, M. de Vaugoubert fastened on M. de Charlus a smile upon which there bloomed visibly one question only. M. de Charlus would, no doubt, readily have compromised some one else, but to feel himself compromised by this smile formed on another person\u2019s lips, which, moreover, could have but one meaning, exasperated him. \u201cI know absolutely nothing about the matter, I beg you to keep your curiosity to yourself. It leaves me more than cold. Besides, in this instance, you are making a mistake of the first order. I believe this young man to be absolutely the opposite.\u201d Here M. de Charlus, irritated at being thus given away by a fool, was not speaking the truth. The secretary would, had the Baron been correct, have formed an exception to the rule of his Embassy. It was, as a matter of fact, composed of widely different personalities, many of them extremely second-rate, so that, if one sought to discover what could have been the motive of the selection that had brought them together, the only one possible seemed to be inversion. By setting at the head of this little diplomatic Sodom an Ambassador who on the contrary ran after women with the comic exaggeration of an old buffer in a revue, who made his battalion of male impersonators toe the line, the authorities seemed to have been obeying the law of contrasts. In spite of what he had beneath his nose, he did not believe in inversion. He gave an immediate proof of this by marrying his sister to a Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires whom he believed, quite mistakenly, to be a womaniser. After this he became rather a nuisance and was soon replaced by a fresh Excellency who ensured the homogeneity of the party. Other Embassies sought to rival this one, but could never dispute the prize (as in the matriculation examinations, where a certain school always heads the list), and more than ten years had to pass before, heterogeneous attach\u00e9s having been introduced into this too perfect whole, another might at last wrest the grim trophy from it and march at the head\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reassured as to her fear of having to talk to Swann, Mme. de Guermantes felt now merely curious as to the subject of the conversation he had had with their host. \u201cDo you know what it was about?\u201d the Duke asked M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. \u201cI did hear,\u201d the other replied, \u201cthat it was about a little play which the writer Bergotte produced at their house. It was a delightful show, as it happens. But it seems the actor made up as Gilbert, whom, as it happens, Master Bergotte had intended to take off.\u201d \u201cOh, I should have loved to see Gilbert taken off,\u201d said the Duchess, with a dreamy smile. \u201cIt was about this little performance,\u201d M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 went on, thrusting forward his rodent jaw, \u201cthat Gilbert demanded an explanation from Swann, who merely replied what everyone thought very witty: \u2018Why, not at all, it wasn\u2019t the least bit like you, you are far funnier!\u2019 It appears, though,\u201d M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 continued, \u201cthat the little play was quite delightful. Mme. Mol\u00e9 was there, she was immensely amused.\u201d \u201cWhat, does Mme. Mol\u00e9 go there?\u201d said the Duchess in astonishment. \u201cAh! That must be M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2018s doing. That is what always happens, in the end, to that sort of house. One fine day everybody begins to flock to it, and I, who have deliberately remained aloof, upon principle, find myself left to mope alone in my corner.\u201d Already, since M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9\u2018s speech, the Duchesse de Guermantes (with regard if not to Swann\u2019s house, at least to the hypothesis of encountering him at any moment) had, as we see, adopted a fresh point of view. \u201cThe explanation that you have given us,\u201d said Colonel de Fro-berville to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, \u201cis entirely unfounded. I have good reason to know. The Prince purely and simply gave Swann a dressing down and would have him to know, as our forebears used to say, that he was not to shew his face in the house again, seeing the opinions he flaunts. And, to my mind, my uncle Gilbert was right a thousand times over, not only in giving Swann a piece of his mind, he ought to have finished six months ago with an out-and-out Dreyfusard.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Poor M. de Vaugoubert, changed now from a too cautious tennis-player to a mere inert tennis ball which is tossed to and fro without compunction, found himself projected towards the Duchesse de Guermantes to whom he made obeisance. He was none too well received, Oriane living in the belief that all the diplomats \u2014 or politicians \u2014 of her world were nincompoops\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Froberville had greatly benefited by the social privileges that had of late been accorded to military men. Unfortunately, if the wife of his bosom was a quite authentic relative of the Guermantes, she was also an extremely poor one, and, as he himself had lost his fortune, they went scarcely anywhere, and were the sort of people who were apt to be overlooked except on great occasions, when they had the good fortune to bury or marry a relative. Then, they did really enter into communion with the world of fashion, like those nominal Catholics who approach the holy table but once in the year. Their material situation would indeed have been deplorable had not Mme. de Saint-Euverte, faithful to her affection for the late General de Froberville, done everything to help the household, providing frocks and entertainments for the two girls. But the Colonel, though generally considered a good fellow, had not the spirit of gratitude. He was envious of the splendours of a benefactress who extolled them herself without pause or measure. The annual garden party was for him, his wife and children a marvellous pleasure which they would not have missed for all the gold in the world, but a pleasure poisoned by the thought of the joys of satisfied pride that Mme. de Saint-Euverte derived from it. The accounts of this garden party in the newspapers, which, after giving detailed reports, would add with Machiavellian guile: \u201cWe shall refer again to this brilliant gathering,\u201d the complementary details of the women\u2019s costume, appearing for several days in succession, all this was so obnoxious to the Frobervilles, that they, cut off from most pleasures and knowing that they could count upon the pleasure of this one afternoon, were moved every year to hope that bad weather would spoil the success of the party, to consult the barometer and to anticipate with ecstasy the threatenings of a storm that might ruin everything\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI shall not discuss politics with you, Froberville,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cbut, so far as Swann is concerned, I can tell you frankly that his conduct towards ourselves has been beyond words. Introduced into society, in the past, by ourselves, by the Duc de Chartres, they tell me now that he is openly a Dreyfusard. I should never have believed it of him, an epicure, a man of practical judgment, a collector, who goes in for old books, a member of the Jockey, a man who enjoys the respect of all that know him, who knows all the good addresses, and used to send us the best port wine you could wish to drink, a dilettante, the father of a family. Oh! I have been greatly deceived. I do not complain for myself, it is understood that I am only an old fool, whose opinion counts for nothing, mere rag tag and bobtail, but if only for Oriane\u2019s sake, he ought to have openly disavowed the Jews and the partisans of the man Dreyfus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, after the friendship my wife has always shewn him,\u201d went on the Duke, who evidently considered that to denounce Dreyfus as guilty of high treason, whatever opinion one might hold in one\u2019s own conscience as to his guilt, constituted a sort of thank-offering for the manner in which one had been received in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, \u201che ought to have disassociated himself. For, you can ask Oriane, she had a real friendship for him.\u201d The Duchess, thinking that an ingenuous, calm tone would give a more dramatic and sincere value to her words, said in a schoolgirl voice, as though she were simply letting the truth fall from her lips, merely giving a slightly melancholy expression to her eyes: \u201cIt is quite true, I have no reason to conceal the fact that I did feel a sincere affection for Charles!\u201d \u201cThere, you see, I don\u2019t have to make her say it. And after that, he carries his ingratitude to the point of being a Dreyfusard!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTalking of Dreyfusards,\u201d I said, \u201cit appears, Prince Von is one.\u201d \u201cAh, I am glad you reminded me of him,\u201d exclaimed M. de Guermantes, \u201cI was forgetting that he had asked me to dine with him on Monday. But whether he is a Dreyfusard or not is entirely immaterial, since he is a foreigner. I don\u2019t give two straws for his opinion. With a Frenchman, it is another matter. It is true that Swann is a Jew. But, until to-day \u2014 forgive me, Fro-berville \u2014 I have always been foolish enough to believe that a Jew can be a Frenchman, that is to say, an honourable Jew, a man of the world. Now, Swann was that in every sense of the word. Ah, well! He forces me to admit that I have been mistaken, since he has taken the side of this Dreyfus (who, guilty or not, never moved in his world, he cannot ever have met him) against a society that had adopted him, had treated him as one of ourselves. It goes without saying, we were all of us prepared to vouch for Swann, I would have answered for his patriotism as for my own. Ah! He is rewarding us very badly: I must confess that I should never have expected such a thing from him. I thought better of him. He was a man of intelligence (in his own line, of course). I know that he had already made that insane, disgraceful marriage. By which token, shall I tell you some one who was really hurt by Swann\u2019s marriage: my wife. Oriane often has what I might call an affectation of insensibility. But at heart she feels things with extraordinary keenness.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes, delighted by this analysis of her character, listened to it with a modest air but did not utter a word, from a scrupulous reluctance to acquiesce in it, but principally from fear of cutting it short. M. de Guermantes might have gone on talking for an hour on this subject, she would have sat as still, or even stiller than if she had been listening to music. \u201cVery well! I remember, when she heard of Swann\u2019s marriage, she felt hurt; she considered that it was wrong in a person to whom we had given so much friendship. She was very fond of Swann; she was deeply grieved. Am I not right, Oriane?\u201d Mme. de Guermantes felt that she ought to reply to so direct a challenge, upon a point of fact, which would allow her, unobtrusively, to confirm the tribute which, she felt, had come to an end. In a shy and simple tone, and with an air all the more studied in that it sought to shew genuine \u2018feeling,\u2019 she said with a meek reserve, \u201cIt is true, Basin is quite right.\u201d \u201cStill, that was not quite the same. After all, love is love, although, in my opinion, it ought to confine itself within certain limits. I might excuse a young fellow, a mere boy, for letting himself be caught by an infatuation. But Swann, a man of intelligence, of proved refinement, a good judge of pictures, an intimate friend of the Duc de Chartres, of Gilbert himself!\u201d The tone in which M. de Guermantes said this was, for that matter, quite inoffensive, without a trace of the vulgarity which he too often shewed. He spoke with a slightly indignant melancholy, but everything about him was steeped in that gentle gravity which constitutes the broad and unctuous charm of certain portraits by Rembrandt, that of the Burgomaster Six, for example. One felt that the question of the immorality of Swann\u2019s conduct with regard to \u2018the Case\u2019 never even presented itself to the Duke, so confident was he of the answer; it caused him the grief of a father who sees one of his sons, for whose education he has made the utmost sacrifices, deliberately ruin the magnificent position he has created for him and dishonour, by pranks which the principles or prejudices of his family cannot allow, a respected name. It is true that M. de Guermantes had not displayed so profound and pained an astonishment when he learned that Saint-Loup was a Dreyfusard. But, for one thing, he regarded his nephew as a young man gone astray, as to whom nothing, until he began to mend his ways, could be surprising, whereas Swann was what M. de Guermantes called \u2018a man of weight, a man occupying a position in the front rank.\u2019 Moreover and above all, a considerable interval of time had elapsed during which, if, from the historical point of view, events had, to some extent, seemed to justify the Dreyfusard argument, the anti-Dreyfusard opposition had doubled its violence, and, from being purely political, had become social. It was now a question of militarism, of patriotism, and the waves of anger that had been stirred up in society had had time to gather the force which they never have at the beginning of a storm. \u201cDon\u2019t you see,\u201d M. de Guermantes went on, \u201ceven from the point of view of his beloved Jews, since he is absolutely determined to stand by them, Swann has made a blunder of an incalculable magnitude. He has shewn that they are to some extent forced to give their support to anyone of their own race, even if they do not know him personally. It is a public danger. We have evidently been too easy going, and the mistake Swann is making will create all the more stir since he was respected, not to say received, and was almost the only Jew that anyone knew. People will say: Ab uno disce omnes.\u201d (His satisfaction at having hit, at the right moment, in his memory, upon so apt a quotation, alone brightened with a proud smile the melancholy of the great nobleman conscious of betrayal.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was longing to know what exactly had happened between the Prince and Swann, and to catch the latter, if he had not already gone home. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you,\u201d the Duchess answered me when I spoke to her of this desire, \u201cthat I for my part am not overanxious to see him, because it appears, by what I was told just now at Mme. de Saint-Euverte\u2019s, that he would like me before he dies to make the acquaintance of his wife and daughter. Good heavens, it distresses me terribly that he should be ill, but, I must say, I hope it is not so serious as all that. And besides, it is not really a reason at all, because if it were it would be so childishly simple. A writer with no talent would have only to say: \u2018Vote for me at the Academy because my wife is dying and I wish to give her this last happiness.\u2019 There would be no more entertaining if one was obliged to make friends with all the dying people. My coachman might come to me with: \u2018My daughter is seriously ill, get me an invitation to the Princesse de Parme\u2019s.\u2019 I adore Charles, and I should hate having to refuse him, and so that is why I prefer to avoid the risk of his asking me. I hope with all my heart that he is not dying, as he says, but really, if it has to happen, it would not be the moment for me to make the acquaintance of those two creatures who have deprived me of the most amusing of my friends for the last fifteen years, with the additional disadvantage that I should not even be able to make use of their society to see him, since he would be dead!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 had not ceased to ruminate the contradiction of his story by Colonel de Froberville. \u201cI do not question the accuracy of your version, my dear fellow,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I had mine from a good source. It was the Prince de la Tour d\u2019Auvergne who told me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am surprised that an educated man like yourself should still say \u2018Prince de la Tour d\u2019Auvergne,\u2019\u201d the Duc de Guermantes broke in, \u201cyou know that he is nothing of the kind. There is only one member of that family left. Oriane\u2019s uncle, the Duc de Bouillon.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe brother of Mme. de Villeparisis?\u201d I asked, remembering that she had been Mlle, de Bouillon. \u201cPrecisely. Oriane, Mme. de Lambresac is bowing to you.\u201d And indeed, one saw at certain moments form and fade like a shooting star a faint smile directed by the Duchesse de Lambresac at somebody whom she had recognised. But this smile, instead of taking definite shape in an active affirmation, in a language mute but clear, was drowned almost immediately in a sort of ideal ecstasy which expressed nothing, while her head drooped in a gesture of blissful benediction, recalling the inclination towards the crowd of communicants of the head of a somewhat senile prelate. There was not the least trace of senility about Mme. de Lambresac. But I was acquainted already with this special type of old-fashioned distinction. At Combray and in Paris, all my grandmother\u2019s friends were in the habit of greeting one another at a social gathering with as seraphic an air as if they had caught sight of some one of their acquaintance in church, at the moment of the Elevation or during a funeral, and were casting him a gentle \u2018Good morning\u2019 which ended in prayer. At this point a remark made by M. de Guermantes was to complete the likeness that I was tracing. \u201cBut you have seen the Duc de Bouillon,\u201d he said to me. \u201cHe was just going out of my library this afternoon as you came in, a short person with white hair.\u201d It was the person whom I had taken for a man of business from Combray, and yet, now that I came to think it over, I could see the resemblance to Mme. de Villeparisis. The similarity between the evanescent greetings of the Duchesse de Lambresac and those of my grandmother\u2019s friends had first aroused my interest, by shewing me how in all narrow and exclusive societies, be they those of the minor gentry or of the great nobility, the old manners persist, allowing us to recapture, like an archaeologist, what might have been the standard of upbringing, and the side of life which it reflects, in the days of the Vicomte d\u2019Arlincourt and Lo\u00efsa Puget. Better still now, the perfect conformity in appearance between a man of business from Combray of his generation and the Duc de Bouillon reminded me of what had already struck me so forcibly when I had seen Saint-Loup\u2019s maternal grandfather, the Duc de La Rochefoucauld, in a daguerreotype in which he was exactly similar, in dress, air and manner, to my great-uncle, that social, and even individual differences are merged when seen from a distance in the uniformity of an epoch. The truth is that the similarity of dress, and also the reflexion, from a person\u2019s face, of the spirit of his age occupy so much more space than his caste, which bulks largely only in his own self-esteem and the imagination of other people, that in order to discover that a great nobleman of the time of Louis Philippe differs less from a citizen of the time of Louis Philippe than from a great nobleman of the time of Louis XV, it is not necessary to visit the galleries of the Louvre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment, a Bavarian musician with long hair, whom the Princesse de Guermantes had taken under her wing, bowed to Oriane. She responded with an inclination of her head, but the Duke, furious at seeing his wife bow to a person whom he did not know, who had a curious style, and, so far as M. de Guermantes understood, an extremely bad reputation, turned upon his wife with a terrible inquisitorial air, as much as to say: \u201cWho in the world is that Ostrogoth?\u201d Poor Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s position was already distinctly complicated, and if the musician had felt a little pity for this martyred wife, he would have made off as quickly as possible. But, whether from a desire not to remain under the humiliation that had just been inflicted on him in public, before the eyes of the Duke\u2019s oldest and most intimate friends, whose presence there had perhaps been responsible to some extent for his silent bow, and to shew that it was on the best of grounds and not without knowing her already that he had greeted the Duchesse de Guermantes, or else in obedience to the obscure but irresistible impulse to commit a blunder which drove him \u2014 at a moment when he ought to have trusted to the spirit \u2014 to apply the whole letter of the law, the musician came closer to Mme. de Guermantes and said to her: \u201cMadame la Duchesse, I should like to request the honour of being presented to the Duke.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes was indeed in a quandary. But after all, she might well be a forsaken wife, she was still Duchesse de Guermantes and could not let herself appear to have forfeited the right to introduce to her husband the people whom she knew. \u201cBasin,\u201d she said, \u201callow me to present to you M. d\u2019Herweck.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI need not ask whether you are going to Madame de Saint-Euverte\u2019s to-morrow,\u201d Colonel de Froberville said to Mme. de Guermantes, to dispel the painful impression produced by M. d\u2019Herweck\u2019s ill-timed request. \u201cThe whole of Paris will be there.\u201d Meanwhile, turning with a single movement and as though he were carved out of a solid block towards the indiscreet musician, the Duc de Guermantes, fronting his suppliant, monumental, mute, wroth, like Jupiter Tonans, remained motionless like this for some seconds, his eyes ablaze with anger and astonishment, his waving locks seeming to issue from a crater. Then, as though carried away by an impulse which alone enabled him to perform the act of politeness that was demanded of him, and after appearing by his attitude of defiance to be calling the entire company to witness that he did not know the Bavarian musician, clasping his white-gloved hands behind his back, he jerked his body forward and bestowed upon the musician a bow so profound, instinct with such stupefaction and rage, so abrupt, so violent, that the trembling artist recoiled, stooping as he went, so as not to receive a formidable butt in the stomach. \u201cWell, the fact is, I shall not be in Paris,\u201d the Duchess answered Colonel de Froberville. \u201cI may as well tell you (though I ought to be ashamed to confess such a thing) that I have lived all these years without seeing the windows at Montfort-l\u2019Amaury. It is shocking, but there it is. And so, to make amends for my shameful ignorance, I decided that I would go and see them to-morrow.\u201d M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 smiled a subtle smile. He quite understood that, if the Duchess had been able to live all these years without seeing the windows at Montfort-l\u2019Amaury, this artistic excursion did not all of a sudden take on the urgent character of an expedition \u2018hot-foot\u2019 and might without danger, after having been put off for more than twenty-five years, be retarded for twenty-four hours. The plan that the Duchess had formed was simply the Guermantes way of issuing the decree that the Saint-Euverte establishment was definitely not a \u2018really nice\u2019 house, but a house to which you were invited that you might be utilised afterwards in the account in the Gaulois, a house that would set the seal of supreme smartness upon those, or at any rate upon her (should there be but one) who did not go to it. The delicate amusement of M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, enhanced by that poetical pleasure which people in society felt when they saw Mme. de Guermantes do things which their own inferior position did not allow them to imitate, but the mere sight of which brought to their lips the smile of the peasant thirled to the soil when he sees freer and more fortunate men pass by above his head, this delicate pleasure could in no way be compared with the concealed but frantic ecstasy that was at once felt by M. de Froberville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The efforts that this gentleman was making so that people should not hear his laughter had made him turn as red as a turkey-cock, in spite of which it was only with a running interruption of hiccoughs of joy that he exclaimed in a pitying tone: \u201cOh! Poor Aunt Saint-Euverte, she will take to her bed! No! The unhappy woman is not to have her Duchess, what a blow, why, it is enough to kill her!\u201d he went on, convulsed with laughter. And in his exhilaration he could not help stamping his feet and rubbing his hands. Smiling out of one eye and with the corner of her lips at M. de Froberville, whose amiable intention she appreciated, but found the deadly boredom of his society quite intolerable, Mme. de Guermantes decided finally to leave him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, I shall be obliged to bid you good night,\u201d she said to him as she rose with an air of melancholy resignation, and as though it had been a bitter grief to her. Beneath the magic spell of her blue eyes her gently musical voice made one think of the poetical lament of a fairy. \u201cBasin wants me to go and talk to Marie for a little.\u201d In reality, she was tired of listening to Froberville, who did not cease to envy her her going to Montfort-l\u2019Amaury, when she knew quite well that he had never heard of the windows before in his life, nor for that matter would he for anything in the world have missed going to the Saint-Euverte party. \u201cGood-bye, I\u2019ve barely said a word to you, it is always like that at parties, we never see the people, we never say the things we should like to say, but it is the same everywhere in this life. Let us hope that when we are dead things will be better arranged. At any rate, we shall not always be having to put on low dresses. And yet, one never knows. We may perhaps have to display our bones and worms on great occasions. Why not? Look, there goes old Rampillon, do you see any great difference between her and a skeleton in an open dress? It is true that she has every right to look like that, for she must be at least a hundred. She was already one of those sacred monsters before whom I refused to bow the knee when I made my first appearance in society. I thought she had been dead for years; which for that matter would be the only possible explanation of the spectacle she presents. It is impressive and liturgical; quite Camposanto!\u201d The Duchess had moved away from Froberville; he came after her: \u201cJust one word in your ear.\u201d Slightly annoyed: \u201cWell, what is it now?\u201d she said to him stiffly. And he, having been afraid lest, at the last moment, she might change her mind about Montfort-l\u2019Amaury: \u201cI did not like to mention it for Mme. de Saint-Euverte\u2019s sake, so as not to get her into trouble, but since you don\u2019t intend to be there, I may tell you that I am glad for your sake, for she has measles in the house!\u201d \u201cOh, good gracious!\u201d said Oriane, who had a horror of illnesses. \u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t matter to me, I\u2019ve had them already. You can\u2019t get them twice.\u201d \u201cSo the doctors say; I know people who\u2019ve had them four times. Anyhow, you are warned.\u201d As for himself, these fictitious measles would have needed to attack him in reality and to chain him to his bed before he would have resigned himself to missing the Saint-Euverte party to which he had looked forward for so many months. He would have the pleasure of seeing so many smart people there! The still greater pleasure of remarking that certain things had gone wrong, and the supreme pleasures of being able for long afterwards to boast that he had mingled with the former and, while exaggerating or inventing them, of deploring the latter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took advantage of the Duchess\u2019s moving to rise also in order to make my way to the smoking-room and find out the truth about Swann. \u201cDo not believe a word of what Babal told us,\u201d she said to me. \u201cLittle Mol\u00e9 would never poke her nose into a place like that. They tell us that to draw us. Nobody ever goes to them and they are never asked anywhere either. He admits it himself: \u2018We spend the evenings alone by our own fireside.\u2019 As he always says we, not like royalty, but to include his wife, I do not press him. But I know all about it,\u201d the Duchess added. We passed two young men whose great and dissimilar beauty took its origin from one and the same woman. They were the two sons of Mme. de Surgis, the latest mistress of the Duc de Guermantes. Both were resplendent with their mother\u2019s perfections, but each in his own way. To one had passed, rippling through a virile body, the royal presence of Mme. de Surgis and the same pallor, ardent, flushed and sacred, flooded the marble cheeks of mother and son; but his brother had received the Grecian brow, the perfect nose, the statuesque throat, the eyes of infinite depth; composed thus of separate gifts, which the goddess had shared between them, their twofold beauty offered one the abstract pleasure of thinking that the cause of that beauty was something outside themselves; one would have said that the principal attributes of their mother were incarnate in two different bodies; that one of the young men was his mother\u2019s stature and her complexion, the other her gaze, like those divine beings who were no more than the strength and beauty of Jupiter or Minerva. Full of respect for M. de Guermantes, of whom they said: \u201cHe is a great friend of our parents,\u201d the elder nevertheless thought that it would be wiser not to come up and greet the Duchess, of whose hostility towards his mother he was aware, though without perhaps understanding the reason for it, and at the sight of us he slightly averted his head. The younger, who copied his brother in everything, because, being stupid and short-sighted to boot, he did not venture to own a personal opinion, inclined his head at the same angle, and the pair slipped past us towards the card-room, one behind the other, like a pair of allegorical figures\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as I reached this room, I was stopped by the Marquise de Citri, still beautiful but almost foaming at the mouth. Of decently noble birth, she had sought and made a brilliant match in marrying M. de Citri, whose great-grandmother had been an Aumale-Lorraine. But no sooner had she tasted this satisfaction than her natural cantankerousness gave her a horror of people in society which did not cut her off absolutely from social life. Not only, at a party, did she deride everyone present, her derision of them was so violent that mere laughter was not sufficiently bitter, and changed into a guttural hiss. \u201cAh!\u201d she said to me, pointing to the Duchesse de Guermantes who had now left my side and was already some way off, \u201cwhat defeats me is that she can lead this sort of existence.\u201d Was this the speech of a righteously indignant Saint, astonished that the Gentiles did not come of their own accord to perceive the Truth, or that of an anarchist athirst for carnage? In any case there could be no possible justification for this apostrophe. In the first place, the \u2018existence led\u2019 by Mme. de Guermantes differed hardly perceptibly (except in indignation) from that led by Mme. de Citri. Mme. de Citri was stupefied when she saw the Duchess capable of that mortal sacrifice: attendance at one of Marie-Gilbert\u2019s parties. It must be said in this particular instance that Mme. de Citri was genuinely fond of the Princess, who was indeed the kindest of women, and knew that, by attending her party, she was giving her great pleasure. And so she had put off, in order to come to the party, a dancer whom she regarded as a genius, and who was to have initiated her into the mysteries of Russian choreography. Another reason which to some extent stultified the concentrated rage which Mme. de Citri felt on seeing Oriane greet one or other of the guests was that Mme. de Guermantes, albeit at a far less advanced stage, shewed the symptoms of the malady that was devouring Mme. de Citri. We have seen, moreover, that she had carried the germs of it from her birth. In fact, being more intelligent than Mme. de Citri, Mme. de Guermantes would have had better right than she to this nihilism (which was more than merely social), but it is true that certain good qualities help us rather to endure the defects of our neighbour than they make us suffer from them; and a man of great talent will normally pay less attention to other people\u2019s folly than would a fool. We have already described at sufficient length the nature of the Duchess\u2019s wit to convince the reader that, if it had nothing in common with great intellect, it was at least wit, a wit adroit in making use (like a translator) of different grammatical forms. Now nothing of this sort seemed to entitle Mme. de Citri to look down upon qualities so closely akin to her own. She found everyone idiotic, but in her conversation, in her letters, shewed herself distinctly inferior to the people whom she treated with such disdain. She had moreover such a thirst for destruction that, when she had almost given up society, the pleasures that she then sought were subjected, each in turn, to her terrible disintegrating force. After she had given up parties for musical evenings, she used to say: \u201cYou like listening to that sort of thing, to music? Good gracious, it all depends on what it is. It can be simply deadly! Oh! Beethoven! What a bore!\u201d With Wagner, then with Franck, Debussy, she did not even take the trouble to say the word barbe, but merely passed her hand over her face with a tonsorial gesture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently, everything became boring. \u201cBeautiful things are such a bore. Oh! Pictures! They\u2019re enough to drive one mad. How right you are, it is such a bore having to write letters!\u201d Finally it was life itself that she declared to be rasante, leaving her hearers to wonder where she applied the term\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not know whether it was the effect of what the Duchesse de Guermantes, on the evening when I first dined at her house, had said of this interior, but the card \u2014 or smoking-room, with its pictorial floor, its tripods, its figures of gods and animals that gazed at you, the sphinxes stretched out along the arms of the chairs, and most of all the huge table, of marble or enamelled mosaic, covered with symbolical signs more or less imitated from Etruscan and Egyptian art, gave me the impression of a magician\u2019s cell. And, on a chair drawn up to the glittering, augural table, M. de Charlus, in person, never touching a card, unconscious of what was going on round about him, incapable of observing that I had entered the room, seemed precisely a magician applying all the force of his will and reason to drawing a horoscope. Not only that, but, like the eyes of a Pythian on her tripod, his eyes were starting from his head, and that nothing might distract him from labours which required the cessation of the most simple movements, he had (like a calculator who will do nothing else until he has solved his problem) laid down beside him the cigar which he had previously been holding between his lips, but had no longer the necessary detachment of mind to think of smoking. Seeing the two crouching deities borne upon the arms of the chair that stood facing him, one might have thought that the Baron was endeavouring to solve the enigma of the Sphinx, had it not been that, rather, of a young and living Oedipus, seated in that very armchair, where he had come to join in the game. Now, the figure to which M. de Charlus was applying with such concentration all his mental powers, and which was not, to tell the truth, one of the sort that are commonly studied more geometrico, was that of the proposition set him by the lineaments of the young Comte de Surgis; it appeared, so profound was M. de Charlus\u2019s absorption in front of it, to be some rebus, some riddle, some algebraical problem, of which he must try to penetrate the mystery or to work out the formula. In front of him the sibylline signs and the figures inscribed upon that Table of the Law seemed the gramarye which would enable the old sorcerer to tell in what direction the young man\u2019s destiny was shaping. Suddenly he became aware that I was watching him, raised his head as though he were waking from a dream, smiled at me and blushed. At that moment Mme. de Surgis\u2019s other son came up behind the one who was playing, to look at his cards. When M. de Charlus had learned from me that they were brothers, his features could not conceal the admiration that he felt for a family which could create masterpieces so splendid and so diverse. And what added to the Baron\u2019s enthusiasm was the discovery that the two sons of Mme. de Surgis-le-Duc were sons not only of the same mother but of the same father. The children of Jupiter are dissimilar, but that is because he married first Metis, whose destiny was to bring into the world wise children, then Themis, and after her Eurynome, and Mnemosyne, and Leto, and only as a last resort Juno. But to a single father Mme. de Surgis had borne these two sons who had each received beauty from her, but a different beauty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had at length the pleasure of seeing Swann come into this room, which was very big, so big that he did not at first catch sight of me. A pleasure mingled with sorrow, with a sorrow which the other guests did not, perhaps, feel, their feeling consisting rather in that sort of fascination which is exercised by the strange and unexpected forms of an approaching death, a death that a man already has, in the popular saying, written on his face. And it was with a stupefaction that was almost offensive, into which entered indiscreet curiosity, cruelty, a scrutiny at once quiet and anxious (a blend of suave mari magno and memento quia pulvis, Robert would have said), that all eyes were fastened upon that face the cheeks of which had been so eaten away by disease, like a waning moon, that, except at a certain angle, the angle doubtless at which Swann looked at himself, they stopped short like a flimsy piece of scenery to which only an optical illusion can add the appearance of solidity. Whether because of the absence of those cheeks, no longer there to modify it, or because arteriosclerosis, which also is a form of intoxication, had reddened it, as would drunkenness, or deformed it, as would morphine, Swann\u2019s punchinello nose, absorbed for long years in an attractive face, seemed now enormous, tumid, crimson, the nose of an old Hebrew rather than of a dilettante Valois. Perhaps too in him, in these last days, the race was making appear more pronounced the physical type that characterises it, at the same time as the sentiment of a moral solidarity with the rest of the Jews, a solidarity which Swann seemed to have forgotten throughout his life, and which, one after another, his mortal illness, the Dreyfus case and the anti-semitic propaganda had revived. There are certain Israelites, superior people for all that and refined men of the world, in whom there remain in reserve and in the wings, ready to enter at a given moment in their lives, as in a play, a bounder and a prophet. Swann had arrived at the age of the prophet. Certainly, with his face from which, by the action of his disease, whole segments had vanished, as when a block of ice melts and slabs of it fall off bodily, he had greatly altered. But I could not help being struck by the discovery how far more he had altered in relation to myself. This man, excellent, cultivated, whom I was far from annoyed at meeting, I could not bring myself to understand how I had been able to invest him long ago in a mystery so great that his appearance in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es used to make my heart beat so violently that I was too bashful to approach his silk-lined cape, that at the door of the flat in which such a being dwelt I could not ring the bell without being overcome by boundless emotion and dismay; all this had vanished not only from his home, but from his person, and the idea of talking to him might or might not be agreeable to me, but had no effect whatever upon my nervous system\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And besides, how he had altered since that very afternoon, when I had met him \u2014 after all, only a few hours earlier \u2014 in the Duc de Guermantes\u2019s study. Had he really had a scene with the Prince, and had it left him crushed? The supposition was not necessary. The slightest efforts that are demanded of a person who is very ill quickly become for him an excessive strain. He has only to be exposed, when already tired, to the heat of a crowded drawing-room, for his countenance to decompose and turn blue, as happens in a few hours with an overripe pear or milk that is ready to turn. Besides, Swann\u2019s hair was worn thin in patches, and, as Mme. de Guermantes remarked, needed attention from the furrier, looked as if it had been camphored, and camphored badly. I was just crossing the room to speak to Swann when unfortunately a hand fell upon my shoulder\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHallo, old boy, I am in Paris for forty-eight hours. I called at your house, they told me you were here, so that it is to you that my aunt is indebted for the honour of my company at her party.\u201d It was Saint-Loup. I told him how greatly I admired the house. \u201cYes, it makes quite a historic edifice. Personally, I think it appalling. We mustn\u2019t go near my uncle Palam\u00e8de, or we shall be caught. Now that Mme. Mol\u00e9 has gone (for it is she that is ruling the roost just now), he is quite at a loose end. It seems it was as good as a play, he never let her out of his sight for a moment, and only left her when he had put her safely into her carriage. I bear my uncle no ill will, only I do think it odd that my family council, which has always been so hard on me, should be composed of the very ones who have led giddy lives themselves, beginning with the giddiest of the lot, my uncle Charlus, who is my official guardian, has had more women than Don Juan, and is still carrying on in spite of his age. There was a talk at one time of having me made a ward of court. I bet, when all those gay old dogs met to consider the question, and had me up to preach to me and tell me that I was breaking my mother\u2019s heart, they dared not look one another in the face for fear of laughing. Just think of the fellows who formed the council, you would think they had deliberately chosen the biggest womanisers.\u201d Leaving out of account M. de Charlus, with regard to whom my friend\u2019s astonishment no longer seemed to me to be justified, but for different reasons, and reasons which, moreover, were afterwards to undergo modification in my mind, Robert was quite wrong in finding it extraordinary that lessons in worldly wisdom should be given to a young man by people who had done foolish things, or were still doing them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if we take into account only atavism, family likenesses, it is inevitable that the uncle who delivers the lecture should have more or less the same faults as the nephew whom he has been deputed to scold. Nor is the uncle in the least hypocritical in so doing, taken in as he is by the faculty that people have of believing, in every fresh experience, that \u2018this is quite different,\u2019 a faculty which allows them to adopt artistic, political and other errors without perceiving that they are the same errors which they exposed, ten years ago, in another school of painters, whom they condemned, another political affair which, they considered, merited a loathing that they no longer feel, and espouse those errors without recognising them in a fresh disguise. Besides, even if the faults of the uncle are different from those of the nephew, heredity may none the less be responsible, for the effect does not always resemble the cause, as a copy resembles its original, and even if the uncle\u2019s faults are worse, he may easily believe them to be less serious\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When M. de Charlus made indignant remonstrances to Robert, who moreover was unaware of his uncle\u2019s true inclinations, at that time, and indeed if it had still been the time when the Baron used to scarify his own inclinations, he might perfectly well have been sincere in considering, from the point of view of a man of the world, that Robert was infinitely more to blame than himself. Had not Robert, at the very moment when his uncle had been deputed to make him listen to reason, come within an inch of getting himself ostracised by society, had he not very nearly been blackballed at the Jockey, had he not made himself a public laughing stock by the vast sums that he threw away upon a woman of the lowest order, by his friendships with people \u2014 authors, actors, Jews \u2014 not one of whom moved in society, by his opinions, which were indistinguishable from those held by traitors, by the grief he was causing to all his relatives? In what respect could it be compared, this scandalous existence, with that of M. de Charlus who had managed, so far, not only to retain but to enhance still further his position as a Guermantes, being in society an absolutely privileged person, sought after, adulated in the most exclusive circles, and a man who, married to a Bourbon Princess, a woman of eminence, had been able to ensure her happiness, had shewn a devotion to her memory more fervent, more scrupulous than is customary in society, and had thus been as good a husband as a son!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut are you sure that M. de Charlus has had all those mistresses?\u201d I asked, not, of course, with any diabolical intent of revealing to Robert the secret that I had surprised, but irritated, nevertheless, at hearing him maintain an erroneous theory with so much certainty and assurance. He merely shrugged his shoulders in response to what he took for ingenuousness on my part. \u201cNot that I blame him in the least, I consider that he is perfectly right.\u201d And he began to sketch in outline a theory of conduct that would have horrified him at Balbec (where he was not content with denouncing seducers, death seeming to him then the only punishment adequate to their crime). Then, however, he had still been in love and jealous. He went so far as to sing me the praises of houses of assignation. \u201cThey\u2019re the only places where you can find a shoe to fit you, sheath your weapon, as we say in the regiment.\u201d He no longer felt for places of that sort the disgust that had inflamed him at Balbec when I made an allusion to them, and, hearing what he now said, I told him that Bloch had introduced me to one, but Robert replied that the one which Bloch frequented must be \u201cextremely mixed, the poor man\u2019s paradise! \u2014 It all depends, though: where is it?\u201d I remained vague, for I had just remembered that it was the same house at which one used to have for a louis that Rachel whom Robert had so passionately loved. \u201cAnyhow, I can take you to some far better ones, full of stunning women.\u201d Hearing me express the desire that he would take me as soon as possible to the ones he knew, which must indeed be far superior to the house to which Bloch had taken me, he expressed a sincere regret that he could not, on this occasion, as he would have to leave Paris next day. \u201cIt will have to be my next leave,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, there are young girls there, even,\u201d he added with an air of mystery. \u201cThere is a little Mademoiselle de . . . I think it\u2019s d\u2019Orgeville, I can let you have the exact name, who is the daughter of quite tip-top people; her mother was by way of being a La Croix-l\u2019Ev\u00eaque, and they\u2019re a really decent family, in fact they\u2019re more or less related, if I\u2019m not mistaken, to my aunt Oriane. Anyhow, you have only to see the child, you can tell at once that she comes of decent people\u201d (I could detect, hovering for a moment over Robert\u2019s voice, the shadow of the genius of the Guermantes, which passed like a cloud, but at a great height and without stopping). \u201cIt seems to me to promise marvellous developments. The parents are always ill and can\u2019t look after her. Gad, the child must have some amusement, and I count upon you to provide it!\u201d \u201cOh! When are you coming back?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, if you don\u2019t absolutely insist upon Duchesses\u201d (Duchess being in aristocracy the only title that denotes a particularly brilliant rank, as the lower orders talk of \u2018Princesses\u2019), \u201cin a different class of goods, there is Mme. Putbus\u2019s maid.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this moment, Mme. de Surgis entered the room in search of her sons. As soon as he saw her M. de Charlus went up to her with a friendliness by which the Marquise was all the more agreeably surprised, in that an icy frigidity was what she had expected from the Baron, who had always posed as Oriane\u2019s protector and alone of the family \u2014 the rest being too often inclined to forgive the Duke his irregularities by the glamour of his position and their own jealousy of the Duchess \u2014 kept his brother\u2019s mistresses pitilessly at a distance. And so Mme. de Surgis had fully understood the motives of the attitude that she dreaded to find in the Baron, but never for a moment suspected those of the wholly different welcome that she did receive from him. He spoke to her with admiration of the portrait that Jacquet had painted of her years before. This admiration waxed indeed to an enthusiasm which, if it was partly deliberate, with the object of preventing the Marquise from going away, of \u2018hooking\u2019 her, as Robert used to say of enemy armies when you seek to keep their effective strength engaged at one point, might also be sincere. For, if everyone was delighted to admire in her sons the regal bearing and eyes of Mme. de Surgis, the Baron could taste an inverse but no less keen pleasure in finding those charms combined in the mother, as in a portrait which does not by itself excite desire, but feeds with the aesthetic admiration that it does excite the desires that it revives. These came now to give, in retrospect, a voluptuous charm to Jacquet\u2019s portrait itself, and at that moment the Baron would gladly have purchased it to study upon its surface the physiognomic pedigree of the two young Surgis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou see, I wasn\u2019t exaggerating,\u201d Robert said in my ear. \u201cJust look at the way my uncle is running after Mme. de Surgis. Though I must say, that does surprise me. If Oriane knew, she would be furious. Really, there are enough women in the world without his having to go and sprawl over that one,\u201d he went on; like everybody who is not in love, he imagined that one chose the person whom one loved after endless deliberations and on the strength of various qualities and advantages. Besides, while completely mistaken about his uncle, whom he supposed to be devoted to women, Robert, in his rancour, spoke too lightly of M. de Charlus. We are not always somebody\u2019s nephew with impunity. It is often through him that a hereditary habit is transmitted to us sooner or later. We might indeed arrange a whole gallery of portraits, named like the German comedy:Uncle and Nephew, in which we should see the uncle watching jealously, albeit unconsciously, for his nephew to end by becoming like himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I go so far as to say that this gallery would be incomplete were we not to include in it the uncles who are not really related by blood, being the uncles only of their nephews\u2019 wives. The Messieurs de Charlus are indeed so convinced that they themselves are the only good husbands, what is more the only husbands of whom their wives are not jealous, that generally, out of affection for their niece, they make her marry another Charlus. Which tangles the skein of family likenesses. And, to affection for the niece, is added at times affection for her betrothed as well. Such marriages are not uncommon, and are often what are called happy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat were we talking about? Oh yes, that big, fair girl, Mme. Put-bus\u2019s maid. She goes with women too, but I don\u2019t suppose you mind that, I can tell you frankly, I have never seen such a gorgeous creature.\u201d \u201cI imagine her rather Giorgione?\u201d \u201cWildly Giorgione! Oh, if I only had a little time in Paris, what wonderful things there are to be done! And then, one goes on to the next. For love is all rot, mind you, I\u2019ve finished with all that.\u201d I soon discovered, to my surprise, that he had equally finished with literature, whereas it was merely with regard to literary men that he had struck me as being disillusioned at our last meeting. (\u201cThey\u2019re practically all a pack of scoundrels,\u201d he had said to me, a saying that might be explained by his justified resentment towards certain of Rachel\u2019s friends. They had indeed persuaded her that she would never have any talent if she allowed \u2018Robert, scion of an alien race\u2019 to acquire an influence over her, and with her used to make fun of him, to his face, at the dinners to which he entertained them.) But in reality Robert\u2019s love of Letters was in no sense profound, did not spring from his true nature, was only a by-product of his love of Rachel, and he had got rid of it, at the same time as of his horror of voluptuaries and his religious respect for the virtue of women\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere is something very strange about those two young men. Look at that curious passion for gambling, Marquise,\u201d said M. de Charlus, drawing Mme. de Surgis\u2019s attention to her own sons, as though he were completely unaware of their identity. \u201cThey must be a pair of Orientals, they have certain characteristic features, they are perhaps Turks,\u201d he went on, so as both to give further support to his feint of innocence and to exhibit a vague antipathy, which, when in due course it gave place to affability, would prove that the latter was addressed to the young men solely in their capacity as sons of Mme. de Surgis, having begun only when the Baron discovered who they were. Perhaps too M. de Charlus, whose insolence was a natural gift which he delighted in exercising, took advantage of the few moments in which he was supposed not to know the name of these two young men to have a little fun at Mme. de Surgis\u2019s expense, and to indulge in his habitual sarcasm, as Scapin takes advantage of his master\u2019s disguise to give him a sound drubbing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey are my sons,\u201d said Mme. de Surgis, with a blush which would not have coloured her cheeks had she been more discerning, without necessarily being more virtuous. She would then have understood that the air of absolute indifference or of sarcasm which M. de Charlus displayed towards a young man was no more sincere than the wholly superficial admiration which he shewed for a woman, did not express his true nature. The woman to whom he could go on indefinitely paying the prettiest compliments might well be jealous of the look which, while talking to her, he shot at a man whom he would pretend afterwards not to have noticed. For that look was not of the sort which M. de Charlus kept for women; a special look, springing from the depths, which even at a party could not help straying innocently in the direction of the young men, like the look in a tailor\u2019s eye which betrays his profession by immediately fastening upon your attire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, how very strange!\u201d replied M. de Charlus, not without insolence, as though his mind had to make a long journey to arrive at a reality so different from what he had pretended to suppose. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know them!\u201d he added, fearing lest he might have gone a little too far in the expression of his antipathy, and have thus paralysed the Marquise\u2019s intention to let him make their acquaintance. \u201cWould you allow me to introduce them to you?\u201d Mme. de Surgis inquired timidly. \u201cWhy, good gracious, just as you please, I shall be delighted, I am perhaps not very entertaining company for such young people,\u201d M. de Charlus intoned with the air of hesitation and coldness of a person who is letting himself be forced into an act of politeness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cArnulphe, Victurnien, come here at once,\u201d said Mme. de Surgis. Vic-turnien rose with decision. Arnulphe, though he could not see where his brother was going, followed him meekly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the sons\u2019 turn, now,\u201d muttered Saint-Loup. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to make one die with laughing. He tries to curry favour with every one, down to the dog in the yard. It is all the funnier, as my uncle detests pretty boys. And just look how seriously he is listening to them. If it had been I who tried to introduce them to him, he would have given me what for. Listen, I shall have to go and say how d\u2019ye do to Oriane. I have so little time in Paris that I want to try and see all the people here that I ought to leave cards on.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a well-bred air they have, what charming manners,\u201d M. de Charlus was saying. \u201cYou think so?\u201d Mme. de Surgis replied, highly delighted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann having caught sight of me came over to Saint-Loup and myself. His Jewish gaiety was less refined than his witticisms as a man of the world. \u201cGood evening,\u201d he said to us. \u201cHeavens! All three of us together, people will think it is a meeting of the Syndicate. In another minute they\u2019ll be looking for the safe!\u201d He had not observed that M. de Beaucerfeuil was just behind his back and could hear what he said. The General could not help wincing. We heard the voice of M. de Charlus close beside us: \u201cWhat, you are called Victurnien, after the Cabinet des Antiques,\u201d the Baron was saying, to prolong his conversation with the two young men. \u201cBy Balzac, yes,\u201d replied the elder Surgis, who had never read a line of that novelist\u2019s work, but to whom his tutor had remarked, a few days earlier, upon the similarity of his Christian name and d\u2019Esgrignon\u2019s. Mme. de Surgis was delighted to see her son shine, and at M. de Charlus\u2019s ecstasy before such a display of learning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt appears that Loubet is entirely on our side, I have it from an absolutely trustworthy source,\u201d Swann informed Saint-Loup, but this time in a lower tone so as not to be overheard by the General. Swann had begun to find his wife\u2019s Republican connexions more interesting now that the Dreyfus case had become his chief preoccupation. \u201cI tell you this because I know that your heart is with us.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot quite to that extent; you are entirely mistaken,\u201d was Robert\u2019s answer. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad business, and I\u2019m sorry I ever had a finger in it. It was no affair of mine. If it were to begin over again, I should keep well clear of it. I am a soldier, and my first duty is to support the Army. If you will stay with M. Swann for a moment, I shall be back presently, I must go and talk to my aunt.\u201d But I saw that it was with Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac that he went to talk, and was distressed by the thought that he had lied to me about the possibility of their engagement. My mind was set at rest when I learned that he had been introduced to her half an hour earlier by Mme. de Marsant\u00e9s, who was anxious for the marriage, the Ambresacs being extremely rich\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt last,\u201d said M. de Charlus to Mme. de Surgis, \u201cI find a young man with some education, who has read, who knows what is meant by Balzac. And it gives me all the more pleasure to meet him where that sort of thing has become most rare, in the house of one of my peers, one of ourselves,\u201d he added, laying stress upon the words. It was all very well for the Guermantes to profess to regard all men as equal; on the great occasions when they found themselves among people who were \u2018born,\u2019 especially if they were not quite so well born as themselves, whom they were anxious and able to flatter, they did not hesitate to trot out old family memories. \u201cAt one time,\u201d the Baron went on, \u201cthe word aristocrat meant the best people, in intellect, in heart. Now, here is the first person I find among pur-selves who has ever heard of Victurnien d\u2019Esgrignon. I am wrong in saying the first. There are also a Polignac and a Montesquieu,\u201d added M. de Charlus, who knew that this twofold association must inevitably thrill the Marquise. \u201cHowever, your sons have every reason to be learned, their maternal grandfather had a famous collection of eighteenth century stuff. I will shew you mine if you will do me the pleasure of coming to luncheon with me one day,\u201d he said to the young Victurnien. \u201cI can shew you an interesting edition of the Cabinet des Antiques with corrections in Balzac\u2019s own hand. I shall be charmed to bring the two Victurniens face to face.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could not bring myself to leave Swann. He had arrived at that stage of exhaustion in which a sick man\u2019s body becomes a mere retort in which we study chemical reactions. His face was mottled with tiny spots of Prussian blue, which seemed not to belong to the world of living things, and emitted the sort of odour which, at school, after the \u2018experiments,\u2019 makes it so unpleasant to have to remain in a \u2018science\u2019 classroom. I asked him whether he had not had a long conversation with the Prince de Guermantes and if he would tell me what it had been about. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut go for a moment first with M. de Charlus and Mme. de Surgis, I shall wait for you here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, M. de Charlus, having suggested to Mme. de Surgis that they should leave this room which was too hot, and go and sit for a little in another, had invited not the two sons to accompany their mother, but myself. In this way he made himself appear, after he had successfully hooked them, to have lost all interest in the two young men. He was moreover paying me an inexpensive compliment, Mme. de Surgis being in distinctly bad odour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, no sooner had we sat down in an alcove from which there was no way of escape than Mme. de Saint-Euverte, a butt for the Baron\u2019s jibes, came past. She, perhaps to mask or else openly to shew her contempt for the ill will which she inspired in M. de Charlus, and above all to shew that she was on intimate terms with a woman who was talking so familiarly to him, gave a disdainfully friendly greeting to the famous beauty, who acknowledged it, peeping out of the corner of her eye at M. de Charlus with a mocking smile. But the alcove was so narrow that Mme. de Saint-Euverte, when she tried to continue, behind our backs, her canvass of her guests for the morrow, found herself a prisoner, and had some difficulty in escaping, a precious moment which M. de Charlus, anxious that his insolent wit should shine before the mother of the two young men, took good care not to let slip. A silly question which I had put to him, without malice aforethought, gave him the opportunity for a hymn of triumph of which the poor Saint-Euverte, almost immobilised behind us, could not have lost a word. \u201cWould you believe it, this impertinent young man,\u201d he said, indicating me to Mme. de Surgis, \u201casked me just now, without any sign of that modesty which makes us keep such expeditions private, if I was going to Mme. de Saint-Euverte\u2019s, which is to say, I suppose, if I was suffering from the colic. I should endeavour, in any case, to relieve myself in some more comfortable place than the house of a person who, if my memory serves me, was celebrating her centenary when I first began to go about town, though not, of course, to her house. And yet who could be more interesting to listen to? What a host of historic memories, seen and lived through in the days of the First Empire and the Restoration, and secret history too, which could certainly have nothing of the \u2018saint\u2019 about it, but must be decidedly \u2018verdant\u2019 if we are to judge by the amount of kick still left in the old trot\u2019s shanks. What would prevent me from questioning her about those passionate times is the acuteness of my olfactory organ. The proximity of the lady is enough. I say to myself all at once: oh, good lord, some one has broken the lid of my cesspool, when it is simply the Marquise opening her mouth to emit some invitation. And you can understand that if I had the misfortune to go to her house, the cesspool would be magnified into a formidable sewage-cart. She bears a mystic name, though, which has always made me think with jubilation, although she has long since passed the date of her jubilee, of that stupid line of poetry called deliquescent: \u2018Ah, green, how green my soul was on that day. . . . \u2019 But I require a cleaner sort of verdure. They tell me that the indefatigable old streetwalker gives \u2018garden-parties,\u2019 I should describe them as \u2018invitations to explore the sewers.\u2019 Are you going to wallow there?\u201d he asked Mme. de Surgis, who this time was annoyed. Wishing to pretend for the Baron\u2019s benefit that she was not going, and knowing that she would give days of her life rather than miss the Saint-Euverte party, she got out of it by taking a middle course, that is to say uncertainty. This uncertainty took so clumsily amateurish, so sordidly material a form, that M. de Charlus, with no fear of offending Mme. de Surgis, whom nevertheless he was anxious to please, began to laugh to shew her that \u2018it cut no ice with him.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI always admire people who make plans,\u201d she said; \u201cI often change mine at the last moment. There is a question of a summer frock which may alter everything. I shall act upon the inspiration of the moment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For my part, I was furious at the abominable little speech that M. de Charlus had just made. I would have liked to shower blessings upon the giver of garden-parties. Unfortunately, in the social as in the political world, the victims are such cowards that one cannot for long remain indignant with their tormentors. Mme. de Saint-Euverte, who had succeeded in escaping from the alcove to which we were barring the entry, brushed against the Baron inadvertently as she passed him, and, by a reflex action of snobbishness which wiped out all her anger, perhaps even in the hope of securing an opening, at which this could not be the first attempt, exclaimed: \u201cOh! I beg your pardon, Monsieur de Charlus, I hope I did not hurt you,\u201d as though she were kneeling before her lord and master. The latter did not deign to reply save by a broad ironical smile, and conceded only a \u201cGood evening,\u201d which, uttered as though he were only now made aware of the Marquise\u2019s presence after she had greeted him, was an insult the more. Lastly, with a supreme want of spirit which pained me for her sake, Mme. de Saint-Euverte came up to me and, drawing me aside, said in my ear: \u201cTell me, what have I done to offend M. de Charlus? They say that he doesn\u2019t consider me smart enough for him,\u201d she said, laughing from ear to ear. I remained serious. For one thing, I thought it stupid of her to appear to believe or to wish other people to believe that nobody, really, was as smart as herself. For another thing, people who laugh so heartily at what they themselves have said, when it is not funny, dispense us accordingly, by taking upon themselves the responsibility for the mirth, from joining in it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOther people assure me that he is cross because I do not invite him. But he does not give me much encouragement. He seems to avoid me.\u201d (This expression struck me as inadequate.) \u201cTry to find out, and come and tell me to-morrow. And if he feels remorseful and wishes to come too, bring him. I shall forgive and forget. Indeed, I shall be quite glad to see him, because it will annoy Mme. de Surgis. I give you a free hand. You have the most perfect judgment in these matters and I do not wish to appear to be begging my guests to come. In any case, I count upon you absolutely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It occurred to me that Swann must be getting tired of waiting for me. I did not wish, moreover, to be too late in returning home, because of Albertine, and, taking leave of Mme. de Surgis and M. de Charlus, I went in search of my sick man in the card-room. I asked him whether what he had said to the Prince in their conversation in the garden was really what M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 (whom I did not name) had reported to us, about a little play by Bergotte. He burst out laughing: \u201cThere is not a word of truth in it, not one, it is entirely made up and would have been an utterly stupid thing to say. Really, it is unheard of, this spontaneous generation of falsehood. I do not ask who it was that told you, but it would be really interesting, in a field as limited as this, to work back from one person to another and find out how the story arose. Anyhow, what concern can it be of other people, what the Prince said to me? People are very inquisitive. I have never been inquisitive, except when I was in love, and when I was jealous. And a lot I ever learned! Are you jealous?\u201d I told Swann that I had never experienced jealousy, that I did not even know what it was. \u201cIndeed! I congratulate you. A little jealousy is not at all a bad thing, from two points of view. For one thing, because it enables people who are not inquisitive to take an interest in the lives of others, or of one other at any rate. And besides, it makes one feel the pleasure of possession, of getting into a carriage with a woman, of not allowing her to go about by herself. But that occurs only in the very first stages of the disease, or when the cure is almost complete. In the interval, it is the most agonising torment. However, even the two pleasures I have mentioned, I must own to you that I have tasted very little of them: the first, by the fault of my own nature, which is incapable of sustained reflexion; the second, by force of circumstances, by the fault of the woman, I should say the women, of whom I have been jealous. But that makes no difference. Even when one is no longer interested in things, it is still something to have been interested in them; because it was always for reasons which other people did not grasp. The memory of those sentiments is, we feel, to be found only in ourselves; we must go back into ourselves to study it. You mustn\u2019t laugh at this idealistic jargon, what I mean to say is that I have been very fond of life and very fond of art. Very well! Now that I am a little too weary to live with other people, those old sentiments, so personal and individual, that I felt in the past, seem to me \u2014 it is the mania of all collectors \u2014 very precious. I open my heart to myself like a sort of showcase, and examine one by one ever so many love affairs of which the rest of the world can have known nothing. And of this collection, to which I am now even more attached than to my others, I say to myself, rather as Mazarin said of his library, but still without any keen regret, that it will be very tiresome to have to leave it all. But, to come back to my conversation with the Prince, I shall repeat it to one person only, and that person is going to be yourself.\u201d My attention was distracted by the conversation that M. de Charlus, who had returned to the card-room, was prolonging indefinitely close beside us. \u201cAnd are you a reader too? What do you do?\u201d he asked Comte Arnulphe, who had never heard even the name of Balzac. But his short-sightedness, as he saw everything very small, gave him the appearance of seeing to great distances, so that, rare poetry in a sculptural Greek god, there seemed to be engraved upon his pupils remote, mysterious stars\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSuppose we took a turn in the garden, Sir,\u201d I said to Swann, while Comte Arnulphe, in a lisping voice which seemed to indicate that mentally at least his development was incomplete, replied to M. de Charlus with an artlessly obliging precision: \u201cI, oh, golf chiefly, tennis, football, running, polo I\u2019m really keen on.\u201d So Minerva, being subdivided, ceased in certain cities to be the goddess of wisdom, and incarnated part of herself in a purely sporting, horse-loving deity, Athene Hippia. And he went to Saint Moritz also to ski, for Pallas Trilogeneia frequents the high peaks and outruns swift horsemen. \u201cAh!\u201d replied M. de Charlus with the transcendent smile of the intellectual who does not even take the trouble to conceal his derision, but, on the other hand, feels himself so superior to other people and so far despises the intelligence of those who are the least stupid, that he barely differentiates between them and the most stupid, the moment they can be attractive to him in some other way. While talking to Arnulphe, M. de Charlus felt that by the mere act of addressing him he was conferring upon him a superiority which everyone else must recognise and envy. \u201cNo,\u201d Swann replied, \u201cI am too tired to walk about, let us sit down somewhere in a corner, I cannot remain on my feet any longer.\u201d This was true, and yet the act of beginning to talk had already given him back a certain vivacity. This was because, in the most genuine exhaustion, there is, especially in neurotic people, an element that depends upon attracting their attention and is kept going only by an act of memory. We at once feel tired as soon as we are afraid of feeling tired, and, to throw off our fatigue, it suffices us to forget about it. To be sure, Swann was far from being one of those indefatigable invalids who, entering a room worn out and ready to drop, revive in conversation like a flower in water and are able for hours on end to draw from their own words a reserve of strength which they do not, alas, communicate to their hearers, who appear more and more exhausted the more the talker comes back to life. But Swann belonged to that stout Jewish race, in whose vital energy, its resistance to death, its individual members seem to share. Stricken severally by their own diseases, as it is stricken itself by persecution, they continue indefinitely to struggle against terrible suffering which may be prolonged beyond every apparently possible limit, when already one sees nothing more than a prophet\u2019s beard surmounted by a huge nose which dilates to inhale its last breath, before the hour strikes for the ritual prayers and the punctual procession begins of distant relatives advancing with mechanical movements, as upon an Assyrian frieze\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We went to sit down, but, before moving away from the group formed by M. de Charlus with the two young Surgis and their mother, Swann could not resist fastening upon the lady\u2019s bosom the slow expansive concupiscent gaze of a connoisseur. He put up his monocle, for a better view, and, while he talked to me, kept glancing in the direction of the lady. \u201cThis is, word for word,\u201d he said to me when we were seated, \u201cmy conversation with the Prince, and if you remember what I said to you just now, you will see why I choose you as my confidant. There is another reason as well, which you shall one day learn. \u2014\u2018My dear Swann,\u2019 the Prince de Guermantes said to me, \u2018you must forgive me if I have appeared to be avoiding you for some time past.\u2019 (I had never even noticed it, having been ill and avoiding society myself.) \u2018In the first place, I had heard it said that, as I fully expected, in the unhappy affair which is splitting the country in two your views were diametrically opposed to mine. Now, it would have been extremely painful to me to have to hear you express them. So sensitive were my nerves that when the Princess, two years ago, heard her brother-in-law, the Grand Duke of Hesse, say that Dreyfus was innocent, she was not content with promptly denying the assertion but refrained from repeating it to me in order not to upset me. About the same time, the Crown Prince of Sweden came to Paris and, having probably heard some one say that the Empress Eug\u00e9nie was a Dreyfusist, confused her with the Princess (a strange confusion, you will admit, between a woman of the rank of my wife and a Spaniard, a great deal less well born than people make out, and married to a mere Bonaparte), and said to her: Princess, I am doubly glad to meet you, for I know that you hold the same view as myself of the Dreyfus case, which does not surprise me since Your Highness is Bavarian. Which drew down upon the Prince the answer: Sir, I am nothing now but a French Princess, and I share the views of all my fellow-countrymen. Now, my dear Swann, about eighteen months ago, a conversation I had with General de Beaucerfeuil made me suspect that not an error, but grave illegalities had been committed in the procedure of the trial.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were interrupted (Swann did not wish people to overhear his story) by the voice of M. de Charlus who (without, as it happened, paying us the slightest attention) came past escorting Mme. de Surgis, and stopped in the hope of detaining her for a moment longer, whether on account of her sons or from that reluctance common to all the Guermantes to bring anything to an end, which kept them plunged in a sort of anxious inertia. Swann informed me, in this connexion, a little later, of something that stripped the name Surgis-le-Duc, for me, of all the poetry that I had found in it. The Marquise de Surgis-le-Duc boasted a far higher social position, far finer connexions by marriage than her cousin the Comte de Surgis, who had no money and lived on his estate in the country. But the words that ended her title \u201cle Duc\u201d had not at all the origin which I ascribed to them, and which had made me associate it in my imagination with Bourg-l\u2019Abb\u00e9, Bois-le-Roi, etc. AH that had happened was that a Comte de Surgis had married, during the Restoration, the daughter of an immensely rich industrial magnate, M. Leduc, or Le Duc, himself the son of a chemical manufacturer, the richest man of his day, and a Peer of France. King Charles X had created for the son born of this marriage the Marquisate of Surgis-le-Duc, a Marquisate of Surgis existing already in the family. The addition of the plebeian surname had not prevented this branch from allying itself, on the strength of its enormous fortune, with the first families of the realm. And the present Marquise de Surgis-le-Duc, herself of exalted birth, might have moved in the very highest circles. A demon of perversity had driven her, scorning the position ready made for her, to flee from the conjugal roof, to live a life of open scandal. Whereupon the world which she had scorned at twenty, when it was at her feet, had cruelly failed her at thirty, when, after ten years, everybody, except a few faithful friends, had ceased to bow to her, and she set to work to reconquer laboriously, inch by inch, what she had possessed as a birthright. (An outward and return journey which are not uncommon.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the great nobles, her kinsmen, whom she had disowned in the past, and who in their turn had now disowned her, she found an excuse for the joy that she would feel in gathering them again to her bosom in the memories of childhood that they would be able to recall. And in so saying, to cloak her snobbishness, she was perhaps less untruthful than she supposed. \u201cBasin is all my girlhood!\u201d she said on the day on which he came back to her. And as a matter of fact there was a grain of truth in the statement. But she had miscalculated when she chose him for her lover. For all the women friends of the Duchesse de Guermantes were to rally round her, and so Mme. de Surgis must descend for the second time that slope up which she had so laboriously toiled. \u201cWell!\u201d M. de Charlus was saying to her, in his attempt to prolong the conversation. \u201cYou will lay my tribute at the feet of the beautiful portrait. How is it? What has become of it?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d replied Mme. de Surgis, \u201cyou know I haven\u2019t got it now; my husband wasn\u2019t pleased with it.\u201d \u201cNot pleased! With one of the greatest works of art of our time, equal to Nattier\u2019s Duchesse de Ch\u00e2teauroux, and, moreover, perpetuating no less majestic and heart-shattering a goddess. Oh! That little blue collar! I swear, Vermeer himself never painted a fabric more consummately, but we must not say it too loud or Swann will fall upon us to avenge his favourite painter, the Master of Delft.\u201d The Marquise, turning round, addressed a smile and held out her hand to Swann, who had risen to greet her. But almost without concealment, whether in his declining days he had lost all wish for concealment, by indifference to opinion, or the physical power, by the excitement of his desire and the weakening of the control that helps us to conceal it, as soon as Swann, on taking the Marquise\u2019s hand, saw her bosom at close range and from above, he plunged an attentive, serious, absorbed, almost anxious gaze into the cavity of her bodice, and his nostrils, drugged by the lady\u2019s perfume, quivered like the wings of a butterfly about to alight upon a half-hidden flower. He checked himself abruptly on the edge of the precipice, and Mme. de Surgis herself, albeit annoyed, stifled a deep sigh, so contagious can desire prove at times. \u201cThe painter was cross,\u201d she said to M. de Charlus, \u201cand took it back. I have heard that it is now at Diane de Saint-Euverte\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI decline to believe,\u201d said the Baron, \u201cthat a great picture can have such bad taste.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is talking to her about her portrait. I could talk to her about that portrait just as well as Charlus,\u201d said Swann, affecting a drawling, slangy tone as he followed the retreating couple with his gaze. \u201cAnd I should certainly enjoy talking about it more than Charlus,\u201d he added. I asked him whether the things that were said about M. de Charlus were true, in doing which I was lying twice over, for, if I had no proof that anybody ever had said anything, I had on the other hand been perfectly aware for some hours past that what I was hinting at was true. Swann shrugged his shoulders, as though I had suggested something quite absurd. \u201cIt\u2019s quite true that he\u2019s a charming friend. But, need I add, his friendship is purely platonic. He is more sentimental than other men, that is all; on the other hand, as he never goes very far with women, that has given a sort of plausibility to the idiotic rumours to which you refer. Charlus is perhaps greatly attached to his men friends, but you may be quite certain that the attachment is only in his head and in his heart. At last, we may perhaps be left in peace for a moment. Well, the Prince de Guermantes went on to say: \u2018I don\u2019t mind telling you that this idea of a possible illegality in the procedure of the trial was extremely painful to me, because I have always, as you know, worshipped the army; I discussed the matter again with the General, and, alas, there could be no two ways of looking at it. I don\u2019t mind telling you frankly that, all this time, the idea that an innocent man might be undergoing the most degrading punishment had never even entered my mind. But, starting from this idea of illegality, I began to study what I had always declined to read, and then the possibility not, this time, of illegal procedure but of the prisoner\u2019s innocence began to haunt me. I did not feel that I could talk about it to the Princess. Heaven knows that she has become just as French as myself. You may say what you like, from the day of our marriage, I took such pride in shewing her our country in all its beauty, and what to me is the most splendid thing in it, our Army, that it would have been too painful to me to tell her of my suspicions, which involved, it is true, a few officers only. But I come of a family of soldiers, I did not like to think that officers could be mistaken. I discussed the case again with Beaucerfeuil, he admitted that there had been culpable intrigues, that the bordereau was possibly not in Dreyfus\u2019s writing, but that an overwhelming proof of his guilt did exist. This was the Henry document. And, a few days later, we learned that it was a forgery. After that, without letting the Princess see me, I began to read the Si\u00e8cle and the Aurore every day; soon I had no doubt left, it kept me awake all night. I confided my distress to our friend, the abb\u00e9 Poir\u00e9, who, I was astonished to find, held the same conviction, and I got him to say masses for the intention of Dreyfus, his unfortunate wife and their children. Meanwhile, one morning as I was going to the Princess\u2019s room, I saw her maid trying to hide something from me that she had in her hand. I asked her, chaffingly, what it was, she blushed and refused to tell me. I had the fullest confidence in my wife, but this incident disturbed me considerably (and the Princess too, no doubt, who must have heard of it from her woman), for my dear Marie barely uttered a word to me that day at luncheon. I asked the abb\u00e9 Poir\u00e9 whether he could say my mass for Dreyfus on the following morning. . . . \u2019 And so much for that!\u201d exclaimed Swann, breaking off his narrative. I looked up, and saw the Duc de Guermantes bearing down upon us. \u201cForgive me for interrupting you, boys. My lad,\u201d he went on, addressing myself, \u201cI am instructed to give you a message from Oriane. Marie and Gilbert have asked her to stay and have supper at their table with only five or six other people: the Princess of Hesse, Mme. de Lign\u00e9, Mme. de Tarente, Mme. de Chevreuse, the Duchesse d\u2019Arenberg. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t wait, we are going on to a little ball of sorts.\u201d I was listening, but whenever we have something definite to do at a given moment, we depute a certain person who is accustomed to that sort of duty to keep an eye on the clock and warn us in time. This indwelling servant reminded me, as I had asked him to remind me a few hours before, that Albertine, who at the moment was far from my thoughts, was to come and see me immediately after the theatre. And so I declined the invitation to supper. This does not mean that I was not enjoying myself at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s. The truth is that men can have several sorts of pleasure. The true pleasure is that for which they abandon the other. But the latter, if it is apparent, or rather if it alone is apparent, may put people off the scent of the other, reassure or mislead the jealous, create a false impression. And yet, all that is needed to make us sacrifice it to the other is a little happiness or a little suffering. Sometimes a third order of pleasures, more serious but more essential, does not yet exist for us, in whom its potential existence is indicated only by its arousing regrets, discouragement. And yet it is to these pleasures that we shall devote ourselves in time to come. To give an example of quite secondary importance, a soldier in time of peace will sacrifice a social existence to love, but, once war is declared (and without there being any need to introduce the idea of a patriotic duty), will sacrifice love to the passion, stronger than love, for fighting. It was all very well Swann\u2019s saying that he enjoyed telling me his story, I could feel that his conversation with me, because of the lateness of the hour, and because he himself was too ill, was one of those fatigues at which those who know that they are killing themselves by sitting up late, by overexerting themselves, feel when they return home an angry regret, similar to that felt at the wild extravagance of which they have again been guilty by the spendthrifts who will not, for all that, be able to restrain themselves to-morrow from throwing money out of the windows. After we have passed a certain degree of enfeeblement, whether it be caused by age or by ill health, all pleasure taken at the expense of sleep, in departure from our habits, every breach of the rules becomes a nuisance. The talker continues to talk, out of politeness, from excitement, but he knows that the hour at which he might still have been able to go to sleep has already passed, and he knows also the reproaches that he will heap upon himself during the insomnia and fatigue that must ensue. Already, moreover, even the momentary pleasure has come to an end, body and brain are too far drained of their strength to welcome with any readiness what seems to the other person entertaining. They are like a house on the morning before a journey or removal, where visitors become a perfect plague, to be received sitting upon locked trunks, with our eyes on the clock. \u201cAt last we are alone,\u201d he said; \u201cI quite forget where I was. Oh yes, I had just told you, hadn\u2019t I, that the Prince asked the abb\u00e9 Poir\u00e9 if he could say his mass next day for Dreyfus. \u2018No, the abb\u00e9 informed me\u2019 (I say me to you,\u201d Swann explained to me, \u201cbecause it is the Prince who is speaking, you understand?), \u2018for I have another mass that I have been asked to say for him to-morrow as well. \u2014 What, I said to him, is there another Catholic as well as myself who is convinced of his innocence? \u2014 It appears so. \u2014 But this other supporter\u2019s conviction must be of more recent growth than mine. \u2014 Maybe, but this other was making me say masses when you still believed Dreyfus guilty. \u2014 Ah, I can see that it is not anyone in our world. \u2014 On the contrary! \u2014 Indeed! There are Dreyfusists among us, are there? You intrigue me; I should like to unbosom myself to this rare bird, if I know him. \u2014 You do know him. \u2014 His name? \u2014 The Princesse de Guermantes. While I was afraid of shocking the Nationalist opinions, the French faith of my dear wife, she had been afraid of alarming my religious opinions, my patriotic sentiments. But privately she had been thinking as I did, though for longer than I had. And what her maid had been hiding as she went into her room, what she went out to buy for her every morning, was the Aurore. My dear Swann, from that moment I thought of the pleasure that I should give you when I told you how closely akin my views upon this matter were to yours; forgive me for not having done so sooner. If you bear in mind that I had never said a word to the Princess, it will not surprise you to be told that thinking the same as yourself must at that time have kept me farther apart from you than thinking differently. For it was an extremely painful topic for me to approach. The more I believe that an error, that crimes even have been committed, the more my heart bleeds for the Army. It had never occurred to me that opinions like mine could possibly cause you similar pain, until I was told the other day that you were emphatically protesting against the insults to the Army and against the Dreyfusists for consenting to ally themselves with those who insulted it. That settled it, I admit that it has been most painful for me to confess to you what I think of certain officers, few in number fortunately, but it is a relief to me not to have to keep at arms\u2019 length from you any longer, and especially that you should quite understand that if I was able to entertain other sentiments, it was because I had not a shadow of doubt as to the soundness of the verdict. As soon as my doubts began, I could wish for only one thing, that the mistake should be rectified.\u2019 I must tell you that this speech of the Prince de Guermantes moved me profoundly. If you knew him as I do, if you could realise the distance he has had to traverse in order to reach his present position, you would admire him as he deserves. Not that his opinion surprises me, his is such a straightforward nature!\u201d Swann was forgetting that in the afternoon he had on the contrary told me that people\u2019s opinions as to the Dreyfus case were dictated by atavism. At the most he had made an exception in favour of intelligence, because in Saint-Loup it had managed to overcome atavism and had made a Dreyfusard of him. Now he had just seen that this victory had been of short duration and that Saint-Loup had passed into the opposite camp. And so it was to straightforwardness now that he assigned the part which had previously devolved upon intelligence. In reality we always discover afterwards that our adversaries had a reason for being on the side they espoused, which has nothing to do with any element of right that there may be on that side, and that those who think as we do do so because their intelligence, if their moral nature is too base to be invoked, or their straightforwardness, if their penetration is feeble, has compelled them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann now found equally intelligent anybody who was of his opinion, his old friend the Prince de Guermantes and my schoolfellow Bloch, whom previously he had avoided and whom he now invited to luncheon. Swann interested Bloch greatly by telling him that the Prince de Guermantes was a Dreyfusard. \u201cWe must ask him to sign our appeal for Picquart; a name like his would have a tremendous effect.\u201d But Swann, blending with his ardent conviction as an Israelite the diplomatic moderation of a man of the world, whose habits he had too thoroughly acquired to be able to shed them at this late hour, refused to allow Bloch to send the Prince a circular to sign, even on his own initiative. \u201cHe cannot do such a thing, we must not expect the impossible,\u201d Swann repeated. \u201cThere you have a charming man who has travelled thousands of miles to come over to our side. He can be very useful to us. If he were to sign your list, he would simply be compromising himself with his own people, would be made to suffer on our account, might even repent of his confidences and not confide in us again.\u201d Nor was this all, Swann refused his own signature. He felt that his name was too Hebraic not to create a bad effect. Besides, even if he approved of all the attempts to secure a fresh trial, he did not wish to be mixed up in any way in the antimilitarist campaign. He wore, a thing he had never done previously, the decoration he had won as a young militiaman, in \u201870, and added a codicil to his will asking that, contrary to his previous dispositions, he might be buried with the military honours due to his rank as Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. A request which assembled round the church of Combray a whole squadron of those troopers over whose fate Fran\u00e7oise used to weep in days gone by, when she envisaged the prospect of a war. In short, Swann refused to sign Bloch\u2019s circular, with the result that, if he passed in the eyes of many people as a fanatical Dreyfusard, my friend found him lukewarm, infected with Nationalism, and a militarist. Swann left me without shaking hands so as not to be forced into a general leave-taking in this room which swarmed with his friends, but said to me: \u201cYou ought to come and see your friend Gilberte. She has really grown up now and altered, you would not know her. She would be so pleased!\u201d I was no longer in love with Gilberte. She was for me like a dead person for whom one has long mourned, then forgetfulness has come, and if she were to be resuscitated, she could no longer find any place in a life which has ceased to be fashioned for her. I had no desire now to see her, not even that desire to shew her that I did not wish to see her which, every day, when I was in love with her, I vowed to myself that I would flaunt before her, when I should be in love with her no longer\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, seeking now only to give myself, in Gilberte\u2019s eyes, the air of having longed with all my heart to meet her again and of having been prevented by circumstances of the kind called \u201cbeyond our control\u201d albeit they only occur, with any certainty at least, when we have done nothing to prevent them, so far from accepting Swann\u2019s invitation with reserve, I would not let him go until he had promised to explain in detail to his daughter the mischances that had prevented and would continue to prevent me from going to see her. \u201cAnyhow, I am going to write to her as soon as I go home,\u201d I added. \u201cBut be sure you tell her it will be a threatening letter, for in a month or two I shall be quite free, and then let her tremble, for I shall be coming to your house as regularly as in the old days.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before parting from Swann, I said a word to him about his health. \u201cNo, it is not as bad as all that,\u201d he told me. \u201cStill, as I was saying, I am quite worn out, and I accept with resignation whatever may be in store for me. Only, I must say that it would be most annoying to die before the end of the Dreyfus case. Those scoundrels have more than one card up their sleeves. I have no doubt of their being defeated in the end, but still they are very powerful, they have supporters everywhere. Just as everything is going on splendidly, it all collapses. I should like to live long enough to see Dreyfus rehabilitated and Picquart a colonel.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Swann had left, I returned to the great drawing-room in which was to be found that Princesse de Guermantes with whom I did not then know that I was one day to be so intimate. Her passion for M. de Charlus did not reveal itself to me at first. I noticed only that the Baron, after a certain date, and without having taken one of those sudden dislikes, which were not surprising in him, to the Princesse de Guermantes, while continuing to feel for her just as strong an affection, a stronger affection perhaps than ever, appeared worried and annoyed whenever anyone mentioned her name to him. He never included it now in his list of the people whom he wished to meet at dinner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that before this time I had heard an extremely malicious man about town say that the Princess had completely changed, that she was in love with M. de Charlus, but this slander had appeared to me absurd and had made me angry. I had indeed remarked with astonishment that, when I was telling her something that concerned myself, if M. de Charlus\u2019s name cropped up in the middle, the Princess immediately screwed up her attention to the narrower focus of a sick man who, hearing us talk about ourselves, and listening, in consequence, in a careless and distracted fashion, suddenly realises that a name we have mentioned is that of the disease from which he is suffering, which at once interests and delights him. So, if I said to her: \u201cWhy, M. de Charlus told me . . . \u201d the Princess at once gathered up the slackened reins of her attention. And having on one occasion said in her hearing that M. de Charlus had at that moment a warm regard for a certain person, I was astonished to see appear in the Princess\u2019s eyes that momentary change of colour, like the line of a fissure in the pupil, which is due to a thought which our words have unconsciously aroused in the mind of the person to whom we are talking, a secret thought that will not find expression in words, but will rise from the depths which we have stirred to the surface \u2014 altered for an instant \u2014 of his gaze. But if my remark had moved the Princess, I did not then suspect in what fashion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow, shortly after this, she began to talk to me about M. de Charlus, and almost without ambiguity. If she made any allusion to the rumours which a few people here and there were spreading about the Baron, it was merely as though to absurd and scandalous inventions. But, on the other hand, she said: \u201cI feel that any woman who fell in love with a man of such priceless worth as Palam\u00e8de ought to have sufficient breadth of mind, enough devotion, to accept him and understand him as a whole, for what he is, to respect his freedom, humour his fancies, seek only to smooth out his difficulties and console him in his griefs.\u201d Now, by such a speech, vague as it was, the Princesse de Guermantes revealed the weakness of the character she was seeking to extol, just as M. de Charlus himself did at times. Have I not heard him, over and again, say to people who until then had been uncertain whether or not he was being slandered: \u201cI, who have climbed many hills and crossed many valleys in my life, who have known all manner of people, burglars as well as kings, and indeed, I must confess, with a slight preference for the burglars, who have pursued beauty in all its forms,\u201d and so forth; and by these words which he thought adroit, and in contradicting rumours the currency of which no one suspected (or to introduce, from inclination, moderation, love of accuracy, an element of truth which he was alone in regarding as insignificant), he removed the last doubts of some of his hearers, inspired others, who had not yet begun to doubt him, with their first. For the most dangerous of all forms of concealment is that of the crime itself in the mind of the guilty party. His permanent consciousness of it prevents him from imagining how generally it is unknown, how readily a complete lie would be accepted, and on the other hand from realising at what degree of truth other people will detect, in words which he believes to be innocent, a confession. Not that he would not be entirely wrong in seeking to hush it up, for there is no vice that does not find ready support in the best society, and one has seen a country house turned upside down in order that two sisters might sleep in adjoining rooms as soon as their hostess learned that theirs was a more than sisterly affection. But what revealed to me all of a sudden the Princess\u2019s love was a trifling incident upon which I shall not dwell here, for it forms part of quite another story, in which M. de Charlus allowed a Queen to die rather than miss an appointment with the hairdresser who was to singe his hair for the benefit of an omnibus conductor who filled him with alarm. However, to be done with the Princess\u2019s love, let us say what the trifle was that opened my eyes. I was, on the day in question, alone with her in her carriage. As we were passing a post office she stopped the coachman. She had come out without a footman. She half drew a letter from her muff and was preparing to step down from the carriage to put it into the box. I tried to stop her, she made a show of resistance, and we both realised that our instinctive movements had been, hers compromising, in appearing to be guarding a secret, mine indiscreet, in attempting to pass that guard. She was the first to recover. Suddenly turning very red, she gave me the letter. I no longer dared not to take it, but, as I slipped it into the box, I could not help seeing that it was addressed to M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to this first evening at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s, I went to bid her good-night, for her cousins, who had promised to take me home, were in a hurry to be gone. M. de Guermantes wished, however, to say good-bye to his brother, Mme. de Surgis having found time to mention to the Duke as she left that M. de Charlus had been charming to her and to her sons. This great courtesy on his brother\u2019s part, the first moreover that he had ever shewn in that line, touched Basin deeply and aroused in him old family sentiments which were never asleep for long. At the moment when we were saying good-bye to the Princess he was attempting, without actually thanking M. de Charlus, to give expression to his fondness for him, whether because he really found a difficulty in controlling it or in order that the Baron might remember that actions of the sort that he had performed this evening did not escape the eyes of a brother, just as, with the object of creating a chain of pleasant associations in the future, we give sugar to a dog that has done its trick. \u201cWell, little brother!\u201d said the Duke, stopping M. de Charlus and taking him lovingly by the arm, \u201cso this is how one walks past one\u2019s elders and betters without so much as a word. I never see you now, M\u00e9m\u00e9, and you can\u2019t think how I miss you. I was turning over some old letters just now and came upon some from poor Mamma, which are all so full of love for you.\u201d \u201cThank you, Basin,\u201d replied M. de Charlus in a broken voice, for he could never speak without emotion of their mother. \u201cYou must make up your mind to let me fix up bachelor quarters for you at Guermantes,\u201d the Duke went on. \u201cIt is nice to see the two brothers so affectionate towards each other,\u201d the Princess said to Oriane. \u201cYes, indeed! I don\u2019t suppose you could find many brothers like that. I shall invite you to meet him,\u201d she promised me. \u201cYou\u2019ve not quarrelled with him? . . . But what can they be talking about?\u201d she added in an anxious tone, for she could catch only an occasional word of what they were saying. She had always felt a certain jealousy of the pleasure that M. de Guermantes found in talking to his brother of a past from which he was inclined to keep his wife shut out. She felt that, when they were happy at being together like this, and she, unable to restrain her impatient curiosity, came and joined them, her coming did not add to their pleasure. But this evening, this habitual jealousy was reinforced by another. For if Mme. de Surgis had told M. de Guermantes how kind his brother had been to her so that the Duke might thank his brother, at the same time certain devoted female friends of the Guermantes couple had felt it their duty to warn the Duchess that her husband\u2019s mistress had been seen in close conversation with his brother. And this information was torture to Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cThink of the fun we used to have at Guermantes long ago,\u201d the Duke went on. \u201cIf you came down sometimes in summer we could take up our old life again. Do you remember old Father Courveau: \u2018Why is Pascal vexing? Because he is vec . . . vec . . . \u2019\u201d \u201cSaid!\u201d put in M. de Charlus as though he were still answering his tutor\u2019s question. \u201cAnd why is Pascal vexed; because he is vec . . . because he is vec . . . Sing! Very good, you will pass, you are certain to be mentioned, and Madame la Duchesse will give you a Chinese dictionary.\u201d \u201cHow it all comes back to me, young M\u00eame, and the old china vase Hervey brought you from Saint-Denis, I can see it now. You used to threaten us that you would go and spend your life in China, you were so fond of the country; even then you used to love wandering about all night. Ah! You were a peculiar type, for I can honestly say that never in anything did you have the same tastes as other people. . . . \u201d But no sooner had he uttered these words than the Duke flamed up, as the saying is, for he was aware of his brother\u2019s reputation, if not of his actual habits. As he never made any allusion to them before his brother, he was all the more annoyed at having said something which might be taken to refer to them, and more still at having shewn his annoyance. After a moment\u2019s silence: \u201cWho knows,\u201d he said, to cancel the effect of his previous speech, \u201cyou were perhaps in love with a Chinese girl, before loving so many white ones and finding favour with them, if I am to judge by a certain lady to whom you have given great pleasure this evening by talking to her. She was delighted with you.\u201d The Duke had vowed that he would not mention Mme. de Surgis, but, in the confusion that the blunder he had just made had wrought in his ideas, he had fallen upon the first that occurred to him, which happened to be precisely the one that ought not to have appeared in the conversation, although it had started it. But M. de Charlus had observed his brother\u2019s blush. And, like guilty persons who do not wish to appear embarrassed that you should talk in their presence of the crime which they are supposed not to have committed, and feel that they ought to prolong a dangerous conversation: \u201cI am charmed to hear it,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut I should like to go back to what you were saying before, which struck me as being profoundly true. You were saying that I never had the same ideas as other people, how right you are, you said that I had peculiar tastes.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d protested M. de Guermantes who, as a matter of fact, had not used those words, and may not have believed that their meaning was applicable to his brother. Besides, what right had he to bully him about eccentricities which in any case were vague enough or secret enough to have in no way impaired the Baron\u2019s tremendous position in society? What was more, feeling that the resources of his brother\u2019s position were about to be placed at the service of his mistresses, the Duke told himself that this was well worth a little tolerance in exchange; had he at that moment known of some \u201cpeculiar\u201d intimacy of his brother, M. de Guermantes would, in the hope of the support that the other was going to give him, have passed it over, shutting his eyes to it, and if need be lending a hand. \u201cCome along, Basin; good night, Palam\u00e8de,\u201d said the Duchess, who, devoured by rage and curiosity, could endure no more, \u201cif you have made up your minds to spend the night here, we might just as well have stayed to supper. You have been keeping Marie and me standing for the last half-hour.\u201d The Duke parted from his brother after a significant pressure of his hand, and the three of us began to descend the immense staircase of the Princess\u2019s house\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On either side of us, on the topmost steps, were scattered couples who were waiting for their carriages to come to the door. Erect, isolated, flanked by her husband and myself, the Duchess kept to the left of the staircase, already wrapped in her Tiepolo cloak, her throat clasped in its band of rubies, devoured by the eyes of women and men alike, who sought to divine the secret of her beauty and distinction. Waiting for her carriage upon the same step of the stair as Mme. de Guermantes, but at the opposite side of it, Mme. de Gallardon, who had long abandoned all hope of ever receiving a visit from her cousin, turned her back so as not to appear to have seen her, and, what was more important, so as not to furnish a proof of the fact that the other did not greet her. Mme. de Gallardon was in an extremely bad temper because some gentlemen in her company had taken it upon themselves to speak to her of Oriane: \u201cI have not the slightest desire to see her,\u201d she had replied to them, \u201cI did see her, as a matter of fact, just now, she is beginning to shew her age; it seems she can\u2019t get over it. Basin says so himself. And, good lord, I can understand that, for, as she has no brains, is as mischievous as a weevil, and has shocking manners, she must know very well that, once her looks go, she will have nothing left to fall back upon.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had put on my greatcoat, for which M. de Guermantes, who dreaded chills, reproached me, as we went down together, because of the heated atmosphere indoors. And the generation of noblemen which more or less passed through the hands of Mgr. Dupanloup speaks such bad French (except the Castellane brothers) that the Duke expressed what was in his mind thus: \u201cIt is better not to put on your coat before going out of doors, at least as a general rule.\u201d I can see all that departing crowd now, I can see, if I be not mistaken in placing him upon that staircase, a portrait detached from its frame, the Prince de Sagan, whose last appearance in society this must have been, baring his head to offer his homage to the Duchess, with so sweeping a revolution of his tall hat in his white-gloved hand (harmonising with the gardenia in his buttonhole), that one felt surprised that it was not a plumed felt hat of the old regime, several ancestral faces from which were exactly reproduced in the face of this great gentleman. He stopped for but a short time in front of her, but even his momentary attitudes were sufficient to compose a complete tableau vivant, and, as it were, an historical scene. Moreover, as he has since then died, and as I never had more than a glimpse of him in his lifetime, he has so far become for me a character in history, social history at least, that I am quite astonished when I think that a woman and a man whom I know are his sister and nephew\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While we were going downstairs, there came up, with an air of weariness that became her, a woman who appeared to be about forty, but was really older. This was the Princesse d\u2019Orvillers, a natural daughter, it was said, of the Duke of Parma, whose pleasant voice rang with a vaguely Austrian accent. She advanced, tall, stooping, in a gown of white flowered silk, her exquisite, throbbing, cankered bosom heaving beneath a harness of diamonds and sapphires. Tossing her head like a royal palfrey embarrassed by its halter of pearls, of an incalculable value but an inconvenient weight, she let fall here and there a gentle, charming gaze, of an azure which, as time began to fade it, became more caressing than ever, and greeted most of the departing guests with a friendly nod. \u201cYou choose a nice time to arrive, Paulette!\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cYes, I am so sorry! But really it was a physical impossibility,\u201d replied the Princesse d\u2019Orvillers, who had acquired this sort of expression from the Duchesse de Guermantes, but added to it her own natural sweetness and the air of sincerity conveyed by the force of a remotely Teutonic accent in so tender a voice. She appeared to be alluding to complications of life too elaborate to be related, and not merely to evening parties, although she had just come on from a succession of these. But it was not they that obliged her to come so late. As the Prince de Guermantes had for many years forbidden his wife to receive Mme. d\u2019Orvillers, that lady, when the ban was withdrawn, contented herself with replying to the other\u2019s invitations, so as not to appear to be thirsting after them, by simply leaving cards. After two or three years of this method, she came in person, but very late, as though after the theatre. In this way she gave herself the appearance of attaching no importance to the party, nor to being seen at it, but simply of having come to pay the Prince and Princess a visit, for their own sakes, because she liked them, at an hour when, the great majority of their guests having already gone, she would \u201chave them more to herself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOriane has really sunk very low,\u201d muttered Mme. de Gallardon. \u201cI cannot understand Basin\u2019s allowing her to speak to Mme. d\u2019Orvillers. I am sure M. de Gallardon would never have allowed me.\u201d For my part, I had recognised in Mme. d\u2019Orvillers the woman who, outside the H\u00f4tel Guermantes, used to cast languishing glances at me, turn round, stop and gaze into shop windows. Mme. de Guermantes introduced me, Mme. d\u2019Orvillers was charming, neither too friendly nor annoyed. She gazed at me as at everyone else out of her gentle eyes. . . . But I was never again, when I met her, to receive from her one of those overtures with which she had seemed to be offering herself. There is a special kind of glance, apparently of recognition, which a young man never receives from certain women \u2014 nor from certain men \u2014 after the day on which they have made his acquaintance and have learned that he is the friend of people with whom they too are intimate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were told that the carriage was at the door. Mme. de Guermantes gathered up her red skirt as though to go downstairs and get into the carriage, but, seized perhaps by remorse, or by the desire to give pleasure, and above all to profit by the brevity which the material obstacle to prolonging it imposed upon so boring an action, looked at Mme. de Gallardon; then, as though she had only just caught sight of her, acting upon a sudden inspiration, before going down tripped across the whole width of the step and, upon reaching her delighted cousin, held out her hand. \u201cSuch a long time,\u201d said the Duchess who then, so as not to have to develop all the regrets and legitimate excuses that this formula might be supposed to contain, turned with a look of alarm towards the Duke, who as a matter of fact, having gone down with me to the carriage, was storming with rage when he saw that his wife had gone over to Mme. de Gallardon and was holding up the stream of carriages behind. \u201cOriane is still very good looking, after all!\u201d said Mme. de Gallardon. \u201cPeople amuse me when they say that we have quarrelled; we may (for reasons which we have no need to tell other people) go for years without seeing one another, we have too many memories in common ever to be separated, and in her heart she must know that she cares far more for me than for all sorts of people whom she sees every day and who are not of her rank.\u201d Mme. de Gallardon was in fact like those scorned lovers who try desperately to make people believe that they are better loved than those, whom their fair one cherishes. And (by the praises which, without heeding their contradiction of what she had been saying a moment earlier, she now lavished in speaking of the Duchesse de Guermantes) she proved indirectly that the other was thoroughly conversant with the maxims that ought to guide in her career a great lady of fashion who, at the selfsame moment when her most marvellous gown is exciting an admiration not unmixed with envy, must be able to cross the whole width of a staircase to disarm it. \u201cDo at least take care not to wet your shoes\u201d (a brief but heavy shower of rain had fallen), said the Duke, who was still furious at having been kept waiting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On our homeward drive, in the confined space of the coup\u00e9, the red shoes were of necessity very close to mine, and Mme. de Guermantes, fearing that she might actually have touched me, said to the Duke: \u201cThis young man will have to say to me, like the person in the caricature: \u2018Madame, tell me at once that you love me, but don\u2019t tread on my feet like that.\u2019\u201d My thoughts, however, were far from Mme. de Guermantes. Ever since Saint-Loup had spoken to me of a young girl of good family who frequented a house of ill-fame, and of the Baroness Putbus\u2019s maid, it was in these two persons that were coalesced and embodied the desires inspired in me day by day by countless beauties of two classes, on the one hand the plebeian and magnificent, the majestic lady\u2019s maids of great bouses, swollen with pride and saying \u2018we\u2019 when they spoke of Duchesses, on the other hand those girls of whom it was enough for me sometimes, without even having seen them go past in carriages or on foot, to have read the names in the account of a ball for me to fall in love with them and, having conscientiously searched the year-book for the country houses in which they spent the summer (as often as not letting myself be led astray by a similarity of names), to dream alternately of going to live amid the plains of the West, the sandhills of the North, the pine-forests of the South. But in vain might I fuse together all the most exquisite fleshly matter to compose, after the ideal outline traced for me by Saint-Loup, the young girl of easy virtue and Mme. Putbus\u2019s maid, my two possessible beauties still lacked what I should never know until I had seen them: individual character. I was to wear myself out in seeking to form a mental picture, during the months in which I would have preferred a lady\u2019s maid, of the maid of Mme. Putbus. But what peace of mind after having been perpetually troubled by my restless desires, for so many fugitive creatures whose very names I often did not know, who were in any case so hard to find again, harder still to become acquainted with, impossible perhaps to captivate, to have subtracted from all that scattered, fugitive, anonymous beauty, two choice specimens duly labelled, whom I was at least certain of being able to procure when I chose. I kept putting off the hour for devoting myself to this twofold pleasure, as I put off that for beginning to work, but the certainty of having it whenever I chose dispensed me almost from the necessity of taking it, like those soporific tablets which one has only to have within reach of one\u2019s hand not to need them and to fall asleep. In the whole universe I desired only two women, of whose faces I could not, it is true, form any picture, but whose names Saint-Loup had told me and had guaranteed their consent. So that, if he had, by what he had said this evening, set my imagination a heavy task, he had at the same time procured an appreciable relaxation, a prolonged rest for my will\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell!\u201d said the Duchess to me, \u201capart from your balls, can\u2019t I be of any use to you? Have you found a house where you would like me to introduce you?\u201d I replied that I was afraid the only one that tempted me was hardly fashionable enough for her. \u201cWhose is that?\u201d she asked in a hoarse and menacing voice, scarcely opening her lips. \u201cBaroness Putbus.\u201d This time she pretended to be really angry. \u201cNo, not that! I believe you\u2019re trying to make a fool of me. I don\u2019t even know how I come to have heard the creature\u2019s name. But she is the dregs of society. It\u2019s just as though you were to ask me for an introduction to my milliner. And worse than that, for my milliner is charming. You are a little bit cracked, my poor boy. In any case, I beg that you will be polite to the people to whom I have introduced you, leave cards on them, and go and see them, and not talk to them about Baroness Putbus of whom they have never heard.\u201d I asked whether Mme. d\u2019Orvillers was not inclined to be flighty. \u201cOh, not in the least, you are thinking of some one else, why, she\u2019s rather a prude, if anything. Ain\u2019t she, Basin?\u201d \u201cYes, in any case I don\u2019t think there has ever been anything to be said about her,\u201d said the Duke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou won\u2019t come with us to the ball?\u201d he asked me. \u201cI can lend you a Venetian cloak and I know some one who will be damned glad to see you there \u2014 Oriane for one, that I needn\u2019t say \u2014 but the Princesse de Parme. She\u2019s never tired of singing your praises, and swears by you alone. It\u2019s fortunate for you \u2014 since she is a trifle mature \u2014 that she is the model of virtue. Otherwise she would certainly have chosen you as a sigisbee, as it was called in my young days, a sort of cavali\u00e8re servente.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was interested not in the ball but in my appointment with Albertine. And so I refused. The carriage had stopped, the footman was shouting for the gate to be opened, the horses pawing the ground until it was flung apart and the carriage passed into the courtyard. \u201cTill we meet again,\u201d said the Duke. \u201cI have sometimes regretted living so close to Marie,\u201d the Duchess said to me, \u201cbecause I may be very fond of her, but I am not quite so fond of her company. But have never regretted it so much as to-night, since it has allowed me so little of yours.\u201d \u201cCome, Oriane, no speechmaking.\u201d The Duchess would have liked me to come inside for a minute. She laughed heartily, as did the Duke, when I said that I could not because I was expecting a girl to call at any moment. \u201cYou choose a funny time to receive visitors,\u201d she said to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome along, my child, there is no time to waste,\u201d said M. de Guermantes to his wife. \u201cIt is a quarter to twelve, and time we were dressed. . . . \u201d He came in collision, outside his front door which they were grimly guarding, with the two ladies of the walking-sticks, who had not been afraid to descend at dead of night from their mountain-top to prevent a scandal. \u201cBasin, we felt we must warn you, in case you were seen at that ball: poor Amanien has just passed away, an hour ago.\u201d The Duke felt a momentary alarm. He saw the delights of the famous ball snatched from him as soon as these accursed mountaineers had informed him of the death of M. d\u2019Osmond. But he quickly recovered himself and flung at his cousins a retort into which he introduced, with his determination not to forego a pleasure, his incapacity to assimilate exactly the niceties of the French language: \u201cHe is dead! No, no, they exaggerate, they exaggerate!\u201d And without giving a further thought to his two relatives who, armed with their alpenstocks, were preparing to make their nocturnal ascent, he fired off a string of questions at his valet:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAre you sure my helmet has come?\u201d \u201cYes, Monsieur le Duc.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re sure there\u2019s a hole in it I can breathe through? I don\u2019t want to be suffocated, damn it!\u201d \u201cYes, Monsieur le Duc.\u201d \u201cOh, thunder of heaven, this is an unlucky evening. Oriane, I forgot to ask Babal whether the shoes with pointed toes were for you!\u201d \u201cBut, my dear, the dresser from the Op\u00e9ra-Comique is here, he will tell us. I don\u2019t see how they could go with your spurs.\u201d \u201cLet us go and find the dresser,\u201d said the Duke. \u201cGood-bye, my boy, I should ask you to come in while we are trying on, it would amuse you. But we should only waste time talking, it is nearly midnight and we must not be late in getting there or we shall spoil the set.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I too was in a hurry to get away from M. and Mme. de Guermantes as quickly as possible. Ph\u00e8dre finished at about half past eleven. Albertine must have arrived by now. I went straight to Fran\u00e7oise: \u201cIs Mlle. Albertine in the house?\u201d \u201cNo one has called.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good God, that meant that no one would call! I was in torment, Al-bertine\u2019s visit seeming to me now all the more desirable, the less certain it had become\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise was cross too, but for quite a different reason. She had just installed her daughter at the table for a succulent repast. But, on hearing me come in, and seeing that there was not time to whip away the dishes and put out needles and thread as though it were a work party and not a supper party: \u201cShe has just been taking a spoonful of soup,\u201d Fran\u00e7oise explained to me, \u201cI forced her to gnaw a bit of bone,\u201d to reduce thus to nothing her daughter\u2019s supper, as though the crime lay in its abundance. Even at luncheon or dinner, if I committed the error of entering the kitchen, Fran\u00e7oise would pretend that they had finished, and would even excuse herself with \u201cI just felt I could eat a scrap,\u201d or \u2018a mouthjul.\u2019 But I was speedily reassured on seeing the multitude of the plates that covered the table, which Fran\u00e7oise, surprised by my sudden entry, like a thief in the night which she was not, had not had time to conjure out of sight. Then she added: \u201cGo along to your bed now, you have done enough work today\u201d (for she wished to make it appear that her daughter not only cost us nothing, lived by privations, but was actually working herself to death in our service). \u201cYou are only crowding up the kitchen, and disturbing Master, who is expecting a visitor. Go on, upstairs,\u201d she repeated, as though she were obliged to use her authority to send her daughter to bed, who, the moment supper was out of the question, remained in the kitchen only for appearance\u2019s sake, and if I had stayed five minutes longer would have withdrawn of her own accord. And turning to me, in that charming popular and yet, somehow, personal French which was her spoken language: \u201cMaster doesn\u2019t see that her face is just cut in two with want of sleep.\u201d I remained, delighted at not having to talk to Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s daughter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have said that she came from a small village which was quite close to her mother\u2019s, and yet different from it in the nature of the soil, its cultivation, in dialect; above all in certain characteristics of the inhabitants. Thus the \u2018butcheress\u2019 and Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s niece did not get on at all well together, but had this point in common, that, when they went out on an errand, they would linger for hours at \u2018the sister\u2019s\u2019 or \u2018the cousin\u2019s,\u2019 being themselves incapable of finishing a conversation, in the course of which the purpose with which they had set out faded so completely from their minds that, if we said to them on their return:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell! Will M. le Marquis de Norpois be at home at a quarter past six?\u201d they did not even beat their brows and say: \u201cOh, I forgot all about it,\u201d but \u201cOh! I didn\u2019t understand that Master wanted to know that, I thought I had just to go and bid him good day.\u201d If they \u2018lost their heads\u2019 in this manner about a thing that had been said to them an hour earlier, it was on the other hand impossible to get out of their heads what they had once heard said, by \u2018the\u2019 sister or cousin. Thus, if the butcheress had heard it said that the English made war upon us in \u201870 at the same time as the Prussians, and I had explained to her until I was tired that this was not the case, every three weeks the butcheress would repeat to me in the course of conversation: \u201cIt\u2019s all because of that war the English made on us in \u201870, with the Prussians.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ve told you a hundred times that you are wrong.\u201d\u2014 She would then answer, implying that her conviction was in no way shaken: \u201cIn any case, that\u2019s no reason for wishing them any harm. Plenty of water has run under the bridges since \u201870,\u201d and so forth. On another occasion, advocating a war with England which I opposed, she said: \u201cTo be sure, it\u2019s always better not to go to war; but when you must, it\u2019s best to do it at once. As the sister was explaining just now, ever since that war the English made on us in \u201870, the commercial treaties have ruined us. After we\u2019ve beaten them, we won\u2019t allow one Englishman into France, unless he pays three hundred francs to come in, as we have to pay now to land in England.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such was, in addition to great honesty and, when they were speaking, an obstinate refusal to allow any interruption, going back twenty times over to the point at which they had been interrupted, which ended by giving to their talk the unshakable solidity of a Bach fugue, the character of the inhabitants of this tiny village which did not boast five hundred, set among its chestnuts, its willows, and its fields of potatoes and beetroot\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Franchise\u2019s daughter, on the other hand, spoke (regarding herself as an up-to-date woman who had got out of the old ruts) Parisian slang and \u2022was well versed in all the jokes of the day. Fran\u00e7oise having told her that I had come from the house of a Princess: \u201cOh, indeed! The Princess of Brazil, I suppose, where the nuts come from.\u201d Seeing that I was expecting a visitor, she pretended to suppose that my name was Charles. I replied innocently that it was not, which enabled her to get in: \u201cOh, I thought it was! And I was just saying to myself, Charles attend (charlatan).\u201d This was not in the best of taste. But I was less unmoved when, to console me for Albertine\u2019s delay, she said to me: \u201cI expect you\u2019ll go on waiting till doomsday. She\u2019s never coming. Oh! Those modern flappers!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so her speech differed from her mother\u2019s; but, what is more curious, her mother\u2019s speech was not the same as that of her grandmother, a native of Bailleau-le-Pin, which was so close to Franchise\u2019s village. And yet the dialects differed slightly, like the scenery. Franchise\u2019s mother\u2019s village, scrambling down a steep bank into a ravine, was overgrown with willows. And, miles away from either of them, there was, on the contrary, a small district of France where the people spoke almost precisely the same dialect as at M\u00e9s\u00e9glise. I made this discovery only to feel its drawbacks. In fact, I once came upon Fran\u00e7oise eagerly conversing with a neighbour\u2019s housemaid, who came from this village and spoke its dialect. They could more or less understand one another, I did not understand a word, they knew this but did not however cease (excused, they felt, by the joy of being fellow-countrywomen although born so far apart) to converse in this strange tongue in front of me, like people who do not wish to be understood. These picturesque studies in linguistic geography and comradeship be-lowstairs were continued weekly in the kitchen, without my deriving any pleasure from them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since, whenever the outer gate opened, the doorkeeper pressed an electric button which lighted the stairs, and since all the occupants of the building had already come in, I left the kitchen immediately and went to sit down in the hall, keeping watch, at a point where the curtains did not quite meet over the glass panel of the outer door, leaving visible a vertical strip of semi-darkness on the stair. If, all of a sudden, this strip turned to a golden yellow, that would mean that Albertine had just entered the building and would be with me in a minute; nobody else could be coming at that time of night. And I sat there, unable to take my eyes from the strip which persisted in remaining dark; I bent my whole body forward to make certain of noticing any change; but, gaze as I might, the vertical black band, despite my impassioned longing, did not give me the intoxicating delight that I should have felt had I seen it changed by a sudden and significant magic to a luminous bar of gold. This was a great to do to make about that Albertine to whom I had not given three minutes\u2019 thought during the Guermantes party! But, reviving my feelings when in the past I had been kept waiting by other girls, Gilberte especially, when she delayed her coming, the prospect of having to forego a simple bodily pleasure caused me an intense mental suffering\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was obliged to retire to my room. Fran\u00e7oise followed me. She felt that, as I had come away from my party, there was no point in my keeping the rose that I had in my buttonhole, and approached to take it from me. Her action, by reminding me that Albertine was perhaps not coming, and by obliging me also to confess that I wished to look smart for her benefit, caused an irritation that was increased by the fact that, in tugging myself free, I crushed the flower and Fran\u00e7oise said to me: \u201cIt would have been better to let me take it than to go and spoil it like that.\u201d But anything that she might say exasperated me. When we are kept waiting, we suffer so keenly from the absence of the person for whom we are longing that we cannot endure the presence of anyone else\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Fran\u00e7oise had left my room, it occurred to me that, if it only meant that now I wanted to look my best before Albertine, it was a pity that I had so many times let her see me unshaved, with several days\u2019 growth of beard, on the evenings when I let her come in to renew our caresses. I felt that she took no interest in me and was giving me the cold shoulder. To make my room look a little brighter, in case Albertine should still come, and because it was one of the prettiest things that I possessed, I set out, for the first time for years, on the table by my bed, the turquoise-studded cover which Gilberte had had made for me to hold Bergotte\u2019s pamphlet, and which, for so long a time, I had insisted on keeping by me while I slept, with the agate marble. Besides, as much perhaps as Albertine herself, who still did not come, her presence at that moment in an \u2018alibi\u2019 which she had evidently found more attractive, and of which I knew nothing, gave me a painful feeling which, in spite of what I had said, barely an hour before, to Swann, as to my incapacity for being jealous, might, if I had seen my friend at less protracted intervals, have changed into an anxious need to know where, with whom, she was spending her time. I dared not send round to Albertine\u2019s house, it was too late, but in the hope that, having supper perhaps with some other girls, in a caf\u00e9, she might take it into her head to telephone to me, I turned the switch and, restoring the connexion to my own room, cut it off between the post office and the porter\u2019s lodge to which it was generally switched at that hour. A receiver in the little passage on which Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s room opened would have been simpler, less inconvenient, but useless. The advance of civilisation enables each of us to display unsuspected merits or fresh defects which make him dearer or more insupportable to his friends. Thus Dr. Bell\u2019s invention had enabled Fran\u00e7oise to acquire an additional defect, which was that of refusing, however important, however urgent the occasion might be, to make use of the telephone. She would manage to disappear whenever anybody was going to teach her how to use it, as people disappear when it is time for them to be vaccinated. And so the telephone was installed in my bedroom, and, that it might not disturb my parents, a rattle had been substituted for the bell. I did not move, for fear of not hearing it sound. So motionless did I remain that, for the first time for months, I noticed the tick of the clock. Fran\u00e7oise came in to make the room tidy. She began talking to me, but I hated her conversation, beneath the uniformly trivial continuity of which my feelings were changing from one minute to another, passing from fear to anxiety; from anxiety to complete disappointment. Belying the words of vague satisfaction which I thought myself obliged to address to her, I could feel that my face was so wretched that I pretended to be suffering from rheumatism, to account for the discrepancy between my feigned indifference and my woebegone expression; besides, I was afraid that her talk, which, for that matter, Fran\u00e7oise carried on in an undertone (not on account of Albertine, for she considered that all possibility of her coming was long past), might prevent me from hearing the saving call which now would not sound. At length Fran\u00e7oise went off to bed; I dismissed her with an abrupt civility, so that the noise she made in leaving the room should not drown that of the telephone. And I settled down again to listen, to suffer; when we are kept waiting, from the ear which takes in sounds to the mind which dissects and analyses them, and from the mind to the heart, to which it transmits its results, the double journey is so rapid that we cannot even detect its course, and imagine that we have been listening directly with our heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was tortured by the incessant recurrence of my longing, ever more anxious and never to be gratified, for the sound of a call; arrived at the culminating point of a tortuous ascent through the coils of my lonely anguish, from the heart of the populous, nocturnal Paris that had suddenly come close to me, there beside my bookcase, I heard all at once, mechanical and sublime, like, in Tristan, the fluttering veil or the shepherd\u2019s pipe, the purr of the telephone. I sprang to the instrument, it was Albertine. \u201cI\u2019m not disturbing you, ringing you up at this hour?\u201d \u201cNot at all . . . \u201d I said, restraining my joy, for her remark about the lateness of the hour was doubtless meant as an apology for coming, in a moment, so late, and did not mean that she was not coming. \u201cAre you coming round?\u201d I asked in a tone of indifference. \u201cWhy . . . no, unless you absolutely must see me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Part of me which the other part sought to join was in Albertine. It was essential that she come, but I did not tell her so at first; now that we were in communication, I said to myself that I could always oblige her at the last moment either to come to me or to let me hasten to her. \u201cYes, I am near home,\u201d she said, \u201cand miles away from you; I hadn\u2019t read your note properly. I have just found it again and was afraid you might be waiting up for me.\u201d I felt sure that she was lying, and it was now, in my fury, from a desire not so much to see her as to upset her plans that I determined to make her come. But I felt it better to refuse at first what in a few moments I should try to obtain from her. But where was she? With the sound of her voice were blended other sounds: the braying of a bicyclist\u2019s horn, a woman\u2019s voice singing, a brass band in the distance rang out as distinctly as the beloved voice, as though to shew me that it was indeed Albertine in her actual surroundings who was beside me at that moment, like a clod of earth with which we have carried away all the grass that was growing from it. The same sounds that I heard were striking her ear also, and were distracting her attention: details of truth, extraneous to the subject under discussion, valueless in themselves, all the more necessary to our perception of the miracle for what it was; elements sober and charming, descriptive of some street in Paris, elements heart-rending also and cruel of some unknown festivity which, after she came away from Ph\u00e8dre, had prevented Albertine from coming to me. \u201cI must warn you first of all that I don\u2019t in the least want you to come, because, at this time of night, it will be a frightful nuisance . . . \u201d I said to her, \u201cI\u2019m dropping with sleep. Besides, oh, well, there are endless complications. I am bound to say that there was no possibility of your misunderstanding my letter. You answered that it was all right. Very well, if you hadn\u2019t understood, what did you mean by that?\u201d \u201cI said it was all right, only I couldn\u2019t quite remember what we had arranged. But I see you\u2019re cross with me, I\u2019m sorry. I wish now I\u2019d never gone to Ph\u00e8dre. If I\u2019d known there was going to be all this fuss about it . . . \u201d she went on, as people invariably do when, being in the wrong over one thing, they pretend to suppose that they are being blamed for another. \u201cI am not in the least annoyed about Ph\u00e8dre, seeing it was I that asked you to go to it.\u201d \u201cThen you are angry with me; it\u2019s a nuisance it\u2019s so late now, otherwise I should have come to you, but I shall call tomorrow or the day after and make it up.\u201d \u201cOh, please, Albertine, I beg of you not to, after making me waste an entire evening, the least you can do is to leave me in peace for the next few days. I shan\u2019t be free for a fortnight or three weeks. Listen, if it worries you to think that we seem to be parting in anger, and perhaps you are right, after all, then I greatly prefer, all things considered, since I have been waiting for you all this time and you have not gone home yet, that you should come at once. I shall take a cup of coffee to keep myself awake.\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t you possibly put it off till tomorrow? Because the trouble is. . . . \u201d As I listened to these words of deprecation, uttered as though she did not intend to come, I felt that, with the longing to see again the velvet-blooming face which in the past, at Balbec, used to point all my days to the moment when, by the mauve September sea, I should be walking by the side of that roseate flower, a very different element was painfully endeavouring to combine. This terrible need of a person, at Combray I had learned to know it in the case of my mother, and to the pitch of wanting to die if she sent word to me by Fran\u00e7oise that she could not come upstairs. This effort on the part of the old sentiment, to combine and form but a single element with the other, more recent, which had for its voluptuous object only the coloured surface, the rosy complexion of a flower of the beach, this effort results often only in creating (in the chemical sense) a new body, which can last for but a few moments. This evening, at any rate, and for long afterwards, the two elements remained apart. But already, from the last words that had reached me over the telephone, I was beginning to understand that Albertine\u2019s life was situated (not in a material sense, of course) at so great a distance from mine that I should always have to make a strenuous exploration before I could lay my hand on her, and, what was more, organised like a system of earthworks, and, for greater security, after the fashion which, at a later period, we learned to call camouflaged. Albertine, in fact, belonged, although at a slightly higher social level, to that class of persons to whom their door-keeper promises your messenger that she will deliver your letter when she comes in (until the day when you realise that it is precisely she, the person whom you met out of doors, and to whom you have allowed yourself to write, who is the door-keeper. So that she does indeed live (but in the lodge, only) at the address she has given you, which for that matter is that of a private brothel, in which the door-keeper acts as pander), or who gives as her address a house where she is known to accomplices who will not betray her secret to you, from which your letters will be forwarded to her, but in which she does not live, keeps at the most a few articles of toilet. Lives entrenched behind five or six lines of defence, so that when you try to see the woman, or to find out about her, you invariably arrive too far to the right, or to the left, or too early, or too late, and may remain for months on end, for years even, knowing nothing. About Albertine, I felt that I should never find out anything, that, out of that tangled mass of details of fact and falsehood, I should never unravel the truth: and that it would always be so, unless I were to shut her up in prison (but prisoners escape) until the end. This evening, this conviction gave me only a vague uneasiness, in which however I could detect a shuddering anticipation of long periods of suffering to come\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d I replied, \u201cI told you a moment ago that I should not be free for the next three weeks \u2014 no more to-morrow than any other day.\u201d \u201cVery well, in that case . . . I shall come this very instant . . . it\u2019s a nuisance, because I am at a friend\u2019s house, and she. . . . \u201d I saw that she had not believed that I would accept her offer to come, which therefore was not sincere, and I decided to force her hand. \u201cWhat do you suppose I care about your friend, either come or don\u2019t, it\u2019s for you to decide, it wasn\u2019t I that asked you to come, it was you who suggested it to me.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me, I am going to jump into a cab now and shall be with you in ten minutes.\u201d And so from that Paris out of whose murky depths there had already emanated as far as my room, delimiting the sphere of action of an absent person, a voice which was now about to emerge and appear, after this preliminary announcement, it was that Albertine whom I had known long ago beneath the sky of Balbec, when the waiters of the Grand Hotel, as they laid the tables, were blinded by the glow of the setting sun, when, the glass having been removed from all the windows, every faintest murmur of the evening passed freely from the beach where the last strolling couples still lingered, into the vast dining-room in which the first diners had not yet taken their places, and, across the mirror placed behind the cashier\u2019s desk, there passed the red reflexion of the hull, and lingered long after it the grey reflexion of the smoke of the last steamer for Rivebelle. I no longer asked myself what could have made Albertine late, and, when Fran\u00e7oise came into my room to inform me: \u201cMademoiselle Albertine is here,\u201d if I answered without even turning my head, that was only to conceal my emotion: \u201cWhat in the world makes Mademoiselle Albertine come at this time of night!\u201d But then, raising my eyes to look at Fran\u00e7oise, as though curious to hear her answer which must corroborate the apparent sincerity of my question, I perceived, with admiration and wrath, that, capable of rivalling Berma herself in the art of endowing with speech inanimate garments and the lines of her face, Fran\u00e7oise had taught their part to her bodice, her hair \u2014 the whitest threads of which had been brought to the surface, were displayed there like a birth-certificate \u2014 her neck bowed by weariness and obedience. They commiserated her for having been dragged from her sleep and from her warm bed, in the middle of the night, at her age, obliged to bundle into her clothes in haste, at the risk of catching pneumonia. And so, afraid that I might have seemed to be apologising for Albertine\u2019s late arrival: \u201cAnyhow, I\u2019m very glad she has come, it\u2019s just what I wanted,\u201d and I gave free vent to my profound joy. It did not long remain unclouded, when I had heard Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s reply. Without uttering a word of complaint, seeming indeed to be doing her best to stifle an irrepressible cough, and simply folding her shawl over her bosom as though she were feeling cold, she began by telling me everything that she had said to Albertine, whom she had not forgotten to ask after her aunt\u2019s health. \u201cI was just saying, Monsieur must have been afraid that Mademoiselle was not coming, because this is no time to pay visits, it\u2019s nearly morning. But she must have been in some place where she was enjoying herself, because she never even said as much as that she was sorry she had kept Monsieur waiting, she answered me with a devil-may-care look, \u2018Better late than never!\u2019\u201d And Fran\u00e7oise added, in words that pierced my heart: \u201cWhen she spoke like that she gave herself away. She would have liked to hide what she was thinking, perhaps, but. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had no cause for astonishment. I said, a few pages back, that Fran\u00e7oise rarely paid attention, when she was sent with a message, if not to what she herself had said, which she would willingly relate in detail, at any rate to the answer that we were awaiting. But if, making an exception, she repeated to us the things that our friends had said, however short they might be, she generally arranged, appealing if need be to the expression, the tone that, she assured us, had accompanied them, to make them in some way or other wounding. At a pinch, she would bow her head beneath an insult (probably quite imaginary) which she had received from a tradesman to whom we had sent her, provided that, being addressed to her as our representative, who was speaking in our name, the insult might indirectly injure us. The only thing would have been to tell her that she had misunderstood the man, that she was suffering from persecution mania and that the shopkeepers were not at all in league against her. However, their sentiments affected me little. It was a very different matter, what Albertine\u2019s sentiments were. And, as she repeated the ironical words: \u201cBetter late than never!\u201d Fran\u00e7oise at once made me see the friends in whose company Albertine had finished the evening, preferring their company, therefore, to mine. \u201cShe\u2019s a comical sight, she has a little flat hat on, with those big eyes of hers, it does make her look funny, especially with her cloak which she did ought to have sent to the amender\u2019s, for it\u2019s all in holes. She amuses me,\u201d added, as though laughing at Albertine, Fran\u00e7oise who rarely shared my impressions, but felt a need to communicate her own. I refused even to appear to understand that this laugh was indicative of scorn, but, to give tit for tat, replied, although I had never seen the little hat to which she referred: \u201cWhat you call a \u2018little flat hat\u2019 is a simply charming. . . . \u201d \u201cThat is to say, it\u2019s just nothing at all,\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, giving expression, frankly this time, to her genuine contempt. Then (in a mild and leisurely tone so that my mendacious answer might appear to be the expression not of my anger but of the truth), wasting no time, however, so as not to keep Albertine waiting, I heaped upon Fran\u00e7oise these cruel words: \u201cYou are excellent,\u201d I said to her in a honeyed voice, \u201cyou are kind, you have a thousand merits, but you have never learned a single thing since the day when you first came to Paris, either about ladies\u2019 clothes or about how to pronounce words without making silly blunders.\u201d And this reproach was particularly stupid, for those French words which We are so proud of pronouncing accurately are themselves only blunders made by the Gallic lips which mispronounced Latin or Saxon, our language being merely a defective pronunciation of several others\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The genius of language in a living state, the future and past of French, that is what ought to have interested me in Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s mistakes. Her \u2018amender\u2019 for \u2018mender\u2019 was not so curious as those animals that survive from remote ages, such as the whale or the giraffe, and shew us the states through which animal life has passed. \u201cAnd,\u201d I went on, \u201csince you haven\u2019t managed to learn in all these years, you never will. But don\u2019t let that distress you, it doesn\u2019t prevent you from being a very good soul, and making spiced beef with jelly to perfection, and lots of other things as well. The hat that you think so simple is copied from a hat belonging to the Princesse de Guermantes which cost five hundred francs. However, I mean to give Mlle. Albertine an even finer one very soon.\u201d I knew that what would annoy Fran\u00e7oise more than anything was the thought of my spending money upon people whom she disliked. She answered me in a few words which were made almost unintelligible by a sudden attack of breathless-ness. When I discovered afterwards that she had a weak heart, how remorseful I felt that I had never denied myself the fierce and sterile pleasure of making these retorts to her speeches. Fran\u00e7oise detested Albertine, moreover, because, being poor, Albertine could not enhance what Fran\u00e7oise regarded as my superior position. She smiled benevolently whenever I was invited by Mme. de Villeparisis. On the other hand, she was indignant that Albertine did not practice reciprocity. It came to my being obliged to invent fictitious presents which she was supposed to have given me, in the existence of which Fran\u00e7oise never for an instant believed. This want of reciprocity shocked her most of all in the matter of food. That Albertine should accept dinners from Mamma, when we were not invited to Mme. Bontemps\u2019s (who for that matter spent half her time out of Paris, her husband accepting \u2018posts\u2019 as in the old days when he had had enough of the Ministry), seemed to her an indelicacy on the part of my friend which she rebuked indirectly by repeating a saying current at Combray:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s eat my bread.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAy, that\u2019s the stuff.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s eat thy bread.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had enough.\u201d\n\nI pretended that I was obliged to write a letter. \u201cTo whom were you writing?\u201d Albertine asked me as she entered the room. \u201cTo a pretty little friend of mine, Gilberte Swann. Don\u2019t you know her?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I decided not to question Albertine as to how she had spent the evening, I felt that I should only find fault with her and that we should not have any time left, seeing how late it was already, to be reconciled sufficiently to pass to kisses and caresses. And so it was with these that I chose to begin from the first moment. Besides, if I was a little calmer, I was not feeling happy. The loss of all orientation, of all sense of direction that we feel when we are kept waiting, still continues, after the coming of the person awaited, and, taking the place, inside us, of the calm spirit in which we were picturing her coming as so great a pleasure, prevents us from deriving any from it. Albertine was in the room: my unstrung nerves, continuing to flutter, were still expecting her. \u201cI want a nice kiss, Albertine.\u201d \u201cAs many as you like,\u201d she said to me in her kindest manner. I had never seen her looking so pretty. \u201cAnother?\u201d \u201cWhy, you know it\u2019s a great, great pleasure to me.\u201d \u201cAnd a thousand times greater to me,\u201d she replied. \u201cOh! What a pretty book-cover you have there!\u201d \u201cTake it, I give it to you as a keepsake.\u201d \u201cYou are too kind. . . . \u201d People would be cured for ever of romanticism if they could make up their minds, in thinking of the girl they love, to try to be the man they will be when they are no longer in love with her. Gilberte\u2019s book-cover, her agate marble, must have derived their importance in the past from some purely inward distinction, since now they were to me a book-cover, a marble like any others\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I asked Albertine if she would like something to drink. \u201cI seem to see oranges over there and water,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will be perfect.\u201d I was thus able to taste with her kisses that refreshing coolness which had seemed to me to be better than they, at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s. And the orange squeezed into the water seemed to yield to me, as I drank, the secret life of its ripening growth, its beneficent action upon certain states of that human body which belongs to so different a kingdom, its powerlessness to make that body live, but on the other hand the process of irrigation by which it was able to benefit it, a hundred mysteries concealed by the fruit from my senses, but not from my intellect\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Albertine had gone, I remembered that I had promised Swann that I would write to Gilberte, and courtesy, I felt, demanded that I should do so at once. It was without emotion and as though drawing a line at the foot of a boring school essay, that I traced upon the envelope the nameGilberte Swann, with which at one time I used to cover my exercise-books to give myself the illusion that I was corresponding with her. For if, in the past, it had been I who wrote that name, now the task had been deputed by Habit to one of the many secretaries whom she employs. He could write down Gilberte\u2019s name with all the more calm, in that, placed with me only recently by Habit, having but recently entered my service, he had never known Gilberte, and knew only, without attaching any reality to the words, because he had heard me speak of her, that she was a girl with whom I had once been in love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could not accuse her of hardness. The person that I now was in relation to her was the clearest possible proof of what she herself had been: the book-cover, the agate marble had simply become for me in relation to Albertine what they had been for Gilberte, what they would have been to anybody who had not suffused them with the glow of an internal flame. But now I felt a fresh disturbance which in its turn destroyed the very real power of things and words. And when Albertine said to me, in a further outburst of gratitude: \u201cI do love turquoises!\u201d I answered her: \u201cDo not let them die,\u201d entrusting to them as to some precious jewel the future of our friendship which however was no more capable of inspiring a sentiment in Albertine than it had been of preserving the sentiment that had bound me in the past to Gilberte\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There appeared about this time a phenomenon which deserves mention only because it recurs in every important period of history. At the same moment when I was writing to Gilberte, M. de Guermantes, just home from his ball, still wearing his helmet, was thinking that next day he would be compelled to go into formal mourning, and decided to proceed a week earlier to the cure that he had been ordered to take. When he returned from it three weeks later (to anticipate for a moment, since I am still finishing my letter to Gilberte), those friends of the Duke who had seen him, so indifferent at the start, turn into a raving anti-Dreyfusard, were left speechless with amazement when they heard him (as though the action of the cure had not been confined to his bladder) answer: \u201cOh, well, there\u2019ll be a fresh trial and he\u2019ll be acquitted; you can\u2019t sentence a fellow without any evidence against him. Did you ever see anyone so gaga as Forcheville? An officer, leading the French people to the shambles, heading straight for war. Strange times we live in.\u201d The fact was that, in the interval, the Duke had met, at the spa, three charming ladies (an Italian princess and her two sisters-in-law). After hearing them make a few remarks about the books they were reading, a play that was being given at the Casino, the Duke had at once understood that he was dealing with women of superior intellect, by whom, as he expressed it, he would be knocked out in the first round. He was all the more delighted to be asked to play bridge by the Princess. But, the moment he entered her sitting room, as he began, in the fervour of his double-dyed anti-Dreyfusism: \u201cWell, we don\u2019t hear very much more of the famous Dreyfus and his appeal,\u201d his stupefaction had been great when he heard the Princess and her sisters-in-law say: \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more certain every day. They can\u2019t keep a man in prison who has done nothing.\u201d \u201cEh? Eh?\u201d the Duke had gasped at first, as at the discovery of a fantastic nickname employed in this household to turn to ridicule a person whom he had always regarded as intelligent. But, after a few days, as, from cowardice and the spirit of imitation, we shout \u2018Hallo, Jojotte\u2019 without knowing why at a great artist whom we hear so addressed by the rest of the household, the Duke, still greatly embarrassed by the novelty of this attitude, began nevertheless to say: \u201cAfter all, if there is no evidence against him.\u201d The three charming ladies decided that he was not progressing rapidly enough and began to bully him: \u201cBut really, nobody with a grain of intelligence can ever have believed for a moment that there was anything.\u201d Whenever any revelation came out that was \u2018damning\u2019 to Dreyfus, and the Duke, supposing that now he was going to convert the three charming ladies, came to inform them of it, they burst out laughing and had no difficulty in proving to him, with great dialectic subtlety, that his argument was worthless and quite absurd. The Duke had returned to Paris a frantic Dreyfusard. And certainly we do not suggest that the three charming ladies were not, in this instance, messengers of truth. But it is to be observed that, every ten years or so, when we have left a man filled with a genuine conviction, it so happens that an intelligent couple, or simply a charming lady, come in touch with him and after a few months he is won over to the opposite camp. And in this respect there are plenty of countries that behave like the sincere man, plenty of countries which we have left full of hatred for another race, and which, six months later, have changed their attitude and broken off all their alliances\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I ceased for some time to see Albertine, but continued, failing Mme. de Guermantes who no longer spoke to my imagination, to visit other fairies and their dwellings, as inseparable from themselves as is from the mollusc that fashioned it and takes shelter within it the pearly or enamelled valve or crenellated turret of its shell. I should not have been able to classify these ladies, the difficulty being that the problem was so vague in its terms and impossible not merely to solve but to set. Before coming to the lady, one had first to approach the faery mansion. Now as one of them was always at home after luncheon in the summer months, before I reached her house I was obliged to close the hood of my cab, so scorching were the sun\u2019s rays, the memory of which was, without my realising it, to enter into my general impression. I supposed that I was merely being driven to the Cours-la-Reine; in reality, before arriving at the gathering which a man of wider experience would perhaps have despised, I received, as though on a journey through Italy, a delicious, dazzled sensation from which the house was never afterwards to be separated in my memory. What was more, in view of the heat of the season and the hour, the lady had hermetically closed the shutters of the vast rectangular saloons on the ground floor in which she entertained her friends. I had difficulty at first in recognising my hostess and her guests, even the Duchesse de Guermantes, who in her hoarse voice bade me come and sit down next to her, in a Beauvais armchair illustrating the Rape of Europa. Then I began to make out on the walls the huge eighteenth century tapestries representing vessels whose masts were hollyhocks in blossom, beneath which I sat as though in the palace not of the Seine but of Neptune, by the brink of the river Oceanus, where the Duchesse de Guermantes became a sort of goddess of the waters. I should never stop if I began to describe all the different types of drawing-room. This example is sufficient to shew that I introduced into my social judgments poetical impressions which I never included among the items when I came to add up the sum, so that, when I was calculating the importance of a drawing-room, my total was never correct\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, these were by no means the only sources of error, but I have no time left now, before my departure for Balbec (where to my sorrow I am going to make a second stay which will also be my last), to start upon a series of pictures of society which will find their place in due course. I need here say only that to this first erroneous reason (my relatively frivolous existence which made people suppose that I was fond of society) for my letter to Gilberte, and for that reconciliation with the Swann family to which it seemed to point, Odette might very well, and with equal inaccuracy, have added a second. I have suggested hitherto the different aspects that the social world assumes in the eyes of a single person only by supposing that, if a woman who, the other day, knew nobody now goes everywhere, and another who occupied a commanding position is ostracised, one is inclined to regard these changes merely as those purely personal ups and downs of fortune which from time to time bring about in a given section of society, in consequence of speculations on the stock exchange, a crashing downfall or enrichment beyond the dreams of avarice. But there is more in it than that. To a certain extent social manifestations (vastly less important than artistic movements, political crises, the evolution that sweeps the public taste in the direction of the theatre of ideas, then of impressionist painting, then of music that is German and complicated, then of music that is Russian and simple, or of ideas of social service, justice, religious reaction, patriotic outbursts) are nevertheless an echo of them, remote, broken, uncertain, disturbed, changing. So that even drawing-rooms cannot be portrayed in a static immobility which has been conventionally employed up to this point for the study of characters, though these too must be carried along in an almost historical flow. The thirst for novelty that leads men of the world who are more or less sincere in their eagerness for information as to intellectual evolution to frequent the circles in which they can trace its development makes them prefer as a rule some hostess as yet undiscovered, who represents still in their first freshness the hopes of a superior culture so faded and tarnished in the women who for long years have wielded the social sceptre and who, having no secrets from these men, no longer appeal to their imagination. And every age finds itself personified thus in fresh women, in a fresh group of women, who, closely adhering to whatever may at that moment be the latest object of interest, seem, in their attire, to be at that moment making their first public appearance, like an unknown species, born of the last deluge, irresistible beauties of each new Consulate, each new Directory. But very often the new hostess is simply like certain statesmen who may be in office for the first time but have for the last forty years been knocking at every door without seeing any open, women who were not known in society but who nevertheless had been receiving, for years past, and failing anything better, a few \u2018chosen friends\u2019 from its ranks. To be sure, this is not always the case, and when, with the prodigious flowering of the Russian Ballet, revealing one after another Bakst, Nijinski, Benoist, the genius of Stravinski, Princess Yourbeletieff, the youthful sponsor of all these new great men, appeared bearing on her head an immense, quivering egret, unknown to the women of Paris, which they all sought to copy, one might have supposed that this marvellous creature had been imported in their innumerable baggage, and as their most priceless treasure, by the Russian dancers; but when presently, by her side, in her stage box, we see, at every performance of the \u2018Russians,\u2019 seated like a true fairy godmother, unknown until that moment to the aristocracy, Mme. Verdurin, we shall be able to tell the society people who naturally supposed that Mme. Verdurin had recently entered the country with Diaghileff\u2019s troupe, that this lady had already existed in different periods, and had passed through various avatars of which this is remarkable only in being the first that is bringing to pass at last, assured henceforth, and at an increasingly rapid pace, the success so long awaited by the Mistress. In Mme. Swann\u2019s case, it is true, the novelty she represented had not the same collective character. Her drawing-room was crystallised round a man, a dying man, who had almost in an instant passed, at the moment when his talent was exhausted, from obscurity to a blaze of glory. The passion for Bergotte\u2019s works was unbounded. He spent the whole day, on show, at Mme. Swann\u2019s, who would whisper to some influential man: \u201cI shall say a word to him, he will write an article for you.\u201d He was, for that matter, quite capable of doing so and even of writing a little play for Mme. Swann. A stage nearer to death, he was not quite so feeble as at the time when he used to come and inquire after my grandmother. This was because intense physical suffering had enforced a regime on him. Illness is the doctor to whom we pay most heed: to kindness, to knowledge we make promises only; pain we obey\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that the Verdurins and their little clan had at this time a far more vital interest than the drawing-room, faintly nationalist, more markedly literary, and pre-eminently Bergottic, of Mme. Swann. The little clan was in fact the active centre of a long political crisis which had reached its maximum of intensity: Dreyfusism. But society people were for the most part so violently opposed to the appeal that a Dreyfusian house seemed to them as inconceivable a thing as, at an earlier period, a Communard house. The Principessa di Caprarola, who had made Mme. Verdurin\u2019s acquaintance over a big exhibition which she had organised, had indeed been to pay her a long call, in the hope of seducing a few interesting specimens of the little clan and incorporating them in her own drawing-room, a call in the course of which the Princess (playing the Duchesse de Guermantes in miniature) had made a stand against current ideas, declared that the people in her world were idiots, all of which, thought Mme. Verdurin, shewed great courage. But this courage was not, in the sequel, to go the length of venturing, under fire of the gaze of nationalist ladies, to bow to Mme. Verdurin at the Balbec races. With Mme. Swann, on the contrary, the anti-Dreyfusards gave her credit for being \u2018sound,\u2019 which, in a woman married to a Jew, was doubly meritorious. Nevertheless, the people who had never been to her house imagined her as visited only by a few obscure Israelites and disciples of Bergotte. In this way we place women far more outstanding than Mme. Swann on the lowest rung of the social ladder, whether on account of their origin, or because they do not care about dinner parties and receptions at which we never see them, and suppose this, erroneously, to be due to their not having been invited, or because they never speak of their social connexions, but only of literature and art, or because people conceal the fact that they go to their houses, or they, to avoid impoliteness to yet other people, conceal the fact that they open their doors to these, in short for a thousand reasons which, added together, make of one or other of them in certain people\u2019s eyes, the sort of woman whom one does not know. So it was with Odette. Mme. d\u2019Epinoy, when busy collecting some subscription for the \u2018Patrie Fran\u00e7aise,\u2019 having been obliged to go and see her, as she would have gone to her dressmaker, convinced moreover that she would find only a lot of faces that were not so much impossible as completely unknown, stood rooted to the ground when the door opened not upon the drawing-room she imagined but upon a magic hall in which, as in the transformation scene of a pantomime, she recognised in the dazzling chorus, half reclining upon divans, seated in armchairs, addressing their hostess by her Christian name, the royalties, the duchesses, whom she, the Princesse d\u2019Epinoy, had the greatest difficulty in enticing into her own drawing-room, and to whom at that moment, beneath the benevolent eyes of Odette, the Marquis du Lau, Comte Louis de Turenne, Prince Borghese, the Duc d\u2019Estr\u00e9es, carrying orangeade and cakes, were acting as cupbearers and henchmen. The Princesse d\u2019Epinoy, as she instinctively made people\u2019s social value inherent in themselves, was obliged to disincarnate Mme. Swann and reincarnate her in a fashionable woman. Our ignorance of the real existence led by the women who do not advertise it in the newspapers draws thus over certain situations (thereby helping to differentiate one house from another) a veil of mystery. In Odette\u2019s case, at the start, a few men of the highest society, anxious to meet Bergotte, had gone to dine, quite quietly, at her house. She had had the tact, recently acquired, not to advertise their presence, they found when they went there, a memory perhaps of the little nucleus, whose traditions Odette had preserved in spite of the schism, a place laid for them at table, and so forth. Odette took them with Bergotte (whom these excursions, incidentally, finished off) to interesting first nights. They spoke of her to various women of their own world who were capable of taking an interest in such a novelty. These women were convinced that Odette, an intimate friend of Bergotte, had more or less collaborated in his works, and believed her to be a thousand times more intelligent than the most outstanding women of the Faubourg, for the same reason that made them pin all their political faith to certain Republicans of the right shade such as M. Doumer and M. Deschanel, whereas they saw France doomed to destruction were her destinies entrusted to the Monarchy men who were in the habit of dining with them, men like Charette or Doudeauville. This change in Odette\u2019s status was carried out, so far as she was concerned, with a discretion that made it more secure and more rapid but allowed no suspicion to filter through to the public that is prone to refer to the social columns of the Gaulois for evidence as to the advance or decline of a house, with the result that one day, at the dress rehearsal of a play by Bergotte, given in one of the most fashionable theatres in aid of a charity, the really dramatic moment was when people saw enter the box opposite, which was that reserved for the author, and sit down by the side of Mme. Swann, Mme. de Marsantes and her who, by the gradual self-effacement of the Duchesse de Guermantes (glutted with fame, and retiring to save the trouble of going on), was on the way to becoming the lion, the queen of the age, Comtesse Mole. \u201cWe never even supposed that she had begun to climb,\u201d people said of Odette as they saw Comtesse Mol\u00e9 enter her box, \u201cand look, she has reached the top of the ladder.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So that Mme. Swann might suppose that it was from snobbishness that I was taking up again with her daughter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Odette, notwithstanding her brilliant escort, listened with close attention to the play, as though she had come there solely to see it performed, just as in the past she used to walk across the Bois for her health, as a form of exercise. Men who in the past had shewn less interest in her came to the edge of the box, disturbing the whole audience, to reach up to her hand and so approach the imposing circle that surrounded her. She, with a smile that was still more friendly than ironical, replied patiently to their questions, affecting greater calm than might have been expected, a calm which was, perhaps, sincere, this exhibition being only the belated revelation of a habitual and discreetly hidden intimacy. Behind these three ladies to whom every eye was drawn was Bergotte flanked by the Prince d\u2019Agrigente, Comte Louis de Turenne, and the Marquis de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. And it is easy to understand that, to men who were received everywhere and could not expect any further advancement save as a reward for original research, this demonstration of their merit which they considered that they were making in letting themselves succumb to a hostess with a reputation for profound intellectuality, in whose house they expected to meet all the dramatists and novelists of the day, was more exciting, more lively than those evenings at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s, which, without any change of programme or fresh attraction, had been going on year after year, all more or less like the one we have described in such detail. In that exalted sphere, the sphere of the Guermantes, in which people were beginning to lose interest, the latest intellectual fashions were not incarnate in entertainments fashioned in their image, as in those sketches that Bergotte used to write for Mme. Swann, or those positive committees of public safety (had society been capable of taking an interest in the Dreyfus case) at which, in Mme. Verdurin\u2019s drawing-room, used to assemble Picquart, Clemenceau, Zola, Reinach and Labori\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gilberte, too, helped to strengthen her mother\u2019s position, for an uncle of Swann had just left nearly twenty-four million francs to the girl, which meant that the Faubourg Saint-Germain was beginning to take notice of her. The reverse of the medal was that Swann (who, however, was dying) held Dreyfusard opinions, though this as a matter of fact did not injure his wife, but was actually of service to her. It did not injure her because people said: \u201cHe is dotty, his mind has quite gone, nobody pays any attention to him, his wife is the only person who counts and she is charming.\u201d But even Swann\u2019s Dreyfusism was useful to Odette. Left to herself, she would quite possibly have allowed herself to make advances to fashionable women which would have been her undoing. Whereas on the evenings when she dragged her husband out to dine in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, Swann, sitting sullenly in his corner, would not hesitate, if he saw Odette seeking an introduction to some Nationalist lady, to exclaim aloud: \u201cReally, Odette, you are mad. Why can\u2019t you keep yourself to yourself. It is idiotic of you to get yourself introduced to anti-Semites, I forbid you.\u201d People in society whom everyone else runs after are not accustomed either to such pride or to such ill-breeding. For the first time they beheld some one who thought himself \u2018superior\u2019 to them. The fame of Swann\u2019s mut-terings was spread abroad, and cards with turned-down corners rained upon Odette. When she came to call upon Mme. d\u2019Arpajon there was a brisk movement of friendly curiosity. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mind my introducing her to you,\u201d said Mme. d\u2019Arpajon. \u201cShe is so nice. It was Marie de Mar-santes that told me about her.\u201d \u201cNo, not at all, I hear she\u2019s so wonderfully clever, and she is charming. I had been longing to meet her; do tell me where she lives.\u201d Mme. d\u2019Arpajon told Mme. Swann that she had enjoyed herself hugely at the latter\u2019s house the other evening, and had joyfully forsaken Mme. de Saint-Euverte for her. And it was true, for to prefer Mme. Swann was to shew that one was intelligent, like going to concerts instead of to tea-parties. But when Mme. de Saint-Euverte called on Mme. d\u2019Arpajon at the same time as Odette, as Mme. de Saint-Euverte was a great snob and Mme. d\u2019Arpajon, albeit she treated her without ceremony, valued her invitations, she did not introduce Odette, so that Mme. de Saint-Euverte should not know who it was. The Marquise imagined that it must be some Princess who never went anywhere, since she had never seen her before, prolonged her call, replied indirectly to what Odette was saying, but Mme. d\u2019Arpajon remained adamant. And when Mme. Saint-Euverte owned herself defeated and took her leave: \u201cI did not introduce you,\u201d her hostess told Odette, \u201cbecause people don\u2019t much care about going to her parties and she is always inviting one; you would never hear the last of her.\u201d \u201cOh, that is all right,\u201d said Odette with a pang of regret. But she retained the idea that people did not care about going to Mme. de Saint-Euverte\u2019s, which was to a certain extent true, and concluded that she herself held a position in society vastly superior to Mme. de Saint-Euverte\u2019s, albeit that lady held a very high position, and Odette, so far, had none at all\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That made no difference to her, and, albeit all Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s friends were friends also of Mme. d\u2019Arpajon, whenever the latter invited Mme. Swann, Odette would say with an air of compunction: \u201cI am going to Mme. d\u2019Arpajon\u2019s; you will think me dreadfully old-fashioned, I know, but I hate going, for Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s sake\u201d (whom, as it happened, she had never met). The distinguished men thought that the fact that Mme. Swann knew hardly anyone in good society meant that she must be a superior woman, probably a great musician, and that it would be a sort of extra distinction, as for a Duke to be a Doctor of Science, to go to her house. The completely unintelligent women were attracted by Odette for a diametrically opposite reason; hearing that she attended the Colonne concerts and professed herself a Wagnerian, they concluded from this that she must be \u2018rather a lark,\u2019 and were greatly excited by the idea of getting to know her. But, being themselves none too firmly established, they were afraid of compromising themselves in public if they appeared to be on friendly terms with Odette, and if, at a charity concert, they caught sight of Mme. Swann, would turn away their heads, deeming it impossible to bow, beneath the very nose of Mme. de Rochechouart, to a woman who was perfectly capable of having been to Bayreuth, which was as good as saying that she would stick at nothing. Everybody becomes different upon entering another person\u2019s house. Not to speak of the marvellous metamorphoses that were accomplished thus in the faery palaces, in Mme. Swann\u2019s drawing-room, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, acquiring a sudden importance from the absence of the people by whom he was normally surrounded, by his air of satisfaction at finding himself there, just as if instead of going out to a party he had slipped on his spectacles to shut himself up in his study and read the Revue des Deux Mondes, the mystic rite that he appeared to be performing in coming to see Odette, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 himself seemed another man. I would have given anything to see what alterations the Duchesse de Montmorency-Luxembourg would undergo in this new environment. But she was one of the people who could never be induced to meet Odette. Mme. de Montmorency, a great deal kinder to Oriane than Oriane was to her, surprised me greatly by saying, with regard to Mme. de Guermantes: \u201cShe knows some quite clever people, everybody likes her, I believe that if she had just had a slightly more coherent mind, she would have succeeded in forming a salon. The fact is, she never bothered about it, she is quite right, she is very well off as she is, with everybody running after her.\u201d If Mme. de Guermantes had not a \u2018salon,\u2019 what in the world could a \u2018salon\u2019 be? The stupefaction in which this speech plunged me was no greater than that which I caused Mme. de Guermantes when I told her that I should like to be invited to Mme. de Montmorency\u2019s. Oriane thought her an old idiot. \u201cI go there,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m forced to, she\u2019s my aunt, but you! She doesn\u2019t even know how to get nice people to come to her house.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes did not realise that nice people left me cold, that when she spoke to me of the Arpajon drawing-room I saw a yellow butterfly, and the Swann drawing-room (Mme. Swann was at home in the winter months between 6 and 7) a black butterfly, its wings powdered with snow. Even this last drawing-room, which was not a \u2018salon\u2019 at all, she considered, albeit out of bounds for herself, permissible to me, on account of the \u2018clever people\u2019 to be found there. But Mme. de Luxembourg! Had I already produced something that had attracted attention, she would have concluded that an element of snobbishness may be combined with talent. But I put the finishing touch to her disillusionment; I confessed to her that I did not go to Mme. de Montmorency\u2019s (as she supposed) to \u2018take notes\u2019 and \u2018make a study.\u2019 Mme. de Guermantes was in this respect no more in error than the social novelists who analyse mercilessly from outside the actions of a snob or supposed snob, but never place themselves in his position, at the moment when a whole social springtime is bursting into blossom in his imagination. I myself, when I sought to discover what was the great pleasure that I found in going to Mme. de Montmorency\u2019s, was somewhat taken aback. She occupied, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, an old mansion ramifying into pavilions which were separated by small gardens. In the outer hall a statuette, said to be by Falconnet, represented a spring which did, as it happened, exude a perpetual moisture. A little farther on the doorkeeper, her eyes always red, whether from grief or neurasthenia, a headache or a cold in the head, never answered your inquiry, waved her arm vaguely to indicate that the Duchess was at home, and let a drop or two trickle from her eyelids into a bowl filled with forget-me-nots. The pleasure that I felt on seeing the statuette, because it reminded me of a \u2018little gardener\u2019 in plaster that stood in one of the Combray gardens, was nothing to that which was given me by the great staircase, damp and resonant, full of echoes, like the stairs in certain old-fashioned bathing establishments, with the vases filled with cinerarias \u2014 blue against blue \u2014 in the entrance hall and most of all the tinkle of the bell, which was exactly that of the bell in Eulalie\u2019s room. This tinkle raised my enthusiasm to a climax, but seemed to me too humble a matter for me to be able to explain it to Mme. de Montmorency, with the result that she invariably saw me in a state of rapture of which she might never guess the cause\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE HEART\u2019S INTERMISSIONS\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My second arrival at Balbec was very different from the other. The manager had come in person to meet me at Pont-a-Couleuvre, reiterating how greatly he valued his titled patrons, which made me afraid that he had ennobled me, until I realised that, in the obscurity of his grammatical memory, titr\u00e9 meant simply attitr\u00e9, or accredited. In fact, the more new languages he learned the worse he spoke the others. He informed me that he had placed me at the very top of the hotel. \u201cI hope,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you will not interpolate this as a want of discourtesy, I was sorry to give you a room of which you are unworthy, but I did it in connexion with the noise, because in that room you will not have anyone above your head to disturb your trapanum (tympanum). Don\u2019t be alarmed, I shall have the windows closed, so that they shan\u2019t bang. Upon that point, I am intolerable\u201d (the last word expressing not his own thought, which was that he would always be found inexorable in that respect, but, quite possibly, the thoughts of his underlings). The rooms were, as it proved, those we had had before. They were no humbler, but I had risen in the manager\u2019s esteem. I could light a fire if I liked (for, by the doctors\u2019 orders, I had left Paris at Easter), but he was afraid there might be \u2018fixtures\u2019 in the ceiling. \u201cSee that you always wait before alighting a fire until the preceding one is extenuated\u201d (extinct). \u201cThe important thing is to take care not to avoid setting fire to the chimney, especially as, to cheer things up a bit, I have put an old china pottage on the mantelpiece which might become insured.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He informed me with great sorrow of the death of the leader of the Cherbourg bar. \u201cHe was an old retainer,\u201d he said (meaning probably \u2018campaigner\u2019) and gave me to understand that his end had been hastened by the quickness, otherwise the fastness, of his life. \u201cFor some time past I noticed that after dinner he would take a doss in the reading-room\u201d (take a doze, presumably). \u201cThe last times, he was so changed that if you hadn\u2019t known who it was, to look at him, he was barely recognisant\u201d (presumably, recognisable)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A happy compensation: the chief magistrate of Caen had just received his \u2018bags\u2019 (badge) as Commander of the Legion of Honour. \u201cSurely to goodness, he has capacities, but seems they gave him it principally because of his general \u2018impotence.\u2019\u201d There was a mention of this decoration, as it happened, in the previous day\u2019s Echo de Paris, of which the manager had as yet read only \u2018the first paradox\u2019 (meaning paragraph). The paper dealt admirably with M. Caillaux\u2019s policy. \u201cI consider, they\u2019re quite right,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is putting us too much under the thimble of Germany\u201d (under the thumb). As the discussion of a subject of this sort with a hotel-keeper seemed to me boring, I ceased to listen. I thought of the visual images that had made me decide to return to Balbec. They were very different from those of the earlier time, the vision in quest of which I came was as dazzlingly clear as the former had been clouded; they were to prove deceitful nevertheless. The images selected by memory are as arbitrary, as narrow, as intangible as those which imagination had formed and reality has destroyed. There is no reason why, existing outside ourselves, a real place should conform to the pictures in our memory rather than to those in our dreams. And besides, a fresh reality will perhaps make us forget, detest even, the desires that led us forth upon our journey\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those that had led me forth to Balbec sprang to some extent from my discovery that the Verdurins (whose invitations I had invariably declined, and who would certainly be delighted to see me, if I went to call upon them in the country with apologies for never having been able to call upon them in Paris), knowing that several of the faithful would be spending the holidays upon that part of the coast, and having, for that reason, taken for the whole season one of M. de Cambremer\u2019s houses (la Raspeli\u00e8re), had invited Mme. Putbus to stay with them. The evening on which I learned this (in Paris) I lost my head completely and sent our young footman to find out whether the lady would be taking her Abigail to Balbec with her. It was eleven o\u2019clock. Her porter was a long time in opening the front door, and, for a wonder, did not send my messenger packing, did not call the police, merely gave him a dressing down, but with it the information that I desired. He said that the head lady\u2019s maid would indeed be accompanying her mistress, first of all to the waters in Germany, then to Biarritz, and at the end of the season to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s. From that moment my mind had been at rest, and glad to have this iron in the fire, I had been able to dispense with those pursuits in the streets, in which I had not that letter of introduction to the beauties I encountered which I should have to the \u2018Giorgione\u2019 in the fact of my having dined that very evening, at the Verdurins\u2019, with her mistress. Besides, she might form a still better opinion of me perhaps when she learned that I knew not merely the middle class tenants of la Raspeli\u00e8re but its owners, and above all Saint-Loup who, prevented from commending me personally to the maid (who did not know him by name), had written an enthusiastic letter about me to the Cambremers. He believed that, quite apart from any service that they might be able to render me, Mme. de Cambremer, the Legrandin daughter-in-law, would interest me by her conversation. \u201cShe is an intelligent woman,\u201d he had assured me. \u201cShe won\u2019t say anything final\u201d (final having taken the place of sublime things with Robert, who, every five or six years, would modify a few of his favourite expressions, while preserving the more important intact), \u201cbut it is an interesting nature, she has a personality, intuition; she has the right word for everything. Every now and then she is maddening, she says stupid things on purpose, to seem smart, which is all the more ridiculous as nobody could be less smart than the Cambremers, she is not always in the picture, but, taking her all round, she is one of the people it is more or less possible to talk to.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No sooner had Robert\u2019s letter of introduction reached them than the Cambremers, whether from a snobbishness that made them anxious to oblige Saint-Loup, even indirectly, or from gratitude for what he had done for one of their nephews at Donci\u00e8res, or (what was most likely) from kindness of heart and traditions of hospitality, had written long letters insisting that I should stay with them, or, if I preferred to be more independent, offering to find me lodgings. When Saint-Loup had pointed out that I should be staying at the Grand Hotel, Balbec, they replied that at least they would expect a call from me as soon as I arrived and, if I did not appear, would come without fail to hunt me out and invite me to their garden parties\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt there was no essential connexion between Mme. Putbus\u2019s maid and the country round Balbec; she would not be for me like the peasant girl whom, as I strayed alone along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, I had so often sought in vain to evoke, with all the force of my desire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I had long since given up trying to extract from a woman as it might be the square root of her unknown quantity, the mystery of which a mere introduction was generally enough to dispel. Anyhow at Balbec, where I had not been for so long, I should have this advantage, failing the necessary connexion which did not exist between the place and this particular woman, that my sense of reality would not be destroyed by familiarity, as in Paris, where, whether in my own home or in a bedroom that I already knew, pleasure indulged in with a woman could not give me for one instant, amid everyday surroundings, the illusion that it was opening the door for me to a new life. (For if habit is a second nature, it prevents us from knowing our original nature, whose cruelties it lacks and also its enchantments.) Now this illusion I might perhaps feel in a strange place, where one\u2019s sensibility is revived by a ray of sunshine, and where my ardour would be raised to a climax by the lady\u2019s maid whom I desired: we shall see, in the course of events, not only that this woman did not come to Balbec, but that I dreaded nothing so much as the possibility of her coming, so that the principal object of my expedition was neither attained, nor indeed pursued. It was true that Mme. Putbus was not to be at the Verdurins\u2019 so early in the season; but these pleasures which we have chosen beforehand may be remote, if their coming is assured, and if, in the interval of waiting, we can devote ourselves to the pastime of seeking to attract, while powerless to love. Moreover, I was not going to Balbec in the same practical frame of mind as before; there is always less egoism in pure imagination than in recollection; and I knew that I was going to find myself in one of those very places where fair strangers most abound; a beach presents them as numerously as a ball-room, and I looked forward to strolling up and down outside the hotel, on the front, with the same sort of pleasure that Mme. de Guermantes would have procured me if, instead of making other hostesses invite me to brilliant dinner-parties, she had given my name more frequently for their lists of partners to those of them who gave dances. To make female acquaintances at Balbec would be as easy for me now as it had been difficult before, for I was now as well supplied with friends and resources there as I had been destitute of them on my former visit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was roused from my meditations by the voice of the manager, to whose political dissertations I had not been listening. Changing the subject, he told me of the chief magistrate\u2019s joy on hearing of my arrival, and that he was coming to pay me a visit in my room, that very evening. The thought of this visit so alarmed me (for I was beginning to feel tired) that I begged him to prevent it (which he promised to do, and, as a further precaution, to post members of his staff on guard, for the first night, on my landing). He did not seem overfond of his staff. \u201cI am obliged to keep running after them all the time because they are lacking in inertia. If I was not there they would never stir. I shall post the lift-boy on sentry outside your door.\u201d I asked him if the boy had yet become \u2018head page.\u2019 \u201cHe is not old enough yet in the house,\u201d was the answer. \u201cHe has comrades more aged than he is. It would cause an outcry. We must act with granulation in everything. I quite admit that he strikes a good aptitude\u201d (meaning attitude) \u201cat the door of his lift. But he is still a trifle young for such positions. With others in the place of longer standing, it would make a contrast. He is a little wanting in seriousness, which is the primitive quality\u201d (doubtless, the primordial, the most important quality). \u201cHe needs his leg screwed on a. bit tighter\u201d (my informant meant to say his head). \u201cAnyhow, he can leave it all to me. I know what I\u2019m about. Before I won my stripes as manager of the Grand Hotel, I smelt powder under M. Paillard.\u201d I was impressed by this simile, and thanked the manager for having come in person as far as Pont-\u00e0-Couleuvre. \u201cOh, that\u2019s nothing! The loss of time has been quite infinite\u201d (for infinitesimal). Meanwhile, we had arrived\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Complete physical collapse. On the first night, as I was suffering from cardiac exhaustion, trying to master my pain, I bent down slowly and cautiously to take off my boots. But no sooner had I touched the topmost button than my bosom swelled, filled with an unknown, a divine presence, I shook with sobs, tears streamed from my eyes. The person who came to my rescue, who saved me from barrenness of spirit, was the same who, years before, in a moment of identical distress and loneliness, in a moment when I was no longer in any way myself, had come in, and had restored me to myself, for that person was myself and more than myself (the container that is greater than the contents, which it was bringing to me). I had just perceived, in my memory, bending over my weariness, the tender, preoccupied, dejected face of my grandmother, as she had been on that first evening of our arrival, the face not of that grandmother whom I was astonished \u2014 and reproached myself \u2014 to find that I regretted so little and who was no more of her than just her name, but of my own true grandmother, of whom, for the first time since that afternoon in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es on which she had had her stroke, I now recaptured, by an instinctive and complete act of recollection, the living reality. That reality has no existence for us, so long as it has not been created anew by our mind (otherwise the men who have been engaged in a Titanic conflict would all of them be great epic poets); and so, in my insane desire to fling myself into her arms, it was not until this moment, more than a year after her burial, because of that anachronism which so often prevents the calendar of facts from corresponding to that of our feelings, that I became conscious that she was dead. I had often spoken about her in the interval, and thought of her also, but behind my words and thoughts, those of an ungrateful, selfish, cruel youngster, there had never been anything that resembled my grandmother, because, in my frivolity, my love of pleasure, my familiarity with the spectacle of her ill health, I retained only in a potential state the memory of what she had been. At whatever moment we estimate it, the total value of our spiritual nature is more or less fictitious, notwithstanding the long inventory of its treasures, for now one, now another of these is unrealisable, whether we are considering actual treasures or those of the imagination, and, in my own case, fully as much as the ancient name of Guermantes, this other, how far more important item, my real memory of my grandmother. For with the troubles of memory are closely linked the heart\u2019s intermissions. It is, no doubt, the existence of our body, which we may compare to a jar containing our spiritual nature, that leads us to suppose that all our inward wealth, our past joys, all our sorrows, are perpetually in our possession. Perhaps it is equally inexact to suppose that they escape or return. In any case, if they remain within us, it is, for most of the time, in an unknown region where they are of no service to us, and where even the most ordinary are crowded out by memories of a different kind, which preclude any simultaneous occurrence of them in our consciousness. But if the setting of sensations in which they are preserved be recaptured, they acquire in turn the same power of expelling everything that is incompatible with them, of installing alone in us the self that originally lived them. Now, inasmuch as the self that I had just suddenly become once again had not existed since that evening long ago when my grandmother undressed me after my arrival at Balbec, it was quite naturally, not at the end of the day that had just passed, of which that self knew nothing, but \u2014 as though there were in time different and parallel series \u2014 without loss of continuity, immediately after the first evening at Balbec long ago, that I clung to the minute in which my grandmother had leaned over me. The self that I then was, that had so long disappeared, was once again so close to me that I seemed still to hear the words that had just been spoken, albeit they were nothing more now than illusion, as a man who is half awake thinks he can still make out close at hand the sounds of his receding dream. I was nothing now but the person who sought a refuge in his grandmother\u2019s arms, sought to wipe away the traces of his suffering by giving her kisses, that person whom I should have had as great difficulty in imagining when I was one or other of those persons which, for some time past, I had successively been, as the efforts, doomed in any event to sterility, that I should now have had to make to feel the desires and joys of any of those which, for a time at least, I no longer was. I reminded myself how, an hour before the moment at which my grandmother had stooped down like that, in her dressing gown, to unfasten my boots, as I wandered along the stiflingly hot street, past the pastry-cook\u2019s, I had felt that I could never, in my need to feel her arms round me, live through the hour that I had still to spend without her. And now that this same need was reviving in me, I knew that I might wait hour after hour, that she would never again be by my side, I had only just discovered this because I had only just, on feeling her for the first time, alive, authentic, making my heart swell to breaking-point, on finding her at last, learned that I had lost her for ever. Lost for ever; I could not understand and was struggling to bear the anguish of this contradiction: on the one hand an existence, an affection, surviving in me as I had known them, that is to say created for me, a love in whose eyes everything found in me so entirely its complement, its goal, its constant lodestar, that the genius of great men, all the genius that might have existed from the beginning of the world would have been less precious to my grandmother than a single one of my defects; and on the other hand, as soon as I had lived over again that bliss, as though it were present, feeling it shot through by the certainty, throbbing like a physical anguish, of an annihilation that had effaced my image of that affection, had destroyed that existence, abolished in retrospect our interwoven destiny, made of my grandmother at the moment when I found her again as in a mirror, a mere stranger whom chance had allowed to spend a few years in my company, as it might have been in anyone\u2019s else, but to whom, before and after those years, I was, I could be nothing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of the pleasures that I had been experiencing of late, the only pleasure that it would have been possible for me to enjoy at that moment would have been, by modifying the past, to diminish the sorrows and sufferings of my grandmother\u2019s life. Now, I did not recall her only in that dressing-gown, a garment so appropriate as to have become almost their symbol to the labours, foolish no doubt but so lovable also, that she performed for me, gradually I began to remember all the opportunities that I had seized, by letting her perceive, by exaggerating if necessary my sufferings, to cause her a grief which I imagined as being obliterated immediately by my kisses, as though my affection had been as capable as my happiness of creating hers; and, what was worse, I, who could conceive no other happiness now than in finding happiness shed in my memory over the contours of that face, moulded and bowed by love, had set to work with frantic efforts, in the past, to destroy even its most modest pleasures, as on the day when Saint-Loup had taken my grandmother\u2019s photograph and I, unable to conceal from her what I thought of the ridiculous childishness of the coquetry with which she posed for him, with her wide-brimmed hat, in a flattering half light, had allowed myself to mutter a few impatient, wounding words, which, I had perceived from a contraction of her features, had carried, had pierced her; it was I whose heart they were rending now that there was no longer possible, ever again, the consolation of a thousand kisses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But never should I be able to wipe out of my memory that contraction of her face, that anguish of her heart, or rather of my own: for as the dead exist only in us, it is ourselves that we strike without ceasing when we persist in recalling the blows that we have dealt them. To these griefs, cruel as they were. I clung with all my might and main, for I realised that they were the effect of my memory of my grandmother, the proof that this memory which I had of her was really present within me. I felt that I did not really recall her save by grief and should have liked to feel driven yet deeper into me these nails which fastened the memory of her to my consciousness. I did not seek to mitigate my suffering, to set it off, to pretend that my grandmother was only somewhere else and momentarily invisible, by addressing to her photograph (the one taken by Saint-Loup, which I had beside me) words and prayers as to a person who is separated from us but, retaining his personality, knows us and remains bound to us by an indissoluble harmony. Never did I do this, for I was determined not merely to suffer, but to respect the original form of my suffering, as it had suddenly come upon me unawares, and I wished to continue to feel it, according to its own laws, whenever those strange contradictory impressions of survival and obliteration crossed one another again in my mind. This painful and, at the moment, incomprehensible impression, I knew \u2014 not, forsooth, whether I should one day distil a grain of truth from it \u2014 but that if I ever should succeed in extracting that grain of truth, it could only be from it, from so singular, so spontaneous an impression, which had been neither traced by my intellect nor attenuated by my pusillanimity, but which death itself, the sudden revelation of death, had, like a stroke of lightning, carved upon me, along a supernatural, inhuman channel, a two-fold and mysterious furrow. (As for the state of forgetfulness of my grandmother in which I had been living until that moment, I could not even think of turning to it to extract truth from it; since in itself it was nothing but a negation, a weakening of the mind incapable of recreating a real moment of life and obliged to substitute for it conventional and neutral images.) Perhaps, however, as the instinct of preservation, the ingenuity of the mind in safeguarding us from grief, had begun already to build upon still smouldering ruins, to lay the first courses of its serviceable and ill-omened structure, I relished too keenly the delight of recalling this or that opinion held by my dear one, recalling them as though she had been able to hold them still, as though she existed, as though I continued to exist for her. But as soon as I had succeeded in falling asleep, at that more truthful hour when my eyes closed to the things of the outer world, the world of sleep (on whose frontier intellect and will, momentarily paralysed, could no longer strive to rescue me from the cruelty of my real impressions) reflected, refracted the agonising synthesis of survival and annihilation, in the mysteriously lightened darkness of my organs. World of sleep in which our inner consciousness, placed in bondage to the disturbances of our organs, quickens the rhythm of heart or breath because a similar dose of terror, sorrow, remorse acts with a strength magnified an hundredfold if it is thus injected into our veins; as soon as, to traverse the arteries of the subterranean city, we have embarked upon the dark current of our own blood as upon an inward Lethe meandering sixfold, huge solemn forms appear to us, approach and glide away, leaving us in tears. I sought in vain for my grandmother\u2019s form when I had stepped ashore beneath the sombre portals; I knew, indeed, that she did still exist, but with a diminished vitality, as pale as that of memory; the darkness was increasing, and the wind; my father, who was to take me where she was, did not appear. Suddenly my breath failed me, I felt my heart turn to stone; I had just remembered that for week after week I had forgotten to write to my grandmother. What must she be thinking of me? \u201cGreat God!\u201d I said to myself, \u201chow wretched she must be in that little room which they have taken for her, no bigger than what one would take for an old servant, where she is all alone with the nurse they have put there to look after her, from which she cannot stir, for she is still slightly paralysed and has always refused to rise from her bed. She must be thinking that I have forgotten her now that she is dead; how lonely she must be feeling, how deserted! Oh, I must run to see her, I mustn\u2019t lose a minute, I mustn\u2019t wait for my father to come, even \u2014 but where is it, how can I have forgotten the address, will she know me again, I wonder? How can I have forgotten her all these months?\u201d It is so dark, I shall not find her; the wind is keeping me back; but look I there is my father walking ahead of me; I call out to him: \u201cWhere is grandmother? Tell me her address. Is she all right? Are you quite sure she has everything she wants?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d says my father, \u201cyou need not alarm yourself. Her nurse is well trained. We send her a trifle, from time to time, so that she can get your grandmother anything she may need. She asks, sometimes, how you are getting on. She was told that you were going to write a book. She seemed pleased. She wiped away a tear.\u201d And then I fancied I could remember that, a little time after her death, my grandmother had said to me, crying, with a humble expression, like an old servant who has been given notice to leave, like a stranger, in fact: \u201cYou will let me see something of you occasionally, won\u2019t you; don\u2019t let too many years go by without visiting me. Remember that you were my grandson, once, and that grandmothers never forget.\u201d And seeing again that face, so submissive, so sad, so tender, which was hers, I wanted to run to her at once and say to her, as I ought to have said to her then: \u201cWhy, grandmother, you can see me as often as you like, I have only you in the world, I shall never leave you any more.\u201d What tears my silence must have made her shed through all those months in which I have never been to the place where she lies, what can she have been saying to herself about me? And it is in a voice choked with tears that I too shout to my father: \u201cQuick, quick, her address, take me to her.\u201d But he says: \u201cWell . . . I don\u2019t know whether you will be able to see her. Besides, you know, she is very frail now, very frail, she is not at all herself, I am afraid you would find it rather painful. And I can\u2019t be quite certain of the number of the avenue.\u201d \u201cBut tell me, you who know, it is not true that the dead have ceased to exist. It can\u2019t possibly be true, in spite of what they say, because grandmother does exist still.\u201d My father smiled a mournful smile: \u201cOh, hardly at all, you know, hardly at all. I think that it would be better if you did not go. She has everything that she wants. They come and keep the place tidy for her.\u201d \u201cBut she is often left alone?\u201d \u201cYes, but that is better for her. It is better for her not to think, which could only be bad for her. It often hurts her, when she tries to think. Besides, you know, she is quite lifeless now. I shall leave a note of the exact address, so that you can go to her; but I don\u2019t see what good you can do there, and I don\u2019t suppose the nurse will allow you to see her.\u201d \u201cYou know quite well I shall always stay beside her, dear, deer, deer, Francis Jammes, fork.\u201d But already I had retraced the dark meanderings of the stream, had ascended to the surface where the world of living people opens, so that if I still repeated: \u201cFrancis Jammes, deer, deer,\u201d the sequence of these words no longer offered me the limpid meaning and logic which they had expressed to me so naturally an instant earlier and which I could not now recall. I could not even understand why the word \u2018Aias\u2019 which my father had just said to me, had immediately signified: \u201cTake care you don\u2019t catch cold,\u201d without any possible doubt. I had forgotten to close the shutters, and so probably the daylight had awakened me. But I could not bear to have before my eyes those waves of the sea which my grandmother could formerly contemplate for hours on end; the fresh image of their heedless beauty was at once supplemented by the thought that she did not see them; I should have liked to stop my ears against their sound, for now the luminous plenitude of the beach carved out an emptiness in my heart; everything seemed to be saying to me, like those paths and lawns of a public garden in which I had once lost her, long ago, when I was still a child: \u201cWe have not seen her,\u201d and beneath the hemisphere of the pale vault of heaven I felt myself crushed as though beneath a huge bell of bluish glass, enclosing an horizon within which my grandmother was not. To escape from the sight of it, I turned to the wall, but alas what was now facing me was that partition which used to serve us as a morning messenger, that partition which, as responsive as a violin in rendering every fine shade of sentiment, reported so exactly to my grandmother my fear at once of waking her and, if she were already awake, of not being heard by her and so of her not coming, then immediately, like a second instrument taking up the melody, informed me that she was coming and bade me be calm. I dared not put out my hand to that wall, any more than to a piano on which my grandmother had played and which still throbbed from her touch. I knew that I might knock now, even louder, that I should hear no response, that my grandmother would never come again. And I asked nothing better of God, if a Paradise exists, than to be able, there, to knock upon that wall the three little raps which my grandmother would know among a thousand, and to which she would reply with those other raps which said: \u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed, little mouse, I know you are impatient, but I am just coming,\u201d and that He would let me remain with her throughout eternity which would not be too long for us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The manager came in to ask whether I would not like to come down. He had most carefully supervised my \u2018placement\u2019 in the dining-room. As he had seen no sign of me, he had been afraid that I might have had another of my choking fits. He hoped that it might be only a little \u2018sore throats\u2019 and assured me that he had heard it said that they could be soothed with what he called \u2018calyptus.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He brought me a message from Albertine. She was not supposed to be coming to Balbec that year but, having changed her plans, had been for the last three days not in Balbec itself but ten minutes away by the tram at a neighbouring watering-place. Fearing that I might be tired after the journey, she had stayed away the first evening, but sent word now to ask when I could see her. I inquired whether she had called in person, not that I wished to see her, but so that I might arrange not to see her. \u201cYes,\u201d replied the manager. \u201cBut she would like it to be as soon as possible, unless you have not some quite necessitous reasons. You see,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthat everybody here desires you, definitively.\u201d But for my part, I wished to see nobody\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet the day before, on my arrival, I had felt myself recaptured by the indolent charm of a seaside existence. The same taciturn lift-boy, silent this time from respect and not from scorn, and glowing with pleasure, had set the lift in motion. As I rose upon the ascending column, I had passed once again through what had formerly been for me the mystery of a strange hotel, in which when you arrive, a tourist without protection or position, each old resident returning to his room, each chambermaid passing along the eery perspective of a corridor, not to mention the young lady from America with her companion, on their way down to dinner, give you a look in which you can read nothing that you would have liked to see. This time on the contrary I had felt the entirely soothing pleasure of passing up through an hotel that I knew, where I felt myself at home, where I had performed once again that operation which we must always start afresh, longer, more difficult than the turning outside in of an eyelid, which consists in investing things with the spirit that is familiar to us instead of their own which we found alarming. Must I always, I had asked myself, little thinking of the sudden change of mood that was in store for me, be going to strange hotels where I should be dining for the first time, where Habit would not yet have killed upon each landing, outside every door, the terrible dragon that seemed to be watching over an enchanted life, where I should have to approach those strange women whom fashionable hotels, casinos, watering-places, seem to draw together and endow with a common existence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had found pleasure even in the thought that the boring chief magistrate was so eager to see me, I could see, on that first evening, the waves, the azure mountain ranges of the sea, its glaciers and its cataracts, its elevation and its careless majesty \u2014 merely upon smelling for the first time after so long an interval, as I washed my hands, that peculiar odour of the over-scented soaps of the Grand Hotel \u2014 which, seeming to belong at once to the present moment and to my past visit, floated between them like the real charm of a particular form of existence to which one returns only to change one\u2019s necktie. The sheets on my bed, too fine, too light, too large, impossible to tuck in, to keep in position, which billowed out from beneath the blankets in moving whorls had distressed me before. Now they merely cradled upon the awkward, swelling fulness of their sails the glorious sunrise, big with hopes, of my first morning. But that sun had not time to appear. In the dead of night, the awful, godlike presence had returned to life. I asked the manager to leave me, and to give orders that no one was to enter my room. I told him that I should remain in bed and rejected his offer to send to the chemist\u2019s for the excellent drug. He was delighted by my refusal for he was afraid that other visitors might be annoyed by the smell of the \u2018calyptus.\u2019 It earned me the compliment: \u201cYou are in the movement\u201d (he meant: \u2018in the right\u2019), and the warning: \u201ctake care you don\u2019t defile yourself at the door, I\u2019ve had the lock \u2018elucidated\u2019 with oil; if any of the servants dares to knock at your door, he\u2019ll be beaten \u2018black and white.\u2019 And they can mark my words, for I\u2019m not a repeater\u201d (this evidently meant that he did not say a thing twice). \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t you care for a drop of old wine, just to set you up; I have a pig\u2019s head of it downstairs\u201d (presumably hogshead). \u201cI shan\u2019t bring it to you on a silver dish like the head of Jonathan, and I warn you that it is not Ch\u00e2teau-Lafite, but it is virtuously equivocal\u201d (virtually equivalent). \u201cAnd as it\u2019s quite light, they might fry you a little sole.\u201d I declined everything, but was surprised to hear the name of the fish (sole) pronounced like that of the King of Israel, Saul, by a man who must have ordered so many in his life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the manager\u2019s promises, they brought me in a little later the turned down card of the Marquise de Cambremer. Having come over to see me, the old lady had sent to inquire whether I was there and when she heard that I had arrived only the day before, and was unwell, had not insisted, but (not without stopping, doubtless, at the chemist\u2019s or the haberdasher\u2019s, while the footman jumped down from the box and went in to pay a bill or to give an order) had driven back to F\u00e9terne, in her old barouche upon eight springs, drawn by a pair of horses. Not infrequently did one hear the rumble and admire the pomp of this carriage in the streets of Balbec and of various other little places along the coast, between Balbec and F\u00e9terne. Not that these halts outside shops were the object of these excursions. It was on the contrary some tea-party or garden-party at the house of some squire or functionary, socially quite unworthy of the Marquise. But she, although completely overshadowing, by her birth and wealth, the petty nobility of the district, was in her perfect goodness and simplicity of heart so afraid of disappointing anyone who had sent her an invitation that she would attend all the most insignificant social gatherings in the neighbourhood. Certainly, rather than travel such a distance to listen, in the stifling heat of a tiny drawing-room, to a singer who generally had no voice and whom in her capacity as the lady bountiful of the countryside and as a famous musician she would afterwards be compelled to congratulate with exaggerated warmth, Mme. de Cambremer would have preferred to go for a drive or to remain in her marvellous gardens at F\u00e9terne, at the foot of which the drowsy waters of a little bay float in to die amid the flowers. But she knew that the probability of her coming had been announced by the host, whether he was a noble or a free burgess of Maineville-la Teinturi\u00e8re or of Chattoncourt-l\u2019Orgueilleux. And if Mme. de Cambremer had driven out that afternoon without making a formal appearance at the party, any of the guests who had come from one or other of the little places that lined the coast might have seen and heard the Marquise\u2019s barouche, which would deprive her of the excuse that she had not been able to get away from F\u00e9terne. On the other hand, these hosts might have seen Mme. de Cambremer, time and again, appear at concerts given in houses which, they considered, were no place for her; the slight depreciation caused thereby, in their eyes, to the position of the too obliging Marquise vanished as soon as it was they who were entertaining her, and it was with feverish anxiety that they kept asking themselves whether or not they were going to have her at their \u2018small party.\u2019 What an allaying of the doubts and fears of days if, after the first song had been sung by the daughter of the house or by some amateur on holiday in the neighbourhood, one of the guests announced (an infallible sign that the Marquise was coming to the party) that he had seen the famous barouche and pair drawn up outside the watchmaker\u2019s or the chemist\u2019s! Thereupon Mme. de Cambremer (who indeed was to enter before long followed by her daughter-in-law, the guests who were staying with her at the moment and whom she had asked permission, granted with such joy, to bring) shone once more with undiminished lustre in the eyes of her host and hostess, to whom the hoped-for reward of her coming had perhaps been the determining if unavowed cause of the decision they had made a month earlier: to burden themselves with the trouble and expense of an afternoon party. Seeing the Marquise present at their gathering, they remembered no longer her readiness to attend those given by their less deserving neighbours, but the antiquity of her family, the splendour of her house, the rudeness of her daughter-in-law, born Legrandin, who by her arrogance emphasised the slightly insipid good-nature of the dowager. Already they could see in their mind\u2019s eye, in the social column of the Gaulois, the paragraph which they would draft themselves in the family circle, with all the doors shut and barred, upon \u2018the little corner of Brittany which is at present a whirl of gaiety, the select party from which the guests could hardly tear themselves away, promising their charming host and hostess that they would soon pay them another visit.\u2019 Day after day they watched for the newspaper to arrive, worried that they had not yet seen any notice in it of their party, and afraid lest they should have had Mme. de Cambremer for their other guests alone and not for the whole reading public. At length the blessed day arrived: \u201cThe season is exceptionally brilliant this year at Balbec. Small afternoon concerts are the fashion. . . . \u201d Heaven be praised, Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s name was spelt correctly, and included \u2018among others we may mention\u2019 but at the head of the list. All that remained was to appear annoyed at this journalistic indiscretion which might get them into difficulties with people whom they had not been able to invite, and to ask hypocritically in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s hearing who could have been so treacherous as to send the notice, upon which the Marquise, every inch the lady bountiful, said: \u201cI can understand your being annoyed, but I must say I am only too delighted that people should know I was at your party.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the card that was brought me, Mme. de Cambremer had scribbled the message that she was giving an afternoon party \u2018the day after tomorrow.\u2019 To be sure, as recently as the day before yesterday, tired as I was of the social round, it would have been a real pleasure to me to taste it, transplanted amid those gardens in which there grew in the open air, thanks to the exposure of F\u00e9terne, fig trees, palms, rose bushes extending down to a sea as blue and calm often as the Mediterranean, upon which the host\u2019s little yacht sped across, before the party began, to fetch from the places on the other side of the bay the most important guests, served, with its awnings spread to shut out the sun, after the party had assembled, as an open air refreshment room, and set sail again in the evening to take back those whom it had brought. A charming luxury, but so costly that it was partly to meet the expenditure that it entailed that Mme. de Cambremer had sought to increase her income in various ways, and notably by letting, for the first time, one of her properties very different from F\u00e9terne: la Raspeli\u00e8re. Yes, two days earlier, how welcome such a party, peopled with minor nobles all unknown to me, would have been to me as a change from the \u2018high life\u2019 of Paris. But now pleasures had no longer any meaning for me. And so I wrote to Mme. de Cambremer to decline, just as, an hour ago, I had put off Albertine: grief had destroyed in me the possibility of desire as completely as a high fever takes away one\u2019s appetite. . . . My mother was to arrive on the morrow. I felt that I was less unworthy to live in her company, that I should understand her better, now that an alien and degrading existence had wholly given place to the resurging, heartrending memories that wreathed and ennobled my soul, like her own, with their crown of thorns. I thought so: in reality there is a world of difference between real griefs, like my mother\u2019s, which literally crush out our life for years if not for ever, when we have lost the person we love \u2014 and those other griefs, transitory when all is said, as mine was to be, which pass as quickly as they have been slow in coming, which we do not realise until long after the event, because, in order to feel them, we need first to understand them; griefs such as so many people feel, from which the grief that was torturing me at this moment differed only in assuming the form of unconscious memory\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That I was one day to experience a grief as profound as that of my mother, we shall find in the course of this narrative, but it was neither then nor thus that I imagined it. Nevertheless, like a principal actor who ought to have learned his part and to have been in his place long beforehand but has arrived only at the last moment and, having read over once only what he has to say, manages to \u2018gag\u2019 so skilfully when his cue comes that nobody notices his unpunctuality, my new-found grief enabled me, when my mother came, to talk to her as though it had existed always. She supposed merely that the sight of these places which I had visited with my grandmother (which was not at all the case) had revived it. For the first time then, and because I felt a sorrow which was nothing compared with hers, but which opened my eyes, I realised and was appalled to think what she must be suffering. For the first time I understood that the fixed and tearless gaze (which made Fran\u00e7oise withhold her sympathy) that she had worn since my grandmother\u2019s death had been arrested by that incomprehensible contradiction of memory and nonexistence. Besides, since she was, although still in deep mourning, more fashionably dressed in this strange place, I was more struck by the transformation that had occurred in her. It is not enough to say that she had lost all her gaiety; melted, congealed into a sort of imploring image, she seemed to be afraid of shocking by too sudden a movement, by too loud a tone, the sorrowful presence that never parted from her. But, what struck me most of all, when I saw her cloak of crape, was \u2014 what had never occurred to me in Paris \u2014 that it was no longer my mother that I saw before me, but my grandmother. As, in royal and princely families, upon the death of the head of the house his son takes his title and, from being Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, Prince de Tarente or Prince des Laumes, becomes King of France, Duc de la Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, Duc de Guermantes, so by an accession of a different order and more remote origin, the dead man takes possession of the living who becomes his image and successor, carries on his interrupted life. Perhaps the great sorrow that follows, in a daughter such as Mamma, the death of her mother only makes the chrysalis break open a little sooner, hastens the metamorphosis and the appearance of a person whom we carry within us and who, but for this crisis which annihilates time and space, would have come more gradually to the surface. Perhaps, in our regret for her who is no more, there is a sort of auto-suggestion which ends by bringing out on our features resemblances which potentially we already bore, and above all a cessation of our most characteristically personal activity (in my mother, her common sense, the sarcastic gaiety that she inherited from her father) which we did not shrink, so long as the beloved was alive, from exercising, even at her expense, and which counterbalanced the traits that we derived exclusively from her. Once she is dead, we should hesitate to be different, we begin to admire only what she was, what we ouiselves already were only blended with something else, and what in future we are to be exclusively. It is in this sense (and not in that other, so vague, so false, in which the phrase is generally used) that we may say that death is not in vain, that the dead man continues to react upon us. He reacts even more than a living man because, true reality being discoverable only by the mind, being the object of a spiritual operation, we acquire a true knowledge only of things that we are obliged to create anew by thought, things that are hidden\u2019 from us in everyday life. . . . Lastly, in our mourning for our dead we pay an idolatrous worship to the things that they liked. Not only could not my mother bear to be parted from my grandmother\u2019s bag, become more precious than if it had been studded with sapphires and diamonds, from her muff, from all those garments which served to enhance their personal resemblance, but even from the volumes of Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 which my grandmother took with her everywhere, copies which my mother would not have exchanged for the original manuscript of the letters. She had often teased my grandmother who could never write to her without quoting some phrase of Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 or Mme. de Beausergent. In each of the three letters that I received from Mamma before her arrival at Balbec, she quoted Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 to me, as though those three letters had been written not by her to me but by my grandmother and to her. She must at once go out upon the front to see that beach of which my grandmother had spoken to her every day in her letters. Carrying her mother\u2019s sunshade, I saw her from my window advance, a sable figure, with timid, pious steps, over the sands that beloved feet had trodden before her, and she looked as though she were going down to find a corpse which the waves would cast up at her feet. So that she should not have to dine by herself, I was to join her downstairs. The chief magistrate and the barrister\u2019s widow asked to be introduced to her. And everything that was in any way connected with my grandmother was so precious to her that she was deeply touched, remembered ever afterwards with gratitude what the chief magistrate had said to her, just as she was hurt and indignant that, the barrister\u2019s wife had not a word to say in memory of the dead. In reality, the chief magistrate was no more concerned about my grandmother than the barrister\u2019s wife. The heartfelt words of the one and the other\u2019s silence, for all that my mother imagined so vast a difference between them, were but alternative ways of expressing that indifference which we feel towards the dead. But I think that my mother found most comfort in the words in which, quite involuntarily, I conveyed to her a little of my own anguish. It could not but make Mamma happy (notwithstanding all her affection for myself), like everything else that guaranteed my grandmother survival in our hearts. Daily after this my mother went down and sat upon the beach, so as to do exactly what her mother had done, and read her mother\u2019s two favourite books, theMemoirs of Madame de Beausergent and the Letters of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. She, like all the rest of us, could not bear to hear the latter lady called the \u2018spirituelle Marquise\u2019 any more than to hear La Fontaine called \u2018le Bonhomme.\u2019 But when, in reading the Letters, she came upon the words: \u2018My daughter,\u2019 she seemed to be listening to her mother\u2019s voice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had the misfortune, upon one of these pilgrimages during which she did not like to be disturbed, to meet upon the beach a lady from Combray, accompanied by her daughters. Her name was, I think, Madame Poussin. But among ourselves we always referred to her as the \u2018Pretty Kettle of Fish,\u2019 for it was by the perpetual repetition of this phrase that she warned her daughters of the evils that they were laying up for themselves, saying for instance if one of them was rubbing her eyes: \u201cWhen you go and get ophthalmia, that will be a pretty kettle of fish.\u201d She greeted my mother from afar with slow and melancholy bows, a sign not of condolence but of the nature of her social training. We might never have lost my grandmother, or had any reason to be anything but happy. Living in comparative retirement at Combray within the walls of her large garden, she could never find anything soft enough to her liking, and subjected to a softening process the words and even the proper names of the French language. She felt \u2018spoon\u2019 to be too hard a word to apply to the piece of silver which measured out her syrups, and said, in consequence, \u2018spune\u2019; she would have been afraid of hurting the feelings of the sweet singer of T\u00e9l\u00e9maque by calling him bluntly F\u00e9nelon \u2014 as I myself said with a clear conscience, having had as a friend the dearest and cleverest of men, good and gallant, never to be forgotten by any that knew him, Bertrand de F\u00e9nelon \u2014 and never said anything but \u2018F\u00e9nelon,\u2019 feeling that the acute accent added a certain softness. The far from soft son-in-law of this Madame Poussin, whose name I have forgotten, having been a lawyer at Combray, ran off with the contents of the safe, and relieved my uncle among others of a considerable sum of money. But most of the people of Combray were on such friendly terms with the rest of the family that no coolness ensued and her neighbours said merely that they were sorry for Madame Poussin. She never entertained, but whenever people passed by her railings they would stop to admire the delicious shade of her trees\u2019, which was the only thing that could be made out. She gave us no trouble at Balbec, where I encountered her only once, at a moment when she was saying to a daughter who was biting her nails: \u201cWhen they begin to fester, that will be a pretty kettle of fish.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Mamma sat reading on the beach I remained in my room by myself. I recalled the last weeks of my grandmother\u2019s life, and everything connected with them, the outer door of the flat which had been propped open when I went out with her for the last time. In contrast to all this the rest of the world seemed scarcely real and my anguish poisoned everything in it. Finally my mother insisted upon my going out. But at every step, some forgotten view of the casino, of the street along which, as I waited until she was ready, that first evening, I had walked as far as the monument to Duguay-Trouin, prevented me, like a wind against which it is hopeless to struggle, from going farther; I lowered my eyes in order not to see. And after I had recovered my strength a little I turned back towards the hotel, the hotel in which I knew that it was henceforth impossible that, however long I might wait, I should find my grandmother, whom I had found there before, on the evening of our arrival. As it was the first time that I had gone out of doors, a number of servants whom I had not yet seen were gazing at me curiously. Upon the very threshold of the hotel a young page took off his cap to greet me and at once put it on again. I supposed that Aim\u00e9 had, to borrow his own expression, \u2018given him the office\u2019 to treat me with respect. But I saw a moment later that, as some one else entered the hotel, he doffed it again. The fact of the matter was that this young man had no other occupation in life than to take off and put on his cap, and did it to perfection. Having realised that he was incapable of doing anything else and that in this art he excelled, he practised it as often as was possible daily, which won him a discreet but widespread regard from the visitors, coupled with great regard from the hall porter upon whom devolved the duty of engaging the boys and who, until this rare bird alighted, had never succeeded in finding one who did not receive notice within a week, greatly to the astonishment of Aim\u00e9 who used to say: \u201cAfter all, in that job they\u2019ve only got to be polite, which can\u2019t be so very difficult.\u201d The manager required in addition that they should have what he called a good \u2018presence,\u2019 meaning thereby that they should not be absent from their posts, or perhaps having heard the word \u2018presence\u2019 used of personal appearance. The appearance of the lawn behind the hotel had been altered by the creation of several flower-beds and by the removal not only of an exotic shrub but of the page who, at the time of my former visit, used to provide an external decoration with the supple stem of his figure crowned by the curious colouring of his hair. He had gone with a Polish countess who had taken him as her secretary, following the example of his two elder brothers and their typist sister, torn from the hotel by persons of different race and sex who had been attracted by their charm. The only one remaining was the youngest, whom nobody wanted, because he squinted. He was highly delighted when the Polish countess or the protectors of the other two brothers came on a visit to the hotel at Balbec. For, albeit he was jealous of his brothers, he was fond of them and could in this way cultivate his family affections for a few weeks in the year. Was not the Abbess of Fontevrault accustomed, deserting her nuns for the occasion, to come and partake of the hospitality which Louis XIV offered to that other Mortemart, his mistress, Madame de Montespan? The boy was still in his first year at Balbec; he did not as yet know me, but having heard his comrades of longer standing supplement the word \u2018Monsieur,\u2019 when they addressed me, with my surname, he copied them from the first with an air of satisfaction, whether at shewing his familiarity with a person whom he supposed to be well-known, or at conforming with a custom of which five minutes earlier he had never heard but which he felt it to be indispensable that he should not fail to observe. I could quite well appreciate the charm that this great \u2018Palace\u2019 might have for certain persons. It was arranged like a theatre, and a numerous cast filled it to the doors with animation. For all that the visitor was only a sort of spectator, he was perpetually taking part in the performance, and that not as in one of those theatres where the actors perform a play among the audience, but as though the life of the spectator were going on amid the sumptuous fittings of the stage. The lawn-tennis player might come in wearing a white flannel blazer, the porter would have put on a blue frock coat with silver braid before handing him his letters. If this lawn-tennis player did not choose to walk upstairs, he was equally involved with the actors in having by his side, to propel the lift, its attendant no less richly attired. The corridors on each landing engulfed a flying band of nymphlike chambermaids, fair visions against the sea, at whose modest chambers the admirers of feminine beauty arrived by cunning detours. Downstairs, it was the masculine element that predominated and made this hotel, in view of the extreme and effortless youth of the servants, a sort of Judaeo-Christian tragedy given bodily form and perpetually in performance. And so I could not help repeating to myself, when I saw them, not indeed the lines of Racine that had come into my head at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s while M. de Vaugoubert stood watching young secretaries of embassy greet M. de Charlus, but other lines of Racine, taken this time not from Esther but from Athalie: for in the doorway of the hall, what in the seventeenth century was called the portico, \u2018a flourishing race\u2019 of young pages clustered, especially at tea-time, like the young Israelites of Racine\u2019s choruses. But I do not believe that one of them could have given even the vague answer that Joas finds to satisfy Athalie when she inquires of the infant Prince: \u201cWhat is your office, then?\u201d for they had none. At the most, if one had asked of any of them, like the new Queen: \u201cBut all this race, what do they then, imprisoned in this place?\u201d he might have said: \u201cI watch the solemn pomp and bear my part.\u201d Now and then one of the young supers would approach some more important personage, then this young beauty would rejoin the chorus, and, unless it were the moment for a spell of contemplative relaxation, they would proceed with their useless, reverent, decorative, daily evolutions. For, except on their \u2018day off,\u2019 \u2018reared in seclusion from the world\u2019 and never crossing the threshold, they led the same ecclesiastical existence as the Levites in Athalie, and as I gazed at that \u2018young and faithful troop\u2019 playing at the foot of the steps draped with sumptuous carpets, I felt inclined to ask myself whether I were entering the Grand Hotel at Balbec or the Temple of Solomon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went straight up to my room. My thoughts kept constantly turning to the last days of my grandmother\u2019s illness, to her sufferings which I lived over again, intensifying them with that element which is even harder to endure than the sufferings of other people, and is added to them by our merciless pity; when we think that we are merely reviving the pains of a beloved friend, our pity exaggerates them; but perhaps it is our pity that is in the right, more than the sufferers\u2019 own consciousness of their pains, they being blind to that tragedy of their own existence which pity sees and deplores. Certainly my pity would have taken fresh strength and far exceeded my grandmother\u2019s sufferings had I known then what I did not know until long afterwards, that my grandmother, on the eve of her death, in a moment of consciousness and after making sure that I was not in the room, had taken Mamma\u2019s hand, and, after pressing her fevered lips to it, had said: \u201cFarewell, my child, farewell for ever.\u201d And this may perhaps have been the memory upon which my mother never ceased to gaze so fixedly. Then more pleasant memories returned to me. She was my grandmother and I was her grandson. Her facial expressions seemed written in a language intended for me alone; she was everything in my life, other people existed merely in relation to her, to the judgment that she would pass upon them; but no, our relations were too fleeting to have been anything but accidental. She no longer knew me, I should never see her again. We had not been created solely for one another, she was a stranger to me. This stranger was before my eyes at the moment in the photograph taken of her by Saint-Loup. Mamma, who had met Albertine, insisted upon my seeing her, because of the nice things that she had said about my grandmother and myself. I had accordingly made an appointment with her. I told the manager that she was coming, and asked him to let her wait for me in the drawing-room. He informed me that he had known her for years, her and her friends, long before they had attained \u2018the age of purity\u2019 but that he was annoyed with them because of certain things that they had said about the hotel. \u201cThey can\u2019t be very \u2018gentlemanly\u2019 if they talk like that. Unless people have been slandering them.\u201d I had no difficulty in guessing that \u2018purity\u2019 here meant \u2018puberty.\u2019 As I waited until it should be time to go down and meet Albertine, I was keeping my eyes fixed, as upon a picture which one ceases to see by dint of staring at it, upon the photograph that Saint-Loup had taken, when all of a sudden I thought once again: \u201cIt\u2019s grandmother, I am her grandson\u201d as a man who has lost his memory remembers his name, as a sick man changes his personality. Fran\u00e7oise came in to tell me that Albertine was there, and, catching sight of the photograph: \u201cPoor Madame; it\u2019s the very image of her, even the beauty spot on her cheek; that day the Marquis took her picture, she was very poorly, she had been taken bad twice. \u2018Whatever happens, Fran\u00e7oise,\u2019 she said, \u2018you must never let my grandson know.\u2019 And she kept it to herself, she was always bright with other people. When she was by herself, though, I used to find that she seemed to be in rather monotonous spirits now and then. But that soon passed away. And then she said to me, she said: \u2018If anything were to happen to me, he ought to have a picture of me to keep. And I have never had one done in my life.\u2019 So then she sent me along with a message to the Marquis, and he was never to let you know that it was she who had asked him, but could he take her photograph. But when I came back and told her that he would, she had changed her mind again, because she was looking so poorly. \u2018It would be even worse,\u2019 she said to me, \u2018than no picture at all.\u2019 But she was a clever one, she was, and in the end she got herself up so well in that big shady hat that it didn\u2019t shew at all when she was out of the sun. She was very glad to have that photograph, because at that time she didn\u2019t think she would ever leave Balbec alive. It was no use my saying to her: \u2018Madame, it\u2019s wrong to talk like that, I don\u2019t like to hear Madame talk like that,\u2019 she had got it into her head. And, lord, there were plenty days when she couldn\u2019t eat a thing. That was why she used to make Monsieur go and dine away out in the country with M. le Marquis. Then, instead of going in to dinner, she would pretend to be reading a book, and as soon as the Marquis\u2019s carriage had started, up she would go to bed. Some days she wanted to send word to Madame, to come down and see her in time. And then she was afraid of alarming her, as she had said nothing to her about it. \u2018It will be better for her to stay with her husband, don\u2019t you see, Fran\u00e7oise.\u2019\u201d Looking me in the face, Fran\u00e7oise asked me all of a sudden if I was \u2018feeling indisposed.\u2019 I said that I was not; whereupon she: \u201cAnd you make me waste my time talking to you. Your visitor has been here all this time. I must go down and tell her. She is not the sort of person to have here. Why, a fast one like that, she may be gone again by now. She doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting. Oh, nowadays, Mademoiselle Albertine, she\u2019s somebody!\u201d \u201cYou are quite wrong, she is a very respectable person, too respectable for this place. But go and tell her that I shan\u2019t be able to see her to-day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What compassionate declamations I should have provoked from Fran\u00e7oise if she had seen me cry. I carefully hid myself from her. Otherwise I should have had her sympathy. But I gave her mine. We do not put ourselves sufficiently in the place of these poor maidservants who cannot bear to see us cry, as though crying were bad for us; or bad, perhaps, for them, for Fran\u00e7oise used to say to me when I was a child: \u201cDon\u2019t cry like that, I don\u2019t like to see you crying like that.\u201d We dislike highfalutin language, asseverations, we are wrong, we close our hearts to the pathos of the countryside, to the legend which the poor servant girl, dismissed, unjustly perhaps, for theft, pale as death, grown suddenly more humble than if it were a crime merely to be accused, unfolds, invoking her father\u2019s honesty, her mother\u2019s principles, her grandam\u2019s counsels. It is true that those same servants who cannot bear our tears will have no hesitation in letting us catch pneumonia, because the maid downstairs likes draughts and it would not be polite to her to shut the windows. For it is necessary that even those who are right, like Fran\u00e7oise, should be wrong also, so that Justice may be made an impossible thing. Even the humble pleasures of servants provoke either the refusal or the ridicule of their masters. For it is always a mere nothing, but foolishly sentimental, unhygienic. And so, they are in a position to say: \u201cHow is it that I ask for only this one thing in the whole year, and am not allowed it.\u201d And yet the masters will allow them something far more difficult, which was not stupid and dangerous for the servants \u2014 or for themselves. To be sure, the humility of the wretched maid, trembling, ready to confess the crime that she has not committed, saying \u201cI shall leave to-night if you wish it,\u201d is a thing that nobody can resist. But we must learn also not to remain unmoved, despite the solemn, menacing fatuity of the things that she says, her maternal heritage and the dignity of the family \u2018kailyard,\u2019 before an old cook draped in the honour of her life and of her ancestry, wielding her broom like a sceptre, donning the tragic buskin, stifling her speech with sobs, drawing herself up with majesty. That afternoon, I remembered or imagined scenes of this sort which I associated with our old servant, and from then onwards, in spite of all the harm that she might do to Albertine, I loved Fran\u00e7oise with an affection, intermittent it is true, but of the strongest kind, the kind that is founded upon pity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, I suffered agonies all that day, as I sat gazing at my grandmother\u2019s photograph. It tortured me. Not so acutely, though, as the visit I received that evening from the manager. After I had spoken to him about my grandmother, and he had reiterated his condolences, I heard him say (for he enjoyed using the words that he pronounced wrongly): \u201cLike the day when Madame your grandmother had that sincup, I wanted to tell you about it, because of the other visitors, don\u2019t you know, it might have given the place a bad name. She ought really to have left that evening. But she begged me to say nothing about it and promised me that she wouldn\u2019t have another sincup, or the first time she had one, she would go. The floor waiter reported to me that she had had another. But, lord, you were old friends that we try to please, and so long as nobody made any complaint.\u201d And so my grandmother had had syncopes which she had never mentioned to me. Perhaps at the very moment when I was being most beastly to her, when she was obliged, amid her pain, to see that she kept her temper, so as not to anger me, and her looks, so as not to be turned out of the hotel. \u2018Sincup\u2019 was a word which, so pronounced, I should never have imagined, which might perhaps, applied to other people, have struck me as ridiculous, but which in its strange sonorous novelty, like that of an original discord, long retained the faculty of arousing in me the most painful sensations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next day I went, at Mamma\u2019s request, to lie down for a little on the sands, or rather among the dunes, where one is hidden by their folds, and I knew that Albertine and her friends would not be able to find me. My drooping eyelids allowed but one kind of light to pass, all rosy, the light of the inner walls of the eyes. Then they shut altogether. Whereupon my grandmother appeared to me, seated in an armchair. So feeble she was, she seemed to be less alive than other people. And yet I could hear her breathe; now and again she made a sign to shew that she had understood what we were saying, my father and I. But in vain might I take her in my arms, I failed utterly to kindle a spark of affection in her eyes, a flush of colour in her cheeks. Absent from herself, she appeared somehow not to love me, not to know me, perhaps not to see me. I could not interpret the secret of her indifference, of her dejection, of her silent resentment. I drew my father aside. \u201cYou can see, all the same,\u201d I said to him, \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt about it, she understands everything perfectly. It is a perfect imitation of life. If we could have your cousin here, who maintains that the dead don\u2019t live. Why, she\u2019s been dead for more than a year now, and she\u2019s still alive. But why won\u2019t she give me a kiss?\u201d \u201cLook her poor head is drooping again.\u201d \u201cBut she wants to go, now, to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s madness!\u201d \u201cYou really think it can do her any harm, that she can die any further? It isn\u2019t possible that she no longer loves me. I keep on hugging her, won\u2019t she ever smile at me again?\u201d \u201cWhat can you expect, when people are dead they are dead.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few days later I was able to look with pleasure at the photograph that Saint-Loup had taken of her; it did not revive the memory of what Fran\u00e7oise had told me, because that memory had never left me and I was growing used to it. But with regard to the idea that I had received of the state of her health \u2014 so grave, so painful \u2014 on that day, the photograph, still profiting by the ruses that my grandmother had adopted, which succeeded in taking me in even after they had been disclosed to me, shewed me her so smart, so care-free, beneath the hat which partly hid her face, that I saw her looking less unhappy and in better health than I had imagined. And yet, her cheeks having unconsciously assumed an expression of their own, livid, haggard, like the expression of an animal that feels that it has been marked down for slaughter, my grandmother had an air of being under sentence of death, an air involuntarily sombre, unconsciously tragic, which passed unperceived by me but prevented Mamma from ever looking at that photograph, that photograph which seemed to her a photograph not so much of her mother as of her mother\u2019s disease, of an insult that the disease was offering to the brutally buffeted face of my grandmother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then one day I decided to send word to Albertine that I would see her presently. This was because, on a morning of intense and premature heat, the myriad cries of children at play, of bathers disporting themselves, of newsvendors, had traced for me in lines of fire, in wheeling, interlacing flashes, the scorching beach which the little waves came up one after another to sprinkle with their coolness; then had begun the symphonic concert mingled with the splashing of the water, through which the violins hummed like a swarm of bees that had strayed out over the sea. At once I had longed to hear again Albertine\u2019s laughter, to see her friends, those girls outlined against the waves who had remained in my memory the inseparable charm, the typical flora of Balbec; and I had determined to send a line by Fran\u00e7oise to Albertine, making an appointment for the following week, while, gently rising, the sea as each wave uncurled completely buried in layers of crystal the melody whose phrases appeared to be separated from one another like those angel lutanists which on the roof of the Italian cathedral rise between the peaks of blue porphyry and foaming jasper. But on the day on which Albertine came, the weather had turned dull and cold again, and moreover I had no opportunity of hearing her laugh; she was in a very bad temper. \u201cBalbec is deadly dull this year,\u201d she said to me. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to stay any longer than I can help. You know I\u2019ve been here since Easter, that\u2019s more than a month. There\u2019s not a soul here. You can imagine what fun it is.\u201d Notwithstanding the recent rain and a sky that changed every moment, after escorting Albertine as far as Epreville, for she was, to borrow her expression, \u2018on the run\u2019 between that little watering-place, where Mme. Bontemps had her villa, and Incarville, where she had been taken \u2018en pension\u2019 by Rosemonde\u2019s family, I went off by myself in the direction of the highroad that Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s carriage had taken when we went for a drive with my grandmother; pools of water which the sun, now bright again, had not dried made a regular quagmire of the ground, and I thought of my grandmother who, in the old days, could not walk a yard without covering herself with mud. But on reaching the road I found a dazzling spectacle. Where I had seen with my grandmother in the month of August only the green leaves and, so to speak, the disposition of the apple-trees, as far as the eye could reach they were in full bloom, marvellous in their splendour, their feet in the mire beneath their ball-dresses, taking no precaution not to spoil the most marvellous pink satin that was ever seen, which glittered in the sunlight; the distant horizon of the sea gave the trees the background of a Japanese print; if I raised my head to gaze at the sky through the blossom, which made its serene blue appear almost violent, the trees seemed to be drawing apart to reveal the immensity of their paradise. Beneath that azure a faint but cold breeze set the blushing bouquets gently trembling. Blue tits came and perched upon the branches and fluttered among the flowers, indulgent, as though it had been an amateur of exotic art and colours who had artificially created this living beauty. But it moved one to tears because, to whatever lengths the artist went in the refinement of his creation, one felt that it was natural, that these apple-trees were there in the heart of the country, like peasants, upon one of the highroads of France. Then the rays of the sun gave place suddenly to those of the rain; they streaked the whole horizon, caught the line of apple-trees in their grey net. But they continued to hold aloft their beauty, pink and blooming, in the wind that had turned icy beneath the drenching rain: it was a day in springEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/210658", "artist_names": "Joan Baez", "full_title": "We Shall Overcome by\u00a0Joan\u00a0Baez", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e473557a23000e5ea178ea6f5e87b4a4.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e473557a23000e5ea178ea6f5e87b4a4.877x877x1.jpg", "id": 210658, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 5, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1618170312, "path": "/Joan-baez-we-shall-overcome-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Joan-baez-we-shall-overcome-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1963, "month": 11, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "November 1963", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Nov. 1963", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e473557a23000e5ea178ea6f5e87b4a4.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e473557a23000e5ea178ea6f5e87b4a4.877x877x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 2, "hot": false, "pageviews": 16060}, "title": "We Shall Overcome", "title_with_featured": "We Shall Overcome", "updated_by_human_at": 1636559636, "url": "https://genius.com/Joan-baez-we-shall-overcome-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/37184", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/480da7e8857fdc48fb47384637e4e7b0.545x317x1.jpg", "id": 37184, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/480da7e8857fdc48fb47384637e4e7b0.545x317x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Joan Baez", "slug": "Joan-baez", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Joan-baez"}, "artist": "Joan Baez", "lyrics": "We Shall Overcome LyricsWe shall overcome\nWe shall overcome\nWe shall overcome, some day\nOh, deep in my heart\nI do believe\nWe shall overcome, some day\nWe'll walk hand in hand\nWe'll walk hand in hand\nWe'll walk hand in hand, some day\nOh, deep in my heart\nWe shall live in peace\nWe shall live in peace\nWe shall live in peace, some day\nOh, deep in my heart\nWe shall all be free\nWe shall all be free\nWe shall all be free, some day\nOh, deep in my heart\nWe are not afraid\nWe are not afraid\nWe are not afraid, TODAY\nOh, deep in my heart\nWe shall overcome\nWe shall overcome\nWe shall overcome, some day\nOh, deep in my heart\nI do believe\nWe shall overcome, some dayYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 16, "api_path": "/songs/498237", "artist_names": "Harmony Korine (Ft.

Casper\nseems much happier than Telly. Telly is laid-back. Casper is\nhyper as he jumps up and down and claws Telly's arm.\n\nTELLY\nWell it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took\nlike 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we\nfucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out\nand putting it back in. It hurts the first time.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nBut then when she got into it. She really got into it. It\nwas good.\n\nCASPER\nHow did she smell? Did her puss stink?\n\nTelly puts his four fingers together and then puts his hand\nin front of Caper's nose.\n\nTELLY\nTake a whiff.\n\nCasper takes a huge whiff, the snot in his nose makes a loud\nsound as he smells Telly's fingers.\n\nCASPER\nOh man, it smells like butterscotch.\n\nTELLY\nHell's yeah. She was so clean.\n\nCASPER\nOh man, that's the best.\n\nTELLY\nYou could tell she took care of herself. She had all these\npowders and creams in her bathroom.\n\nCASPER\nLet me smell it again.\n\nTelly lifts his fingers once again, as Casper breathes in\nthe odor.\n\nCASPER\nThat's why virgins are the best. I love that smell.\n\nAs they walk down the street, joggers, men in business suits\nwith briefcases, ambulances, and women with baby carriages\nall pass by.\n\nTELLY\nYou know what else?\n\nCASPER\nWhat?\n\nTELLY\nI can tell that she had just entered puberty.\n\nCASPER\nHow?\n\nTELLY\nWell, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her\nfamily, right.\n\nCASPER\nRight.\n\nTELLY\nAnd there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or\nsomething. And I said, you were cut when you were little.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nAnd she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year\nago. I look younger without my makeup.\n\nCasper starts to crack up.\n\nTELLY\nAnd I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this\ngirl is a baby.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nAnd for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know,\nbecause she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit,\nthat turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.\n\nThey both laugh.\n\nCASPER\nFuckin perverted bastard.\n\nThey continue to laugh and walk.\n\nTELLY\nI'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that\nshit.\n\nCASPER\nTo what? Virgins?\n\nTELLY\nYeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's\nlike lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex\nfantasies.\n\nCASPER\nWhat do you mean?\n\nTELLY\nI mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.\n\nCASPER\nYou mean like fucking two virgins at once.\n\nTELLY\n(laughing)\nThat would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like\nwhen I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I\nwould like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would\nhappen.\n\nCASPER\n(laughing)\nShe's probably smash you in the fucking face.\n\nTELLY\nI don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I\nwasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it\nslow. Show 'em some respect.\n\nCASPER\nDid you tell her that you loved her?\n\nTELLY\nLike. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin\nseduction guys.\n\nThey stop walking. Casper takes the last sip of his beer,\nthen throws it toward an orange trash can. He misses the can\nand the bottle smashes in the middle of a busy street.\n\nCASPER\nShit.\n\nTELLY\nWhat do you want?\n\nCASPER\nGet another forty.\n(burps)\nSmoke a blunt.\n\nTELLY\nAre you hungry?\n\nCASPER\nHell yeah. Fuckin starvin. Wait up a sec.\n\nCasper takes two steps away and starts urinating in\nsomeone's bushes. People walk by and stare.\n\nTELLY\nYou wanna go to Paul's house?\n\nCASPER\nWhat for? That guys a dick.\n\nTELLY\nI'm sue he's got food. He's always got those microwave\nburrito things in his freezer.\n\nCASPER\nYou think he's got any herb?\n\nTELLY\nI don't know, he quit dealin but I'll bet he'll smoke us\nout.\n\nCASPER\nYou think?\n\nTELLY\nProbably.\n\nCASPER\nHe lives on 76th?\n\nTELLY\n78th.\n\nCASPER\nDen less go Joe.\n\nHe zips up his pants.\n\nThey start walking again. Casper is carrying a folded up\ncomic book in his hand.\n\nCASPER\nTelly.\n\nTELLY\nYeah.\n\nCASPER\nDid she suck your dick?\n\nTELLY\nA little bit. But I didn't really want her to.\n\nCASPER\nWhy?\n\nTELLY\nI don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to\nsuck your dick. That's so easy.\n\nCASPER\nIt is right.\n\nTELLY\nI want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole\nphilosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's\nbasic because there's nothing lost.\n\nCASPER\nIt's no big deal, right?\n\nTELLY\nRight. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it.\nYou were the one. No one else can ever do it.\n\nCASPER\nYeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.\n(they both start laughing)\nIt's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like,\nif you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the\nvirgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were\ntheir first.\n\nTELLY\nYep.\n\nCASPER\nThey're gonna tell their grand kids.\n(mimicking an old lady)\nThat Telly. He sure was good in the sack!\n\nThe two of them are laughing, their conversation has gotten\nthem very excited.\n\nThey walk in front of a Korean grocery. The grocery has a\nsmall outdoor produce section, juice, fruit, sodas, etc. A\nKOREAN GUY with flip-flops and headphones is sitting on a\ntall wooden stool.\n\nTELLY\nYou thirsty?\n\nCASPER\nYeah, I feel dehydrated.\n\nTELLY\nYou got any money?\n\nCASPER\nThree pennies and a ball of lint.\n\nTELLY\nYou down with the boost?\n\nCASPER\n(whispers)\nUnzip my pack, yo.\n\nHe turns around and Telly quickly unzips his backpack.\n\n\nINT. KOREAN GROCERY - DAY\n\nThe grocery is your basic traditional market with a lunch\nbuffet. Behind the cash register is a middle-aged KOREAN\nMAN. He is watching a small black and white television set.\n\nThe two boys enter.\n\nCasper walks straight to the back where they keep the beer.\n\nTelly circles the buffet and then walks up to the cash\nregister.\n\nTELLY\nUh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER\nWhah?\n\nTELLY\nDiss digg. I'm curious if you have it?\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER\nWhah is dissdee?\n\nCasper is going through the beer section. He pulls out two\n40oz. bottles of and puts them on the floor.\n\nTELLY\nDiss digg, diss digg, diss digg.\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER\nI no understand you. Maybe crazy.\n\nA round mirror is reflecting Casper putting the bottles into\nhis backpack.\n\nTELLY\nI'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER\nWhah you say? Dissdee?\n\nCasper runs up to the counter and grabs his crotch.\n\nCASPER\nHe said This Dick, mutha fucka! Can't you understand\nEnglish?\n\nThe two of them both run out the door.\n\nTelly taps the Korean man who is sitting outside. The man\nlooks in the opposite direction while Casper grabs two\npeaches and puts them into his pocket.\n\nThe two boys run off.\n\nThe Korean man gets off his stool. He pulls his headphones\noff his ears.\n\nKOREAN MAN\nStupy fucky boys! Fucky!\n\nHe looks at his fruit stand and puts a peach in the spot\nthat Casper previously stole from.\n\n\nEXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - APARTMENT - DAY\n\nCasper and Telly are walking down the street. Casper is\neating a peach and drinking his 40oz. beer.

PAUL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\nA medium sized apartment building on the Upper East Side.\nCars are speeding by the front of the building. Cabs drive\nby and beep their horns.\n\nTelly and Casper are sitting on the front steps. Telly rings\none of the buttons. The bottom switchboard is plastered with\nskateboarding stickers and \"Legalize Marijuana\" stickers. A\nVespa scooter is parked on the outside in front of the\nbuilding, it also has stickers on it.\n\nTelly rings it again.

Vitamin C for the new generation.\n\nPaul hands Casper another cartridge.\n\nCASPER\nThat's why I like 'em.

He took it away and now it's gone\nforever.\n\nLaughter.\n\nJENNIE\nYeah. But it's not even the fact that he devirginized me.\nIt's the fact that after it was done he never spoke to me\nagain. He talked all this bullshit and then just broke out.\n\nLINDA\nThat's the kinda shit he's into. Telly is known for that\nstuff. He fucked Amber the same way.\n\nSUSAN\nAnd Susan too.\n\nJENNIE\nBut he was all like, Oh Jennie I like you so much. Trust me\nyou'll love it, I'm not gonna use you. I promise.

Everyone is cracking up.\n\nSUSAN\n(still laughing)\nI was like yes! I'm going out with him!\n\nLINDA\nThat's right.

Where just one more move and you would be like crazy.\n\nShe snaps her fingers.\n\nRUBY\nYep.\n\nLINDA\nBut then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What\nhappened!

He's such a jerk.\n\nTELLY\nYou think so?\n\nMISHA\nYeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in\nlike seventh grade.\n\nTELLY\nHe still does.\n\nMISHA\nI hate 'em.\n\nTELLY\nIt's not his fault. He had a hard life.\n\nMISHA\nYeah?\n\nTELLY\nYou've heard the stories right?\n\nMISHA\nNo.\n\n\nEXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK - DAY\n\nBack in time. Casper is a little boy, age 11. He is walking\ndown the sidewalk with a lunch box and a \"Casper the\nFriendly Ghost\" T-shirt. He is wearing his hat on backwards.\n\nMusic accompanies this entire episode.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nWell, one day Casper had a stomachache and he got permission\nfrom his teacher to leave school early and go home.\n\nCasper walks up to a nice middle-class home, it could be in\nQueens or Brooklyn, it doesn't matter. He pulls out a key\nand opens the door. He enters his home.\n\n\nINT. CASPER'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nThe house is dark. Plastic on all the furniture. A velvet\npicture of Christ is hanging on the wall in the hallway.\nVery simple and plain, a generic adobe.\n\nCasper enters his house and flips on a lightswitch.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo he walks into his house and hears some strange noises.\n\nThe sounds of his mother screaming from upstairs.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(screaming from upstairs)\nGet away! Get away! Help! You monster! Please help!\n\nCasper puts his lunch box down and walks to the first stair\nto listen to his mother's screams.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nThe noises were coming from upstairs. In his parents room.\n\nCasper's mom continues to scream from upstairs.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo, this freaked the hell out of Casper. He was just a\nlittle kid and he wasn't sure what to do.\n\nCasper moves off the step and runs into the kitchen.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo he ran and got a big knife. The same knife his pops used\nto cut the turkey on Thanksgiving with.\n\nHe opens a drawer full of silverware and pulls out a\nhumongous glistening knife. He picks it up, and it shines on\nhis face.\n\nAs his mother screams he looks up at the ceiling with the\nknife in his hand.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(screaming from upstairs)\nStop! Please stop! Oooh help!\n\nCasper runs up the stairs, he is holding the knife straight\nout.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo he heard his mom's screams, and knew that she was in\ntrouble. It sounded like she was getting ready to be killed.\nLike someone was kicking her in the head.\n\nCasper runs down the hall and opens the door to his parents\nroom.\n\nWhat he sees is very shocking. His face becomes extremely\nanimated.\n\nCasper's mom is on the bed. She is completely naked except\nfor a pair of bright red high heel shoes. In between her\nlegs is a man wearing all black, including a black ski mask\nand motorcycle boots. He is having sex with Casper's mom. He\nhas her arms pinned down on the bed. He is grunting like a\npig.\n\nCasper watches for a moment in awe.\n\nMAN IN BLACK\nBitch. You fuckin bitch. Fuckin bitch. Slutty whore.\n\nThe man in black slaps Casper's mom hard on her naked ass.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(screaming)\nNo! Stop! Get off me!\n\nShe is struggling to get loose.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo Casper opened the door and he saw some big guy with a ski\nmask fucking his mother. What a sight for an 11 year old\nkid.\n\nCasper runs up to the bed. He climbs on top of the bed with\nthe big knife in the air, all the while the man in black is\nhaving sex with his mother. And they don't even notice\nCasper at first.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nAnd he goes and jumps on his parent's bed. And for a second\nhe just looks and watches.\n\nCasper takes his knife and starts stabbing the guy in black,\nover and over. His mother is kicking and trying to stop him.\nAll the while, she is screaming outrageously and blood is\npouring out.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nAnd you know. Casper loved his mom, he didn't want anything\nto happen to her. So he started stabbing this guy, over and\nover. But it was a mistake.\n\nCasper's mom is kicking Casper as he stabs the man.\n\nCasper is biting his tongue as he stabs the man.\n\nThe man falls off the bed and onto the floor.\n\nCasper's mom is going totally nuts. She is completely naked,\nwith blood all over her body. There is blood all over the\nsheets. His mom is clawing her face in complete hysterics.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\nYou fuck!!! It's your father!!! We were playing a game you\nfuck!!! That's your father!!! We were just playing!!!\n\nCasper looks very confused as he looks at his naked mother.\nHe has the knife in his hand, and a little blood on his\nT-shirt and cheek.\n\nCasper's mom continues to yell at him.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\nCasper, you fucker!!! Oh, my god!!! Help me God!!!\n\nCasper looks at his mother, then he looks at the dead guy on\nthe floor. He bends down and takes off the mask. It's his\nfather.\n\nCASPER\n(calmly)\nThat's my dad.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(crying)\nYou fuck. You killed your father!\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo Casper killed his father. He came home with a stomachache\nand ended up murdering his pops. It was a very embarrassing\nthing.\n\n\nEXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - ON A CEMENT BENCH - DAY\n\nTelly is in the same spot talking to Misha.\n\nTELLY\nSo that's why Casper is how he is.\n\nMISHA\nOh god. That's horrible.\n\nA quick shot of Casper smoking a blunt and laughing with his\nfriends.\n\nTELLY\nYep.\n\nMISHA\nHoly shi. That's all true?\n\nTELLY\nNo. I was just kidding.\n\nMISHA\n(outraged)\nWhat?!\n\nTELLY\nI lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post\noffice.\n\n\nEXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - ON THE FOUNTAIN - DAY\n\nCasper and all his friends are passing around the blunt,\nwhich by now is almost gone. All that is left is a roach and\nCasper is sucking on it really hard.\n\nCasper breathes out the smoke and then passes the roach to\nHamilton.\n\nCASPER\nYo, that weed is mad good.\n\nHamilton gets ready to puff.\n\nHAMILTON\nHells yeah. Gimmie a taste of the mothafuckin chronic.\n\nCasper rubs his eyes.\n\nHamilton puffs on the little roach.\n\nCasper grabs somebody's skateboard and stands on it. He\nstarts rolling around slowly and doing some tricks.\n\nThe other kids continue to smoke. They watch Casper and\nlaugh.\n\nCasper is slowly trying to do tricks, but he's so stoned\nthat he just falls off.\n\nAs he skates in front of is friends he doesn't pay any\nattention to where he's going.\n\nA tall HOODLUM with gold front teeth is walking by. He is\nwearing all Polo and a thick white Fila headband. He is\nbiting down on a chew stick.\n\nThe hoodlum walks by. He has a certain ominous strut. He is\nlooking at the ground as he walks.\n\nHe takes the chew stick out of his mouth and looks at some\ngirl's ass as she walks by. He makes a little noise with his\nmouth.\n\nAs the hoodlum walks by, Casper is rolling backward, not\npaying attention. He rolls into the hoodlum's heels. Casper\nfalls down and laughs. Everyone watching laughs, including\nTelly who is still sitting with Misha.\n\nCasper jumps up and grabs his skateboard. The hoodlum is\nturned around. Casper walks up to him with a smile.\n\nCASPER\nYo, sorry money.\n\nThe hoodlum is a good seven inches taller than Casper. He\nputs his arms out like he's upset.\n\nHOODLUM\nYeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm\nsaying?\n\nCASPER\n(smiling)\nYeah, watch where you walk dukes.\n\nHOODLUM\nWhat?\n\nCASPER\nNuffin G. Just forget it.\n\nHOODLUM\nWhat the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?\n\nCasper throws his skateboard down. He quickly turns around\nand pulls his pants up. He runs right up to the hoodlum and\nhe looks up at him.\n\nCASPER\nSup then? Sup?\n\nHOODLUM\nCome on bitch. Throw your fists up.\n\n\nEXT. THE CEMENT BENCHES - DAY\n\nTelly and Misha are watching. Telly stands up.\n\nTELLY\nUh oh. Casper's in the mix.\n\nHe quickly walks up.\n\n\nEXT. THE FOUNTAIN - DAY\n\nAll the guys jump up and start screaming.\n\nSTEVEN\nOh shit. Throw down.\n\nSteven and all the guys run up and surround the hoodlum.\nThey all start screaming taunts. \"Fuck 'em up Casper!\"\n\nCasper is inches from the hoodlum. They are both in a\nfighting stance. Casper keeps pulling his pants up. Casper\nhas a huge smile on his face, like this is his favorite\nthing in the whole world.\n\nCASPER\nSup. Sup.\n\nHOODLUM\nCome on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.\n\nCASPER\nI'm gonna fuck you up bitch.\n\nThey are both right about to swing.\n\nEveryone in the whole park has turned their attention to the\nscuffle.\n\nAll of a sudden, out of nowhere, Harold runs up behind the\nHoodlum and with the truck of his skateboard, smashes the\nguy in the back of the head. A huge thud is heard and the\nhoodlum just kinda falls forward on his knees.\n\nCasper, with a big smile, steps back and kicks the guy in\nthe face as hard as he can.\n\nEveryone gets in a big circle around the fallen hoodlum.\nThey're all screaming. Even the girls are screaming. \"Fuck\n'em up!\"\n\nHarold continues hitting the hoodlum with his skateboard.\n\nHitting him on the legs and stomach.\n\nCasper is jumping up and down on the hoodlum's head.\n\nCASPER\n(everytime he kicks the guy he says this)\nSuck my dick! Suck my dick! Suck my dick!\n\nAll of a sudden, all the skateboarders in the park,\nincluding Hamilton and Steven, take their boards and start\nsmashing this guy, over and over.\n\nThe hoodlum is on the ground holding his head, as everyone\nfrantically tries to kill him.\n\nThe focus should be on the face of the skateboarders. How\nmuch they are enjoying this. They continue to pound him,\nover and over, like animals in on the prey.\n\nThis should look very scary, as twenty guys try to kill the\nfallen hoodlum. Even little kids are in the middle, beating\nthe guy.\n\nTelly looks up to the sky. He makes a loud noise as he\nclears his throat, like he's gathering mucus. Then he puts\nhis arms down and stops some of the kids from hitting the\nhoodlum. His face is completely cracked and bloody. Telly\nsteps over him and spits a huge phlegm wad onto his face.\n\nCasper, still smiling, kicks the guy in the face.\n\nCASPER\nSuck my dick, Suck my dick. Suck my dick.\n\nEveryone stops kicking the guy and they all get kinda silent\nand look at him. He looks completely twisted, bloody, and\ndead.\n\nCasper bends over, right in his face.\n\nCASPER\n(smiling)\nNow get in my way! Bitch.\n\nCUT TO BLACK\n\n\nINT. / EXT. TAXICAB - GOING DOWNTOWN - EVENING\n\nJennie is in the back of a speeding cab. She is looking out\nthe window. Her face looks sad.\n\nThe TAXI DRIVER is a funny looking old man.

Can I ask you a question?\n\nJennie just shrugs.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nCan I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a\npest.\n\nJENNIE\nWhat?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWell, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was\nlooking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you,\nbut your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be\nof any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin.\nHelp make you happy. Who knows? Somethin maybe.\n\nAs the taxi driver talks, he looks in the mirror, and then\nlooks at the road. He is driving fast and clumsy. He pulls\nout his cigar and then puts it back in his mouth.\n\nJENNIE\nNo. I'm OK. Thanks.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYou're OK?\n\nJENNIE\nYeah.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nBecause gee, you don't look OK. I mean your a very beautiful\nyoung lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...\n\nJENNIE\nYeah well, it's been a bad day.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nA bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was\nsmashed over by a car and when my wife found out she\ncollapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack.\nPartial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way.\nNot me. It's not good for the soul.\n\nThe taxi driver begins to laugh a really squeaky laugh.\n\nJENNIE\nSorry.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nOh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who\nknows? You don't. No one does.\n\nJennie continues to look glumly out the window.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYou know. I could tell you were sad by the way your eyes\ndrooped. Like an adopted kid.

Jennie continues to look sadly out the\nwindow.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWould I be prying if I asked you what was wrong?\n\nJennie is silent.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nMiss, would I be prying?\n\nJENNIE\nEverything is wrong.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nNo, not everything?

Like a glamour girl.\n\nJENNIE\nYeah?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nOh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom\nqueen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center\nof her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis.\nYou know you look a little bit like her.\n\nJENNIE\nThanks.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a\ncrush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in\nher mouth.\n\nHe stops at a red light and turns around to look at her.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nHey look. Whatever it is. Just forget about it. Life's too\nshort. Make yourself happy. I'll give you an example. When\nmy golden retriever passed away. God rest his soul.\n(he punches the roof of the cab)\nI was lonesome. I missed him. So I got a tattoo.\n\nHe pulls up his shirt and reveals a tattoo of a dog on his\nforearm. It says \"Bruno\" in big letters.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nNow how do you like that? Now he's with me forever.\n\nThe light turns and he starts driving.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nI swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight\noff my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.\n\nJENNIE\nYeah?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should\nmake yourself happy.\n\nJENNIE\nWhat if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything\nfalls apart?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWell then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You\nforget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My\ngrandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, \"Leon,\nmy darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't\nthink. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't\ntalk\" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be\nhappier.\n\nHe starts to laugh.\n\nA quick shot of his identification badge. He has a really\ngoofy smile and he's wearing the same Hawaiian shirt.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nThat's life.\n\nJennie is smiling.\n\nJENNIE\nYour a real philosopher.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.\n\nHe pulls up on Washington Square Park. He slams on the\nbrakes and turns around in his seat.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWell here we are, Miss.\n\nJennie pulls some money out.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nAw, don't worry 'bout it. The rides on me.\n\nJennie has the money up to the glass.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nAll right, all right, I'll take it. But forget about the\ntip.\n\nHe takes her money.\n\nJENNIE\nThanks. Bye.\n\nThe taxi driver sticks his head out the window.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nOh yeah. Oh Miss. Miss. When you smile, God notices.

A little bit of\nfuzz runs down his cheeks.\n\nCasper walks back into the living room.\n\nHe walks over to where Harold is asleep and just looks at\nhim for a second.\n\nThen Casper walks down the hallway to the door in front of\nSteven's parent's bedroom. He opens the door wide and looks\nat the two, both naked and asleep in each other's arm.\n\nCASPER\n(to himself)\nLucky fuckin bastard.\n\nCasper shuts the door.\n\nHe walks back through the hallway and into the living room.\n\nWhen he gets in the living room, he looks around, then he\nflops down beside Jennie on the couch. He puts his hands\ndown his pants and starts itching.\n\nCasper looks beside his feet and sees Steven sleeping with\nhis head on top of Kim's stomach.\n\nCasper continues to scratch his balls. Then he looks over\nbeside him at Jennie scrunched up asleep.\n\nCasper looks around to see if anyone is awake in the room.\nEverybody is asleep.\n\nHe scoots up close to Jennie and looks at her.\n\nCasper nudges her shoulder.\n\nCASPER\n(whispering)\nJennie.

He looks at\nher and then pulls her panties off.\n\nCasper quickly undoes his pants and gets in betwen her legs.\n\nHe puts her hands around his shoulders.\n\nJennie is sort of coming to but she has no energy. She makes\nsome noise but she is passed out and powerless.\n\nHer eyes are closed the whole time. She is not aware of what\nis happening.\n\nJENNIE\n(slurred and unconscious)\nDon't. Please don't. No. No.\n\nCasper starts situating himself. She is totally limp.\n\nCASPER\nShh. Don't worry Jennie. It's me Casper.\n\nCasper has his knees on the floor as he takes advantage of\nJennie.\n\nJennie moves her arms a little bit. Casper is breathing fast\nand heavy.\n\nCUT TO BLACK\n\n\nAs the scene ends in blackness, the sound of Casper's heavy\nbreathing persists. Then it slowly fades out and everything\nis silent.\n\n\nEXT. OUTSIDE MANHATTAN - DAY\n\nThe birds are chirping. People are going to work. Stores are\nopening.

Or buy your coach.\u201d\n\nVaccaro\u2019s audience, the members of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, bristled. These were eminent reformers\u2014among them the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, two former heads of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and several university presidents and chancellors. The Knight Foundation, a nonprofit that takes an interest in college athletics as part of its concern with civic life, had tasked them with saving college sports from runaway commercialism as embodied by the likes of Vaccaro, who, since signing his pioneering shoe contract with Michael Jordan in 1984, had built sponsorship empires successively at Nike, Adidas, and Reebok. Not all the members could hide their scorn for the \u201csneaker pimp\u201d of schoolyard hustle, who boasted of writing checks for millions to everybody in higher education.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d asked Bryce Jordan, the president emeritus of Penn State, \u201cshould a university be an advertising medium for your industry?\u201d\n\nVaccaro did not blink. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t, sir,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou sold your souls, and you\u2019re going to continue selling them. You can be very moral and righteous in asking me that question, sir,\u201d Vaccaro added with irrepressible good cheer, \u201cbut there\u2019s not one of you in this room that\u2019s going to turn down any of our money. You\u2019re going to take it. I can only offer it.\u201d\n\nWilliam Friday, a former president of North Carolina\u2019s university system, still winces at the memory. \u201cBoy, the silence that fell in that room,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cI never will forget it.\u201d Friday, who founded and co-chaired two of the three Knight Foundation sports initiatives over the past 20 years, called Vaccaro \u201cthe worst of all\u201d the witnesses ever to come before the panel.\n\nBut what Vaccaro said in 2001 was true then, and it\u2019s true now: corporations offer money so they can profit from the glory of college athletes, and the universities grab it. In 2010, despite the faltering economy, a single college athletic league, the football-crazed Southeastern Conference (SEC), became the first to crack the billion-dollar barrier in athletic receipts. The Big Ten pursued closely at $905 million. That money comes from a combination of ticket sales, concession sales, merchandise, licensing fees, and other sources\u2014but the great bulk of it comes from television contracts.\nEducators are in thrall to their athletic departments because of these television riches and because they respect the political furies that can burst from a locker room. \u201cThere\u2019s fear,\u201d Friday told me when I visited him on the University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill last fall. As we spoke, two giant construction cranes towered nearby over the university\u2019s Kenan Stadium, working on the latest $77 million renovation. (The University of Michigan spent almost four times that much to expand its Big House.) Friday insisted that for the networks, paying huge sums to universities was a bargain. \u201cWe do every little thing for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe furnish the theater, the actors, the lights, the music, and the audience for a drama measured neatly in time slots. They bring the camera and turn it on.\u201d Friday, a weathered idealist at 91, laments the control universities have ceded in pursuit of this money. If television wants to broadcast football from here on a Thursday night, he said, \u201cwe shut down the university at 3 o\u2019clock to accommodate the crowds.\u201d He longed for a campus identity more centered in an academic mission.\n\nThe United States is the only country in the world that hosts big-time sports at institutions of higher learning. This should not, in and of itself, be controversial. College athletics are rooted in the classical ideal of mens sane in corpore sano\u2014a sound mind in a sound body\u2014and who would argue with that? College sports are deeply inscribed in the culture of our nation. Half a million young men and women play competitive intercollegiate sports each year. Millions of spectators flock into football stadiums each Saturday in the fall, and tens of millions more watch on television. The March Madness basketball tournament each spring has become a major national event, with upwards of 80 million watching it on television and talking about the games around the office water cooler. ESPN has spawned ESPNU, a channel dedicated to college sports, and Fox Sports and other cable outlets are developing channels exclusively to cover sports from specific regions or divisions.\nWith so many people paying for tickets and watching on television, college sports has become Very Big Business. According to various reports, the football teams at Texas, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, and Penn State\u2014to name just a few big-revenue football schools\u2014each earn between $40 million and $80 million in profits a year, even after paying coaches multimillion-dollar salaries. When you combine so much money with such high, almost tribal, stakes\u2014football boosters are famously rabid in their zeal to have their alma mater win\u2014corruption is likely to follow.\n\nScandal after scandal has rocked college sports. In 2010, the NCAA sanctioned the University of Southern California after determining that star running back Reggie Bush and his family had received \u201cimproper benefits\u201d while he played for the Trojans. (Among other charges, Bush and members of his family were alleged to have received free airfare and limousine rides, a car, and a rent-free home in San Diego, from sports agents who wanted Bush as a client.) The Bowl Championship Series stripped USC of its 2004 national title, and Bush returned the Heisman Trophy he had won in 2005. Last fall, as Auburn University football stormed its way to an undefeated season and a national championship, the team\u2019s star quarterback, Cam Newton, was dogged by allegations that his father had used a recruiter to solicit up to $180,000 from Mississippi State in exchange for his son\u2019s matriculation there after junior college in 2010. Jim Tressel, the highly successful head football coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes, resigned last spring after the NCAA alleged he had feigned ignorance of rules violations by players on his team. At least 28 players over the course of the previous nine seasons, according to Sports Illustrated, had traded autographs, jerseys, and other team memorabilia in exchange for tattoos or cash at a tattoo parlor in Columbus, in violation of NCAA rules. Late this summer, Yahoo Sports reported that the NCAA was investigating allegations that a University of Miami booster had given millions of dollars in illicit cash and services to more than 70 Hurricanes football players over eight years.\n\nThe list of scandals goes on. With each revelation, there is much wringing of hands. Critics scold schools for breaking faith with their educational mission, and for failing to enforce the sanctity of \u201camateurism.\u201d Sportswriters denounce the NCAA for both tyranny and impotence in its quest to \u201cclean up\u201d college sports. Observers on all sides express jumbled emotions about youth and innocence, venting against professional mores or greedy amateurs.\nFor all the outrage, the real scandal is not that students are getting illegally paid or recruited, it\u2019s that two of the noble principles on which the NCAA justifies its existence\u2014\u201camateurism\u201d and the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d\u2014are cynical hoaxes, legalistic confections propagated by the universities so they can exploit the skills and fame of young athletes. The tragedy at the heart of college sports is not that some college athletes are getting paid, but that more of them are not.\n\n\nDon Curtis, a UNC trustee, told me that impoverished football players cannot afford movie tickets or bus fare home. Curtis is a rarity among those in higher education today, in that he dares to violate the signal taboo: \u201cI think we should pay these guys something.\u201d\nFans and educators alike recoil from this proposal as though from original sin. Amateurism is the whole point, they say. Paid athletes would destroy the integrity and appeal of college sports. Many former college athletes object that money would have spoiled the sanctity of the bond they enjoyed with their teammates. I, too, once shuddered instinctively at the notion of paid college athletes.\n\nBut after an inquiry that took me into locker rooms and ivory towers across the country, I have come to believe that sentiment blinds us to what\u2019s before our eyes. Big-time college sports are fully commercialized. Billions of dollars flow through them each year. The NCAA makes money, and enables universities and corporations to make money, from the unpaid labor of young athletes.\nSlavery analogies should be used carefully. College athletes are not slaves. Yet to survey the scene\u2014corporations and universities enriching themselves on the backs of uncompensated young men, whose status as \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d deprives them of the right to due process guaranteed by the Constitution\u2014is to catch an unmistakable whiff of the plantation. Perhaps a more apt metaphor is colonialism: college sports, as overseen by the NCAA, is a system imposed by well-meaning paternalists and rationalized with hoary sentiments about caring for the well-being of the colonized. But it is, nonetheless, unjust. The NCAA, in its zealous defense of bogus principles, sometimes destroys the dreams of innocent young athletes.\n\nThe NCAA today is in many ways a classic cartel. Efforts to reform it\u2014most notably by the three Knight Commissions over the course of 20 years\u2014have, while making changes around the edges, been largely fruitless. The time has come for a major overhaul. And whether the powers that be like it or not, big changes are coming. Threats loom on multiple fronts: in Congress, the courts, breakaway athletic conferences, student rebellion, and public disgust. Swaddled in gauzy clich\u00e9s, the NCAA presides over a vast, teetering glory.\nFounding Myths\nFrom the start, amateurism in college sports has been honored more often in principle than in fact; the NCAA was built of a mixture of noble and venal impulses. In the late 19th century, intellectuals believed that the sporting arena simulated an impending age of Darwinian struggle. Because the United States did not hold a global empire like England\u2019s, leaders warned of national softness once railroads conquered the last continental frontier. As though heeding this warning, ingenious students turned variations on rugby into a toughening agent. Today a plaque in New Brunswick, New Jersey, commemorates the first college game, on November 6, 1869, when Rutgers beat Princeton 6\u20134.\nWalter Camp graduated from Yale in 1880 so intoxicated by the sport that he devoted his life to it without pay, becoming \u201cthe father of American football.\u201d He persuaded other schools to reduce the chaos on the field by trimming each side from 15 players to 11, and it was his idea to paint measuring lines on the field. He conceived functional designations for players, coining terms such as quarterback. His game remained violent by design. Crawlers could push the ball forward beneath piles of flying elbows without pause until they cried \u201cDown!\u201d in submission.\n\nIn an 1892 game against its archrival, Yale, the Harvard football team was the first to deploy a \u201cflying wedge,\u201d based on Napoleon\u2019s surprise concentrations of military force. In an editorial calling for the abolition of the play, The New York Times described it as \u201chalf a ton of bone and muscle coming into collision with a man weighing 160 or 170 pounds,\u201d noting that surgeons often had to be called onto the field. Three years later, the continuing mayhem prompted the Harvard faculty to take the first of two votes to abolish football. Charles Eliot, the university\u2019s president, brought up other concerns. \u201cDeaths and injuries are not the strongest argument against football,\u201d declared Eliot. \u201cThat cheating and brutality are profitable is the main evil.\u201d Still, Harvard football persisted. In 1903, fervent alumni built Harvard Stadium with zero college funds. The team\u2019s first paid head coach, Bill Reid, started in 1905 at nearly twice the average salary for a full professor.\n\nA newspaper story from that year, illustrated with the Grim Reaper laughing on a goalpost, counted 25 college players killed during football season. A fairy-tale version of the founding of the NCAA holds that President Theodore Roosevelt, upset by a photograph of a bloodied Swarthmore College player, vowed to civilize or destroy football. The real story is that Roosevelt maneuvered shrewdly to preserve the sport\u2014and give a boost to his beloved Harvard. After McClure\u2019s magazine published a story on corrupt teams with phantom students, a muckraker exposed Walter Camp\u2019s $100,000 slush fund at Yale. In response to mounting outrage, Roosevelt summoned leaders from Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to the White House, where Camp parried mounting criticism and conceded nothing irresponsible in the college football rules he\u2019d established. At Roosevelt\u2019s behest, the three schools issued a public statement that college sports must reform to survive, and representatives from 68 colleges founded a new organization that would soon be called the National Collegiate Athletic Association. A Haverford College official was confirmed as secretary but then promptly resigned in favor of Bill Reid, the new Harvard coach, who instituted new rules that benefited Harvard\u2019s playing style at the expense of Yale\u2019s. At a stroke, Roosevelt saved football and dethroned Yale.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, the NCAA, with no real authority and no staff to speak of, enshrined amateur ideals that it was helpless to enforce. (Not until 1939 did it gain the power even to mandate helmets.) In 1929, the Carnegie Foundation made headlines with a report, \u201cAmerican College Athletics,\u201d which concluded that the scramble for players had \u201creached the proportions of nationwide commerce.\u201d Of the 112 schools surveyed, 81 flouted NCAA recommendations with inducements to students ranging from open payrolls and disguised booster funds to no-show jobs at movie studios. Fans ignored the uproar, and two-thirds of the colleges mentioned told The New York Times that they planned no changes. In 1939, freshman players at the University of Pittsburgh went on strike because they were getting paid less than their upperclassman teammates.\n\nEmbarrassed, the NCAA in 1948 enacted a \u201cSanity Code,\u201d which was supposed to prohibit all concealed and indirect benefits for college athletes; any money for athletes was to be limited to transparent scholarships awarded solely on financial need. Schools that violated this code would be expelled from NCAA membership and thus exiled from competitive sports.\n\nThis bold effort flopped. Colleges balked at imposing such a drastic penalty on each other, and the Sanity Code was repealed within a few years. The University of Virginia went so far as to call a press conference to say that if its athletes were ever accused of being paid, they should be forgiven, because their studies at Thomas Jefferson\u2019s university were so rigorous.\n\nThe Big Bluff\nIn 1951, the NCAA seized upon a serendipitous set of events to gain control of intercollegiate sports. First, the organization hired a young college dropout named Walter Byers as executive director. A journalist who was not yet 30 years old, he was an appropriately inauspicious choice for the vaguely defined new post. He wore cowboy boots and a toupee. He shunned personal contact, obsessed over details, and proved himself a bureaucratic master of pervasive, anonymous intimidation. Although discharged from the Army during World War II for defective vision, Byers was able to see an opportunity in two contemporaneous scandals. In one, the tiny College of William and Mary, aspiring to challenge football powers Oklahoma and Ohio State, was found to be counterfeiting grades to keep conspicuously pampered players eligible. In the other, a basketball point-shaving conspiracy (in which gamblers paid players to perform poorly) had spread from five New York colleges to the University of Kentucky, the reigning national champion, generating tabloid \u201cperp\u201d photos of gangsters and handcuffed basketball players. The scandals posed a crisis of credibility for collegiate athletics, and nothing in the NCAA\u2019s feeble record would have led anyone to expect real reform.\n\nBut Byers managed to impanel a small infractions board to set penalties without waiting for a full convention of NCAA schools, which would have been inclined toward forgiveness. Then he lobbied a University of Kentucky dean\u2014A. D. Kirwan, a former football coach and future university president\u2014not to contest the NCAA\u2019s dubious legal position (the association had no actual authority to penalize the university), pleading that college sports must do something to restore public support. His gambit succeeded when Kirwan reluctantly accepted a landmark precedent: the Kentucky basketball team would be suspended for the entire 1952\u201353 season. Its legendary coach, Adolph Rupp, fumed for a year in limbo.\n\nThe Kentucky case created an aura of centralized command for an NCAA office that barely existed. At the same time, a colossal misperception gave Byers leverage to mine gold. Amazingly in retrospect, most colleges and marketing experts considered the advent of television a dire threat to sports. Studies found that broadcasts reduced live attendance, and therefore gate receipts, because some customers preferred to watch at home for free. Nobody could yet imagine the revenue bonanza that television represented. With clunky new TV sets proliferating, the 1951 NCAA convention voted 161\u20137 to outlaw televised games except for a specific few licensed by the NCAA staff.\n\nAll but two schools quickly complied. The University of Pennsylvania and Notre Dame protested the order to break contracts for home-game television broadcasts, claiming the right to make their own decisions. Byers objected that such exceptions would invite disaster. The conflict escalated. Byers brandished penalties for games televised without approval. Penn contemplated seeking antitrust protection through the courts. Byers issued a contamination notice, informing any opponent scheduled to play Penn that it would be punished for showing up to compete. In effect, Byers mobilized the college world to isolate the two holdouts in what one sportswriter later called \u201cthe Big Bluff.\u201d\n\nByers won. Penn folded in part because its president, the perennial White House contender Harold Stassen, wanted to mend relations with fellow schools in the emerging Ivy League, which would be formalized in 1954. When Notre Dame also surrendered, Byers conducted exclusive negotiations with the new television networks on behalf of every college team. Joe Rauh Jr., a prominent civil-rights attorney, helped him devise a rationing system to permit only 11 broadcasts a year\u2014the fabled Game of the Week. Byers and Rauh selected a few teams for television exposure, excluding the rest. On June 6, 1952, NBC signed a one-year deal to pay the NCAA $1.14 million for a carefully restricted football package. Byers routed all contractual proceeds through his office. He floated the idea that, to fund an NCAA infrastructure, his organization should take a 60 percent cut; he accepted 12 percent that season. (For later contracts, as the size of television revenues grew exponentially, he backed down to 5 percent.) Proceeds from the first NBC contract were enough to rent an NCAA headquarters, in Kansas City.\n\nOnly one year into his job, Byers had secured enough power and money to regulate all of college sports. Over the next decade, the NCAA\u2019s power grew along with television revenues. Through the efforts of Byers\u2019s deputy and chief lobbyist, Chuck Neinas, the NCAA won an important concession in the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, in which Congress made its granting of a precious antitrust exemption to the National Football League contingent upon the blackout of professional football on Saturdays. Deftly, without even mentioning the NCAA, a rider on the bill carved each weekend into protected broadcast markets: Saturday for college, Sunday for the NFL. The NFL got its antitrust exemption. Byers, having negotiated the NCAA\u2019s television package up to $3.1 million per football season\u2014which was higher than the NFL\u2019s figure in those early years\u2014had made the NCAA into a spectacularly profitable cartel.\n\n\u201cWe Eat What We Kill\u201d\nThe NCAA\u2019s control of college sports still rested on a fragile base, however: the consent of the colleges and universities it governed. For a time, the vast sums of television money delivered to these institutions through Byers\u2019s deals made them willing to submit. But the big football powers grumbled about the portion of the television revenue diverted to nearly a thousand NCAA member schools that lacked major athletic programs. They chafed against cost-cutting measures\u2014such as restrictions on team size\u2014designed to help smaller schools. \u201cI don\u2019t want Hofstra telling Texas how to play football,\u201d Darrell Royal, the Longhorns coach, griped. By the 1970s and \u201980s, as college football games delivered bonanza ratings\u2014and advertising revenue\u2014to the networks, some of the big football schools began to wonder: Why do we need to have our television coverage brokered through the NCAA? Couldn\u2019t we get a bigger cut of that TV money by dealing directly with the networks?\nByers faced a rude internal revolt. The NCAA\u2019s strongest legions, its big football schools, defected en masse. Calling the NCAA a price-fixing cartel that siphoned every television dollar through its coffers, in 1981 a rogue consortium of 61 major football schools threatened to sign an independent contract with NBC for $180 million over four years.\n\nWith a huge chunk of the NCAA\u2019s treasury walking out the door, Byers threatened sanctions, as he had against Penn and Notre Dame three decades earlier. But this time the universities of Georgia and Oklahoma responded with an antitrust suit. \u201cIt is virtually impossible to overstate the degree of our resentment \u2026 of the NCAA,\u201d said William Banowsky, the president of the University of Oklahoma. In the landmark 1984 NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the NCAA\u2019s latest football contracts with television\u2014and any future ones\u2014as an illegal restraint of trade that harmed colleges and viewers. Overnight, the NCAA\u2019s control of the television market for football vanished. Upholding Banowsky\u2019s challenge to the NCAA\u2019s authority, the Regents decision freed the football schools to sell any and all games the markets would bear. Coaches and administrators no longer had to share the revenue generated by their athletes with smaller schools outside the football consortium. \u201cWe eat what we kill,\u201d one official at the University of Texas bragged.\n\nA few years earlier, this blow might have financially crippled the NCAA\u2014but a rising tide of money from basketball concealed the structural damage of the Regents decision. During the 1980s, income from the March Madness college basketball tournament, paid directly by the television networks to the NCAA, grew tenfold. The windfall covered\u2014and then far exceeded\u2014what the organization had lost from football.\n\nStill, Byers never forgave his former deputy Chuck Neinas for leading the rebel consortium. He knew that Neinas had seen from the inside how tenuous the NCAA\u2019s control really was, and how diligently Byers had worked to prop up its Oz-like fa\u00e7ade. During Byers\u2019s tenure, the rule book for Division I athletes grew to 427 pages of scholastic detail. His NCAA personnel manual banned conversations around water coolers, and coffee cups on desks, while specifying exactly when drapes must be drawn at the NCAA\u2019s 27,000-square-foot headquarters near Kansas City (built in 1973 from the proceeds of a 1 percent surtax on football contracts). It was as though, having lost control where it mattered, Byers pedantically exerted more control where it didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter retiring in 1987, Byers let slip his suppressed fury that the ingrate football conferences, having robbed the NCAA of television revenue, still expected it to enforce amateurism rules and police every leak of funds to college players. A lethal greed was \u201cgnawing at the innards of college athletics,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. When Byers renounced the NCAA\u2019s pretense of amateurism, his former colleagues would stare blankly, as though he had gone senile or, as he wrote, \u201cdesecrated my sacred vows.\u201d But Byers was better positioned than anyone else to argue that college football\u2019s claim to amateurism was unfounded. Years later, as we will see, lawyers would seize upon his words to do battle with the NCAA.\n\nMeanwhile, reformers fretted that commercialism was hurting college sports, and that higher education\u2019s historical balance between academics and athletics had been distorted by all the money sloshing around. News stories revealed that schools went to extraordinary measures to keep academically incompetent athletes eligible for competition, and would vie for the most-sought-after high-school players by proffering under-the-table payments. In 1991, the first Knight Commission report, \u201cKeeping Faith With the Student Athlete,\u201d was published; the commission\u2019s \u201cbedrock conviction\u201d was that university presidents must seize control of the NCAA from athletic directors in order to restore the preeminence of academic values over athletic or commercial ones. In response, college presidents did take over the NCAA\u2019s governance. But by 2001, when the second Knight Commission report (\u201cA Call to Action: Reconnecting College Sports and Higher Education\u201d) was issued, a new generation of reformers was admitting that problems of corruption and commercialism had \u201cgrown rather than diminished\u201d since the first report. Meanwhile the NCAA itself, revenues rising, had moved into a $50 million, 116,000-square-foot headquarters in Indianapolis. By 2010, as the size of NCAA headquarters increased yet again with a 130,000-square-foot expansion, a third Knight Commission was groping blindly for a hold on independent college-athletic conferences that were behaving more like sovereign pro leagues than confederations of universities. And still more money continued to flow into NCAA coffers. With the basketball tournament\u2019s 2011 television deal, annual March Madness broadcast revenues had skyrocketed 50-fold in less than 30 years.\n\nThe Myth of the \u201cStudent-Athlete\u201d\nToday, much of the NCAA\u2019s moral authority\u2014indeed much of the justification for its existence\u2014is vested in its claim to protect what it calls the \u201cstudent-athlete.\u201d The term is meant to conjure the nobility of amateurism, and the precedence of scholarship over athletic endeavor. But the origins of the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d lie not in a disinterested ideal but in a sophistic formulation designed, as the sports economist Andrew Zimbalist has written, to help the NCAA in its \u201cfight against workmen\u2019s compensation insurance claims for injured football players.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe crafted the term student-athlete,\u201d Walter Byers himself wrote, \u201cand soon it was embedded in all NCAA rules and interpretations.\u201d The term came into play in the 1950s, when the widow of Ray Dennison, who had died from a head injury received while playing football in Colorado for the Fort Lewis A&M Aggies, filed for workmen\u2019s-compensation death benefits. Did his football scholarship make the fatal collision a \u201cwork-related\u201d accident? Was he a school employee, like his peers who worked part-time as teaching assistants and bookstore cashiers? Or was he a fluke victim of extracurricular pursuits? Given the hundreds of incapacitating injuries to college athletes each year, the answers to these questions had enormous consequences. The Colorado Supreme Court ultimately agreed with the school\u2019s contention that he was not eligible for benefits, since the college was \u201cnot in the football business.\u201d\n\nThe term student-athlete was deliberately ambiguous. College players were not students at play (which might understate their athletic obligations), nor were they just athletes in college (which might imply they were professionals). That they were high-performance athletes meant they could be forgiven for not meeting the academic standards of their peers; that they were students meant they did not have to be compensated, ever, for anything more than the cost of their studies. Student-athlete became the NCAA\u2019s signature term, repeated constantly in and out of courtrooms.\n\nUsing the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d defense, colleges have compiled a string of victories in liability cases. On the afternoon of October 26, 1974, the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs were playing the Alabama Crimson Tide in Birmingham, Alabama. Kent Waldrep, a TCU running back, carried the ball on a \u201cRed Right 28\u201d sweep toward the Crimson Tide\u2019s sideline, where he was met by a swarm of tacklers. When Waldrep regained consciousness, Bear Bryant, the storied Crimson Tide coach, was standing over his hospital bed. \u201cIt was like talking to God, if you\u2019re a young football player,\u201d Waldrep recalled.\n\nWaldrep was paralyzed: he had lost all movement and feeling below his neck. After nine months of paying his medical bills, Texas Christian refused to pay any more, so the Waldrep family coped for years on dwindling charity.\n\nThrough the 1990s, from his wheelchair, Waldrep pressed a lawsuit for workers\u2019 compensation. (He also, through heroic rehabilitation efforts, recovered feeling in his arms, and eventually learned to drive a specially rigged van. \u201cI can brush my teeth,\u201d he told me last year, \u201cbut I still need help to bathe and dress.\u201d) His attorneys haggled with TCU and the state worker-compensation fund over what constituted employment. Clearly, TCU had provided football players with equipment for the job, as a typical employer would\u2014but did the university pay wages, withhold income taxes on his financial aid, or control work conditions and performance? The appeals court finally rejected Waldrep\u2019s claim in June of 2000, ruling that he was not an employee because he had not paid taxes on financial aid that he could have kept even if he quit football. (Waldrep told me school officials \u201csaid they recruited me as a student, not an athlete,\u201d which he says was absurd.)\n\nThe long saga vindicated the power of the NCAA\u2019s \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d formulation as a shield, and the organization continues to invoke it as both a legalistic defense and a noble ideal. Indeed, such is the term\u2019s rhetorical power that it is increasingly used as a sort of reflexive mantra against charges of rabid hypocrisy.\n\nLast Thanksgiving weekend, with both the FBI and the NCAA investigating whether Cam Newton had been lured onto his team with illegal payments, Newton\u2019s Auburn Tigers and the Alabama Crimson Tide came together for their annual game, known as the Iron Bowl, before 101,821 fans at Bryant-Denny Stadium. This game is always a highlight of the football season because of the historic rivalry between the two schools, and the 2010 edition had enormous significance, pitting the defending national champion Crimson Tide against the undefeated Tigers, who were aiming for their first championship since 1957. I expected excited fans; what I encountered was the throbbing heart of college sports. As I drove before daybreak toward the stadium, a sleepless caller babbled over WJOX, the local fan radio station, that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t stop thinking about the coin toss.\u201d In the parking lot, ticketless fans were puzzled that anyone need ask why they had tailgated for days just to watch their satellite-fed flat screens within earshot of the roar. All that morning, pilgrims packed the Bear Bryant museum, where displays elaborated the misery of Alabama\u2019s 4\u201324 run before the glorious Bryant era dawned in 1958.\n\nFinally, as Auburn took the field for warm-ups, one of Alabama\u2019s public-address-system operators played \u201cTake the Money and Run\u201d (an act for which he would be fired). A sea of signs reading $CAM taunted Newton. The game, perhaps the most exciting of the season, was unbearably tense, with Auburn coming from way behind to win 28\u201327, all but assuring that it would go on to play for the national championship. Days later, Auburn suspended Newton after the NCAA found that a rules violation had occurred: his father was alleged to have marketed his son in a pay-for-play scheme; a day after that, the NCAA reinstated Newton\u2019s eligibility because investigators had not found evidence that Newton or Auburn officials had known of his father\u2019s actions. This left Newton conveniently eligible for the Southeastern Conference championship game and for the postseason BCS championship bowl. For the NCAA, prudence meant honoring public demand.\n\n\u201cOur championships,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert has declared, \u201care one of the primary tools we have to enhance the student-athlete experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoremasters\u201d\nNCAA v. Regents left the NCAA devoid of television football revenue and almost wholly dependent on March Madness basketball. It is rich but insecure. Last year, CBS Sports and Turner Broadcasting paid $771 million to the NCAA for television rights to the 2011 men\u2019s basketball tournament alone. That\u2019s three-quarters of a billion dollars built on the backs of amateurs\u2014on unpaid labor. The whole edifice depends on the players\u2019 willingness to perform what is effectively volunteer work. The athletes, and the league officials, are acutely aware of this extraordinary arrangement. William Friday, the former North Carolina president, recalls being yanked from one Knight Commission meeting and sworn to secrecy about what might happen if a certain team made the NCAA championship basketball game. \u201cThey were going to dress and go out on the floor,\u201d Friday told me, \u201cbut refuse to play,\u201d in a wildcat student strike. Skeptics doubted such a diabolical plot. These were college kids\u2014unlikely to second-guess their coaches, let alone forfeit the dream of a championship. Still, it was unnerving to contemplate what hung on the consent of a few young volunteers: several hundred million dollars in television revenue, countless livelihoods, the NCAA budget, and subsidies for sports at more than 1,000 schools. Friday\u2019s informants exhaled when the suspect team lost before the finals.\n\nCognizant of its precarious financial base, the NCAA has in recent years begun to pursue new sources of revenue. Taking its cue from member schools such as Ohio State (which in 2009 bundled all its promotional rights\u2014souvenirs, stadium ads, shoe deals\u2014and outsourced them to the international sports marketer IMG College for a guaranteed $11 million a year), the NCAA began to exploit its vault of college sports on film. For $29.99 apiece, NCAA On Demand offers DVDs of more than 200 memorable contests in men\u2019s ice hockey alone. Video-game technology also allows nostalgic fans to relive and even participate in classic moments of NCAA Basketball. NCAA Football, licensed by the NCAA through IMG College to Electronic Arts, one of the world\u2019s largest video-game manufacturers, reportedly sold 2.5 million copies in 2008. Brit Kirwan, the chancellor of the Maryland university system and a former president at Ohio State, says there were \u201cterrible fights\u201d between the third Knight Commission and the NCAA over the ethics of generating this revenue.\n\nAll of this money ultimately derives from the college athletes whose likenesses are shown in the films or video games. But none of the profits go to them. Last year, Electronic Arts paid more than $35 million in royalties to the NFL players union for the underlying value of names and images in its pro football series\u2014but neither the NCAA nor its affiliated companies paid former college players a nickel. Naturally, as they have become more of a profit center for the NCAA, some of the vaunted \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d have begun to clamor that they deserve a share of those profits. You \u201csee everybody getting richer and richer,\u201d Desmond Howard, who won the 1991 Heisman Trophy while playing for the Michigan Wolverines, told USA Today recently. \u201cAnd you walk around and you can\u2019t put gas in your car? You can\u2019t even fly home to see your parents?\u201d\n\nSome athletes have gone beyond talk. A series of lawsuits quietly making their way through the courts cast a harsh light on the absurdity of the system\u2014and threaten to dislodge the foundations on which the NCAA rests. On July 21, 2009, lawyers for Ed O\u2019Bannon filed a class-action antitrust suit against the NCAA at the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. \u201cOnce you leave your university,\u201d says O\u2019Bannon, who won the John Wooden Award for player of the year in 1995 on UCLA\u2019s national-championship basketball team, \u201cone would think your likeness belongs to you.\u201d The NCAA and UCLA continue to collect money from the sales of videos of him playing. But by NCAA rules, O\u2019Bannon, who today works at a Toyota dealership near Las Vegas, alleges he is still not allowed to share the revenue the NCAA generates from his own image as a college athlete. His suit quickly gathered co-plaintiffs from basketball and football, ex-players featured in NCAA videos and other products. \u201cThe NCAA does not license student-athlete likenesses,\u201d NCAA spokesperson Erik Christianson told The New York Times in response to the suit, \u201cor prevent former student-athletes from attempting to do so. Likewise, to claim the NCAA profits off student-athlete likenesses is also pure fiction.\u201d\n\nThe legal contention centers on Part IV of the NCAA\u2019s \u201cStudent-Athlete Statement\u201d for Division I, which requires every athlete to authorize use of \u201cyour name or picture \u2026 to promote NCAA championships or other NCAA events, activities or programs.\u201d Does this clause mean that athletes clearly renounce personal interest forever? If so, does it actually undermine the NCAA by implicitly recognizing that athletes have a property right in their own performance? Jon King, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, expects the NCAA\u2019s core mission of amateurism to be its \u201clast defense standing.\u201d\n\nIn theory, the NCAA\u2019s passion to protect the noble amateurism of college athletes should prompt it to focus on head coaches in the high-revenue sports\u2014basketball and football\u2014since holding the top official accountable should most efficiently discourage corruption. The problem is that the coaches\u2019 growing power has rendered them, unlike their players, ever more immune to oversight. According to research by Charles Clotfelter, an economist at Duke, the average compensation for head football coaches at public universities, now more than $2 million, has grown 750 percent (adjusted for inflation) since the Regents decision in 1984; that\u2019s more than 20 times the cumulative 32 percent raise for college professors. For top basketball coaches, annual contracts now exceed $4 million, augmented by assorted bonuses, endorsements, country-club memberships, the occasional private plane, and in some cases a negotiated percentage of ticket receipts. (Oregon\u2019s ticket concessions netted former football coach Mike Bellotti an additional $631,000 in 2005.)\n\nThe NCAA rarely tangles with such people, who are apt to fight back and win. When Rick Neuheisel, the head football coach of the Washington Huskies, was punished for petty gambling (in a March Madness pool, as it happened), he sued the NCAA and the university for wrongful termination, collected $4.5 million, and later moved on to UCLA. When the NCAA tried to cap assistant coaches\u2019 entering salary at a mere $16,000, nearly 2,000 of them brought an antitrust suit, Law v. NCAA, and in 1999 settled for $54.5 million. Since then, salaries for assistant coaches have commonly exceeded $200,000, with the top assistants in the SEC averaging $700,000. In 2009, Monte Kiffin, then at the University of Tennessee, became the first assistant coach to reach $1 million, plus benefits.\n\nThe late Myles Brand, who led the NCAA from 2003 to 2009, defended the economics of college sports by claiming that they were simply the result of a smoothly functioning free market. He and his colleagues deflected criticism about the money saturating big-time college sports by focusing attention on scapegoats; in 2010, outrage targeted sports agents. Last year Sports Illustrated published \u201cConfessions of an Agent,\u201d a firsthand account of dealing with high-strung future pros whom the agent and his peers courted with flattery, cash, and tawdry favors. Nick Saban, Alabama\u2019s head football coach, mobilized his peers to denounce agents as a public scourge. \u201cI hate to say this,\u201d he said, \u201cbut how are they any better than a pimp? I have no respect for people who do that to young people. None.\u201d\n\nSaban\u2019s raw condescension contrasts sharply with the lonely penitence from Dale Brown, the retired longtime basketball coach at LSU. \u201cLook at the money we make off predominantly poor black kids,\u201d Brown once reflected. \u201cWe\u2019re the whoremasters.\u201d\n\n\u201cPicayune Rules\u201d\nNCAA officials have tried to assert their dominion\u2014and distract attention from the larger issues\u2014by chasing frantically after petty violations. Tom McMillen, a former member of the Knight Commission who was an All-American basketball player at the University of Maryland, likens these officials to traffic cops in a speed trap, who could flag down almost any passing motorist for prosecution in kangaroo court under a \u201cmaze of picayune rules.\u201d The publicized cases have become convoluted soap operas. At the start of the 2010 football season, A. J. Green, a wide receiver at Georgia, confessed that he\u2019d sold his own jersey from the Independence Bowl the year before, to raise cash for a spring-break vacation. The NCAA sentenced Green to a four-game suspension for violating his amateur status with the illicit profit generated by selling the shirt off his own back. While he served the suspension, the Georgia Bulldogs store continued legally selling replicas of Green\u2019s No. 8 jersey for $39.95 and up.\n\nA few months later, the NCAA investigated rumors that Ohio State football players had benefited from \u201chook-ups on tatts\u201d\u2014that is, that they\u2019d gotten free or underpriced tattoos at an Ohio tattoo parlor in exchange for autographs and memorabilia\u2014a violation of the NCAA\u2019s rule against discounts linked to athletic personae. The NCAA Committee on Infractions imposed five-game suspensions on Terrelle Pryor, Ohio State\u2019s tattooed quarterback, and four other players (some of whom had been found to have sold their Big Ten championship rings and other gear), but did permit them to finish the season and play in the Sugar Bowl. (This summer, in an attempt to satisfy NCAA investigators, Ohio State voluntarily vacated its football wins from last season, as well as its Sugar Bowl victory.) A different NCAA committee promulgated a rule banning symbols and messages in players\u2019 eyeblack\u2014reportedly aimed at Pryor\u2019s controversial gesture of support for the pro quarterback Michael Vick, and at Bible verses inscribed in the eyeblack of the former Florida quarterback Tim Tebow.\n\nThe moral logic is hard to fathom: the NCAA bans personal messages on the bodies of the players, and penalizes players for trading their celebrity status for discounted tattoos\u2014but it codifies precisely how and where commercial insignia from multinational corporations can be displayed on college players, for the financial benefit of the colleges. Last season, while the NCAA investigated him and his father for the recruiting fees they\u2019d allegedly sought, Cam Newton compliantly wore at least 15 corporate logos\u2014one on his jersey, four on his helmet visor, one on each wristband, one on his pants, six on his shoes, and one on the headband he wears under his helmet\u2014as part of Auburn\u2019s $10.6 million deal with Under Armour.\n\n\u201cRestitution\u201d\nObscure NCAA rules have bedeviled Scott Boras, the preeminent sports agent for Major League Baseball stars, in cases that may ultimately prove more threatening to the NCAA than Ed O\u2019Bannon\u2019s antitrust suit. In 2008, Andrew Oliver, a sophomore pitcher for the Oklahoma State Cowboys, had been listed as the 12th-best professional prospect among sophomore players nationally. He decided to dismiss the two attorneys who had represented him out of high school, Robert and Tim Baratta, and retain Boras instead. Infuriated, the Barattas sent a spiteful letter to the NCAA. Oliver didn\u2019t learn about this until the night before he was scheduled to pitch in the regional final for a place in the College World Series, when an NCAA investigator showed up to question him in the presence of lawyers for Oklahoma State. The investigator also questioned his father, Dave, a truck driver.\n\nHad Tim Baratta been present in their home when the Minnesota Twins offered $390,000 for Oliver to sign out of high school? A yes would mean trouble. While the NCAA did not forbid all professional advice\u2014indeed, Baseball America used to publish the names of agents representing draft-likely underclassmen\u2014NCAA Bylaw 12.3.2.1 prohibited actual negotiation with any professional team by an adviser, on pain of disqualification for the college athlete. The questioning lasted past midnight.\n\nJust hours before the game was to start the next day, Oklahoma State officials summoned Oliver to tell him he would not be pitching. Only later did he learn that the university feared that by letting him play while the NCAA adjudicated his case, the university would open not only the baseball team but all other Oklahoma State teams to broad punishment under the NCAA\u2019s \u201crestitution rule\u201d (Bylaw 19.7), under which the NCAA threatens schools with sanctions if they obey any temporary court order benefiting a college athlete, should that order eventually be modified or removed. The baseball coach did not even let his ace tell his teammates the sad news in person. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s probably not a good idea for you to be at the game,\u2019\u201d Oliver recalls.\n\nThe Olivers went home to Ohio to find a lawyer. Rick Johnson, a solo practitioner specializing in legal ethics, was aghast that the Baratta brothers had turned in their own client to the NCAA, divulging attorney-client details likely to invite wrath upon Oliver. But for the next 15 months, Johnson directed his litigation against the two NCAA bylaws at issue. Judge Tygh M. Tone, of Erie County, came to share his outrage. On February 12, 2009, Tone struck down the ban on lawyers negotiating for student-athletes as a capricious, exploitative attempt by a private association to \u201cdictate to an attorney where, what, how, or when he should represent his client,\u201d violating accepted legal practice in every state. He also struck down the NCAA\u2019s restitution rule as an intimidation that attempted to supersede the judicial system. Finally, Judge Tone ordered the NCAA to reinstate Oliver\u2019s eligibility at Oklahoma State for his junior season, which started several days later.\n\nThe NCAA sought to disqualify Oliver again, with several appellate motions to stay \u201can unprecedented Order purporting to void a fundamental Bylaw.\u201d Oliver did get to pitch that season, but he dropped into the second round of the June 2009 draft, signing for considerably less than if he\u2019d been picked earlier. Now 23, Oliver says sadly that the whole experience \u201cmade me grow up a little quicker.\u201d His lawyer claimed victory. \u201cAndy Oliver is the first college athlete ever to win against the NCAA in court,\u201d said Rick Johnson.\n\nYet the victory was only temporary. Wounded, the NCAA fought back with a vengeance. Its battery of lawyers prepared for a damages trial, ultimately overwhelming Oliver\u2019s side eight months later with an offer to resolve the dispute for $750,000. When Oliver and Johnson accepted, to extricate themselves ahead of burgeoning legal costs, Judge Tone was compelled to vacate his orders as part of the final settlement. This freed NCAA officials to reassert the two bylaws that Judge Tone had so forcefully overturned, and they moved swiftly to ramp up rather than curtail enforcement. First, the NCAA\u2019s Eligibility Center devised a survey for every drafted undergraduate athlete who sought to stay in college another year. The survey asked whether an agent had conducted negotiations. It also requested a signed release waiving privacy rights and authorizing professional teams to disclose details of any interaction to the NCAA Eligibility Center. Second, NCAA enforcement officials went after another Scott Boras client.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays had made the left-handed pitcher James Paxton, of the University of Kentucky, the 37th pick in the 2009 draft. Paxton decided to reject a reported $1 million offer and return to school for his senior year, pursuing a dream to pitch for his team in the College World Series. But then he ran into the new NCAA survey. Had Boras negotiated with the Blue Jays? Boras has denied that he did, but it would have made sense that he had\u2014that was his job, to test the market for his client. But saying so would get Paxton banished under the same NCAA bylaw that had derailed Andrew Oliver\u2019s career. Since Paxton was planning to go back to school and not accept their draft offer, the Blue Jays no longer had any incentive to protect him\u2014indeed, they had every incentive to turn him in. The Blue Jays\u2019 president, by telling reporters that Boras had negotiated on Paxton\u2019s behalf, demonstrated to future recruits and other teams that they could use the NCAA\u2019s rules to punish college players who wasted their draft picks by returning to college. The NCAA\u2019s enforcement staff raised the pressure by requesting to interview Paxton.\n\nThough Paxton had no legal obligation to talk to an investigator, NCAA Bylaw 10.1(j) specified that anything short of complete cooperation could be interpreted as unethical conduct, affecting his amateur status. Under its restitution rule, the NCAA had leverage to compel the University of Kentucky to ensure obedience.\n\nAs the 2010 season approached, Gary Henderson, the Kentucky coach, sorely wanted Paxton, one of Baseball America\u2019s top-ranked players, to return. Rick Johnson, Andrew Oliver\u2019s lawyer, filed for a declaratory judgment on Paxton\u2019s behalf, arguing that the state constitution\u2014plus the university\u2019s code of student conduct\u2014barred arbitrary discipline at the request of a third party. Kentucky courts deferred to the university, however, and Paxton was suspended from the team. \u201cDue to the possibility of future penalties, including forfeiture of games,\u201d the university stated, it \u201ccould not put the other 32 players of the team and the entire UK 22-sport intercollegiate athletics department at risk by having James compete.\u201d The NCAA appraised the result with satisfaction. \u201cWhen negotiations occur on behalf of student-athletes,\u201d Erik Christianson, the NCAA spokesperson, told The New York Times in reference to the Oliver case, \u201cthose negotiations indicate that the student-athlete intends to become a professional athlete and no longer remain an amateur.\u201d\n\nPaxton was stranded. Not only could he not play for Kentucky, but his draft rights with the Blue Jays had lapsed for the year, meaning he could not play for any minor-league affiliate of Major League Baseball. Boras wrangled a holdover job for him in Texas with the independent Grand Prairie AirHogs, pitching against the Pensacola Pelicans and Wichita Wingnuts. Once projected to be a first-round draft pick, Paxton saw his stock plummet into the fourth round. He remained unsigned until late in spring training, when he signed with the Seattle Mariners and reported to their minor-league camp in Peoria, Arizona.\n\n\u201cYou Might As Well Shoot Them in the Head\u201d\n\u201cWhen you dream about playing in college,\u201d Joseph Agnew told me not long ago, \u201cyou don\u2019t ever think about being in a lawsuit.\u201d Agnew, a student at Rice University in Houston, had been cut from the football team and had his scholarship revoked by Rice before his senior year, meaning that he faced at least $35,000 in tuition and other bills if he wanted to complete his degree in sociology. Bereft of his scholarship, he was flailing about for help when he discovered the National College Players Association, which claims 7,000 active members and seeks modest reforms such as safety guidelines and better death benefits for college athletes. Agnew was struck by the NCPA scholarship data on players from top Division I basketball teams, which showed that 22 percent were not renewed from 2008 to 2009\u2014the same fate he had suffered.\n\nIn October 2010, Agnew filed a class-action antitrust suit over the cancellation of his scholarship and to remove the cap on the total number of scholarships that can be awarded by NCAA schools. In his suit, Agnew did not claim the right to free tuition. He merely asked the federal court to strike down an NCAA rule, dating to 1973, that prohibited colleges and universities from offering any athletic scholarship longer than a one-year commitment, to be renewed or not, unilaterally, by the school\u2014which in practice means that coaches get to decide each year whose scholarships to renew or cancel. (After the coach who had recruited Agnew had moved on to Tulsa, the new Rice coach switched Agnew\u2019s scholarship to a recruit of his own.) Agnew argued that without the one-year rule, he would have been free to bargain with all eight colleges that had recruited him, and each college could have decided how long to guarantee his scholarship.\n\nAgnew\u2019s suit rested on a claim of an NCAA antitrust violation combined with a laudable academic goal\u2014making it possible for students to finish their educations. Around the same time, lawyers from President Obama\u2019s Justice Department initiated a series of meetings with NCAA officials and universities in which they asked what possible educational rationale there was for allowing the NCAA\u2014an organization that did not itself pay for scholarships\u2014to impose a blanket restriction on the length of scholarships offered by colleges. Tidbits leaked into the press. In response, the NCAA contended that an athletic scholarship was a \u201cmerit award\u201d that should be reviewed annually, presumably because the degree of \u201cmerit\u201d could change. Justice Department lawyers reportedly suggested that a free market in scholarships would expand learning opportunities in accord with the stated rationale for the NCAA\u2019s tax-exempt status\u2014that it promotes education through athletics. The one-year rule effectively allows colleges to cut underperforming \u201cstudent-athletes,\u201d just as pro sports teams cut their players. \u201cPlenty of them don\u2019t stay in school,\u201d said one of Agnew\u2019s lawyers, Stuart Paynter. \u201cThey\u2019re just gone. You might as well shoot them in the head.\u201d\n\nAgnew\u2019s lawsuit has made him a pariah to former friends in the athletic department at Rice, where everyone identified so thoroughly with the NCAA that they seemed to feel he was attacking them personally. But if the premise of Agnew\u2019s case is upheld by the courts, it will make a sham of the NCAA\u2019s claim that its highest priority is protecting education.\n\n\u201cThey Want to Crush These Kids\u201d\nAcademic performance has always been difficult for the NCAA to address. Any detailed regulation would intrude upon the free choice of widely varying schools, and any academic standard broad enough to fit both MIT and Ole Miss would have little force. From time to time, a scandal will expose extreme lapses. In 1989, Dexter Manley, by then the famous \u201cSecretary of Defense\u201d for the NFL\u2019s Washington Redskins, teared up before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Education, Arts, and Humanities, when admitting that he had been functionally illiterate in college.\n\nWithin big-time college athletic departments, the financial pressure to disregard obvious academic shortcomings and shortcuts is just too strong. In the 1980s, Jan Kemp, an English instructor at the University of Georgia, publicly alleged that university officials had demoted and then fired her because she refused to inflate grades in her remedial English courses. Documents showed that administrators replaced the grades she\u2019d given athletes with higher ones, providing fake passing grades on one notable occasion to nine Bulldog football players who otherwise would have been ineligible to compete in the 1982 Sugar Bowl. (Georgia lost anyway, 24\u201320, to a University of Pittsburgh team led by the future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino.) When Kemp filed a lawsuit against the university, she was publicly vilified as a troublemaker, but she persisted bravely in her testimony. Once, Kemp said, a supervisor demanding that she fix a grade had bellowed, \u201cWho do you think is more important to this university, you or Dominique Wilkins?\u201d (Wilkins was a star on the basketball team.) Traumatized, Kemp twice attempted suicide.\n\nIn trying to defend themselves, Georgia officials portrayed Kemp as naive about sports. \u201cWe have to compete on a level playing field,\u201d said Fred Davison, the university president. During the Kemp civil trial, in 1986, Hale Almand, Georgia\u2019s defense lawyer, explained the university\u2019s patronizing aspirations for its typical less-than-scholarly athlete. \u201cWe may not make a university student out of him,\u201d Almand told the court, \u201cbut if we can teach him to read and write, maybe he can work at the post office rather than as a garbage man when he gets through with his athletic career.\u201d This argument backfired with the jurors: finding in favor of Kemp, they rejected her polite request for $100,000, and awarded her $2.6 million in damages instead. (This was later reduced to $1.08 million.) Jan Kemp embodied what is ostensibly the NCAA\u2019s reason for being\u2014to enforce standards fairly and put studies above sports\u2014but no one from the organization ever spoke up on her behalf.\n\nTHE NCAA BODY charged with identifying violations of any of the Division I league rules, the Committee on Infractions, operates in the shadows. Josephine Potuto, a professor of law at the University of Nebraska and a longtime committee member who was then serving as its vice chair, told Congress in 2004 that one reason her group worked in secret was that it hoped to avoid a \u201cmedia circus.\u201d The committee preferred to deliberate in private, she said, guiding member schools to punish themselves. \u201cThe enforcement process is cooperative, not adversarial,\u201d Potuto testified. The committee consisted of an elite coterie of judges, athletic directors, and authors of legal treatises. \u201cThe committee also is savvy about intercollegiate athletics,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cannot be conned.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, a series of unlikely circumstances peeled back the veil of secrecy to reveal NCAA procedures so contorted that even victims marveled at their comical wonder. The saga began in March of 2007, shortly after the Florida State Seminoles basketball team was knocked out of the NIT basketball tournament, which each spring invites the best teams not selected for the March Madness tournament. At an athletic-department study hall, Al Thornton, a star forward for the team, completed a sports-psychology quiz but then abandoned it without posting his written answers electronically by computer. Brenda Monk, an academic tutor for the Seminoles, says she noticed the error and asked a teammate to finish entering Thornton\u2019s answers onscreen and hit \u201csubmit,\u201d as required for credit. The teammate complied, steaming silently, and then complained at the athletic office about getting stuck with clean-up chores for the superstar Thornton (who was soon to be selected by the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the NBA draft). Monk promptly resigned when questioned by FSU officials, saying her fatigue at the time could not excuse her asking the teammate to submit the answers to another student\u2019s completed test.\n\nMonk\u2019s act of guileless responsibility set off a chain reaction. First, FSU had to give the NCAA preliminary notice of a confessed academic fraud. Second, because this would be its seventh major infraction case since 1968, FSU mounted a vigorous self-investigation to demonstrate compliance with NCAA academic rules. Third, interviews with 129 Seminoles athletes unleashed a nightmare of matter-of-fact replies about absentee professors who allowed group consultations and unlimited retakes of open-computer assignments and tests. Fourth, FSU suspended 61 of its athletes in 10 sports. Fifth, the infractions committee applied the byzantine NCAA bylaws to FSU\u2019s violations. Sixth, one of the penalties announced in March of 2009 caused a howl of protest across the sports universe.\n\nTwenty-seven news organizations filed a lawsuit in hopes of finding out how and why the NCAA proposed to invalidate 14 prior victories in FSU football. Such a penalty, if upheld, would doom coach Bobby Bowden\u2019s chance of overtaking Joe Paterno of Penn State for the most football wins in Division I history. This was sacrosanct territory. Sports reporters followed the litigation for six months, reporting that 25 of the 61 suspended FSU athletes were football players, some of whom were ruled ineligible retroactively from the time they had heard or yelled out answers to online test questions in, of all things, a music-appreciation course.\n\nWhen reporters sought access to the transcript of the infractions committee\u2019s hearing in Indianapolis, NCAA lawyers said the 695-page document was private. (The NCAA claimed it was entitled to keep all such records secret because of a landmark Supreme Court ruling that it had won in 1988, in NCAA v. Tarkanian, which exempted the organization from any due-process obligations because it was not a government organization.) Media outlets pressed the judge to let Florida State share its own copy of the hearing transcript, whereupon NCAA lawyers objected that the school had never actually \u201cpossessed\u201d the document; it had only seen the transcript via a defendant\u2019s guest access to the carefully restricted NCAA Web site. This claim, in turn, prompted intercession on the side of the media by Florida\u2019s attorney general, arguing that letting the NCAA use a technical loophole like this would undermine the state\u2019s sunshine law mandating open public records. After tumultuous appeals, the Florida courts agreed and ordered the NCAA transcript released in October of 2009.\n\nNews interest quickly evaporated when the sports media found nothing in the record about Coach Bowden or the canceled football victories. But the transcript revealed plenty about the NCAA. On page 37, T. K. Wetherell, the bewildered Florida State president, lamented that his university had hurt itself by cooperating with the investigation. \u201cWe self-reported this case,\u201d he said during the hearing, and he later complained that the most ingenuous athletes\u2014those who asked \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal, this happens all the time?\u201d\u2014received the harshest suspensions, while those who clammed up on the advice of lawyers went free. The music-appreciation professor was apparently never questioned. Brenda Monk, the only instructor who consistently cooperated with the investigation, appeared voluntarily to explain her work with learning-disabled athletes, only to be grilled about her credentials by Potuto in a pettifogging inquisition of remarkable stamina.\n\nIn January of last year, the NCAA\u2019s Infractions Appeals Committee sustained all the sanctions imposed on FSU except the number of vacated football victories, which it dropped, ex cathedra, from 14 to 12. The final penalty locked Bobby Bowden\u2019s official win total on retirement at 377 instead of 389, behind Joe Paterno\u2019s 401 (and counting). This carried stinging symbolism for fans, without bringing down on the NCAA the harsh repercussions it would have risked if it had issued a television ban or substantial fine.\n\nCruelly, but typically, the NCAA concentrated public censure on powerless scapegoats. A dreaded \u201cshow cause\u201d order rendered Brenda Monk, the tutor, effectively unhirable at any college in the United States. Cloaking an old-fashioned blackball in the stately language of law, the order gave notice that any school hiring Monk before a specified date in 2013 \u201cshall, pursuant to the provisions of Bylaw 19.5.2.2(l), show cause why it should not be penalized if it does not restrict the former learning specialist [Monk] from having any contact with student-athletes.\u201d Today she works as an education supervisor at a prison in Florida.\n\nTHE FLORIDA STATE verdict hardly surprised Rick Johnson, the lawyer who had represented the college pitchers Andrew Oliver and James Paxton. \u201cAll the NCAA\u2019s enforcements are random and selective,\u201d he told me, calling the organization\u2019s appeals process a travesty. (Johnson says the NCAA has never admitted to having wrongly suspended an athlete.) Johnson\u2019s scalding experience prompted him to undertake a law-review article on the subject, which in turn sent him trawling through NCAA archives. From the summary tax forms required of nonprofits, he found out that the NCAA had spent nearly $1 million chartering private jets in 2006. \u201cWhat kind of nonprofit organization leases private jets?,\u201d Johnson asks. It\u2019s hard to determine from tax returns what money goes where, but it looks as if the NCAA spent less than 1 percent of its budget on enforcement that year. Even after its plump cut for its own overhead, the NCAA dispersed huge sums to its 1,200 member schools, in the manner of a professional sports league. These annual payments are universal\u2014every college gets something\u2014but widely uneven. They keep the disparate shareholders (barely) united and speaking for all of college sports. The payments coerce unity within the structure of a private association that is unincorporated and unregulated, exercising amorphous powers not delegated by any government.\n\nSearching through the archives, Johnson came across a 1973 memo from the NCAA general counsel recommending the adoption of a due-process procedure for athletes in disciplinary cases. Without it, warned the organization\u2019s lawyer, the association risked big liability claims for deprivation of rights. His proposal went nowhere. Instead, apparently to limit costs to the universities, Walter Byers had implemented the year-by-year scholarship rule that Joseph Agnew would challenge in court 37 years later. Moreover, the NCAA\u2019s 1975 convention adopted a second recommendation \u201cto discourage legal actions against the NCAA,\u201d according to the minutes. The members voted to create Bylaw 19.7, Restitution, to intimidate college athletes in disputes with the NCAA. Johnson recognized this provision all too well, having won the temporary court judgment that the rule was illegal if not downright despotic. It made him nearly apoplectic to learn that the NCAA had deliberately drawn up the restitution rule as an obstacle to due process, contrary to the recommendation of its own lawyer. \u201cThey want to crush these kids,\u201d he says.\n\nThe NCAA, of course, has never expressed such a desire, and its public comments on due process tend to be anodyne. At a congressional hearing in 2004, the infractions-committee vice chair, Josephine Potuto, repeatedly argued that although the NCAA is \u201cnot bound by any judicial due process standards,\u201d its enforcement, infractions, and hearing procedures meet and \u201cvery likely exceed\u201d those of other public institutions. Yet when pressed, Potuto declared that athletes would have no standing for due process even if the Supreme Court had not exempted the NCAA in the 1988 Tarkanian decision. \u201cIn order to reach due-process issues as a legal Constitutional principle, the individual challenging has to have a substantive property or liberty interest,\u201d she testified. \u201cThe opportunity to play intercollegiate athletics does not rise to that level.\u201d\n\nTo translate this from the legal jargon, Potuto used a circular argument to confine college athletes beneath any right to freedom or property in their own athletic effort. They have no stake to seek their rights, she claimed, because they have no rights at stake.\n\nPotuto\u2019s assertion might be judged preposterous, an heir of the Dred Scott dictum that slaves possessed no rights a white person was bound to respect. But she was merely being honest, articulating assumptions almost everyone shares without question. Whether motivated by hostility for students (as critics like Johnson allege), or by noble and paternalistic tough love (as the NCAA professes), the denial of fundamental due process for college athletes has stood unchallenged in public discourse. Like other NCAA rules, it emanates naturally from the premise that college athletes own no interest in sports beyond exercise, character-building, and good fun. Who represents these young men and women? No one asks.\n\nThe debates and commissions about reforming college sports nibble around the edges\u2014trying to reduce corruption, to prevent the \u201ccontamination\u201d of athletes by lucre, and to maintain at least a pretense of concern for academic integrity. Everything stands on the implicit presumption that preserving amateurism is necessary for the well-being of college athletes. But while amateurism\u2014and the free labor it provides\u2014may be necessary to the preservation of the NCAA, and perhaps to the profit margins of various interested corporations and educational institutions, what if it doesn\u2019t benefit the athletes? What if it hurts them?\n\n\u201cThe Plantation Mentality\u201d\n\u201cNinety percent of the NCAA revenue is produced by 1 percent of the athletes,\u201d Sonny Vaccaro says. \u201cGo to the skill positions\u201d\u2014the stars. \u201cNinety percent African Americans.\u201d The NCAA made its money off those kids, and so did he. They were not all bad people, the NCAA officials, but they were blind, Vaccaro believes. \u201cTheir organization is a fraud.\u201d\n\nVaccaro retired from Reebok in 2007 to make a clean break for a crusade. \u201cThe kids and their parents gave me a good life,\u201d he says in his peppery staccato. \u201cI want to give something back.\u201d Call it redemption, he told me. Call it education or a good cause. \u201cHere\u2019s what I preach,\u201d said Vaccaro. \u201cThis goes beyond race, to human rights. The least educated are the most exploited. I\u2019m probably closer to the kids than anyone else, and I\u2019m 71 years old.\u201d\n\nVaccaro is officially an unpaid consultant to the plaintiffs in O\u2019Bannon v. NCAA. He connected Ed O\u2019Bannon with the attorneys who now represent him, and he talked to some of the additional co-plaintiffs who have joined the suit, among them Oscar Robertson, a basketball Hall of Famer who was incensed that the NCAA was still selling his image on playing cards 50 years after he left the University of Cincinnati.\n\nJon King, an antitrust lawyer at Hausfeld LLP in San Francisco, told me that Vaccaro \u201copened our eyes to massive revenue streams hidden in college sports.\u201d King and his colleagues have drawn on Vaccaro\u2019s vast knowledge of athletic-department finances, which include off-budget accounts for shoe contracts. Sonny Vaccaro and his wife, Pam, \u201chad a mountain of documents,\u201d he said. The outcome of the 1984 Regents decision validated an antitrust approach for O\u2019Bannon, King argues, as well as for Joseph Agnew in his continuing case against the one-year scholarship rule. Lawyers for Sam Keller\u2014a former quarterback for the University of Nebraska who is featured in video games\u2014are pursuing a parallel \u201cright of publicity\u201d track based on the First Amendment. Still other lawyers could revive Rick Johnson\u2019s case against NCAA bylaws on a larger scale, and King thinks claims for the rights of college players may be viable also under laws pertaining to contracts, employment, and civil rights.\n\nVaccaro had sought a law firm for O\u2019Bannon with pockets deep enough to withstand an expensive war of attrition, fearing that NCAA officials would fight discovery to the end. So far, though, they have been forthcoming. \u201cThe numbers are off the wall,\u201d Vaccaro says. \u201cThe public will see for the first time how all the money is distributed.\u201d\n\nVaccaro has been traveling the after-dinner circuit, proselytizing against what he sees as the NCAA\u2019s exploitation of young athletes. Late in 2008, someone who heard his stump speech at Howard University mentioned it to Michael Hausfeld, a prominent antitrust and human-rights lawyer, whose firm had won suits against Exxon for Native Alaskans and against Union Bank of Switzerland for Holocaust victims\u2019 families. Someone tracked down Vaccaro on vacation in Athens, Greece, and he flew back directly to meet Hausfeld. The shoe salesman and the white-shoe lawyer made common cause.\n\nHausfeld LLP has offices in San Francisco, Philadelphia, and London. Its headquarters are on K Street in Washington, D.C., about three blocks from the White House. When I talked with Hausfeld there not long ago, he sat in a cavernous conference room, tidy in pinstripes, hands folded on a spotless table that reflected the skyline. He spoke softly, without pause, condensing the complex fugue of antitrust litigation into simple sentences. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the basic question,\u201d he said, noting that the NCAA claims that student-athletes have no property rights in their own athletic accomplishments. Yet, in order to be eligible to play, college athletes have to waive their rights to proceeds from any sales based on their athletic performance.\n\n\u201cWhat right is it that they\u2019re waiving?,\u201d Hausfeld asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t waive something you don\u2019t have. So they had a right that they gave up in consideration to the principle of amateurism, if there be such.\u201d (At an April hearing in a U.S. District Court in California, Gregory Curtner, a representative for the NCAA, stunned O\u2019Bannon\u2019s lawyers by saying: \u201cThere is no document, there is no substance, that the NCAA ever takes from the student-athletes their rights of publicity or their rights of likeness. They are at all times owned by the student-athlete.\u201d Jon King says this is \u201clike telling someone they have the winning lottery ticket, but by the way, it can only be cashed in on Mars.\u201d The court denied for a second time an NCAA motion to dismiss the O\u2019Bannon complaint.)\n\nThe waiver clause is nestled among the paragraphs of the \u201cStudent-Athlete Statement\u201d that NCAA rules require be collected yearly from every college athlete. In signing the statement, the athletes attest that they have amateur status, that their stated SAT scores are valid, that they are willing to disclose any educational documents requested, and so forth. Already, Hausfeld said, the defendants in the Ed O\u2019Bannon case have said in court filings that college athletes thereby transferred their promotional rights forever. He paused. \u201cThat\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody assigns rights like that. Nobody can assert rights like that.\u201d He said the pattern demonstrated clear abuse by the collective power of the schools and all their conferences under the NCAA umbrella\u2014\u201ca most effective cartel.\u201d\n\nThe faux ideal of amateurism is \u201cthe elephant in the room,\u201d Hausfeld said, sending for a book. \u201cYou can\u2019t get to the bottom of our case without exposing the hypocrisy of amateurism, and Walter Byers says it eloquently.\u201d An assistant brought in Byers\u2019s memoir. It looked garish on the shiny table because dozens of pink Post-its protruded from the text. Hausfeld read to me from page 390:\n\nThe college player cannot sell his own feet (the coach does that) nor can he sell his own name (the college will do that). This is the plantation mentality resurrected and blessed by today\u2019s campus executives.\nHe looked up. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the NCAA\u2019s architect.\u201d He found a key recommendation on page 388:\n\nProsecutors and the courts, with the support of the public, should use antitrust laws to break up the collegiate cartel\u2014not just in athletics but possibly in other aspects of collegiate life as well.\nCould the book become evidence? Might the aged Byers testify? (He is now 89.) Was that part of the plaintiffs\u2019 strategy for the O\u2019Bannon trial? Hausfeld smiled faintly. \u201cI\u2019d rather the NCAA lawyers not fully understand the strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe put the spiny book away and previewed what lies ahead. The court soon would qualify his clients as a class. Then the Sherman Antitrust Act would provide for thorough discovery to break down exactly what the NCAA receives on everything from video clips to jerseys, contract by contract. \u201cAnd we want to know what they\u2019re carrying on their books as the value of their archival footage,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThey say it\u2019s a lot of money. We agree. How much?\u201d\n\nThe work will be hard, but Hausfeld said he will win in the courts, unless the NCAA folds first. \u201cWhy?\u201d Hausfeld asked rhetorically. \u201cWe know our clients are foreclosed: neither the NCAA nor its members will permit them to participate in any of that licensing revenue. Under the law, it\u2019s up to them [the defendants] to give a pro-competitive justification. They can\u2019t. End of story.\u201d\n\nIN 2010 THE third Knight Commission, complementing a previous commission\u2019s recommendation for published reports on academic progress, called for the finances of college sports to be made transparent and public\u2014television contracts, conference budgets, shoe deals, coaches\u2019 salaries, stadium bonds, everything. The recommendation was based on the worthy truism that sunlight is a proven disinfectant. But in practice, it has not been applied at all. Conferences, coaches, and other stakeholders resisted disclosure; college players still have no way of determining their value to the university.\n\n\u201cMoney surrounds college sports,\u201d says Domonique Foxworth, who is a cornerback for the NFL\u2019s Baltimore Ravens and an executive-committee member for the NFL Players Association, and played for the University of Maryland. \u201cAnd every player knows those millions are floating around only because of the 18-to-22-year-olds.\u201d Yes, he told me, even the second-string punter believes a miracle might lift him into the NFL, and why not? In all the many pages of the three voluminous Knight Commission reports, there is but one paragraph that addresses the real-life choices for college athletes. \u201cApproximately 1 percent of NCAA men\u2019s basketball players and 2 percent of NCAA football players are drafted by NBA or NFL teams,\u201d stated the 2001 report, basing its figures on a review of the previous 10 years, \u201cand just being drafted is no assurance of a successful professional career.\u201d Warning that the odds against professional athletic success are \u201castronomically high,\u201d the Knight Commission counsels college athletes to avoid a \u201crude surprise\u201d and to stick to regular studies. This is sound advice as far as it goes, but it\u2019s a bromide that pinches off discussion. Nothing in the typical college curriculum teaches a sweat-stained guard at Clemson or Purdue what his monetary value to the university is. Nothing prods students to think independently about amateurism\u2014because the universities themselves have too much invested in its preservation. Stifling thought, the universities, in league with the NCAA, have failed their own primary mission by providing an empty, cynical education on college sports.\n\nThe most basic reform would treat the students as what they are\u2014adults, with rights and reason of their own\u2014and grant them a meaningful voice in NCAA deliberations. A restoration of full citizenship to \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d would facilitate open governance, making it possible to enforce pledges of transparency in both academic standards and athletic finances. Without that, the NCAA has no effective checks and balances, no way for the students to provide informed consent regarding the way they are governed. A thousand questions lie willfully silenced because the NCAA is naturally afraid of giving \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d a true voice. Would college players be content with the augmented scholarship or allowance now requested by the National College Players Association? If a player\u2019s worth to the university is greater than the value of his scholarship (as it clearly is in some cases), should he be paid a salary? If so, would teammates in revenue sports want to be paid equally, or in salaries stratified according to talent or value on the field? What would the athletes want in Division III, where athletic budgets keep rising without scholarships or substantial sports revenue? Would athletes seek more or less variance in admissions standards? Should non-athletes also have a voice, especially where involuntary student fees support more and more of college sports? Might some schools choose to specialize, paying players only in elite leagues for football, or lacrosse? In athletic councils, how much would high-revenue athletes value a simple thank you from the tennis or field-hockey players for the newly specified subsidies to their facilities?\n\nUniversity administrators, already besieged from all sides, do not want to even think about such questions. Most cringe at the thought of bargaining with athletes as a general manager does in professional sports, with untold effects on the budgets for coaches and every other sports item. \u201cI would not want to be part of it,\u201d North Carolina Athletic Director Dick Baddour told me flatly. After 44 years at UNC, he could scarcely contemplate a world without amateur rules. \u201cWe would have to think long and hard,\u201d Baddour added gravely, \u201cabout whether this university would continue those sports at all.\u201d\n\nI, too, once reflexively recoiled at the idea of paying college athletes and treating them like employees or professionals. It feels abhorrent\u2014but for reasons having to do more with sentiment than with practicality or law. Not just fans and university presidents but judges have often found cursory, non-statutory excuses to leave amateur traditions intact. \u201cEven in the increasingly commercial modern world,\u201d said a federal-court judge in Gaines v. NCAA in 1990, \u201cthis Court believes there is still validity to the Athenian concept of a complete education derived from fostering the full growth of both mind and body.\u201d The fact that \u201cthe NCAA has not distilled amateurism to its purest form,\u201d said the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988, \u201cdoes not mean its attempts to maintain a mixture containing some amateur elements are unreasonable.\u201d\n\nBut one way or another, the smokescreen of amateurism may soon be swept away. For one thing, a victory by the plaintiffs in O\u2019Bannon\u2019s case would radically transform college sports. Colleges would likely have to either stop profiting from students or start paying them. The NCAA could also be forced to pay tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars in damages. If O\u2019Bannon and Vaccaro and company win, \u201cit will turn college sports on its ear,\u201d said Richard Lapchick, the president of the National Consortium for Academics and Sports, in a recent interview with The New York Times.\n\nThough the O\u2019Bannon case may take several years yet to reach resolution, developments on other fronts are chipping away at amateurism, and at the NCAA. This past summer, Sports Illustrated editorialized in favor of allowing college athletes to be paid by non-university sources without jeopardizing their eligibility. At a press conference last June, Steve Spurrier, the coach of the South Carolina Gamecocks football team (and the winner of the 1966 Heisman Trophy as a Florida Gator), proposed that coaches start paying players $300 a game out of their own pockets. The coaches at six other SEC schools (Alabama, Florida, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, LSU, and Tennessee) all endorsed Spurrier\u2019s proposal. And Mark Emmert, the NCAA president, recently conceded that big changes must come. \u201cThe integrity of collegiate athletics is seriously challenged today by rapidly growing pressures coming from many directions,\u201d Emmert said in July. \u201cWe have reached a point where incremental change is not sufficient to meet these challenges. I want us to act more aggressively and in a more comprehensive way than we have in the past. A few new tweaks of the rules won\u2019t get the job done.\u201d\n\nThreats to NCAA dominion also percolate in Congress. Aggrieved legislators have sponsored numerous bills. Senator Orrin Hatch, citing mistreatment of his Utah Utes, has called witnesses to discuss possible antitrust remedies for the Bowl Championship Series. Congressional committees have already held hearings critical of the NCAA\u2019s refusal to follow due process in disciplinary matters; other committees have explored a rise in football concussions. Last January, calls went up to investigate \u201cinformal\u201d football workouts at the University of Iowa just after the season-ending bowl games\u2014workouts so grueling that 41 of the 56 amateur student-athletes collapsed, and 13 were hospitalized with rhabdomyolysis, a life-threatening kidney condition often caused by excessive exercise.\n\nThe greatest threat to the viability of the NCAA may come from its member universities. Many experts believe that the churning instability within college football will drive the next major change. President Obama himself has endorsed the drumbeat cry for a national playoff in college football. This past spring, the Justice Department questioned the BCS about its adherence to antitrust standards. Jim Delany, the commissioner of the Big Ten, has estimated that a national playoff system could produce three or four times as much money as the existing bowl system does. If a significant band of football schools were to demonstrate that they could orchestrate a true national playoff, without the NCAA\u2019s assistance, the association would be terrified\u2014and with good reason. Because if the big sports colleges don\u2019t need the NCAA to administer a national playoff in football, then they don\u2019t need it to do so in basketball. In which case, they could cut out the middleman in March Madness and run the tournament themselves. Which would deprive the NCAA of close to $1 billion a year, more than 95 percent of its revenue. The organization would be reduced to a rule book without money\u2014an organization aspiring to enforce its rules but without the financial authority to enforce anything.\n\nThus the playoff dreamed of and hankered for by millions of football fans haunts the NCAA. \u201cThere will be some kind of playoff in college football, and it will not be run by the NCAA,\u201d says Todd Turner, a former athletic director in four conferences (Big East, ACC, SEC, and Pac-10). \u201cIf I\u2019m at the NCAA, I have to worry that the playoff group can get basketball to break away, too.\u201d\n\nThis danger helps explain why the NCAA steps gingerly in enforcements against powerful colleges. To alienate member colleges would be to jeopardize its own existence. Long gone are television bans and the \u201cdeath penalty\u201d sentences (commanding season-long shutdowns of offending teams) once meted out to Kentucky (1952), Southwestern Louisiana (1973), and Southern Methodist University (1987). Institutions receive mostly symbolic slaps nowadays. Real punishments fall heavily on players and on scapegoats like literacy tutors.\n\nA deeper reason explains why, in its predicament, the NCAA has no recourse to any principle or law that can justify amateurism. There is no such thing. Scholars and sportswriters yearn for grand juries to ferret out every forbidden bauble that reaches a college athlete, but the NCAA\u2019s ersatz courts can only masquerade as public authority. How could any statute impose amateur status on college athletes, or on anyone else? No legal definition of amateur exists, and any attempt to create one in enforceable law would expose its repulsive and unconstitutional nature\u2014a bill of attainder, stripping from college athletes the rights of American citizenship.\n\nFOR ALL OUR queasiness about what would happen if some athletes were to get paid, there is a successful precedent for the professionalization of an amateur sports system: the Olympics. For years, Walter Byers waged war with the NCAA\u2019s older and more powerful nemesis, the Amateur Athletic Union, which since 1894 had overseen U.S. Olympic athletes. Run in high-handed fashion, the AAU had infamously banned Jesse Owens for life in 1936\u2014weeks after his four heroic gold medals punctured the Nazi claim of Aryan supremacy\u2014because instead of using his sudden fame to tour and make money for the AAU at track meets across Europe, he came home early. In the early 1960s, the fights between the NCAA and the AAU over who should manage Olympic athletes become so bitter that President Kennedy called in General Douglas MacArthur to try to mediate a truce before the Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\nUltimately, Byers prevailed and effectively neutered the AAU. In November 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the bipartisan Amateur Sports Act. Amateurism in the Olympics soon dissolved\u2014and the world did not end. Athletes, granted a 20 percent voting stake on every Olympic sport\u2019s governing body, tipped balances in the United States and then inexorably around the world. First in marathon races, then in tennis tournaments, players soon were allowed to accept prize money and keep their Olympic eligibility. Athletes profited from sponsorships and endorsements. The International Olympic Committee expunged the word amateur from its charter in 1986. Olympic officials, who had once disdained the NCAA for offering scholarships in exchange for athletic performance, came to welcome millionaire athletes from every quarter, while the NCAA still refused to let the pro Olympian Michael Phelps swim for his college team at Michigan.\n\nThis sweeping shift left the Olympic reputation intact, and perhaps improved. Only hardened romantics mourned the amateur code. \u201cHey, come on,\u201d said Anne Audain, a track-and-field star who once held the world record for the 5,000 meters. \u201cIt\u2019s like losing your virginity. You\u2019re a little misty for awhile, but then you realize, Wow, there\u2019s a whole new world out there!\u201d\n\nWithout logic or practicality or fairness to support amateurism, the NCAA\u2019s final retreat is to sentiment. The Knight Commission endorsed its heartfelt cry that to pay college athletes would be \u201can unacceptable surrender to despair.\u201d Many of the people I spoke with while reporting this article felt the same way. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay college players,\u201d said Wade Smith, a tough criminal lawyer and former star running back at North Carolina. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to do it. We\u2019d lose something precious.\u201d\n\n\u201cScholarship athletes are already paid,\u201d declared the Knight Commission members, \u201cin the most meaningful way poss-ible: with a free education.\u201d This evasion by prominent educators severed my last reluctant, emotional tie with imposed amateurism. I found it worse than self-serving. It echoes masters who once claimed that heavenly salvation would outweigh earthly injustice to slaves. In the era when our college sports first arose, colonial powers were turning the whole world upside down to define their own interests as all-inclusive and benevolent. Just so, the NCAA calls it heinous exploitation to pay college athletes a fair portion of what they earn.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 27, "api_path": "/songs/198067", "artist_names": "Marc Lamont Hill", "full_title": "Critical Pedagogy Comes At Halftime: Nas As Black Public Intellectual [Excerpt] by\u00a0Marc\u00a0Lamont Hill", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "id": 198067, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 137667, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1604955756, "path": "/Marc-lamont-hill-critical-pedagogy-comes-at-halftime-nas-as-black-public-intellectual-excerpt-annotated", "pyongs_count": 2, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Marc-lamont-hill-critical-pedagogy-comes-at-halftime-nas-as-black-public-intellectual-excerpt-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "song_art_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 14, "hot": false, "pageviews": 5288}, "title": "Critical Pedagogy Comes At Halftime: Nas As Black Public Intellectual [Excerpt]", "title_with_featured": "Critical Pedagogy Comes At Halftime: Nas As Black Public Intellectual [Excerpt]", "updated_by_human_at": 1604955757, "url": "https://genius.com/Marc-lamont-hill-critical-pedagogy-comes-at-halftime-nas-as-black-public-intellectual-excerpt-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/57182", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "id": 57182, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Marc Lamont Hill", "slug": "Marc-lamont-hill", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Marc-lamont-hill"}, "artist": "Marc Lamont Hill", "lyrics": "Critical Pedagogy Comes At Halftime: Nas As Black Public Intellectual [Excerpt] LyricsDespite its placement in the middle of the album, \"Halftime\" in many ways represents the beginning of the Illmatic legacy. Nearly three years before Columbia Records released Illmatic, Nas made hip-hop history by stealing the show on Main Source's classic 1991 posse cut \"Live at the BBQ\" featuring Joe Fatal, Akinyele, and Large Professor. The subsequent buzz from Nas's verse (\u201cVerbal assassin, my architect pleases/When l was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus\") prompted 3rd Bass\u2019s MC Serch to recruit him for the soundtrack to Zebrahead, Anthony Drazan's low-budget race movie. (1) Nas responded with the Large Professor-produced battle track \u201cHalftime,\u201d a strong lead single on an otherwise forgettable album. Through a clever mix of braggadocio and sharp lyricism, the artist still officially known as \"Nasty Nas\" created an underground hit and a national buzz. \"Halftime\" was so well received that it was also placed on Illmatic in order to secure sales as well as please loyal underground fans. Although the musical value of \"Halftime\" is significant, it is dwarfed by the larger implications of the song and the Illmatic album within the public sphere. As Nas's first official single, \u201cHalftime\" marked a watershed moment in his career and in the cultural life of a generation, signaling Nas's first full-fledged foray into the world of black public intellectuals.\n\nThroughout the Illmatic album, Nas performs the most critical function of the public intellectual: linking a rigorous engagement with the life of the mind to an equally rigorous engagement with the public and its problems. (2) While not as pensive or contemplative as some of Illmatic's more celebrated tracks like \"One Love\" or \"Life's a Bitch,\" \"Halftime\" is in many ways a more precise representation of Nas's intellectual project. as it brings together two allegedly irreconcilable camps within the hip-hop community: \u201cconscious\u201d and \"commercial.\" Although these terms are wholly artificial and insufficient for understanding the complexities of artistic identity, they serve as useful tools for understanding the current division of labor within hip-hop's cultural landscape.\n\nWithin hip-hop culture. the terms \"conscious\" and \"commercial\"\u2014as well as others like \"political\" and \"mainstream\"\u2014 are assigned to rappers in ways that divide them into discrete categories. Through these terms, artists develop public identities that shape the ways they are understood and engaged by various audiences. In addition to prefiguring artist-audience relationships, such divisions are often based on superficial criteria. For example, despite the relatively apolitical nature of their work, groups like The Roots and A Tribe Called Quest are hastily branded \"conscious\" or \"political\" because of their avant-garde music and aesthetics. On the contrary, the political critiques and philanthropy of \"mainstream\" rappers like Jay-Z and Ice Cube are often overlooked or dismissed. Within this superficial framework, hip-hop political consciousness is reduced to a thin politics of fashion and speech that privileges bourgeois bohemianism over engaged social critique and concrete action.\n\nThe construction of a conscious/commercial divide also undermines a sophisticated and evenhanded analysis of all hip-hop artists. Too often, commercial figures like Jay-Z and Ice Cube are classified as mere rappers who are only worthy of critical attention in order to expose the troubling dimensions of their music. On the other hand, \"conscious\" rappers like Talib Kweli and Mos Def are romantically viewed as legitimate cultural workers whose work should be analyzed based on artistic merit. Such distinctions are highly problematic, however, as they obscure the complexities and contradictions that operate within every artist's body of work. For example, Jay-Z has written songs that critique the American invasion of Iraq (\u201cBeware of the Boys\"), post-9/11 race relations (\"Ballad for the Fallen Soldier\"), and the nation\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina (\u201cMinority Report\"); in his solo and group projects, Ice Cube has consistently critiqued police brutality (\u201cFuck Da Police\"), black Christianity (\"Heaven\"), and white supremacy (\u201cThe Nigga Trapp\"). Talib Kweli and Mos Def, on the other hand, have both appeared on songs that deploy homophobic language (\u201cREDEFinition,\" \u201cThe Rape Over\"). By ignoring such work or dismissing it as the exception to an otherwise useful rule, we squander valuable opportunities to enrich our understanding of hip-hop identities, as well as the forces that help constitute them.\n\nNo hip-hop artist better spotlights the poverty of the conscious/commercial divide than Nas, whose refusal to fit neatly into either category provides the basis for his artistic identity. (3) Unlike most rappers, Nas has a thoroughly equivocal relationship to both the commercial and conscious sectors of hip-hop culture. Despite his commercial leanings, Nas openly moves between each space in ways that defy the dominant logic and practices of hip-hop. As opposed to his counterparts, Nas\u2019s movement between the conscious and commercial realms is not understood as a momentary departure from his \"true\" artistic self, such as when hard-core rapper Jadakiss released the politically charged single \u201cWhy.\u201d Instead, Nas is viewed by fans and critics as the rare artist who can traverse the boundaries of each territory with equal skill. This artistic ambidexterity is acknowledged by Nas himself on songs like Kanye West\u2019s \"We Major,\" where he uses a guest verse to deliberate about whether to write a verse about \u201c44s or Black Christ,\" \u201cbig paper or the Black man's plight.\u201d This type of public rumination, which occurs on a track with Kanye West, whose artistic identity also embodies this tension, combined with his conclusion that \"both flows would be nice,\" demonstrates Nas's intentionality and comprehension of his position.\n\nDespite the public's recognition of Nas's modus operandi, many view his fluid artistic identity as a shortcoming rather than a virtue. This discomfort with Nas surfaced during his well-publicized feud with Jay-Z, who pointed out Nas's alleged contradictions in his 2002 title track \u201cBlueprint 2\":\n\"You can't give cred to anything dude said\nSame dude give you ice and you owe him some head . ..\nIs it \"Oochie Wally Wally\" or is it \"One Mic\u201c?\nIs it \"Black Girl Lost\" or Shonie owe you for ice?\" (4)\n\nLike many hip-hop observers, Jay-Z viewed Nas's penchant for releasing radio-friendly songs like \u201cOochie Wally Wally\" and \"You Owe Me\" as directly contradictory to the content of his socially conscious songs like \u201cOne Mic\" and \"Black Girl Lost.\" Jay-Z's critique of the moral and ideological contradictions within Nas's music is accurate, particularly with regard to the consumerist and misogynistic impulses that animate his commercial releases. Still, Jay-Z's comments also reflect a deep suspicion of Nas's authenticity as a conscious artist based on his location within the commercial marketplace.\n\nSuspicions regarding artistic authenticity are animated by a belief that \u201creal\u201d art cannot exist in the capitalist marketplace. As a result, artists who move from the margins to the center of the commercial sphere are often viewed as \u201csellouts\u201d whose work no longer honors the spirit of the craft. While this claim is true in certain cases \u2014 such as the underground-turned-pop group Black Eye Peas, for whom such a choice was deliberate and unabashed \u2014 it cannot be held as a universal truth claim about commercially successful artists. Conversely, it is equally problematic to view commercial marginality (i.e., lack of sales) as an index of artistic integrity or quality. Such an approach is deeply problematic, as it overestimates the extent to which artists choose not to operate within mainstream circles, and it romanticizes the underground as a space untouched by the same corporate capitalist forces as mainstream spheres. An excellent example of this reality is the rap group The Roots, who are often viewed by critics and fans as exemplars of authentic and untampered artistry. Despite their reputation for self-imposed marginality within the hip-hop community, the group has written multiple singles (e.g., \u201cYou Got Me,\" \"Break You Off\") expressly aimed at mainstream radio audiences and mass sales. Additionally, the group's label, Def Jam, is owned by Universal Music Group, which has more than a 25 percent market share in the music industry. As such, the group not only willfully operates squarely within the capitalist marketplace but helps promote and finance pop acts (like Black Eye Peas) that are also under the Universal Music Group umbrella. This is not to suggest that The Roots are less authentic than popularly imagined, but that any sophisticated notion of authenticity must consider the ways in which artistic identities are crafted in relation to pervasive forces of global capitalism.\n\nIn classifying Nas as an intellectual, we must reconsider the possible sites where intellectual work occurs. In the case of Nas, it becomes necessary to look beyond formal locations such as universities, think tanks, and literary circles, and look to the highly contested domain of hip-hop culture. While many critics and scholars have argued the intellectual merit of hip-hop culture and its practitioners (in many ways this has been the unifying thread of contemporary hip-hop studies), much of their work has relied on a narrow conception of hip-hop that distinguishes it from rap. Within this limited and limiting framework, debates about Nas as an intellectual can only be resolved after first determining where he fits along a hip-hop/rap continuum that is often used to evaluate hip-hop artists. This framework enables fans, artists, and critics to mimic the elitist postures of earlier European traditions by creating high/low distinctions within the culture. (5) Through these distinctions, \u201crap\u201d (low culture) becomes shorthand for the most problematic aspects of hip-hop culture (commercialism, sexism, violence, etc.) and \u201chip-hop\" (high culture) is represented as a space for genuine artistry and political consciousness. These divisions also facilitate the cooptation of black art by corporate interests and parasitic (read: white) cultural forces through all too familiar divide-and-conquer tactics. An excellent example of this is the growing overrepresentation of suburban and bohemian whites within the conscious fan base, as reflected in retail consumption and concert attendance. As in the case of jazz, such trends allow ostensibly highbrow hip-hop to be dislocated from its original cultural homes and appropriated by whites and bourgeois intellectuals. Additionally, these high/low distinctions prevent us from recognizing the intellectual merit of ordinary people and popular culture.\n\nThe dilemma Nas confronts is not peculiar to him or to other black cultural workers who initially gain popularity with the general public. Those who are intellectuals by profession (i.e., professors and researchers) but begin to encroach upon the popular territory typically reserved for actors, athletes, and politicians are equally derided for their activities inside and outside of academe. Figures like Michael Eric Dyson and Cornel West, two of the most visible and influential black public intellectuals of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, are met with great skepticism from those outside of the academy who question the authenticity of their organic links to community, as well as from their academic colleagues for departing from traditionally narrow and technocratic standards of academic productivity and rigor. (6) An example of the academy's intolerance with black intellectuals came in the spring of 2002, when Cornel West became embroiled in a public feud with Harvard University president Larry Summers over West's public intellectual activities, particularly his involvement with the 2004 Al Sharpton presidential campaign, appearance in the latter two Matrix films, and release of a spoken-word poetry (not hip-hop!) album. (7) Summers argued that such activities were unbefitting a Harvard University professor, and that West should focus exclusively on writing peer-refereed publications.\n\nSimiliar to Nas, intellectuals like Dyson and West are victims of a vicious turf war, which demands that one choose between the academy and the outside world. The stakes of this war are grounded in the assumption that \"real\" intellectual activity is naturally incompatible with popular culture. In short, intellectuals cannot be celebrities and celebrities cannot be intellectuals. Analogous to the artificial conscious/commercial divide within hip-hop culture, this Manichean stance is underpinned by Western capitalism\u2019s emphasis on specialization over versatility, narrowness over proteanism. Within the logic of this purist ethic, academic work (as well as the academic herself) is compromised by an engagement with real-world problems. Again, like the conscious/commercial binary, such a belief obscures the ways in which the academy's walls are inevitably porous, infiltrated by myriad political agendas, ideological commitments, and relations of capital that constitute its very existence. (8)\n\nThis shortsighted stance was exemplified in 2002 when neoconservative scholars John Patrick Diggins, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Hilton Kramer, and lrving Kristol threatened to boycott an academic conference on Sidney Hook after being notified that Cornel West was added to the list of participants. When questioned, Diggins responded that he was \u201cconcerned about whether [West] has any point of in matters of philosophy.\" He also added that \"one would have to read at least 20 of [Hook's] books. Cornel West is such a celebrity intellectual, I don't think he'll have time for it.\" (9) In addition to evincing the racist paternalism that governs collegial relations with many black intellectuals, Diggins's comment speaks to a pervasive sense that an intellectual cannot \u201creturn home\" after entering the realm of popular culture. Despite being perfectly qualified to speak on Sidney Hook\u2014in addition to being the only trained philosopher on the panel\u2014in his book American Evasion of Philosophy West provides a substantive, critically lauded treatment of Hook\u2019s work\u2014West\u2018s status as a public intellectual was viewed as a professional demerit that denied him access to the very spaces that he was accused of abandoning.\n\nThe punitive treatment black intellectuals receive for functioning outside of the ivory tower is not only an outgrowth of narrow-minded romanticism, which can be excused as misguided idealism or naivete, but also a tradition of repressing particular strands of intellectual activism. It is within this tradition that Cornel West\u2019s public support of Al Sharpton, Edward Said\u2019s demands for an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine, and Noam Chomsky's critiques of American imperialism are treated as extracurricular and inappropriate while the pro-conservative activities of public intellectuals like Alan Dershowitz, John McWhorter, or Diane Ravitch are excused or critiqued solely on the basis of ideas. This disparity in treatment speaks to the ways in which intellectuals who work in the interest of black and brown communities are policed in an effort to transform them into \u201ccoopted progressives\" rather than \"intellectuals in exile\" who are in the academy but not of it.\n\nAmong progressive scholars, a narrow view of the life of the mind is also informed by an outmoded conception of the public intellectual that does not adequately consider the potential of popular culture as a legitimate site for transformative intellectual work. For example, Michael Eric Dyson's immediate and effective rejoinder to Bill Cosby\u2019s neoconservative critiques of the black poor beginning with his 2004 \u201cpound cake\" speech was largely linked to his ability to operate within the same spaces that Cosby used to offer his commentary. Rather than merely responding within left-wing academic circles (which generally held Cosby's critiques to be facile, stale, and uninteresting except to the extent that they were linked to his celebrity status), Dyson occupied the same public venues that Cosby used to preach his hostile gospel of individual responsibility. By appearing on national television shows ranging from Nightline to Rap City and writing his best-selling book Is Bill Cosby Right? Or Has The Black Man Lost Its Mind? Dyson was able to leverage his fame and media access in ways that countervailed Cosby's dangerous rhetoric.\n\nWhile these examples demonstrate the dangers of prima facie rejections of public intellectual work, it is equally important not to ignore potential pitfalls. For Nas as well as traditional academics, access to mainstream audiences can become an end in itself, transforming them into celebrity rather than public intellectuals. Instead of functioning as an engaged cultural worker. the black intellectual is then reduced to, at best, a glib and detached cultural critic or, at worst, a politically promiscuous spokesperson for an imaginary constituency. As the work of Nas (as well as Dyson and West) suggests, however, such outcomes are not inevitable. Instead, the conditions of public prominence can be manipulated in ways that yield concrete benefits for the people represented by public intellectuals.\n\nFor both Nas and traditional academics, it is the relationship between the popular and the political that constitutes both the form and content of black public intellectual work. In his essay on Nigerian political musician Fela Kuti, Mark Anthony Neal introduces the term \"celebrity Gramiscian\" in order to (post)modernize Gramsci's conception of organic intellectuals as the \u201cthinking and organizing element of a particular fundamental social class.\" As Neal argues, it is necessary to expand our definition in order to account for those organic intellectuals who utilize their fame in order to further a particular political agenda. The notion of the celebrity Gramscian is extremely important for understanding the black public intellectual.\n\nAlthough Neal accurately cites explicitly political (or at least politicized) hip-hop figures like Talib Kweli, Common, and Mos Def as examples of celebrity Gramscians, these artists are hampered by the mass public's general ambivalence or unawareness in relation to their music. Despite receiving sustained critical acclaim for their albums, none of the artists have attained platinum sales (the contemporary benchmark for mainstream hip-hop success) for their efforts, which, along with limited radio airplay and smaller concert venues, has undermined their ability to reach mass audiences through their music. Also, despite the \"raced\" nature of their music\u2014all of the artists openly draw from black musical traditions and openly write their music for black audiences\u2014the primary consumers of their live and recorded music are not African American. On the contrary, Nas's consistent platinum sales and largely urban black fan base are a testament both to his ability to successfully move across the commercial and conscious worlds and to his efficacy as a celebrity Gramscian.\nAs Grant Farred argues in his book What's My Name, the nexus between the popular and the political within black intellectual spaces is linked to the vernacular tradition.\" Through this tradition, which is rooted in an engagement with the popular. we are able to understand how a wide range of figures engage in intellectual activity. For Farred, Bob Marley's music, Muhammad Ali's \"trash talking,\" Stuart Hall's theory, and CLR James's writing, despite their disparate ideologies and vocational locations, can all be seen as legitimate intellectual production that operates in the interests of their respective communities. With regard to Nas, the site of intellectual labor is rap music, which is steeped in the hip~hop vernacular traditions of storytelling and signifyin'. Through his music, Nas engages in rigorous intellection in the form of cultural criticism and public pedagogy.\n\nLike other black public intellectuals, Nas uses the public sphere as a space for critically engaging pressing social issues of the day. While Nas's cultural critiques are often conveyed through explicitly political songs like \u201cI Want to Talk to You\u201d and \"New World,\" such commentaries have typically failed to garner critical approval or commercial attention. On the contrary, Nas\u2019s most successful work has emerged more comfortably through the practice of lyrical storytelling. Through his lyrical representations, Nas functions as an informal ethnographer by consistently offering an on-the-ground counternarrative of day-to-day ghetto life.\n\nUnlike intellectuals who operate within traditional academic spaces, Nas faces a unique burden of authenticity when engaging in his storytelling practices. In addition to personal stories, Nas's music also includes third-person narratives and autobiographical fiction. Although these are common Western literary devices, they conflict with hip-hop's authenticity fetish, which demands that artists \u201ckeep it real,\" or rap exclusively about personal experience. Within this context. to be \"real\" is to participate in particular practices (violence, drug use. etc.) or to have access to specific experiences (poverty, absentee parenting, etc.) that have become normalized within the hip-hop context. As such, Nas's stories must also withstand intense biographical scrutiny in order to qualify as legitimate. Jay-Z's critiques from the diss record \"The Takeover,\" where he accuses Nas of merely witnessing the ghetto as a spectator rather than \"really living it,\" reflect this sensibility.\u201c While Jay-Z\u2019s allegations, which allude to Nas's vivid lllmatic narratives (he later references the \"Tec on the dresser\" from \"Represent\"), are intended to expose Nas for his alleged lack of authenticity, they also speak to Nas's uncanny ability to accurately represent his surroundings.\n\nSince Nas functions as a black public intellectual, the value of his lyrical narratives cannot be reduced to their coherence with narrow and arbitrary standards of authenticity, but on their ability to relocate previously overlooked stories from the margins to the center of public consciousness. For example, Nas makes a reference in \u201cHalftime\u201d to the \u201cfoul cop that shot Garcia.\" While Nas's lyrics suggest a level of intimacy with the situation that (if we are to believe Jay-Z) he uses to deliberately overstate his ghetto affiliations, the truth of Nas's story is subordinate to its political potential. in fact, an obsession with the \"realness\" of the narratives (i.e. if Garcia actually existed, whether or not Nas knew him, and if a cop actually shot him) is counterproductive, as it directs attention away from Nas's implicit claims about police brutality as a common feature of urban life.\n\nSkepticism about the stories of the relatively powerless is not restricted to hip-hop culture, as many academics, politicians, and everyday citizens remain wary of individual stories out of deference to dominant (often called \"generalizable,\" \"scientific,\" or \u201cobjective\") narratives about the world. In the ease of the aforementioned reference to Nas and police brutality, many critics would argue that Nas's individual experiences are atypical and therefore cannot be used to refute accepted claims about the day-to-day practices of police in urban spaces. It is, however, the matter-of-fact manner in which Nas references police brutality (he devotes only one line to the event and does nothing to suggest that it was unusual) that underscores its commonness. By presenting police officers as routinely and unsurprisingly violent, Nas is able to offer an important counter-narrative to the dominant belief that in urban America police are agents of order and justice, rather than terror and repression.\n\nLike many hip\u2014hop artists. Nas's stories are rooted in what Murray Forman calls the \u201cextreme local,\" which refers to hip-hop culture's focus on specific cities, neighborhoods. area codes, and housing projects. It is through the extreme local that Nas is able to spotlight and humanize ghetto suffering by appending names and faces to otherwise distant and abstract narratives about urban ghettos. Queens, New York, and more specifically the Queensbridge housing projects, is the primary setting for Nas's stories. This narrative commitment to the extreme local is immediately demonstrated in the first verse of \"Halftime,\" where Nas \u201cshouts out\" (verbally acknowledges) the \u201cforty side\" as \u201cthe place that has given me grace.\u201d By locating himself within his neighborhood, Nas is able to engage in what Michael Eric Dyson calls \"Africeture,\" or the practice of people of African descent writing themselves into existence.\u201c In this case. the residents of Queens and its surrounding area are given narrative life through Nas's rhetorical gestures. The connection between \"Africeture\" and the \"extreme local\" is critical for understanding Nas's vocation as a black public intellectual. By placing the lives and experiences of particular communities within the public sphere vis-a-vis his storytelling practices, Nas is able to account for people who historically have been rendered anonymous. Through this act, Nas crafts a new counter-narrative of black existence for his generation.\n\nDespite growing scholarly discussion of the role and function of modern black public intellectuals, little direct attention has been paid to the pedagogical dimensions of their work. As critical educators have argued, pedagogy, the practice of teaching and learning, is not exclusively or even primarily confined to formal schooling or official subjects such as English or mathematics. Instead, the entire social world serves as a classroom in which particular beliefs, values, identities, and stories are sanctioned at the expense of others. Through this broader understanding of education and pedagogy, we are able to understand how public intellectuals function outside of the classroom as public educators for their respective constituencies. There is hardly a better example than Nas, whose work reflects the particular importance of \u201cpublic pedagogy\" for black communities, as well as the unique role of hip-hop artists in articulating and informing public discourse.\n\nDue in large part to the persistence of structures, both legal and de facto, that have limited or completely obstructed their access to quality formal education since slavery, black people have often looked outside of schools for learning. In addition, those who have had the benefit of formal schooling often depend on out-of-school educations in order to earn a \u201cdual degree,\" or a supplemental education designed to ward off the disingenuous, disempowering, and dehumanizing aspects of the official school curriculum. The sites for black public pedagogy have been various counterpublic spaces such as churches and mosques, barbershops. and black bookstores. Within these locations, black people have been able to share alternate forms of knowledge and affirm their fundamental humanity within relatively safe and supportive communities.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/4447919", "artist_names": "Rare Breed Entertainment (Ft.

Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, J., joined, and in which Souter and Ginsburg, JJ., joined as to Part IA, post, p. 655.\n\n*601Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.In these cases we consider the constitutionality of 42 U. S. C.  13981, which provides a federal civil remedy for the *602 victims of gender-motivated violence. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, struck down  13981 because it concluded that Congress lacked constitutional authority to enact the section's civil remedy. Believing that these cases are controlled by our decisions in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629 (1883), and the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883), we affirm.IPetitioner Christy Brzonkala enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech) in the fall of 1994. In September of that year, Brzonkala met respondents Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, who were both students at Virginia Tech and members of its varsity football team. Brzonkala alleges that, within 30 minutes of meeting Morrison and Crawford, they assaulted and repeatedly raped her. After the attack, Morrison allegedly told Brzonkala, \"You better not have any . . . diseases.\" Complaint  22. In the months following the rape, Morrison also allegedly announced in the dormitory's dining room that he \"like[d] to get girls drunk and . . . .\" Id.,  31. The omitted portions, quoted verbatim in the briefs on file with this Court, consist of boasting, debased remarks about what Morrison would do to women, vulgar remarks that cannot fail to shock and offend.\n\nBrzonkala alleges that this attack caused her to become severely emotionally disturbed and depressed. She sought assistance from a university psychiatrist, who prescribed *603 antidepressant medication. Shortly after the rape Brzonkala stopped attending classes and withdrew from the university.\nIn early 1995, Brzonkala filed a complaint against respondents under Virginia Tech's Sexual Assault Policy. During the school-conducted hearing on her complaint, Morrison admitted having sexual contact with her despite the fact that she had twice told him \"no.\" After the hearing, Virginia Tech's Judicial Committee found insufficient evidence to punish Crawford, but found Morrison guilty of sexual assault and sentenced him to immediate suspension for two semesters.\n\nVirginia Tech's dean of students upheld the judicial committee's sentence. However, in July 1995, Virginia Tech informed Brzonkala that Morrison intended to initiate a court challenge to his conviction under the Sexual Assault Policy. University officials told her that a second hearing would be necessary to remedy the school's error in prosecuting her complaint under that policy, which had not been widely circulated to students. The university therefore conducted a second hearing under its Abusive Conduct Policy, which was in force prior to the dissemination of the Sexual Assault Policy. Following this second hearing the Judicial Committee again found Morrison guilty and sentenced him to an identical 2-semester suspension. This time, however, the description of Morrison's offense was, without explanation, changed from \"sexual assault\" to \"using abusive language.\"\n\nMorrison appealed his second conviction through the university's administrative system. On August 21, 1995, Virginia Tech's senior vice president and provost set aside Morrison's punishment. She concluded that it was \"`excessive when compared with other cases where there has been a finding of violation of the Abusive Conduct Policy,' \" Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ., 132 F. 3d 950, 955 (CA4 1997). Virginia Tech did not inform Brzonkala of this decision. After learning from a *604 newspaper that Morrison would be returning to Virginia Tech for the fall 1995 semester, she dropped out of the university.\n\nIn December 1995, Brzonkala sued Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Her complaint alleged that Morrison's and Crawford's attack violated  13981 and that Virginia Tech's handling of her complaint violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373-375, 20 U. S. C.  1681-1688. Morrison and Crawford moved to dismiss this complaint on the grounds that it failed to state a claim and that  13981's civil remedy is unconstitutional. The United States, petitioner in No. 99-5, intervened to defend  13981's constitutionality.\n\nThe District Court dismissed Brzonkala's Title IX claims against Virginia Tech for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic and State Univ., 935 F. Supp. 772 (WD Va. 1996). It then held that Brzonkala's complaint stated a claim against Morrison and Crawford under  13981, but dismissed the complaint because it concluded that Congress lacked authority to enact the section under either the Commerce Clause or  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic and State Univ., 935 F. Supp. 779 (WD Va. 1996).\n\nA divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, reinstating Brzonkala's  13981 claim and her Title IX hostile environment claim.[1]Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic and State Univ., 132 F. 3d 949 (CA4 1997). The full Court of Appeals vacated the panel's opinion and reheard the case en banc. The en banc court then issued an opinion affirming the District Court's conclusion that Brzonkala stated a claim under  13981 because her complaint alleged a crime of violence and the allegations of Morrison's crude and derogatory statements regarding his *605 treatment of women sufficiently indicated that his crime was motivated by gender animus.[2] Nevertheless, the court by a divided vote affirmed the District Court's conclusion that Congress lacked constitutional authority to enact  13981's civil remedy. Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic and State Univ., 169 F. 3d 820 (CA4 1999). Because the Court of Appeals invalidated a federal statute on constitutional grounds, we granted certiorari. 527 U. S. 1068 (1999).\n\nSection 13981 was part of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994,  40302, 108 Stat. 1941-1942. It states that \"[a]ll persons within the United States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender.\" 42 U. S. C.  13981(b). To enforce that right, subsection (c) declares:\"A person (including a person who acts under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State) who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.\"Section 13981 defines a \"crim[e] of violence motivated by gender\" as \"a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an *606 animus based on the victim's gender.\"  13981(d)(1). It also provides that the term \"crime of violence\" includes any\"(A) . . . act or series of acts that would constitute a felony against the person or that would constitute a felony against property if the conduct presents a serious risk of physical injury to another, and that would come within the meaning of State or Federal offenses described in section 16 of Title 18, whether or not those acts have actually resulted in criminal charges, prosecution, or conviction and whether or not those acts were committed in the special maritime, territorial, or prison jurisdiction of the United States; and \"(B) includes an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony described in subparagraph (A) but for the relationship between the person who takes such action and the individual against whom such action is taken.\"  13981(d)(2).Further clarifying the broad scope of  13981's civil remedy, subsection (e)(2) states that \"[n]othing in this section requires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution, or conviction to establish the elements of a cause of action under subsection (c) of this section.\" And subsection (e)(3) provides a  13981 litigant with a choice of forums: Federal and state courts \"shall have concurrent jurisdiction\" over complaints brought under the section.\n\nAlthough the foregoing language of  13981 covers a wide swath of criminal conduct, Congress placed some limitations on the section's federal civil remedy. Subsection (e)(1) states that \"[n]othing in this section entitles a person to a cause of action under subsection (c) of this section for random acts of violence unrelated to gender or for acts that cannot be demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, to be motivated by gender.\" Subsection (e)(4) further states that  13981 shall not be construed \"to confer on the courts of the United States jurisdiction over any State law claim seeking *607 the establishment of a divorce, alimony, equitable distribution of marital property, or child custody decree.\"\n\nEvery law enacted by Congress must be based on one or more of its powers enumerated in the Constitution. \"The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written.\" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.). Congress explicitly identified the sources of federal authority on which it relied in enacting  13981. It said that a \"Federal civil rights cause of action\" is established \"[p]ursuant to the affirmative power of Congress . . . under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, as well as under section 8 of Article I of the Constitution.\" 42 U. S. C.  13981(a). We address Congress' authority to enact this remedy under each of these constitutional provisions in turn.IIDue respect for the decisions of a coordinate branch of Government demands that we invalidate a congressional enactment only upon a plain showing that Congress has exceeded its constitutional bounds. See United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 568, 577-578 (Kennedy, J., concurring); United States v. Harris, 106 U. S., at 635. With this presumption of constitutionality in mind, we turn to the question whether  13981 falls within Congress' power under Article I,  8, of the Constitution. Brzonkala and the United States rely upon the third clause of the section, which gives Congress power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\"\n\nAs we discussed at length in Lopez, our interpretation of the Commerce Clause has changed as our Nation has developed. See 514 U. S., at 552-557; id., at 568-574 (Kennedy, J., concurring); id., at 584, 593-599 (Thomas, J., concurring). We need not repeat that detailed review of *608 the Commerce Clause's history here; it suffices to say that, in the years since NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.,  301 U. S. 1 (1937), Congress has had considerably greater latitude in regulating conduct and transactions under the Commerce Clause than our previous case law permitted. See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 555-556; id., at 573-574 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\nLopez emphasized, however, that even under our modern, expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause, Congress' regulatory authority is not without effective bounds. Id., at 557.\"[E]ven [our] modern-era precedents which have expanded congressional power under the Commerce Clause confirm that this power is subject to outer limits. In Jones & Laughlin Steel, the Court warned that the scope of the interstate commerce power `must be considered in the light of our dual system of government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace them, in view of our complex society, would effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized government.' \" Id., at 556-557 (quoting Jones & Laughlin Steel, supra, at 37).[3]As we observed in Lopez, modern Commerce Clause jurisprudence has \"identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power.\" *609 514 U. S., at 558 (citing Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276-277 (1981); Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 150 (1971)). \"First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.\" 514 U. S., at 558 (citing Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 256 (1964); United States  v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 114 (1941)). \"Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.\" 514 U. S., at 558 (citing Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342 (1914); Southern R. Co. v. United States,  222 U. S. 20 (1911); Perez, supra, at 150). \"Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, . . . i. e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\" 514 U. S., at 558-559 (citing Jones & Laughlin Steel, supra, at 37).\n\nPetitioners do not contend that these cases fall within either of the first two of these categories of Commerce Clause regulation. They seek to sustain  13981 as a regulation of activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. Given  13981's focus on gender-motivated violence wherever it occurs (rather than violence directed at the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, interstate markets, or things or persons in interstate commerce), we agree that this is the proper inquiry.\n\nSince Lopez most recently canvassed and clarified our case law governing this third category of Commerce Clause regulation, it provides the proper framework for conducting the required analysis of  13981. In Lopez, we held that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, 18 U. S. C.  922(q)(1)(A), which made it a federal crime to knowingly possess a firearm in a school zone, exceeded Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause. See 514 U. S., at 551. Several significant considerations contributed to our decision.\n*610 First, we observed that  922(q) was \"a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with `commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.\" Id., at 561. Reviewing our case law, we noted that \"we have upheld a wide variety of congressional Acts regulating intrastate economic activity where we have concluded that the activity substantially affected interstate commerce.\" Id., at 559. Although we cited only a few examples, including Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942); Hodel, supra; Perez, supra; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964); and Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, we stated that the pattern of analysis is clear. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 559-560. \"Where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sustained.\" Id., at 560.\n\nBoth petitioners and Justice Souter's dissent downplay the role that the economic nature of the regulated activity plays in our Commerce Clause analysis. But a fair reading of Lopez shows that the noneconomic, criminal nature of the conduct at issue was central to our decision in that case. See, e. g., id., at 551 (\"The Act [does not] regulat[e] a commercial activity\"), 560 (\"Even Wickard, which is perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity, involved economic activity in a way that the possession of a gun in a school zone does not\"), 561 (\"Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity\"), 566 (\"Admittedly, a determination whether an intrastate activity is commercial or noncommercial may in some cases result in legal uncertainty. But, so long as Congress' authority is limited to those powers enumerated in the Constitution, and so long as those enumerated powers are interpreted as having judicially enforceable outer limits, congressional legislation under the Commerce Clause always will engender `legal uncertainty' \"), 567 (\"The possession of a gun in a local school zone is in no sense an economic activity that might, through repetition *611 elsewhere, substantially affect any sort of interstate commerce\"); see also id., at 573-574 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (stating that Lopez did not alter our \"practical conception of commercial regulation\" and that Congress may \"regulate in the commercial sphere on the assumption that we have a single market and a unified purpose to build a stable national economy\"), 577 (\"Were the Federal Government to take over the regulation of entire areas of traditional state concern, areas having nothing to do with the regulation of commercial activities, the boundaries between the spheres of federal and state authority would blur\"), 580 (\"[U]nlike the earlier cases to come before the Court here neither the actors nor their conduct has a commercial character, and neither the purposes nor the design of the statute has an evident commercial nexus. The statute makes the simple possession of a gun within 1,000 feet of the grounds of the school a criminal offense. In a sense any conduct in this interdependent world of ours has an ultimate commercial origin or consequence, but we have not yet said the commerce power may reach so far\" (citation omitted)). Lopez `s review of Commerce Clause case law demonstrates that in those cases where we have sustained federal regulation of intrastate activity based upon the activity's substantial effects on interstate commerce, the activity in question has been some sort of economic endeavor. See id., at 559-560.[4]\n\nThe second consideration that we found important in analyzing  922(q) was that the statute contained \"no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have *612 an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.\" Id., at 562. Such a jurisdictional element may establish that the enactment is in pursuance of Congress' regulation of interstate commerce.\n\nThird, we noted that neither  922(q) \"`nor its legislative history contain[s] express congressional findings regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a school zone.' \" Ibid. (quoting Brief for United States, O. T. 1994, No. 93-1260, pp. 5-6). While \"Congress normally is not required to make formal findings as to the substantial burdens that an activity has on interstate commerce,\" 514 U. S., at 562 (citing McClung, supra, at 304; Perez, 402 U. S., at 156), the existence of such findings may \"enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affect[s] interstate commerce, even though no such substantial effect [is] visible to the naked eye.\" 514 U. S., at 563.\n\nFinally, our decision in Lopez rested in part on the fact that the link between gun possession and a substantial effect on interstate commerce was attenuated. Id., at 563-567. The United States argued that the possession of guns may lead to violent crime, and that violent crime \"can be expected to affect the functioning of the national economy in two ways. First, the costs of violent crime are substantial, and, through the mechanism of insurance, those costs are spread throughout the population. Second, violent crime reduces the willingness of individuals to travel to areas within the country that are perceived to be unsafe.\" Id.,  at 563-564 (citation omitted). The Government also argued that the presence of guns at schools poses a threat to the educational process, which in turn threatens to produce a less efficient and productive work force, which will negatively affect national productivity and thus interstate commerce. Ibid.\n\nWe rejected these \"costs of crime\" and \"national productivity\" arguments because they would permit Congress *613 to \"regulate not only all violent crime, but all activities that might lead to violent crime, regardless of how tenuously they relate to interstate commerce.\" Id., at 564. We noted that, under this but-for reasoning:\"Congress could regulate any activity that it found was related to the economic productivity of individual citizens: family law (including marriage, divorce, and child custody), for example. Under the[se] theories . . . , it is difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign. Thus, if we were to accept the Government's arguments, we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to regulate.\" Ibid. With these principles underlying our Commerce Clause jurisprudence as reference points, the proper resolution of the present cases is clear. Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity. While we need not adopt a categorical rule against aggregating the effects of any noneconomic activity in order to decide these cases, thus far in our Nation's history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is economic in nature. See, e. g., id., at 559-560, and the cases cited therein.\n\nLike the Gun-Free School Zones Act at issue in Lopez,   13981 contains no jurisdictional element establishing that the federal cause of action is in pursuance of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce. Although Lopez makes clear that such a jurisdictional element would lend support to the argument that  13981 is sufficiently tied to interstate commerce, Congress elected to cast  13981's remedy over a wider, and more purely intrastate, body of violent crime.[5]\n*614 In contrast with the lack of congressional findings that we faced in Lopez,  13981 is supported by numerous findings regarding the serious impact that gender-motivated violence has on victims and their families. See, e. g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, p. 385 (1994); S. Rep. No. 103-138, p. 40 (1993); S. Rep. No. 101-545, p. 33 (1990). But the existence of congressional findings is not sufficient, by itself, to sustain the constitutionality of Commerce Clause legislation. As we stated in Lopez, \"`[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily make it so.' \" 514 U. S., at 557, n. 2 (quoting Hodel, 452 U. S., at 311 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment)). Rather, \"`[w]hether particular operations affect interstate commerce sufficiently to come under the constitutional power of Congress to regulate them is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question, and can be settled finally only by this Court.' \" 514 U. S., at 557, n. 2 (quoting Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U. S., at 273 (Black, J., concurring)).\n\n*615 In these cases, Congress' findings are substantially weakened by the fact that they rely so heavily on a method of reasoning that we have already rejected as unworkable if we are to maintain the Constitution's enumeration of powers. Congress found that gender-motivated violence affects interstate commerce\"by deterring potential victims from traveling interstate, from engaging in employment in interstate business, and from transacting with business, and in places involved in interstate commerce; . . . by diminishing national productivity, increasing medical and other costs, and decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate products.\" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, at 385.Accord, S. Rep. No. 103-138, at 54. Given these findings and petitioners' arguments, the concern that we expressed in Lopez that Congress might use the Commerce Clause to completely obliterate the Constitution's distinction between national and local authority seems well founded. See Lopez, supra, at 564. The reasoning that petitioners advance seeks to follow the but-for causal chain from the initial occurrence of violent crime (the suppression of which has always been the prime object of the States' police power) to every attenuated effect upon interstate commerce. If accepted, petitioners' reasoning would allow Congress to regulate any crime as long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption. Indeed, if Congress may regulate gendermotivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or any other type of violence since gender-motivated violence, as a subset of all violent crime, is certain to have lesser economic impacts than the larger class of which it is a part.\n\nPetitioners' reasoning, moreover, will not limit Congress to regulating violence but may, as we suggested in Lopez,  be applied equally as well to family law and other areas of traditional state regulation since the aggregate effect of *616 marriage, divorce, and childrearing on the national economy is undoubtedly significant. Congress may have recognized this specter when it expressly precluded  13981 from being used in the family law context.[6] See 42 U. S. C.  13981(e)(4). Under our written Constitution, however, the limitation of congressional authority is not solely a matter of legislative grace.[7] See Lopez, supra, at 575-579 (Kennedy, J., concurring); Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 176-178.\n\n*617 We accordingly reject the argument that Congress may regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce. The Constitution requires a distinction between what is *618 truly national and what is truly local. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 568 (citing Jones & Laughlin Steel, 301 U. S., at 30). In recognizing this fact we preserve one of the few principles that has been consistent since the Clause was adopted. The regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities, channels, or goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province of the States. See, e. g., Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 426, 428 (1821) (Marshall, C. J.) (stating that Congress \"has no general right to punish murder committed within any of the States,\" and that it is \"clear . . . that congress cannot punish felonies generally\"). Indeed, we can think of no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.[8] See, e. g., Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566 (\"The Constitution . . . withhold[s] from Congress a plenary police power\"); id., at 584-585 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\"[W]e always have rejected readings *619 of the Commerce Clause and the scope of federal power that would permit Congress to exercise a police power\"), 596-597, and n. 6 (noting that the first Congresses did not enact nationwide punishments for criminal conduct under the Commerce Clause).IIIBecause we conclude that the Commerce Clause does not provide Congress with authority to enact  13981, we address petitioners' alternative argument that the section's civil remedy should be upheld as an exercise of Congress' remedial power under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. As noted above, Congress expressly invoked the Fourteenth Amendment as a source of authority to enact  13981.\n\nThe principles governing an analysis of congressional legislation under  5 are well settled. Section 5 states that Congress may \"`enforce' by `appropriate legislation' the constitutional guarantee that no State shall deprive any person of `life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,' nor deny any person `equal protection of the laws.' \" City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 517 (1997). Section 5 is \"a positive grant of legislative power,\" Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641, 651 (1966), that includes authority to \"prohibi[t] conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and [to] intrud[e] into `legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the States.' \" Flores, supra, at 518 (quoting Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 455 (1976)); see also Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 81 (2000). However, \"[a]s broad as the congressional enforcement power is, it is not unlimited.\" Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112, 128 (1970); see also Kimel, supra, at 81. In fact, as we discuss in detail below, several limitations inherent in  5's text and constitutional context have been recognized since the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted.\n\nPetitioners'  5 argument is founded on an assertion that there is pervasive bias in various state justice systems against victims of gender-motivated violence. This assertion *620 is supported by a voluminous congressional record. Specifically, Congress received evidence that many participants in state justice systems are perpetuating an array of erroneous stereotypes and assumptions. Congress concluded that these discriminatory stereotypes often result in insufficient investigation and prosecution of gendermotivated crime, inappropriate focus on the behavior and credibility of the victims of that crime, and unacceptably lenient punishments for those who are actually convicted of gender-motivated violence. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103 711, at 385-386; S. Rep. No. 103-138, at 38, 41-55; S. Rep. No. 102-197, at 33-35, 41, 43-47. Petitioners contend that this bias denies victims of gender-motivated violence the equal protection of the laws and that Congress therefore acted appropriately in enacting a private civil remedy against the perpetrators of gender-motivated violence to both remedy the States' bias and deter future instances of discrimination in the state courts.\nAs our cases have established, state-sponsored gender discrimination violates equal protection unless it \"`serves \"important governmental objectives and . . . the discriminatory means employed\" are \"substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\"` \" United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 533 (1996) (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982), in turn quoting Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U. S. 142, 150 (1980)). See also Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 198-199 (1976). However, the language and purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment place certain limitations on the manner in which Congress may attack discriminatory conduct. These limitations are necessary to prevent the Fourteenth Amendment from obliterating the Framers' carefully crafted balance of power between the States and the National Government. See Flores, supra, at 520-524 (reviewing the history of the Fourteenth Amendment's enactment and discussing the contemporary belief that the Amendment \"`does *621 not concentrate power in the general government for any purpose of police government within the States' \") (quoting T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 294, n. 1 (2d ed. 1871)). Foremost among these limitations is the time-honored principle that the Fourteenth Amendment, by its very terms, prohibits only state action. \"[T]he principle has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.\" Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 13, and n. 12 (1948).\n\nShortly after the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, we decided two cases interpreting the Amendment's provisions, United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629 (1883), and the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883). In Harris, the Court considered a challenge to  2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871. That section sought to punish \"private persons\" for \"conspiring to deprive any one of the equal protection of the laws enacted by the State.\" 106 U. S., at 639. We concluded that this law exceeded Congress'  5 power because the law was \"directed exclusively against the action of private persons, without reference to the laws of the State, or their administration by her officers.\" Id., at 640. In so doing, we reemphasized our statement from Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 318 (1880), that \"`these provisions of the fourteenth amendment have reference to State action exclusively, and not to any action of private individuals.' \" Harris, supra, at 639 (misquotation in Harris ).\n\nWe reached a similar conclusion in the Civil Rights Cases.  In those consolidated cases, we held that the public accommodation provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which applied to purely private conduct, were beyond the scope of the  5 enforcement power. 109 U. S., at 11 (\"Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the [Fourteenth] [A]mendment\"). See also, e. g., Romer v. *622 Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 628 (1996) (\"[I]t was settled early that the Fourteenth Amendment did not give Congress a general power to prohibit discrimination in public accommodations\"); Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922, 936 (1982) (\"Careful adherence to the `state action' requirement preserves an area of individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law and federal judicial power\"); Blum v. Yaretsky,  457 U. S. 991, 1002 (1982); Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U. S. 163, 172 (1972); Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U. S. 144, 147, n. 2 (1970); United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 554 (1876) (\"The fourteenth amendment prohibits a state from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; but this adds nothing to the rights of one citizen as against another. It simply furnishes an additional guaranty against any encroachment by the States upon the fundamental rights which belong to every citizen as a member of society\").\n\nThe force of the doctrine of stare decisis behind these decisions stems not only from the length of time they have been on the books, but also from the insight attributable to the Members of the Court at that time. Every Member had been appointed by President Lincoln, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, or Arthurand each of their judicial appointees obviously had intimate knowledge and familiarity with the events surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nPetitioners contend that two more recent decisions have in effect overruled this longstanding limitation on Congress'  5 authority. They rely on United States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745 (1966), for the proposition that the rule laid down in the Civil Rights Cases is no longer good law. In Guest, the Court reversed the construction of an indictment under 18 U. S. C.  241, saying in the course of its opinion that \"we deal here with issues of statutory construction, not with issues of constitutional power.\" 383 U. S., at 749. Three Members of the Court, in a separate opinion by Justice Brennan, expressed the view that the Civil Rights Cases *623 were wrongly decided, and that Congress could under  5 prohibit actions by private individuals. 383 U. S., at 774 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Three other Members of the Court, who joined the opinion of the Court, joined a separate opinion by Justice Clark which in two or three sentences stated the conclusion that Congress could \"punis[h] all conspiracieswith or without state actionthat interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights.\" Id., at 762 (concurring opinion). Justice Harlan, in another separate opinion, commented with respect to the statement by these Justices:\"The action of three of the Justices who joined the Court's opinion in nonetheless cursorily pronouncing themselves on the far-reaching constitutional questions deliberately not reached in Part II seems to me, to say the very least, extraordinary.\" Id., at 762, n. 1 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).Though these three Justices saw fit to opine on matters not before the Court in Guest, the Court had no occasion to revisit the Civil Rights Cases and Harris, having determined \"the indictment [charging private individuals with conspiring to deprive blacks of equal access to state facilities] in fact contain[ed] an express allegation of state involvement.\" 383 U. S., at 756. The Court concluded that the implicit allegation of \"active connivance by agents of the State\" eliminated any need to decide \"the threshold level that state action must attain in order to create rights under the Equal Protection Clause.\" Ibid. All of this Justice Clark explicitly acknowledged. See id., at 762 (concurring opinion) (\"The Court's interpretation of the indictment clearly avoids the question whether Congress, by appropriate legislation, has the power to punish private conspiracies that interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights, such as the right to utilize public facilities\").\n\n*624 To accept petitioners' argument, moreover, one must add to the three Justices joining Justice Brennan's reasoned explanation for his belief that the Civil Rights Cases were wrongly decided, the three Justices joining Justice Clark's opinion who gave no explanation whatever for their similar view. This is simply not the way that reasoned constitutional adjudication proceeds. We accordingly have no hesitation in saying that it would take more than the naked dicta contained in Justice Clark's opinion, when added to Justice Brennan's opinion, to cast any doubt upon the enduring vitality of the Civil Rights Cases and Harris.\n\nPetitioners also rely on District of Columbia v. Carter,  409 U. S. 418 (1973). Carter was a case addressing the question whether the District of Columbia was a \"State\" within the meaning of Rev. Stat.  1979, 42 U. S. C.  1983a section which by its terms requires state action before it may be employed. A footnote in that opinion recites the same litany respecting Guest that petitioners rely on. This litany is of course entirely dicta, and in any event cannot rise above its source. We believe that the description of the  5 power contained in the Civil Rights Cases is correct:\"But where a subject is not submitted to the general legislative power of Congress, but is only submitted thereto for the purpose of rendering effective some prohibition against particular [s]tate legislation or [s]tate action in reference to that subject, the power given is limited by its object, and any legislation by Congress in the matter must necessarily be corrective in its character, adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such prohibited state laws or proceedings of [s]tate officers.\" 109 U. S., at 18.Petitioners alternatively argue that, unlike the situation in the Civil Rights Cases, here there has been gender-based disparate treatment by state authorities, whereas in those cases there was no indication of such state action. There is *625 abundant evidence, however, to show that the Congresses that enacted the Civil Rights Acts of 1871 and 1875 had a purpose similar to that of Congress in enacting  13981: There were state laws on the books bespeaking equality of treatment, but in the administration of these laws there was discrimination against newly freed slaves. The statement of Representative Garfield in the House and that of Senator Sumner in the Senate are representative:\"[T]he chief complaint is not that the laws of the State are unequal, but that even where the laws are just and equal on their face, yet, by a systematic maladministration of them, or a neglect or refusal to enforce their provisions, a portion of the people are denied equal protection under them.\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 153 (1871) (statement of Rep. Garfield).\"The Legislature of South Carolina has passed a law giving precisely the rights contained in your `supplementary civil rights bill.' But such a law remains a dead letter on her statute-books, because the State courts, comprised largely of those whom the Senator wishes to obtain amnesty for, refuse to enforce it.\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 2d Sess., 430 (1872) (statement of Sen. Sumner).See also, e. g., Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., at 653 (statement of Sen. Osborn); id., at 457 (statement of Rep. Coburn); id., at App. 78 (statement of Rep. Perry); 2 Cong. Rec. 457 (1874) (statement of Rep. Butler); 3 Cong. Rec. 945 (1875) (statement of Rep. Lynch).\n\nBut even if that distinction were valid, we do not believe it would save  13981's civil remedy. For the remedy is simply not \"corrective in its character, adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such prohibited [s]tate laws or proceedings of [s]tate officers.\" Civil Rights Cases, supra, at 18. Or, as we have phrased it in more recent cases, prophylactic legislation under  5 must have a \"`congruence *626 and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.\" Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 639 (1999); Flores, 521 U. S., at 526. Section 13981 is not aimed at proscribing discrimination by officials which the Fourteenth Amendment might not itself proscribe; it is directed not at any State or state actor, but at individuals who have committed criminal acts motivated by gender bias.\n\nIn the present cases, for example,  13981 visits no consequence whatever on any Virginia public official involved in investigating or prosecuting Brzonkala's assault. The section is, therefore, unlike any of the  5 remedies that we have previously upheld. For example, in Katzenbach v. Morgan,  384 U. S. 641 (1966), Congress prohibited New York from imposing literacy tests as a prerequisite for voting because it found that such a requirement disenfranchised thousands of Puerto Rican immigrants who had been educated in the Spanish language of their home territory. That law, which we upheld, was directed at New York officials who administered the State's election law and prohibited them from using a provision of that law. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach,  383 U. S. 301 (1966), Congress imposed voting rights requirements on States that, Congress found, had a history of discriminating against blacks in voting. The remedy was also directed at state officials in those States. Similarly, in Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339 (1880), Congress criminally punished state officials who intentionally discriminated in jury selection; again, the remedy was directed to the culpable state official.\n\nSection 13981 is also different from these previously upheld remedies in that it applies uniformly throughout the Nation. Congress' findings indicate that the problem of discrimination against the victims of gender-motivated crimes does not exist in all States, or even most States. By contrast, the  5 remedy upheld in Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra, *627 was directed only to the State where the evil found by Congress existed, and in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra,  the remedy was directed only to those States in which Congress found that there had been discrimination.\n\nFor these reasons, we conclude that Congress' power under  5 does not extend to the enactment of  13981.IVPetitioner Brzonkala's complaint alleges that she was the victim of a brutal assault. But Congress' effort in  13981 to provide a federal civil remedy can be sustained neither under the Commerce Clause nor under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. If the allegations here are true, no civilized system of justice could fail to provide her a remedy for the conduct of respondent Morrison. But under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and not by the United States. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\nAffirmed.Justice Thomas, concurring.The majority opinion correctly applies our decision in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), and I join it in full. I write separately only to express my view that the very notion of a \"substantial effects\" test under the Commerce Clause is inconsistent with the original understanding of Congress' powers and with this Court's early Commerce Clause cases. By continuing to apply this rootless and malleable standard, however circumscribed, the Court has encouraged the Federal Government to persist in its view that the Commerce Clause has virtually no limits. Until this Court replaces its existing Commerce Clause jurisprudence with a standard more consistent with the original understanding, we will continue to see Congress appropriating state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce.\n\n*628Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.The Court says both that it leaves Commerce Clause precedent undisturbed and that the Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 42 U. S. C.  13981, exceeds Congress's power under that Clause. I find the claims irreconcilable and respectfully dissent.[1]IOur cases, which remain at least nominally undisturbed, stand for the following propositions. Congress has the power to legislate with regard to activity that, in the aggregate, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 124-128 (1942); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 277 (1981). The fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for the courts in the first instance, ibid., but for the Congress, whose institutional capacity for gathering evidence and taking testimony far exceeds ours. By passing legislation, Congress indicates its conclusion, whether explicitly or not, that facts support its exercise of the commerce power. The business of the courts is to review the congressional assessment, not for soundness but simply for the rationality of concluding that a jurisdictional basis exists in fact. See ibid. Any explicit findings that Congress chooses to make, though not dispositive of the question of rationality, may advance judicial review by identifying factual authority on which Congress relied. Applying those propositions in these cases can lead to only one conclusion.\n\nOne obvious difference from United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), is the mountain of data assembled by Congress, *629 here showing the effects of violence against women on interstate commerce.[2] Passage of the Act in 1994 was preceded by four years of hearings,[3] which included testimony from physicians and law professors;[4] from survivors *630 of rape and domestic violence;[5] and from representatives of state law enforcement and private business.[6] The record includes reports on gender bias from task forces in 21 States,[7] and we have the benefit of specific factual findings *631 in the eight separate Reports issued by Congress and its committees over the long course leading to enactment.[8] Cf. Hodel, 452 U. S., at 278-279 (noting \"extended hearings,\" \"vast amounts of testimony and documentary evidence,\" and \"years of the most thorough legislative consideration\").\n\nWith respect to domestic violence, Congress received evidence for the following findings:\"Three out of four American women will be victims of violent crimes sometime during their life.\" H.

[,] by diminishing national productivity, increasing medical and other costs, and decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate products . . . .\" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, p. 385 (1994).Congress thereby explicitly stated the predicate for the exercise of its Commerce Clause power. Is its conclusion irrational in view of the data amassed? True, the methodology of particular studies may be challenged, and some of the figures arrived at may be disputed. But the sufficiency of the evidence before Congress to provide a rational basis for the finding cannot seriously be questioned. Cf. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180, 199 (1997) *635 (\"The Constitution gives to Congress the role of weighing conflicting evidence in the legislative process\").\n\nIndeed, the legislative record here is far more voluminous than the record compiled by Congress and found sufficient in two prior cases upholding Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against Commerce Clause challenges. In Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 (1964), and Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964), the Court referred to evidence showing the consequences of racial discrimination by motels and restaurants on interstate commerce. Congress had relied on compelling anecdotal reports that individual instances of segregation cost thousands to millions of dollars. See Civil RightsPublic Accommodations, Hearings on S. 1732 before the Senate Committee on Commerce, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., App. V, pp. 1383-1387 (1963). Congress also had evidence that the average black family spent substantially less than the average white family in the same income range on public accommodations, and that discrimination accounted for much of the difference.

Bromwell).\n\nWhile Congress did not, to my knowledge, calculate aggregate dollar values for the nationwide effects of racial discrimination in 1964, in 1994 it did rely on evidence of the harms caused by domestic violence and sexual assault, citing annual costs of $3 billion in 1990, see S. Rep. 101-545, at 33, and $5 to $10 billion in 1993, see S. Rep. No. 103-138, at 41.[9] Equally important, though, gender-based violence in the 1990's was shown to operate in a manner similar to racial *636 discrimination in the 1960's in reducing the mobility of employees and their production and consumption of goods shipped in interstate commerce. Like racial discrimination, \"[g]ender-based violence bars its most likely targets womenfrom full partic[ipation] in the national economy.\" Id., at 54.\n\nIf the analogy to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not plain enough, one can always look back a bit further. In Wickard,  we upheld the application of the Agricultural Adjustment Act to the planting and consumption of homegrown wheat. The effect on interstate commerce in that case followed from the possibility that wheat grown at home for personal consumption could either be drawn into the market by rising prices, or relieve its grower of any need to purchase wheat in the market. See 317 U. S., at 127-129. The Commerce Clause predicate was simply the effect of the production of wheat for home consumption on supply and demand in interstate commerce. Supply and demand for goods in interstate commerce will also be affected by the deaths of 2,000 to 4,000 women annually at the hands of domestic abusers, see S. Rep. No. 101-545, at 36, and by the reduction in the work force by the 100,000 or more rape victims who lose their jobs each year or are forced to quit, see id., at 56; H. R. Rep. No. 103-395, at 25-26. Violence against women may be found to affect interstate commerce and affect it substantially.[10]=\n\n*637 IIThe Act would have passed muster at any time between Wickard in 1942 and Lopez in 1995, a period in which the law enjoyed a stable understanding that congressional power under the Commerce Clause, complemented by the authority of the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I,  8, cl. 18, extended to all activity that, when aggregated, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. As already noted, this understanding was secure even against the turmoil at the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in the aftermath of which the Court not only reaffirmed the cumulative effects and rational basis features of the substantial effects test, see Heart of Atlanta, supra, at 258; McClung, supra, at 301-305, but declined to limit the commerce power through a formal distinction between legislation focused on \"commerce\" and statutes addressing \"moral and social wrong[s],\" Heart of Atlanta, supra, at 257.\n\nThe fact that the Act does not pass muster before the Court today is therefore proof, to a degree that Lopez was not, that the Court's nominal adherence to the substantial effects test is merely that. Although a new jurisprudence has not emerged with any distinctness, it is clear that some congressional conclusions about obviously substantial, cumulative effects on commerce are being assigned lesser values than the once-stable doctrine would assign them. These devaluations are accomplished not by any express repudiation of the substantial effects test or its application through the aggregation of individual conduct, but by supplanting rational basis scrutiny with a new criterion of review.\n\n*638 Thus the elusive heart of the majority's analysis in these cases is its statement that Congress's findings of fact are \"weakened\" by the presence of a disfavored \"method of reasoning.\" Ante, at 615. This seems to suggest that the \"substantial effects\" analysis is not a factual enquiry, for Congress in the first instance with subsequent judicial review looking only to the rationality of the congressional conclusion, but one of a rather different sort, dependent upon a uniquely judicial competence.\n\nThis new characterization of substantial effects has no support inour cases (the self-fulfilling prophecies of Lopez  aside), least of all those the majority cites. Perhaps this explains why the majority is not content to rest on its cited precedent but claims a textual justification for moving toward its new system of congressional deference subject to selective discounts. Thus it purports to rely on the sensible and traditional understanding that the listing in the Constitution of some powers implies the exclusion of others unmentioned. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 195 (1824); ante, at 610; The Federalist No. 45, p. 313 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison).[11] The majority stresses that Art. I,  8,enumerates *639 the powers of Congress, including the commerce power, an enumeration implying the exclusion of powers not enumerated. It follows, for the majority, not only that there must be some limits to \"commerce,\" but that some particular subjects arguably within the commerce power can be identified in advance as excluded, on the basis of characteristics other than their commercial effects. Such exclusions come into sight when the activity regulated is not itself commercial or when the States have traditionally addressed it in the exercise of the general police power, conferred under the state constitutions but never extended to Congress under the Constitution of the Nation, see Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566. Ante, at 615-616.\n\nThe premise that the enumeration of powers implies that other powers are withheld is sound; the conclusion that some particular categories of subject matter are therefore presumptively beyond the reach of the commerce power is, however, a non sequitur. From the fact that Art. I,  8, cl. 3, grants an authority limited to regulating commerce, it follows only that Congress may claim no authority under that section to address any subject that does not affect commerce. It does not at all follow that an activity affecting commerce nonetheless falls outside the commerce power, depending on the specific character of the activity, or the authority of a State to regulate it along with Congress.[12] My disagreement *640 with the majority is not, however, confined to logic, for history has shown that categorical exclusions have proven as unworkable in practice as they are unsupportable in theory.AObviously, it would not be inconsistent with the text of the Commerce Clause itself to declare \"noncommercial\" primary activity beyond or presumptively beyond the scope of the commerce power. That variant of categorical approach is not, however, the sole textually permissible way of defining the scope of the Commerce Clause, and any such neat limitation would at least be suspect in the light of the final sentence of Art. I,  8, authorizing Congress to make \"all Laws . . . necessary and proper\" to give effect to its enumerated powers such as commerce. See United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 118 (1941) (\"The power of Congress . . . extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce\"). Accordingly, for significant periods of our history, the Court has defined the commerce power as plenary, unsusceptible to categorical exclusions, and this was the view expressed throughout the latter part of the 20th century in the substantial effects test. These two conceptions of the commerce power, plenary and categorically limited, are in fact old rivals, and today's revival of their competition summons up familiar history, a brief reprise of which may be helpful in posing what I take to be the key question going to the legitimacy of the majority's decision to breathe new life into the approach of categorical limitation.\n\n*641 Chief Justice Marshall's seminal opinion in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 193-194, construed the commerce power from the start with \"a breadth never yet exceeded,\" Wickard  v. Filburn, 317 U. S., at 120. In particular, it is worth noting, the Court in Wickard did not regard its holding as exceeding the scope of Chief Justice Marshall's view of interstate commerce; Wickard applied an aggregate effects test to ostensibly domestic, noncommercial farming consistently with Chief Justice Marshall's indication that the commerce power may be understood by its exclusion of subjects, among others, \"which do not affect other States,\" Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 195. This plenary view of the power has either prevailed or been acknowledged by this Court at every stage of our jurisprudence. See, e. g., id., at 197; Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Alabama, 128 U. S. 96, 99-100 (1888); Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 353 (1903); Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 398 (1913); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175, 185 (1936); United States v. Darby, supra, at 115; Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States,  379 U. S., at 255; Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U. S., at 324. And it was this understanding, free of categorical qualifications, that prevailed in the period after 1937 through Lopez, as summed up by Justice Harlan: \"`Of course, the mere fact that Congress has said when particular activity shall be deemed to affect commerce does not preclude further examination by this Court. But where we find that the legislators . . . have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce, our investigation is at an end.' \" Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 190 (1968) (quoting Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S., at 303-304).\n\nJustice Harlan spoke with the benefit of hindsight, for he had seen the result of rejecting the plenary view, and today's attempt to distinguish between primary activities affecting commerce in terms of the relatively commercial or noncommercial character of the primary conduct proscribed comes with the pedigree of near tragedy that I outlined in *642 United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 603 (dissenting opinion). In the half century following the modern activation of the commerce power with passage of the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, this Court from time to time created categorical enclaves beyond congressional reach by declaring such activities as \"mining,\" \"production,\" \"manufacturing,\" and union membership to be outside the definition of \"commerce\" and by limiting application of the effects test to \"direct\" rather than \"indirect\" commercial consequences. See, e. g., United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1 (1895) (narrowly construing the Sherman Antitrust Act in light of the distinction between \"commerce\" and \"manufacture\"); In re Heff, 197 U. S. 488, 505-506 (1905) (stating that Congress could not regulate the intrastate sale of liquor); The Employers' Liability Cases, 207 U. S. 463, 495-496 (1908) (invalidating law governing tort liability for common carriers operating in interstate commerce because the effects on commerce were indirect); Adair v. United States, 208 U. S. 161 (1908) (holding that labor union membership fell outside \"commerce\"); Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251 (1918) (invalidating law prohibiting interstate shipment of goods manufactured with child labor as a regulation of \"manufacture\"); A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 545 548 (1935) (invalidating regulation of activities that only \"indirectly\" affected commerce); Railroad Retirement Bd.  v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S. 330, 368-369 (1935) (invalidating pension law for railroad workers on the grounds that conditions of employment were only indirectly linked to commerce); Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 303-304 (1936) (holding that regulation of unfair labor practices in mining regulated \"production,\" not \"commerce\").\n\nSince adherence to these formalistically contrived confines of commerce power in large measure provoked the judicial crisis of 1937, one might reasonably have doubted that Members of this Court would ever again toy with a return to the days before NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., *643 301 U. S. 1 (1937), which brought the earlier and nearly disastrous experiment to an end. And yet today's decision can only be seen as a step toward recapturing the prior mistakes. Its revival of a distinction between commercial and noncommercial conduct is at odds with Wickard, which repudiated that analysis, and the enquiry into commercial purpose, first intimated by the Lopez concurrence, see Lopez, supra, at 580 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), is cousin to the intent-based analysis employed in Hammer, supra, at 271 272, but rejected for Commerce Clause purposes in Heart of Atlanta, supra, at 257, and Darby, 312 U. S., at 115.\n\nWhy is the majority tempted to reject the lesson so painfully learned in 1937? An answer emerges from contrasting Wickard with one of the predecessor cases it superseded. It was obvious in Wickard that growing wheat for consumption right on the farm was not \"commerce\" in the common vocabulary,[13] but that did not matter constitutionally so long as the aggregated activity of domestic wheat growing affected commerce substantially. Just a few years before *644 Wickard, however, it had certainly been no less obvious that \"mining\" practices could substantially affect commerce, even though Carter Coal Co., supra, had held mining regulation beyond the national commerce power. When we try to fathom the difference between the two cases, it is clear that they did not go in different directions because the Carter Coal Court could not understand a causal connection that the Wickard Court could grasp; the difference, rather, turned on the fact that the Court in Carter Coal had a reason for trying to maintain its categorical, formalistic distinction, while that reason had been abandoned by the time Wickard was decided. The reason was laissez-faire economics, the point of which was to keep government interference to a minimum. See Lopez, supra, at 605-606 (Souter, J., dissenting). The Court in Carter Coal was still trying to create a laissez-faire world out of the 20thcentury economy, and formalistic commercial distinctions were thought to be useful instruments in achieving that object. The Court in Wickard knew it could not do any such thing and in the aftermath of the New Deal had long since stopped attempting the impossible. Without the animating economic theory, there was no point in contriving formalisms in a war with Chief Justice Marshall's conception of the commerce power.\n\nIf we now ask why the formalistic economic/noneconomic distinction might matter today, after its rejection in Wickard, the answer is not that the majority fails to see causal connections in an integrated economic world. The answer is that in the minds of the majority there is a new animating theory that makes categorical formalism seem useful again. Just as the old formalism had value in the service of an economic conception, the new one is useful in serving a conception of federalism. It is the instrument by which assertions of national power are to be limited in favor of preserving a supposedly discernible, proper sphere of state autonomy to legislate or refrain from legislating as the individual *645 States see fit. The legitimacy of the Court's current emphasis on the noncommercial nature of regulated activity, then, does not turn on any logic serving the text of the Commerce Clause or on the realism of the majority's view of the national economy. The essential issue is rather the strength of the majority's claim to have a constitutional warrant for its current conception of a federal relationship enforceable by this Court through limits on otherwise plenary commerce power. This conception is the subject of the majority's second categorical discount applied today to the facts bearing on the substantial effects test.BThe Court finds it relevant that the statute addresses conduct traditionally subject to state prohibition under domestic criminal law, a fact said to have some heightened significance when the violent conduct in question is not itself aimed directly at interstate commerce or its instrumentalities. Ante, at 609. Again, history seems to be recycling, for the theory of traditional state concern as grounding a limiting principle has been rejected previously, and more than once. It was disapproved in Darby, 312 U. S., at 123-124, and held insufficient standing alone to limit the commerce power in Hodel, 452 U. S., at 276-277. In the particular context of the Fair Labor Standards Act it was rejected in Maryland  v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968), with the recognition that \"[t]here is no general doctrine implied in the Federal Constitution that the two governments, national and state, are each to exercise its powers so as not to interfere with the free and full exercise of the powers of the other.\" Id., at 195 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held it to be \"clear that the Federal Government, when acting within a delegated power, may override countervailing state interests, whether these be described as `governmental' or `proprietary' in character.\" Ibid. While Wirtz was later overruled by National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. *646 833 (1976), that case was itself repudiated in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985), which held that the concept of \"traditional governmental function\" (as an element of the immunity doctrine under Hodel ) was incoherent, there being no explanation that would make sense of the multifarious decisions placing some functions on one side of the line, some on the other. 469 U. S., at 546-547. The effort to carve out inviolable state spheres within the spectrum of activities substantially affecting commerce was, of course, just as irreconcilable with Gibbons `s explanation of the national commerce power as being as \"absolut[e] as it would be in a single government,\" 9 Wheat., at 197.[14]\n*647 The objection to reviving traditional state spheres of action as a consideration in commerce analysis, however, not only rests on the portent of incoherence, but is compounded by a further defect just as fundamental. The defect, in essence, is the majority's rejection of the Founders' considered judgment that politics, not judicial review, should mediate between state and national interests as the strength and legislative jurisdiction of the National Government inevitably increased through the expected growth of the national economy.[15] Whereas today's majority takes a leaf from the book of the old judicial economists in saying that the Court should somehow draw the line to keep the federal relationship in a proper balance, Madison, Wilson, and Marshall understood the Constitution very differently.\n\nAlthough Madison had emphasized the conception of a National Government of discrete powers (a conception that a number of the ratifying conventions thought was too indeterminate to protect civil liberties),[16] Madison himself must have sensed the potential scope of some of the powers granted (such as the authority to regulate commerce), for he *648 took care in The Federalist No. 46 to hedge his argument for limited power by explaining the importance of national politics in protecting the States' interests. The National Government \"will partake sufficiently of the spirit [of the States], to be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual States, or the prerogatives of their governments.\" The Federalist No. 46, p. 319 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). James Wilson likewise noted that \"it was a favorite object in the Convention\" to secure the sovereignty of the States, and that it had been achieved through the structure of the Federal Government. 2 Elliot's Debates 438-439.[17] The Framers of the Bill of Rights, in turn, may well have sensed that Madison and Wilson were right about politics as the determinant of the federal balance within the broad limits of a power like commerce, for they formulated the Tenth Amendment without any provision comparable to the specific guarantees proposed for individual liberties.[18] In any case, this Court recognized the political component of federalism in the seminal Gibbons  opinion. After declaring the plenary character of congressional power within the sphere of activity affecting commerce, the Chief Justice spoke for the Court in explaining that there was only one restraint on its valid exercise:*649 \"The wisdom and the discretion of Congress, their identity with the people, and the influence which their constituents possess at elections, are, in this, as in many other instances, as that, for example, of declaring war, the sole restraints on which they have relied, to secure them from its abuse. They are the restraints on which the people must often rely solely, in all representative governments.\" Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 197.Politics as the moderator of the congressional employment of the commerce power was the theme many years later in Wickard, for after the Court acknowledged the breadth of the Gibbons formulation it invoked Chief Justice Marshall yet again in adding that \"[h]e made emphatic the embracing and penetrating nature of this power by warning that effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than judicial processes.\" Wickard, 317 U. S., at 120 (citation omitted). Hence, \"conflicts of economic interest . . . are wisely left under our system to resolution by Congress under its more flexible and responsible legislative process. Such conflicts rarely lend themselves to judicial determination. And with the wisdom, workability, or fairness, of the plan of regulation we have nothing to do.\" Id., at 129 (footnote omitted).\n\nAs with \"conflicts of economic interest,\" so with supposed conflicts of sovereign political interests implicated by the Commerce Clause: the Constitution remits them to politics. The point can be put no more clearly than the Court put it the last time it repudiated the notion that some state activities categorically defied the commerce power as understood in accordance with generally accepted concepts. After confirming Madison's and Wilson's views with a recitation of the sources of state influence in the structure of the National Constitution, Garcia, 469 U. S., at 550-552, the Court disposed of the possibility of identifying \"principled constitutional limitations on the scope of Congress' Commerce Clause powers over the States merely *650 by relying on a priori definitions of state sovereignty,\" id.,  at 548. It concluded that\"the Framers chose to rely on a federal system in which special restraints on federal power over the States inhered principally in the workings of the National Government itself, rather than in discrete limitations on the objects of federal authority. State sovereign interests, then, are more properly protected by procedural safeguards inherent in the structure of the federal system than by judicially created limitations on federal power.\" Id., at 552.The Garcia Court's rejection of \"judicially created limitations\" in favor of the intended reliance on national politics was all the more powerful owing to the Court's explicit recognition that in the centuries since the framing the relative powers of the two sovereign systems have markedly changed. Nationwide economic integration is the norm, the national political power has been augmented by its vast revenues, and the power of the States has been drawn down by the Seventeenth Amendment, eliminating selection of senators by state legislature in favor of direct election.\n\nThe Garcia majority recognized that economic growth and the burgeoning of federal revenue have not amended the Constitution, which contains no circuit breaker to preclude the political consequences of these developments. Nor is there any justification for attempts to nullify the natural political impact of the particular amendment that was adopted. The significance for state political power of ending state legislative selection of senators was no secret in 1913, and the amendment was approved despite public comment on that very issue. Representative Franklin Bartlett, after quoting Madison's Federalist No. 62, as well as remarks by George Mason and John Dickinson during the Constitutional Convention, concluded, \"It follows, therefore, that the *651 framers of the Constitution, were they present in this House to-day, would inevitably regard this resolution as a most direct blow at the doctrine of State's rights and at the integrity of the State sovereignties; for if you once deprive a State as a collective organism of all share in the General Government, you annihilate its federative importance.\" 26 Cong. Rec. 7774 (1894). Massachusetts Senator George Hoar likewise defended indirect election of the Senate as \"a great security for the rights of the States.\" S. Doc. No. 232, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., 21 (1906). And Elihu Root warned that if the selection of senators should be taken from state legislatures, \"the tide that now sets toward the Federal Government will swell in volume and power.\" 46 Cong. Rec. 2243 (1911). \"The time will come,\" he continued, \"when the Government of the United States will be driven to the exercise of more arbitrary and unconsidered power, will be driven to greater concentration, will be driven to extend its functions into the internal affairs of the States.\" Ibid.  See generally Rossum, The Irony of Constitutional Democracy: Federalism, the Supreme Court, and the Seventeenth Amendment, 36 San Diego L. Rev. 671, 712-714 (1999) (noting federalism-based objections to the Seventeenth Amendment). These warnings did not kill the proposal; the Amendment was ratified, and today it is only the ratification, not the predictions, which this Court can legitimately heed.[19]\n*652 Amendments that alter the balance of power between the National and State Governments, like the Fourteenth, or that change the way the States are represented within the Federal Government, like the Seventeenth, are not rips in the fabric of the Framers' Constitution, inviting judicial repairs. The Seventeenth Amendment may indeed have lessened the enthusiasm of the Senate to represent the States as discrete sovereignties, but the Amendment did not convert the judiciary into an alternate shield against the commerce power.CThe Court's choice to invoke considerations of traditional state regulation in these cases is especially odd in light of a distinction recognized in the now-repudiated opinion for the Court in Usery. In explaining that there was no inconsistency between declaring the States immune to the commerce power exercised in the Fair Labor Standards Act, but subject to it under the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as decided in Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975), the Court spoke of the latter statute as dealing with a serious threat affecting all the political components of the federal *653 system, \"which only collective action by the National Government might forestall.\" Usery, 426 U. S., at 853. Today's majority, however, finds no significance whatever in the state support for the Act based upon the States' acknowledged failure to deal adequately with gender-based violence in state courts, and the belief of their own law enforcement agencies that national action is essential.[20]\n\nThe National Association of Attorneys General supported the Act unanimously, see Violence Against Women: Victims of the System, Hearing on S. 15 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 37-38 (1991), and Attorneys General from 38 States urged Congress to enact the Civil Rights Remedy, representing that \"the current system for dealing with violence against women is inadequate,\" see Crimes of Violence Motivated by Gender, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 34-36 (1993). It was against this record of failure at the state level that the Act was passed to provide the choice of a federal forum in place of the state-court systems found inadequate to stop gender-biased violence. See Women and Violence, Hearing before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1990) (statement of Sen. Biden) (noting importance of federal forum).[21] The Act accordingly offers a federal civil rights remedy aimed exactly *654 at violence against women, as an alternative to the generic state tort causes of action found to be poor tools of action by the state task forces. See S. Rep. No. 101-545, at 45 (noting difficulty of fitting gender-motivated crimes into commonlaw categories). As the 1993 Senate Report put it, \"The Violence Against Women Act is intended to respond both to the underlying attitude that this violence is somehow less serious than other crime and to the resulting failure of our criminal justice system to address such violence. Its goals are both symbolic and practical . . . .\" S. Rep. No. 103-138, at 38.\n\nThe collective opinion of state officials that the Act was needed continues virtually unchanged, and when the Civil Rights Remedy was challenged in court, the States came to its defense. Thirty-six of them and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have filed an amicus brief in support of petitioners in these cases, and only one State has taken respondents' side. It is, then, not the least irony of these cases that the States will be forced to enjoy the new federalism whether they want it or not. For with the Court's decision today, Antonio Morrison, like Carter Coal `s James Carter before him, has \"won the states' rights plea against the states themselves.\" R. Jackson, The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy 160 (1941).IIIAll of this convinces me that today's ebb of the commerce power rests on error, and at the same time leads me to doubt that the majority's view will prove to be enduring law. There is yet one more reason for doubt. Although we sense the presence of Carter Coal, Schechter, and Usery once again, the majority embraces them only at arm's-length. Where such decisions once stood for rules, today's opinion points to considerations by which substantial effects are discounted. Cases standing for the sufficiency of substantial effects are not overruled; cases overruled since 1937 are not quite revived. The Court's thinking betokens less clearly *655 a return to the conceptual straitjackets of Schechter and Carter Coal and Usery than to something like the unsteady state of obscenity law between Redrup v. New York, 386 U. S. 767 (1967) (per curiam), and Miller v. California,  413 U. S. 15 (1973), a period in which the failure to provide a workable definition left this Court to review each case ad hoc. See id., at 22, n. 3; Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas,  390 U. S. 676, 706-708 (1968) (Harlan, J., dissenting). As our predecessors learned then, the practice of such ad hoc review cannot preserve the distinction between the judicial and the legislative, and this Court, in any event, lacks the institutional capacity to maintain such a regime for very long. This one will end when the majority realizes that the conception of the commerce power for which it entertains hopes would inevitably fail the test expressed in Justice Holmes's statement that \"[t]he first call of a theory of law is that it should fit the facts.\" O. Holmes, The Common Law 167 (Howe ed. 1963). The facts that cannot be ignored today are the facts of integrated national commerce and a political relationship between States and Nation much affected by their respective treasuries and constitutional modifications adopted by the people. The federalism of some earlier time is no more adequate to account for those facts today than the theory of laissez-faire was able to govern the national economy 70 years ago.Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins, and with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join as to Part IA, dissenting.No one denies the importance of the Constitution's federalist principles. Its state/federal division of authority protects libertyboth by restricting the burdens that government can impose from a distance and by facilitating citizen participation in government that is closer to home. The question is how the judiciary can best implement that *656 original federalist understanding where the Commerce Clause is at issue.IThe majority holds that the federal commerce power does not extend to such \"noneconomic\" activities as \"noneconomic, violent criminal conduct\" that significantly affects interstate commerce only if we \"aggregate\" the interstate \"effect[s]\" of individual instances. Ante, at 617. Justice Souter explains why history, precedent, and legal logic militate against the majority's approach. I agree and join his opinion. I add that the majority's holding illustrates the difficulty of finding a workable judicial Commerce Clause touchstonea set of comprehensible interpretive rules that courts might use to impose some meaningful limit, but not too great a limit, upon the scope of the legislative authority that the Commerce Clause delegates to Congress.AConsider the problems. The \"economic/noneconomic\" distinction is not easy to apply. Does the local street corner mugger engage in \"economic\" activity or \"noneconomic\" activity when he mugs for money? See Perez v. United States,  402 U. S. 146 (1971) (aggregating local \"loan sharking\" instances); United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 559 (1995) (loan sharking is economic because it consists of \"intrastate extortionate credit transactions\"); ante, at 610. Would evidence that desire for economic domination underlies many brutal crimes against women save the present statute? See United States General Accounting Office, Health, Education, and Human Services Division, Domestic Violence: Prevalence and Implications for Employment Among Welfare Recipients 7-8 (Nov. 1998); Brief for Equal Rights Advocates et al. as Amicus Curiae 10-12.\n\nThe line becomes yet harder to draw given the need for exceptions. The Court itself would permit Congress to aggregate, hence regulate, \"noneconomic\" activity taking place *657 at economic establishments. See Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 (1964) (upholding civil rights laws forbidding discrimination at local motels); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964) (same for restaurants); Lopez, supra, at 559 (recognizing congressional power to aggregate, hence forbid, noneconomically motivated discrimination at public accommodations); ante, at 610 (same). And it would permit Congress to regulate where that regulation is \"an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\" Lopez, supra, at 561; cf. Controlled Substances Act, 21 U. S. C.  801 et seq. (regulating drugs produced for home consumption). Given the former exception, can Congress simply rewrite the present law and limit its application to restaurants, hotels, perhaps universities, and other places of public accommodation? Given the latter exception, can Congress save the present law by including it, or much of it, in a broader \"Safe Transport\" or \"Workplace Safety\" act?\n\nMore important, why should we give critical constitutional importance to the economic, or noneconomic, nature of an interstate-commerce-affecting cause? If chemical emanations through indirect environmental change cause identical, severe commercial harm outside a State, why should it matter whether local factories or home fireplaces release them? The Constitution itself refers only to Congress' power to \"regulate Commerce . . . among the several States,\" and to make laws \"necessary and proper\" to implement that power. Art. I,  8, cls. 3, 18. The language says nothing about either the local nature, or the economic nature, of an interstatecommerce-affecting cause.\n\nThis Court has long held that only the interstate commercial effects, not the local nature of the cause, are constitutionally relevant. See NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.,  301 U. S. 1, 38-39 (1937) (focusing upon interstate effects); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 125 (1942) (aggregating *658 interstate effects of wheat grown for home consumption); Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at 258 (\"`[I]f it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter how local the operation which applies the squeeze' \" (quoting United States v. Women's Sportswear Mfrs. Assn., 336 U. S. 460, 464 (1949))). Nothing in the Constitution's language, or that of earlier cases prior to Lopez, explains why the Court should ignore one highly relevant characteristic of an interstatecommerce-affecting cause (how \"local\" it is), while placing critical constitutional weight upon a different, less obviously relevant, feature (how \"economic\" it is).\n\nMost importantly, the Court's complex rules seem unlikely to help secure the very object that they seek, namely, the protection of \"areas of traditional state regulation\" from federal intrusion. Ante, at 615. The Court's rules, even if broadly interpreted, are underinclusive. The local pickpocket is no less a traditional subject of state regulation than is the local gender-motivated assault. Regardless, the Court reaffirms, as it should, Congress' well-established and frequently exercised power to enact laws that satisfy a commerce-related jurisdictional prerequisitefor example, that some item relevant to the federally regulated activity has at some time crossed a state line. Ante, at 609, 611-612, 613, and n. 5; Lopez, supra, at 558; Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at 256 (\"`[T]he authority of Congress to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses has been frequently sustained, and is no longer open to question' \" (quoting Caminetti v. United States,  242 U. S. 470, 491 (1917))); see also United States v. Bass,  404 U. S. 336, 347-350 (1971) (saving ambiguous felon-inpossession statute by requiring gun to have crossed state line); Scarborough v. United States, 431 U. S. 563, 575 (1977) (interpreting same statute to require only that gun passed \"in interstate commerce\" \"at some time,\" without questioning constitutionality); cf., e. g., 18 U. S. C.  2261(a)(1) (making it a federal crime for a person to cross state lines to commit *659 a crime of violence against a spouse or intimate partner);  1951(a) (federal crime to commit robbery, extortion, physical violence or threat thereof, where \"article or commodity in commerce\" is affected, obstructed, or delayed);  2315 (making unlawful the knowing receipt or possession of certain stolen items that have \"crossed a State . . . boundary\");  922(g)(1) (prohibiting felons from shipping, transporting, receiving, or possessing firearms \"in interstate . . . commerce\").\n\nAnd in a world where most everyday products or their component parts cross interstate boundaries, Congress will frequently find it possible to redraft a statute using language that ties the regulation to the interstate movement of some relevant object, thereby regulating local criminal activity or, for that matter, family affairs. See, e. g., Child Support Recovery Act of 1992, 18 U. S. C.  228. Although this possibility does not give the Federal Government the power to regulate everything, it means that any substantive limitation will apply randomly in terms of the interests the majority seeks to protect. How much would be gained, for example, were Congress to reenact the present law in the form of \"An Act Forbidding Violence Against Women Perpetrated at Public Accommodations or by Those Who Have Moved in, or through the Use of Items that Have Moved in, Interstate Commerce\"? Complex Commerce Clause rules creating fine distinctions that achieve only random results do little to further the important federalist interests that called them into being. That is why modern (pre-Lopez ) case law rejected them. See Wickard, supra, at 120; United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 116-117 (1941); Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra, at 37.\n\nThe majority, aware of these difficulties, is nonetheless concerned with what it sees as an important contrary consideration. To determine the lawfulness of statutes simply by asking whether Congress could reasonably have found that aggregated local instances significantly affect interstate commerce will allow Congress to regulate almost anything. *660 Virtually all local activity, when instances are aggregated, can have \"substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption.\" Hence Congress could \"regulate any crime,\" and perhaps \"marriage, divorce, and childrearing\" as well, obliterating the \"Constitution's distinction between national and local authority.\" Ante, at 615, 616; Lopez, 514 U. S., at 558; cf. A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.  v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 548 (1935) (need for distinction between \"direct\" and \"indirect\" effects lest there \"be virtually no limit to the federal power\"); Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251, 276 (1918) (similar observation).\n\nThis consideration, however, while serious, does not reflect a jurisprudential defect, so much as it reflects a practical reality. We live in a Nation knit together by two centuries of scientific, technological, commercial, and environmental change. Those changes, taken together, mean that virtually every kind of activity, no matter how local, genuinely can affect commerce, or its conditions, outside the Stateat least when considered in the aggregate. Heart of Atlanta Motel,  379 U. S., at 251. And that fact makes it close to impossible for courts to develop meaningful subject-matter categories that would exclude some kinds of local activities from ordinary Commerce Clause \"aggregation\" rules without, at the same time, depriving Congress of the power to regulate activities that have a genuine and important effect upon interstate commerce.\n\nSince judges cannot change the world, the \"defect\" means that, within the bounds of the rational, Congress, not the courts, must remain primarily responsible for striking the appropriate state/federal balance. Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 552 (1985); ante, at 645-649 (Souter, J., dissenting); Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 93-94 (2000) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (Framers designed important structural safeguards to ensure that, when Congress legislates, \"the normal operation of the legislative process itself would adequately defend *661 state interests from undue infringement\"); see also Kramer, Putting the Politics Back into the Political Safeguards of Federalism, 100 Colum. L. Rev. 215 (2000) (focusing on role of political process and political parties in protecting state interests). Congress is institutionally motivated to do so. Its Members represent state and local district interests. They consider the views of state and local officials when they legislate, and they have even developed formal procedures to ensure that such consideration takes place. See, e. g., Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-4, 109 Stat. 48 (codified in scattered sections of 2 U. S. C.). Moreover, Congress often can better reflect state concerns for autonomy in the details of sophisticated statutory schemes than can the Judiciary, which cannot easily gather the relevant facts and which must apply more general legal rules and categories. See, e. g., 42 U. S. C.  7543(b) (Clean Air Act); 33 U. S. C.  1251 et seq. (Clean Water Act); see also New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 167-168 (1992) (collecting other examples of \"cooperative federalism\"). Not surprisingly, the bulk of American law is still state law, and overwhelmingly so.BI would also note that Congress, when it enacted the statute, followed procedures that help to protect the federalism values at stake. It provided adequate notice to the States of its intent to legislate in an \"are[a] of traditional state regulation.\" Ante, at 615. And in response, attorneys general in the overwhelming majority of States (38) supported congressional legislation, telling Congress that \"[o]ur experience as Attorneys General strengthens our belief that the problem of violence against women is a national one, requiring federal attention, federal leadership, and federal funds.\" Crimes of Violence Motivated by Gender, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 34-36 (1993); see also Violence Against Women: Victims of *662 the System, Hearing on S. 15 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 37-38 (1991) (unanimous resolution of the National Association of Attorneys General); but cf. Crimes of Violence Motivated by Gender, supra, at 77-84 (Conference of Chief Justices opposing legislation).\n\nMoreover, as Justice Souter has pointed out, Congress compiled a \"mountain of data\" explicitly documenting the interstate commercial effects of gender-motivated crimes of violence. Ante, at 628-635, 653-654 (dissenting opinion). After considering alternatives, it focused the federal law upon documented deficiencies in state legal systems. And it tailored the law to prevent its use in certain areas of traditional state concern, such as divorce, alimony, or child custody. 42 U. S. C.  13981(e)(4). Consequently, the law before us seems to represent an instance, not of state/federal conflict, but of state/federal efforts to cooperate in order to help solve a mutually acknowledged national problem. Cf.  300w10, 3796gg, 3796hh, 10409, 13931 (providing federal moneys to encourage state and local initiatives to combat gender-motivated violence).\n\nI call attention to the legislative process leading up to enactment of this statute because, as the majority recognizes, ante, at 614, it far surpasses that which led to the enactment of the statute we considered in Lopez. And even were I to accept Lopez as an accurate statement of the law, which I do not, that distinction provides a possible basis for upholding the law here. This Court on occasion has pointed to the importance of procedural limitations in keeping the power of Congress in check. See Garcia, supra, at 554 (\"Any substantive restraint on the exercise of Commerce Clause powers must find its justification in the procedural nature of this basic limitation, and it must be tailored to compensate for possible failings in the national political process rather than to dictate a `sacred province of state autonomy' \" (quoting EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 236 (1983))); see *663 also Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460-461 (1991) (insisting upon a \"plain statement\" of congressional intent when Congress legislates \"in areas traditionally regulated by the States\"); cf. Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 103 105, 114-117 (1976); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 548-554 (1980) (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n\nCommentators also have suggested that the thoroughness of legislative procedurese. g., whether Congress took a \"hard look\"might sometimes make a determinative difference in a Commerce Clause case, say, when Congress legislates in an area of traditional state regulation. See, e. g.,  Jackson, Federalism and the Uses and Limits of Law: Printz  and Principle?, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 2180, 2231-2245 (1998); Gardbaum, Rethinking Constitutional Federalism, 74 Texas L. Rev. 795, 812-828, 830-832 (1996); Lessig, Translating Federalism: United States v. Lopez, 1995 S. Ct. Rev. 125, 194-214 (1995); see also Treaty Establishing the European Community Art. 5; Bermann, Taking Subsidiarity Seriously: Federalism in the European Community and the United States, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 331, 378-403 (1994) (arguing for similar limitation in respect to somewhat analogous principle of subsidiarity for European Community); Gardbaum, supra,  at 833-837 (applying subsidiarity principles to American federalism). Of course, any judicial insistence that Congress follow particular procedures might itself intrude upon congressional prerogatives and embody difficult definitional problems. But the intrusion, problems, and consequences all would seem less serious than those embodied in the majority's approach. See supra, at 656-659.\n\nI continue to agree with Justice Souter that the Court's traditional \"rational basis\" approach is sufficient. Ante, at 628 (dissenting opinion); see also Lopez, 514 U. S., at 603-615 (Souter, J., dissenting); id., at 615-631 (Breyer, J., dissenting). But I recognize that the law in this area is unstable and that time and experience may demonstrate both the unworkability of the majority's rules and the superiority *664 of Congress' own procedural approachin which case the law may evolve toward a rule that, in certain difficult Commerce Clause cases, takes account of the thoroughness with which Congress has considered the federalism issue.\n\nFor these reasons, as well as those set forth by Justice Souter, this statute falls well within Congress' Commerce Clause authority, and I dissent from the Court's contrary conclusion.IIGiven my conclusion on the Commerce Clause question, I need not consider Congress' authority under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Nonetheless, I doubt the Court's reasoning rejecting that source of authority. The Court points out that in United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629 (1883), and the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883), the Court held that  5 does not authorize Congress to use the Fourteenth Amendment as a source of power to remedy the conduct of private persons. Ante, at 621-622. That is certainly so. The Federal Government's argument, however, is that Congress used  5 to remedy the actions of state actors, namely, those States which, through discriminatory design or the discriminatory conduct of their officials, failed to provide adequate (or any) state remedies for women injured by gender-motivated violencea failure that the States, and Congress, documented in depth. See ante, at 630-631, n. 7, 653-654 (Souter, J., dissenting) (collecting sources).\n\nNeither Harris nor the Civil Rights Cases considered this kind of claim. The Court in Harris specifically said that it treated the federal laws in question as \"directed exclusively  against the action of private persons, without reference to the laws of the State or their administration by her officers.\" 106 U. S., at 640 (emphasis added); see also Civil Rights Cases, supra, at 14 (observing that the statute did \"not profess to be corrective of any constitutional wrong committed by the States\" and that it established \"rules for the conduct *665 of individuals in society towards each other, . . . without referring in any manner to any supposed action of the State or its authorities\").\n\nThe Court responds directly to the relevant \"state actor\" claim by finding that the present law lacks \"`congruence and proportionality' \" to the state discrimination that it purports to remedy. Ante, at 625-626; see City of Boerne v. Flores,  521 U. S. 507, 526 (1997). That is because the law, unlike federal laws prohibiting literacy tests for voting, imposing voting rights requirements, or punishing state officials who intentionally discriminated in jury selection, Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966); South Carolina v. Katzenbach,  383 U. S. 301 (1966); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339 (1880), is not \"directed . . . at any State or state actor.\" Ante,  at 626.\n\nBut why can Congress not provide a remedy against private actors? Those private actors, of course, did not themselves violate the Constitution. But this Court has held that Congress at least sometimes can enact remedial \"[l]egislation . . .[that] prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional.\" Flores, supra, at 518; see also Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra, at 651; South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra, at 308. The statutory remedy does not in any sense purport to \"determine what constitutes a constitutional violation.\" Flores, supra, at 519. It intrudes little upon either States or private parties. It may lead state actors to improve their own remedial systems, primarily through example. It restricts private actors only by imposing liability for private conduct that is, in the main, already forbidden by state law. Why is the remedy \"disproportionate\"? And given the relation between remedy and violationthe creation of a federal remedy to substitute for constitutionally inadequate state remedieswhere is the lack of \"congruence\"?\n\nThe majority adds that Congress found that the problem of inadequacy of state remedies \"does not exist in all States, *666 or even most States.\" Ante, at 626. But Congress had before it the task force reports of at least 21 States documenting constitutional violations. And it made its own findings about pervasive gender-based stereotypes hampering many state legal systems, sometimes unconstitutionally so. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 103-138, pp. 38, 41-42, 44-47 (1993); S. Rep. No. 102-197, pp. 39, 44-49 (1991); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, p. 385 (1994). The record nowhere reveals a congressional finding that the problem \"does not exist\" elsewhere. Why can Congress not take the evidence before it as evidence of a national problem? This Court has not previously held that Congress must document the existence of a problem in every State prior to proposing a national solution. And the deference this Court gives to Congress' chosen remedy under  5, Flores, supra, at 536, suggests that any such requirement would be inappropriate.\n\nDespite my doubts about the majority's  5 reasoning, I need not, and do not, answer the  5 question, which I would leave for more thorough analysis if necessary on another occasion. Rather, in my view, the Commerce Clause provides an adequate basis for the statute before us. And I would uphold its constitutionality as the \"necessary and proper\" exercise of legislative power granted to Congress by that Clause.NOTES[*]   Together with No. 99-29, Brzonkala v.

Our grant of certiorari did not encompass Brzonkala's Title IX claims, and we thus do not consider them in this opinion.\n\n[3]  Justice Souter's dissent takes us to task for allegedly abandoning Jones & Laughlin Steel in favor ofan inadequate \"federalism of some earlier time.\" Post, at 641-643, 655. As the foregoing language from Jones & Laughlin Steel makes clear however, this Court has always recognized a limit on the commerce power inherent in \"our dual system of government.\" 301 U. S., at 37. It is the dissent's remarkable theory that the commerce power is without judicially enforceable boundaries that disregards the Court's caution in Jones & Laughlin Steel against allowing that power to \"effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local.\" Ibid.\n\n[4]  Justice Souter's dissent does not reconcile its analysis with our holding in Lopez because it apparently would cast that decision aside. See post, at 637-643. However, the dissent cannot persuasively contradict Lopez `s conclusion that, in every case where we have sustained federal regulation under the aggregation principle in Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), the regulated activity was of an apparent commercial character. See, e. g., Lopez, 514 U. S., at 559-560, 580.\n\n[5]  Title 42 U. S. C.  13981 is not the sole provision of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 to provide a federal remedy for gender-motivated crime. Section 40221(a) of the Act creates a federal criminal remedy to punish \"interstate crimes of abuse including crimes committed against spouses or intimate partners during interstate travel and crimes committed by spouses or intimate partners who cross State lines to continue the abuse.\" S. Rep. No. 103-138, p. 43 (1993). That criminal provision has been codified at 18 U. S. C.  2261(a)(1), which states: \"A person who travels across a State line or enters or leaves Indian country with the intent to injure, harass, or intimidate that person's spouse or intimate partner, and who, in the course of or as a result of such travel, intentionally commits a crime of violence and thereby causes bodily injury to such spouse or intimate partner, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).\"\n\nThe Courts of Appeals have uniformly upheld this criminal sanction as an appropriate exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause authority, reasoning that \"[t]he provision properly falls within the first of Lopez `s categories as it regulates the use of channels of interstate commercei. e., the use of the interstate transportation routes through which persons and goods move.\" United States v. Lankford, 196 F. 3d 563, 571-572 (CA5 1999) (collecting cases) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n[6]  We are not the first to recognize that the but-for causal chain must have its limits in the Commerce Clause area. In Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567, we quoted Justice Cardozo's concurring opinion in A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935): \"There is a view of causation that would obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local in the activities of commerce. Motion at the outer rim is communicated perceptibly, though minutely, to recording instruments at the center. A society such as ours `is an elastic medium which transmits all tremors throughout its territory; the only question is of their size.' \" Id., at 554 (quoting United States v. A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp., 76 F. 2d 617, 624 (CA2 1935) (L. Hand, J., concurring)).\n\n[7]  Justice Souter's theory that Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824), Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985), and the Seventeenth Amendment provide the answer to these cases, see post, at 645-652, is remarkable because it undermines this central principle of our constitutional system. As we have repeatedly noted, the Framers crafted the federal system of Government so that the people's rights would be secured by the division of power. See, e. g., Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 30 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458-459 (1991) (cataloging the benefits of the federal design); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985) (\"The `constitutionally mandated balance of power' between the States and the Federal Government was adopted by the Framers to ensure the protection of `our fundamental liberties' \") (quoting Garcia, supra, at 572 (Powell, J., dissenting)). Departing from their parliamentary past, the Framers adopted a written Constitution that further divided authority at the federal level so that the Constitution's provisions would not be defined solely by the political branches nor the scope of legislative power limited only by public opinion and the Legislature's self-restraint. See, e. g., Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.) (\"The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written\"). It is thus a \"`permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system' \" that \"`the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution.' \" Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 922-923 (1995) (quoting Cooper  v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 18 (1958)).\n\nNo doubt the political branches have a role in interpreting and applying the Constitution, but ever since Marbury this Court has remained the ultimate expositor of the constitutional text. As we emphasized in United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974): \"In the performance of assigned constitutional duties each branch of the Government must initially interpret the Constitution, and the interpretation of its powers by any branch is due great respect from the others. . . . Many decisions of this Court, however, have unequivocally reaffirmed the holding of Marbury  that `[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.' \" Id., at 703 (citation omitted).\n\nContrary to Justice Souter's suggestion, see post, at 647-652, and n. 14, Gibbons did not exempt the commerce power from this cardinal rule of constitutional law. His assertion that, from Gibbons on, public opinion has been the only restraint on the congressional exercise of the commerce power is true only insofar as it contends that political accountability is and has been the only limit on Congress' exercise of the commerce power within that power's outer bounds. As the language surrounding that relied upon by Justice Souter makes clear, Gibbons did not remove from this Court the authority to define that boundary. See Gibbons, supra, at 194-195 (\"It is not intended to say that these words comprehend that commerce, which is completely internal, which is carried on between man and man in a State, or between different parts of the same State, and which does not extend to or affect other States. . . . Comprehensive as the word `among' is, it may very properly be restricted to that commerce which concerns more States than one. The phrase is not one which would probably have been selected to indicate the completely interior traffic of a State, because it is not an apt phrase for that purpose; and the enumeration of the particular classes of commerce to which the power was to be extended, would not have been made, had the intention been to extend the power to every description. The enumeration presupposes something not enumerated; and that something, if we regard the language or the subject of the sentence, must be the exclusively internal commerce of a State\").\n\n[8]  Justice Souter disputes our assertion that the Constitution reserves the general police power to the States, noting that the Founders failed to adopt several proposals for additional guarantees against federal encroachment on state authority. See post, at 645-646, and n. 14. This argument is belied by the entire structure of the Constitution. With its careful enumeration of federal powers and explicit statement that all powers not granted to the Federal Government are reserved, the Constitution cannot realistically be interpreted as granting the Federal Government an unlimited license to regulate. See, e. g., New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 156-157 (1992). And, as discussed above, the Constitution's separation of federal power and the creation of the Judicial Branch indicate that disputes regarding the extent of congressional power are largely subject to judicial review. See n. 7, supra. Moreover, the principle that \"`[t]he Constitution created a Federal Government of limited powers,' \" while reserving a generalized police power to the States, is deeply ingrained in our constitutional history. New York, supra, at 155 (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, supra, at 457); see also Lopez, 514 U. S., at 584-599 (Thomas, J., concurring) (discussing the history of the debates surrounding the adoption of the Commerce Clause and our subsequent interpretation of the Clause); Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 196 (1968).\n\n[1]  Finding the law a valid exercise of Commerce Clause power, I have no occasion to reach the question whether it might also be sustained as an exercise of Congress's power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n[2]  It is true that these data relate to the effects of violence against women generally, while the civil rights remedy limits its scope to \"crimes of violence motivated by gender\"presumably a somewhat narrower subset of acts. See 42 U. S. C.  13981(b). But the meaning of \"motivated by gender\" has not been elucidated by lower courts, much less by this one, so the degree to which the findings rely on acts not redressable by the civil rights remedy isunclear. As will appear, however, much of the data seems to indicate behavior with just such motivation. In any event, adopting a cramped reading of the statutory text, and thereby increasing the constitutional difficulties, would directly contradict one of the most basic canons of statutory interpretation. See NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 30 (1937). Having identified the problem of violence against women, Congress may address what it sees as the most threatening manifestation; \"reform may take one step at a time.\" Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 489 (1955).\n\n[3]  See, e. g., Domestic Violence: Terrorism in the Home, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Children, Family, Drugs and Alcoholism of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 101st Cong., 2d Sess.

S.314, 325,n. 11 (1981) (statingthat corn production with a value of $5.16 million\"surely isnot an insignificant amount of commerce\").\n\n[10]  Itshould go without saying that my view of the limit of thecongressional commerce power carries no implication about the wisdom of exercising it to the limit.I and other Members of this Court appearing before Congress have repeatedly argued against the federalization of traditionalstate crimes and the extension of federal remedies to problems for which the States have historically taken responsibility and may deal with today ifthey have the will to do so. See Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 7, pp. 13-14 (1995) (testimony of Justice Kennedy); Hearings on H. R. 4603 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations,103d Cong., 2d Sess.,100-107 (1994) (testimony of Justices Kennedy and Souter). The JudicialConference of the United States originallyopposed the Act, though after the originalbillwas amended to include the gender-based animus requirement, the objection was withdrawn for reasons that are not apparent. See Crimes of Violence Motivated by Gender, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 70-71 (1993).\n\n[11]  The claim that powers not granted were withheld was the chief Federalist argument against the necessity of a bill of rights.Bills of rights, Hamilton claimed, \"have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people, and executed by their immediate representatives and servants. Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing, and as they retain every thing, they have no need of particular reservations.\" The Federalist No. 84,at 578. James Wilson went further in the Pennsylvania ratifying convention, asserting that an enumeration of rights was positivelydangerous because it suggested, conversely, that every right not reserved was surrendered. See 2 J.Elliot, Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 436-437 (2d ed. 1863) (hereinafter Elliot'sDebates). The Federalists did not, of course, prevailon this point; most States voted for the Constitution only after proposing amendments and the First Congress speedily adopted a Bill of Rights. See Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 569 (1985) (Powell, J., dissenting). While that document protected a range of specific individual rights against federal infringement, it did not, with the possible exception of the Second Amendment, offer any similarly specific protections to areas of state sovereignty.\n\n[12]  Tothe contrary,we have always recognized thatwhile the federal commerce power may overlap the reserved state police power, in such cases federal authority is supreme. See, e. g., Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R. Co. v. Ohio, 173 U. S. 285, 297-298 (1899) (\"When Congress acts with reference to a matter confided to itby the Constitution, then its statutes displace all conflicting local regulations touching that matter, although such regulations may have been established in pursuance of a power not surrendered by the States to the General Government\"); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175, 185 (1936) (\"[W]e look to the activities in which the states have traditionally engaged as marking the boundary of the restriction upon the federal taxing power. But there is no such limitation upon the plenary power to regulate commerce\").\n\n[13]  Contrary to the Court's suggestion, ante, at 611, n. 4, Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), applied the substantial effects test to domestic agricultural production for domestic consumption, an activity that cannot fairly be described as commercial, despite its commercial consequences in affecting or being affected by the demand for agricultural products in the commercial market. The Wickard Court admitted that Filburn's activity \"may not be regarded as commerce\" but insisted that \"it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce . . . .\" Id., at 125. The characterization of home wheat production as \"commerce\" or not is, however, ultimately beside the point. For if substantial effects on commerce are proper subjects of concern under the Commerce Clause, what difference should it make whether the causes of those effects are themselves commercial? Cf., e. g., National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 258 (1994) (\"An enterprise surely can have a detrimental influence on interstate or foreign commerce without having its own profit-seeking motives\"). The Court's answer is that it makes a difference to federalism, and the legitimacy of the Court's new judicially derived federalism is the crux of our disagreement. See infra, at 644-646.\n\n[14]  The Constitution of 1787 did, in fact, forbid some exercises of the commerce power. Article I,  9, cl. 6, barred Congress from giving preference to the ports of one State over those of another. More strikingly, the Framers protected the slave trade from federal interference, see Art. I,  9, cl. 1, and confirmed the power of a State to guarantee the chattel status of slaves who fled to another State, see Art. IV,  2, cl. 3. These reservations demonstrate the plenary nature of the federal power; the exceptions prove the rule. Apart from them, proposals to carve islands of state authority out of the stream of commerce power were entirely unsuccessful. Roger Sherman's proposed definition of federal legislative power as excluding \"matters of internal police\" met Gouverneur Morris's response that \"[t]he internal police . . . ought to be infringed in many cases\" and was voted down eight to two. 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 25-26 (M. Farrand ed. 1911) (hereinafter Farrand). The Convention similarly rejected Sherman's attempt to include in Article V a proviso that \"no state shall . . . be affected in its internal police.\" 5 Elliot's Debates 551-552. Finally, Rufus King suggested an explicit bill of rights for the States, a device that might indeed have set aside the areas the Court now declares off-limits. 1 Farrand 493 (\"As the fundamental rights of individuals are secured by express provisions in the State Constitutions; why may not a like security be provided for the Rights of States in the National Constitution\"). That proposal, too, came to naught. In short, to suppose that enumerated powers must have limits is sensible; to maintain that there exist judicially identifiable areas of state regulation immune to the plenary congressional commerce power even though falling within the limits defined by the substantial effects test is to deny our constitutional history.\n\n[15]  That the national economy and the national legislative power expand in tandem is not a recent discovery. This Court accepted the prospect well over 100 years ago, noting that the commerce powers \"are not confined to the instrumentalities of commerce, or the postal service known or in use when the Constitution was adopted, but they keep pace with the progress of the country, and adapt themselves to the new developments of time and circumstances.\" Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 96 U. S. 1, 9 (1878). See also, e. g., Farmers Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, 280 U. S. 204, 211-212 (1930) (\"Primitive conditions have passed; business is now transacted on a national scale\").\n\n[16]  As mentioned in n. 11, supra, many state conventions voted in favor of the Constitution only after proposing amendments. See 1 Elliot's Debates 322-323 (Massachusetts), 325 (South Carolina), 325-327 (New Hampshire), 327 (Virginia), 327-331 (New York), 331-332 (North Carolina), 334 337 (Rhode Island).\n\n[17]  Statements to similar effect pervade the ratification debates. See, e. g., 2 id., at 166-170 (Massachusetts, remarks of Samuel Stillman); 2 id.,  at 251-253 (New York, remarks of Alexander Hamilton); 4 id., at 95-98 (North Carolina, remarks of James Iredell).\n\n[18]  The majority's special solicitude for \"areas of traditional state regulation,\" ante, at 615, is thus founded not on the text of the Constitution but on what has been termed the \"spirit of the Tenth Amendment,\" Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S., at 585 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). Susceptibility to what Justice Holmes more bluntly called \"some invisible radiation from the general terms of the Tenth Amendment,\" Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416, 434 (1920), has increased in recent years, in disregard of his admonition that \"[w]e must consider what this country has become in deciding what that Amendment has reserved,\" ibid.\n\n[19]  The majority tries to deflect the objection that it blocks an intended political process by explaining that the Framers intended politics to set the federal balance only within the sphere of permissible commerce legislation, whereas we are looking to politics to define that sphere (in derogation even of Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803)), ante, at 616. But we all accept the view that politics is the arbiter of state interests only within the realm of legitimate congressional action under the commerce power. Neither Madison nor Wilson nor Marshall, nor the Jones & Laughlin, Darby, Wickard, or Garcia Courts, suggested that politics defines the commerce power. Nor do we, even though we recognize that the conditions of the contemporary world result in a vastly greater sphere of influence for politics than the Framers would have envisioned. Politics has legitimate authority, for all of us on both sides of the disagreement, only within the legitimate compass of the commerce power. The majority claims merely to be engaging in the judicial task of patrolling the outer boundaries of that congressional authority. See ante, at 616-617, n. 7. That assertion cannot be reconciled with our statements of the substantial effects test, which have not drawn the categorical distinctions the majority favors. See, e. g., Wickard, 317 U. S., at 125; United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 118-119 (1941). The majority's attempt to circumscribe the commerce power by defining it in terms of categorical exceptions can only be seen as a revival of similar efforts that led to near tragedy for the Court and incoherence for the law. If history's lessons are accepted as guides for Commerce Clause interpretation today, as we do accept them, then the subject matter of the Act falls within the commerce power and the choice to legislate nationally on that subject, or to except it from national legislation because the States have traditionally dealt with it, should be a political choice and only a political choice.\n\n[20]  See n. 7, supra. The point here is not that I take the position that the States are incapable of dealing adequately with domestic violence if their political leaders have the will to do so; it is simply that the Congress had evidence from which it could find a national statute necessary, so that its passage obviously survives Commerce Clause scrutiny.\n\n[21]  The majority's concerns about accountability strike me as entirely misplaced. Individuals, such as the defendants in this action, haled into federal court and sued under the United States Code, are quite aware of which of our dual sovereignties is attempting to regulate their behavior. Had Congress chosen, in the exercise of its powers under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, to proceed instead by regulating the States, rather than private individuals, this accountability would be far less plain.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1662965", "artist_names": "Rolf Harris", "full_title": "Nick Teen and Al K.

They was a 100% certain\nThe underworld knew... Detroit was working\nRum running Tommy Gunning.. who said crime don\u2019t pay\nThey helped Capone set up Bugs Moran for St. Valentine\u2019s Day\n[Hook]\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe Adamo brothers were originally, from Alcamo Sicily\nThey were chiefs of the black hand in Detroit\u2019s little Italy/\nExtorted merchants, grocers, bakers, and butchers\nAnd they were beer barons and feared blood thirsty butchers\n\u201cMustache Petes\u201d.. old school Mafiosos\nChokehold on the game that the youngsters wouldn't go foe\nThe Gianola Family got tired of being fruit vendors\nStarted playing the rackets to get some of that illegal tender\nStarted a war with the Adomos to get that big bread\nBoth sides shot it out and left plenty dead\nThe war was bloody, the feud really was on\nTil' the Adamos got shot up in front of their home\nThe Gianolas took over.. but it was short lived\nThey only had Detroit on lock for about 4 or 5 years\nGot into it with Johnny Vitale shit got real\nTony and Salvatore Gianolla.. both got killed\nWith the Gianolas out the way\nIt was safe say\nVitale was the don of Detroit for that day\nThe Gianolla organization splintered off\nAs the Eastside mob and Westside mob\nBut Johnny V. didn't last long either\nOrdered a drive-by on 3 young up and coming high achievers\nHeavy is the head, it cost to be the don\nRetaliation killed his nephew and 17 year old son\nYou

Don was selected, they called him \"Singing Sam\"\nHe brought the east and west back together, yeah he was the man\n\"Unione Scicilliana\" Detroit boss of all bosses\nReigned peacefully for 9 years and died from natural causes\nThe purple gang was falling apart, in-fighting within in their factions\nAllowed the mafia to get a bigger piece of prohibition actions\nGasper Millazo took over after Singing Sam died\nAnd briefly kept Detroit Mafiosi allied\nBut it fell apart soon, more blood and gore\nNew York exploded with the Castellammarese War\nAll \u201cGodfathers\u201d 'cross country had to choose sides\nMoranzano or Maseria, you had to choose sides\nMillazo picked Moranzano, Maseria didn't like this\nDecided to kill Milazzo fast and swift\nHad him gunned down at the Vernor fish market\nAnd another war between east and west Detroit started\nWith Maseria's support, Caesar LaMare was king of the land\nBut after killing Milazzo, he was a marked man\nWent underground for a year, he was afraid of getting whacked\nBut 2 of his own guys him in the back\n[Hook]\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\nCash rules everything around

and Maranzano\nA nationwide commission was organized by Lucky Luciano\nIt was a new day.. in a new world\nThe partnership was the heart of the Michigan underworld\nBut William Tocco got indicted and stepped down as boss\nSo his cousin Joe Zerilli became the new boss\nGodfather for 40 years everything was peaceful\nNo full scale war everything was peaceful\nThere was a boss, underboss and consigliare\nBut no one talked to the top 3 directly\nA street boss was the go-between\nFor the top3 and capo regimes\nSoldiers on the street scored and kicked up the cream\nThe Zerilli family.. they weren\u2019t just a crime family\nRelated through money and blood.. they really were family\nIntertwined by blood relation, they trusted few\nArranged marriages between they sons, daughters, nieces and nephews\nOf bosses capo regimes, and soldiers\nCouldn\u2019t be infiltrated by the federal or local rollers\nOn everything that circulated, they wet their beak\nTaxed any and all money that was

Black Bottom Paradise Valley numbers rackets\nThere was this guy named St Luis Geech\nNumbers king who never paid a mafia leach\nGot rich retired and left his interest to \"Monk\" Watson\nBlack owned and operated.. the streets was watching\nIn addition to numbers he owned the Twenty Grand Club\nAnd Motown hangout and black social hub\nAt the same time Joe Louis was Heavy Weight Champ of the world\nHis manager John Roxborough was a boss in the numbers worlds\nBoth him and Watson was part of the Big 12 Syndicate\nBig war-chest just in case them and the Mafia got into it\nBut they both caught cases for bribing the mayor, city hall cops\nThat's when the era of Black policy kings stopped\nItalians swooped in like blood thirsty vultures\nTo colonize the Black underworld policy culture\nPapa John Prizoli used the Carrado's connection in the policy game\nTo recruit new associates for the heroin game\nFrankie established of secret drug cash flow\nThe inspiration for Godfather's Virgil Solozzo\nBrought the dope to Detroit from the borders of Canada\nSupplied the whole country and the math for the money was doing algebra\nLucked up in the hood and found a violent

town\nMaserati Rick hooked up with Rockin' Reg and Boog Brown\nBeef with the other put Rick in a hospital bed\nSomeone walked in his room, and put a bullet in his head\nDemetris saw the writing on the wall, and he went into hiding\nHide out for about a year and half before deciding\nTo come back around.. he was spending thousands on clothe at the Broadway\nGunners came through the front door killed

London. A street.\nEnter GLOUCESTER, solus\nGLOUCESTER\nNow is the winter of our discontent\nMade glorious summer by this sun of York;\nAnd all the clouds that lour'd upon our house\nIn the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\nNow are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\nOur bruised arms hung up for monuments;\nOur stern alarums changed to merry meetings,\nOur dreadful marches to delightful measures.\nGrim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;\nAnd now, instead of mounting barded steeds\nTo fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\nHe capers nimbly in a lady's chamber\nTo the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\nBut I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,\nNor made to court an amorous looking-glass;\nI, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty\nTo strut before a wanton ambling nymph;\nI, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,\nCheated of feature by dissembling nature,\nDeformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time\nInto this breathing world, scarce half made up,\nAnd that so lamely and unfashionable\nThat dogs bark at me as I halt by them;\nWhy, I, in this weak piping time of peace,\nHave no delight to pass away the time,\nUnless to spy my shadow in the sun\nAnd descant on mine own deformity:\nAnd therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,\nTo entertain these fair well-spoken days,\nI am determined to prove a villain\nAnd hate the idle pleasures of these days.\nPlots have I laid, inductions dangerous,\nBy drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,\nTo set my brother Clarence and the king\nIn deadly hate the one against the other:\nAnd if King Edward be as true and just\nAs I am subtle, false and treacherous,\nThis day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,\nAbout a prophecy, which says that 'G'\nOf Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.\nDive, thoughts, down to my soul: here\nClarence comes.\nEnter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY\n\nBrother, good day; what means this armed guard\nThat waits upon your grace?\n\nCLARENCE\nHis majesty\nTendering my person's safety, hath appointed\nThis conduct to convey me to the Tower.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nUpon what cause?\n\nCLARENCE\nBecause my name is George.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nAlack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;\nHe should, for that, commit your godfathers:\nO, belike his majesty hath some intent\nThat you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.\nBut what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?\n\nCLARENCE\nYea, Richard, when I know; for I protest\nAs yet I do not: but, as I can learn,\nHe hearkens after prophecies and dreams;\nAnd from the cross-row plucks the letter G.\nAnd says a wizard told him that by G\nHis issue disinherited should be;\nAnd, for my name of George begins with G,\nIt follows in his thought that I am he.\nThese, as I learn, and such like toys as these\nHave moved his highness to commit me now.\nGLOUCESTER\nWhy, this it is, when men are ruled by women:\n'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:\nMy Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she\nThat tempers him to this extremity.\nWas it not she and that good man of worship,\nAnthony Woodville, her brother there,\nThat made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,\nFrom whence this present day he is deliver'd?\nWe are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.\n\nCLARENCE\nBy heaven, I think there's no man is secure\nBut the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds\nThat trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.\nHeard ye not what an humble suppliant\nLord hastings was to her for his delivery?\n\nGLOUCESTER\nHumbly complaining to her deity\nGot my lord chamberlain his liberty.\nI'll tell you what; I think it is our way,\nIf we will keep in favour with the king,\nTo be her men and wear her livery:\nThe jealous o'erworn widow and herself,\nSince that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.\nAre mighty gossips in this monarchy.\nBRAKENBURY\nI beseech your graces both to pardon me;\nHis majesty hath straitly given in charge\nThat no man shall have private conference,\nOf what degree soever, with his brother.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nEven so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,\nYou may partake of any thing we say:\nWe speak no treason, man: we say the king\nIs wise and virtuous, and his noble queen\nWell struck in years, fair, and not jealous;\nWe say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,\nA cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;\nAnd that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:\nHow say you sir? Can you deny all this?\n\nBRAKENBURY\nWith this, my lord, myself have nought to do.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nNaught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,\nHe that doth naught with her, excepting one,\nWere best he do it secretly, alone.\n\nBRAKENBURY\nWhat one, my lord?\n\nGLOUCESTER\nHer husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?\n\nBRAKENBURY\nI beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal\nForbear your conference with the noble duke.\n\nCLARENCE\nWe know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nWe are the queen's abjects, and must obey.\nBrother, farewell: I will unto the king;\nAnd whatsoever you will employ me in,\nWere it to call King Edward's widow sister,\nI will perform it to enfranchise you.\nMeantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood\nTouches me deeper than you can imagine.\n\nCLARENCE\nI know it pleaseth neither of us well.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nWell, your imprisonment shall not be long;\nMeantime, have patience.\n\nCLARENCE\nI must perforce. Farewell.\n\nExeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard\n\nGLOUCESTER\nGo, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.\nSimple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,\nThat I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,\nIf heaven will take the present at our hands.\nBut who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?\n\nEnter HASTINGS\n\nHASTINGS\nGood time of day unto my gracious lord!\n\nGLOUCESTER\nAs much unto my good lord chamberlain!\nWell are you welcome to the open air.\nHow hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?\n\nHASTINGS\nWith patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:\nBut I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks\nThat were the cause of my imprisonment.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nNo doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;\nFor they that were your enemies are his,\nAnd have prevail'd as much on him as you.\n\nHASTINGS\nMore pity that the eagle should be mew'd,\nWhile kites and buzzards prey at liberty.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nWhat news abroad?\n\nHASTINGS\nNo news so bad abroad as this at home;\nThe King is sickly, weak and melancholy,\nAnd his physicians fear him mightily.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nNow, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.\nO, he hath kept an evil diet long,\nAnd overmuch consumed his royal person:\n'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.\nWhat, is he in his bed?\n\nHASTINGS\nHe is.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nGo you before, and I will follow you.\n\nExit HASTINGS\n\nHe cannot live, I hope; and must not die\nTill George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.\nI'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,\nWith lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;\nAnd, if I fall not in my deep intent,\nClarence hath not another day to live:\nWhich done, God take King Edward to his mercy,\nAnd leave the world for me to bustle in!\nFor then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.\nWhat though I kill'd her husband and her father?\nThe readiest way to make the wench amends\nIs to become her husband and her father:\nThe which will I; not all so much for love\nAs for another secret close intent,\nBy marrying her which I must reach unto.\nBut yet I run before my horse to market:\nClarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:\nWhen they are gone, then must I count my gains.\n\nExit3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/782988", "artist_names": "Paul Anka", "full_title": "Hello Jim by\u00a0Paul\u00a0Anka", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/630f2ed60ed88f4ea0d7f8e0ec1381d8.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/630f2ed60ed88f4ea0d7f8e0ec1381d8.337x337x1.jpg", "id": 782988, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429194797, "path": "/Paul-anka-hello-jim-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Paul-anka-hello-jim-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/630f2ed60ed88f4ea0d7f8e0ec1381d8.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/630f2ed60ed88f4ea0d7f8e0ec1381d8.337x337x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Hello Jim", "title_with_featured": "Hello Jim", "updated_by_human_at": 1432835977, "url": "https://genius.com/Paul-anka-hello-jim-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/42458", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/7deb5c7c8bca1630de4d1e5eb1d09b54.480x360x1.jpg", "id": 42458, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c1830688225545aefb615c28999dfcb0.727x727x1.jpg", "index_character": "p", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Paul Anka", "slug": "Paul-anka", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Paul-anka"}, "artist": "Paul Anka", "lyrics": "Hello Jim LyricsHello, Jim, what do you say?\nRemember my love\nThat I lost her yesterday\n\nHey, tell me, Jim, what's new with you?\nYou found another girl\nWell, I hope she'll be true\n\nJim, you can't trust them\nAnd don't even try\nOr you'll lose her like I did\nTo some other guy\nKeep one eye on her\nAnd the other on him\nI speak as a buddy\nI'm telling you, Jim\n\nTell me, pal, what's your girl's name?\nThat's very funny\n'Cause my girl's was the same\n\nIs her last name Jones?\nFrom the West end of town?\n\nYeah, thanks a lot, Jim\nSee you around, Good bye Jim\nGoodbye, JimSee Paul Anka LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also likeEmbed"}]
