arrives without a suitcase\nSunday morning creeping like a nun\nMonday's child has learned to tie his bootlace\nSee how they run\n[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]\nLady Madonna, baby at your breast\nWonders how you manage to feed the rest\n\n[Bridge 2: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]\n[Tenor Saxophone Solo: Ronnie Scott]\nSee how they run\n\n[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]\nLady Madonna, lying

with silvery tears\nBetween the salt water and the sea strands\nA soldier cleans and polishes a gun\nThen she'll be a true love of mine\n\n[Verse 4]\nTell her to reap it with a sickle of leather\nWar bellows blazing in scarlet battalions\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme\nGenerals order their soldiers to kill\nAnd gather it all in a bunch of heather\nAnd to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten\nThen she'll be a true love of mine\n\n[Verse 5]\nAre you going to Scarborough Fair?\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme\nRemember me to one who lives there\nShe once was a true love of

me in a lover's trance\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nNow listen, no rabbits in his hand\nNo pigeons up his sleeve\nBut you better believe (You better believe)\nWhen I prove he can do so much\n[Chorus]\nMy baby must be a magician\n'Cause he's sure got the magic touch\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, my morale was low\nThen he appeared just like a genie\nHis love has the power\nHe's my private great Houdini\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nNo reading decks of cards\nNo cords that disappear\nNo special gear\nLike Aladdin's lamp and such\n\n[Chorus]\nBut my baby must be a magician\n'Cause he's sure got the magic touch\n\n[Bridge]\nWhenever I'm feeling bad\nMy baby simply kisses me\nAnd then Presto, Change-o, Ala-kazam\nI'm alright again\nOh, yes I am\nYes, I am alright\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus 3]\nNo mystic crystal ball\nNo long black flowing cape\nBut I can't escape (I can't escape)\nFrom his tender loving touch\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, my baby must be a magician\n'Cause he's sure got the magic

like everything I see\nReflects the love that used to be\n\nIn you I put\nAll my faith and trust\nRight before my eyes\nMy world has turned to dust\n\nAfter all the nights\nI sat alone and wept\nJust a handful of promises\nAre all that's left of loving you\n\nReflections of\nThe way life used to be\nReflections of\nThe love you took from me\n\nIn you I put\nAll my faith and trust\nRight before my eyes\nMy world has turned to dust1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/729160", "artist_names": "The Turtles", "full_title": "You Know What I Mean

to block\nThe wind, the elements\nNothing to buffer them for me to\nKeep them from knocking my pad down, you know\nI mean really socking it to me\nWhen the boiler would bust and the heat was gone\nI would have to get fully dressed before I could go the bed\nCause I couldn't put on my goulashes cause they had buckles on them\nAnd my folks didn't play that\nThey said \"don't you tear up my bed clothes with some goulashes on\"\nBut I was fortunate\nAs soon as I was big enough to get a job save enough money\nTo get a ticket to catch anything\nI split\nI said one day I'm going to return\nAnd I'm going to straighten it all out\nAnd I'm about ready to go back now\nSo I thought I'd tell ya about it\n----------\nThey say this is a big rich town\nBut I live in the poorest part\nI know I'm on a dead-end street\nIn a city without a heart\nI learned to fight before I was six\nThe only way I could get along\nBut when you're raised on a dead-end street\nYou've got to be tough and strong\nNow all the guys I know are getting in trouble\nThat's how its always been\nWhen the odds are all against you\nHow can you win, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI'm going to push my way out of here\nEven though I can't say

going to save my dough\nGet away from here\nI ain't going to come back no more\nI'm tired of a dead-end street\nI want to get out in the world and learn something\nI'm tired of breaking my back\nI

change\nAnd the world puts on a new face\nCertain things rearrange\nAnd this ol' world seems like a new place\n\nOh, yeah, secretly I've been trailin' you\nLike a fox that preys on a rabbit\nI had to get you and so I knew\nI had to learn your ways and habits\nOoh, you were the catch that I was after\nBut I looked up and I was in your arms\nAnd I knew I had been captured\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat's this ol' world comin' to?\nThings just ain't the same\nAnytime the hunter gets captured by the game\nOh, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery day things change\nAnd some old ideas give way to some new\nSome new ideas are strange\nLike the new idea of me being caught by you\n\nOh, yeah, I had laid such a tender trap\nHoping you might fall into it\nBut love hit me like a sudden slap\nOne kiss and then I knew it\n\nOoh, my plan didn't work out like I thought\n'Cause I had laid my trap for you\nBut it seems like I got caught\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat's this ol' world comin' to?\nThings just ain't the same\nAnytime

nothing left but emptiness\nAnd the tears that fill my crying eyes\n\nI've passed this way before\nAnd I've felt this pain before\nA hurt that took so long to end\nHas found my poor heart again\n\nNo matter how strong a man is\nWithout love he walks in the dark\nIf love deserts him it will surely hurt him\nCos his weakness is his heart\n\nA lonely journey now stands before me\nThe endless pain has started\nBut this time I know the way\nWalking alone and broken hearted\n\nIt so hard to face reality\nKnowing loneliness is my destiny\n\nBecause I've passed this way before\nAnd I've felt this pain

people get their kicks stompin' on a dream\nBut I don't let it, let it get me down\n'Cause this fine old world, it keeps spinning around\n[Chorus]\nI've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king\nI've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing\nEach time I find myself flat on my face\nI pick myself up and get back in the race\n\n[Verse 3]\nThat's life (That's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it\nI thought of quitting, baby\nBut my heart just ain't gonna buy it\nAnd if I didn't think it was worth one single try\nI'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king\nI've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing\nEach time I find myself laying flat on my face\nI just pick myself up and get back in the race\n\n[Verse 3]\nThat's life (That's life), that's life and I can't deny it\nMany times I thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it\nBut if there's nothing

taxi cab. He takes a pamphlet for \u2018Haunted Segway Tours\u2019, folds it up, and puts it in his pocket. He plays with the window. He puts his finger in some gum on the ceiling. He tries flicking it off, but it ends up on the camera lense. He picks it off. Cut to the taxi driver. Suddenly, Deadpool sticks his head up front.\n\nDEADPOOL: Kinda lonesome back here.\n\nHe begins climbing up into the passenger seat, grunting.\n\nDEADPOOL: Little help?\nDOPINDER: Sir, I have to keep my hands on the wheel.\n\nDEADPOOL: Excuse me.\n\nHe finishes climbing into the seat and rights himself. The cabbie extends his hand.\n\nDOPINDER: Dopinder.\n\nDEADPOOL: Pool. Dead.\n\nThey shake hands. Deadpool notices a picture of a woman on Dopinder\u2019s dashboard.\n\nDEADPOOL: Mmm. Nice.\n\nDOPINDER: Smells good, no?\n\nDEADPOOL: Not the Daffodil Daydream. The girl.\n\nDOPINDER: Ah, yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She would have made me a very agreeable wife, but, um\u2026 Gita\u2019s heart has been stolen by my cousin Bantu. He is as dishonorable as he is attractive.\n\nDEADPOOL: Dopinder, I\u2019m starting to think there\u2019s a reason I\u2019m in this cab today.\n\nDOPINDER: Yes, sir, you called for it, remember?\n\nDEADPOOL: No, my slender, brown friend. Love is a beautiful thing. When you find it, the whole world tastes like Daffodil Daydream.\nDOPINDER: Mmm.\n\nDEADPOOL: So you gotta hold onto love. Tight!\n\nDeadpool makes a fist. Dopinder copies him.\n\nDEADPOOL: And never let go. Don\u2019t make the same mistakes I did. Got it?\n\nDopinder nods.\n\nDOPINDER: Yes.\n\nDEADPOOL: Or else the whole world tastes like Mama June after hot yoga.\n\nDOPINDER: Sir, what does Miss Mama June taste like?\n\nDEADPOOL: Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.\n\nDOPINDER: Okay, stop.\n\nDEADPOOL: I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is, it\u2019s bad.\n\nDOPINDER: It\u2019s bad. Uh, why the fancy red suit Mr. Pool?\n\nDEADPOOL: Oh, that\u2019s because it\u2019s Christmas Day, Dopinder. And I\u2019m after someone on my naughty list. I\u2019ve been waiting one year, three weeks, six days, and oh\u2026\nHe checks his Adventure Time watch.\n\nDEADPOOL: Fourteen minutes to make him fix what he did to me.\n\nDOPINDER: And what did he do to you?\n\nDEADPOOL: This shit.\n\nDeadpool lifts up his mask, revealing his horribly scarred face.\n\nDEADPOOL: Boo!\n\nCUT TO: AIRPORT RUNWAY\nFrancis sits on top of a crate. A helicopter lands a few yards away. Some men get off. One in particular approaches him. Francis smiles and taps on a crate, standing up.\n\nFRANCIS: They won\u2019t disappoint.\n\nMAN: They better not. What about next month\u2019s shipment?\n\nFRANCIS: There won\u2019t be one. You\u2019re not the only one with a war to win.\n\nMAN: That won\u2019t do.\n\nFRANCIS: See, we\u2019ve had this small disruption to our supply chain.\n\nFrancis grabs the man by the throat and lifts him into the air.\n\nFRANCIS: We\u2019d appreciate your patience.\n\nMAN: Okay!\n\nFRANCIS: We\u2019ll deliver in full the following month.\n\nFrancis drops the man, who chokes a little.\n\nFRANCIS: Pleasure doing business with you.\n\nHe walks away. He and his men leave.\n\nMAN: Fucking mutant.\n\nSome men grab the crates. Francis\u2019s convoy drives off.\nCUT TO: TAXI\nDeadpool begins patting his costume, looking for something. He looks in the backseat.\n\nDEADPOOL: Aw, shit! I forgot my ammo bag!\n\nDOPINDER: Shall we turn back?\n\nDEADPOOL: Nope, no time. Fuck it. I got this. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve bullets, or bust. We\u2019re here!\n\nDopinder slams on the breaks. They\u2019re on the middle of a bridge over a highway.\n\nDOPINDER: That\u2019s uh, twenty seven fifty.\n\nDEADPOOL: I, I never carry a wallet while I\u2019m working. Ruins the lines of my suit.\n\nDOPINDER: Oh.\n\nDEADPOOL: But, uh, how \u2018bout a crisp high-five!\n\nDOPINDER: Okay.\n\nThe high-five.\n\nDEADPOOL: Merry Christmas.\n\nDOPINDER: And a convival Tuesday in April to you too, Mr. Pool!\n\nDeadpool gets out of the cab. Cut to him sitting on the side of the bridge. He\u2019s listening to music and coloring a picture with crayons. Deadpool sings along. We see that the picture he\u2019s drawing is him shooting Francis in the head. He then turns his head to the camera.\nDEADPOOL: Wha- Oh! Oh, hello. I know, right? Who\u2019s balls did I have to fondle to get my very own movie? I can\u2019t tell you, but it does rhyme with Pullverine. And let me tell you; (In an Australian accent) he\u2019s got a nice pair of smooth criminals down under. Anyway, I got places to be, a face to fix, and - oh! Bad guys to kill.\n\nDeadpool spots Francis\u2019s convoy.\n\nDEADPOOL: Maximum effort.\n\nHe walks off of the side of the bridge, landing in one of the cars in the convoy. He beats all of the men in the car, sending one flying out the back, and barely holding on. Deadpool laughs at him. One of the men takes his head and slams it into a car seat.\nDEADPOOL: Rich, corinthian leather.\nHe beats the man holding him down and snaps his neck.\n\nDEADPOOL: I\u2019m looking for Francis. Have you seen this man?\n\nHe holds up his crayon drawing. The man repeatedly shoves Deadpool\u2019s head into the car radio, changing the channel. Someone rides up on a motorcycle next to the car. They fire into the car indiscriminately, killing everyone but Deadpool and the driver. Deadpool kicks the door open, sending the person on the motorcycle flying. The guy holding on to the back of the car starts to pull himself up. Deadpool holds the gas pedal down, and they crash into the car in front of them. Deadpool places both of the men in headlocks. He takes out the cigarette lighter, brand\u2019s one of the men\u2019s foreheads, and shoves it into the man\u2019s mouth, holding his jaw shut.\n\nDEADPOOL: I\u2019ve never said this, but don\u2019t swallow.\n\nAnother car pulls up beside them. Inside, men are prepared to shoot. Deadpool swerves the car, causing it to flip and crash. In front of the car, a man on a motorcycle begins shooting. As the car flips, Deadpool grabs the man on the motorcycle by the waist, pulling him into the spinning wreck. Everything slows down for a moment.\n\nDEADPOOL: Shit. Did I leave the stove on?\n\nEverything returns to normal speed. A chain slices the biker\u2019s head off. Another man is sent flying, crashing into a highway sign. Bodies fall out of the car. Finally, the car comes to a stop.\nCUT TO: THE X-MANSION\nWide shot of the mansion.\n\nREPORTER: Now, breaking news: A multi car collision turns shots fired on the crosstown expressway this morning. Gridlock has kept police from the scene.\n\nCut to the kitchen. Colossus is eating cereal and watching the news.\n\nREPORTER: Residents are advised to remain in their homes the assailant appears to be armed, dangerous, and wearing a red suit.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Red suit.\n\nHe slams his hands on the table, and stands up.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Deadpool. Negasonic! Come. We have mission.\n\nCut to elsewhere in the mansion. Colossus and Negasonic approach a door, which opens automatically.\nNEGASONIC: Colossus, wait up.\n\nThey approach a plane in the hangar.\n\nCOLOSSUS: I\u2019ve given Deadpool every chance to join us. But he\u2019d rather act like a child. A heavily armed child. When will he grow up and see benefits of becoming X-man?\n\nNEGASONIC: Which benefits, the matching unitards? The house that blows up every few years?\n\nCOLOSSUS: Please. House blowing up builds character. You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast is most important meal of day. Here. Protein bar. Good for bones.\n\nHe hands her a protein bar.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Deadpool may try to break yours.\n\nThe plane takes off from the mansion.\nCUT TO: HIGHWAY\nA number of men get out of their cars with guns and approach the car that Deadpool is in. He rolls down the window and pops his head up.\n\nDEADPOOL: Hey! Oh!\n\nThe men begin shooting at him. He puts his dead back down. After a moment they stop. Some of them exchange glances and they all approach the car. Deadpool throws his hands up.\n\nDEADPOOL: Wait! You may be wondering, why the red suit? Well, that\u2019s so bad guys can\u2019t see me bleed. This guy\u2019s got the right idea.\n\nDeadpool points to one of the men.\n\nDEADPOOL: He wore the brown pants.\n\nThe man shoots at the car for a moment. Deadpool puts his hands down.\n\nDEADPOOL: Fine! I only have twelve bullets, so you\u2019re going to have to share. Let\u2019s count \u2018em down.\n\nHe jumps into the air, quickly firing off two shots. The casings say 12 and 11. Two men get shot in the head. The men begin shooting again. One rides past on a motorcycle, shooting as he goes. Deadpool looks down at his arm.\n\nDEADPOOL: Shit.\n\nHe holds his arm up, revealing a bullet hole going straight through. Through the hole, he sees the motorcycle coming back.\n\nDEADPOOL: Mother fucker! Ten. (He shoots and misses). Shit! Nine. (He shoots and misses). Fuck! Eight. (He shoots and misses). Shit fuck!\n\nHe leaps over the car and takes aim, but loses his chance at a good shot.\n\nDEADPOOL: Bad Deadpool.\n\nHe notices one of the men sneaking around the car, unaware that Deadpool is no longer there. Deadpool shoots him in the head.\n\nDEADPOOL: Seven. Good Deadpool.\n\nAnother man begins shooting at him. Deadpool hides behind a car. The man reloads. The man shoots some more, then jumps on top of the car to find Deadpool seductively posed. He tries to shoot, but his gun just clicks.\nDEADPOOL: Someone\u2019s not counting.\nHe shoots the man in the head.\n\nDEADPOOL: Six.\n\nA pair of men approaches. One begins to throw a grenade. Deadpool shoots it while it\u2019s still in the man\u2019s hand, causing it to explode and kill both men. The bullet casing says five on it. Deadpool does a celebratory dance. Someone sneaks up behind him and shoots him. Deadpool lies on the ground, pretending to be dead. The man approaches.\n\nDEADPOOL: Four.\n\nHe shoots the man from between his legs. He gets up, groaning.\n\nDEADPOOL: Ah! Right up main street.\n\nHe walks up to the man he just shot and shoots him twice.\n\nDEADPOOL Three! Two! Stupid! Worth it.\n\nSome more men begin shooting at him. He ducks behind another car. Three men approach. Deadpool jumps over the car and shoots a single bullet, which goes through all three of their heads. The casing says one. Deadpool smells the smoke from his guns.\n\nDEADPOOL: Ooh. I\u2019m touching myself tonight.\n\nDeadpool begins prancing through the wreckage and bodies.\n\nDEADPOOL: Francis! Francis!\n\nHe searches one of the cars.\n\nDEADPOOL: What the shit biscuit! Where you at, Francis?\n\nBehind him, one of the men he shot gets up.\n\nDEADPOOL: Ugh. You\u2019re not Francis.\n\nRather than killing him, the bullet is just lodged in his forehead. He pulls it out and rolls up his sleeves.\n\nDEADPOOL: Really? Rolling up the sleeves?\n\nThe man pulls out some knives and charges Deadpool. Deadpool takes out his swords and skewers the man. Everything slows down to a stop.\n\nDEADPOOL: (Narrating) You\u2019re probably thinking, \u2018My boyfriend said this was a superhero movie, but this guy in the red suit just turned that other guy into a fucking kebab.\u2019 Well, I may be super, but I am no hero. And yeah, technically, this is a murder. But some of the best love stories start with a murder. And that\u2019s exactly what this is. A love story. And to tell it right, I gotta take you back to way before I squeezed this ass into red spandex.\n\nCUT TO: APARTMENT, TWO YEARS AGO\n\nMERCHANT: Look, what if I slow it down for you? I didn\u2019t order the pizza.\n\nJEREMY: Is this 7348 Red Ledge Drive? Are you Mr. Merchant?\n\nMERCHANT: Yeah, the Mr. Merchant, who didn\u2019t order the fucking pie!\n\nJEREMY: Then who placed the call?\n\nWade Wilson calls out from the bathroom.\n\nWADE: I did. Pineapple and olive? Sweet and salty.\n\nThe delivery boy hands the pizza to Wade.\n\nMERCHANT: Fuck are you? The fuck you doing in my crib?\n\nWade pulls out a gun. Merchant backs off.\n\nWADE: Is it bread crust?\n\nJEREMY: Oh, God, I hope not.\n\nMERCHANT: Woah, man, look. If this is about that poker game, I told him, I told Howie that uh\u2026 Just uh, just take whatever you want.\n\nMerchant hands Wade his wallet.\n\nWADE: Thanks.\n\nJEREMY: Sir, before you do anything to him, mind if I get a big tip?\n\nWADE: Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson. That is ah, a no go on the tiperoo, Jer. I\u2019m not here for him. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nMERCHANT: Oh, hey, wow, dodged a big time bullet on that one!\n\nWADE: You\u2019re not out of the woods yet. You need to seriously ease-up on the bedazzling. They\u2019re jeans, not a chandelier. P.S., I am keeping your wallet. You did kind of give it to me.\n\nMERCHANT: Hey, look man, can I just have my Sam\u2019s Card -\n\nWADE: I will shoot your fucking cat.\n\nMERCHANT: I don\u2019t even know what that means. I don\u2019t have a cat.\n\nWADE: Then who\u2019s kitty litter did I just shit in?\n\nNo one says anything for a moment.\n\nWADE: Anywho, tell me something, what situation isn\u2019t improved by pizza? Do you happen to know a Megan, Orflowsky? Orlavsky? Orlovsky? Am I getting that right?\n\nJeremy nods.\n\nWADE: Good.\n\nHe eats a slice of pizza.\n\nWADE: 'Cause she knows you. Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys who take a dime to beat a fella down.\n\nWade hands a piece of pizza to Merchant, who reaches for it, but Wade drops it on the floor.\n\nWADE: And Megan, she\u2019s not made of money, but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.\n\nJEREMY: I\u2019m, uh\u2026\n\nWADE: A stalker. Threats hurt, Jer. But not nearly as much as serrated steel. So keep away from Megan. Cool?\n\nJEREMY: Yes, sir.\n\nWADE: Kay, we\u2019re cool.\n\nJEREMY: Wait, we are?\n\nWADE: Yeah, totally done.\n\nThey all start laughing. Wade points to Merchant.\n\nWADE: You should have seen your face!\n\nMERCHANT: I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was so scared.\n\nWADE: Soft spot, remember?\n\nSuddenly, Wade takes Jeremy by the neck and throws him up against the wall.\n\nWADE: Read a book in her general direction again, and you will learn in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots too. That came out wrong. Or did it?\n\nWade gently kisses Jeremy\u2019s cheek. Jeremy whimpers.\nCUT TO: SKATE PARK\nA bunch of teenagers are hanging out at a skate park. Wade arrives and walks towards a group of girls, point to one of them.\n\nWADE: Megan.\n\nHe throws down a pizza box and some photos of him holding a gun to Jeremy.\n\nWADE: You\u2019ve heard the last of Jeremy. He\u2019s sorry.\n\nMEGAN: No friggin\u2019 way!\n\nDEADPOOL: Shoulda brought my roller blades, show these kids how it\u2019s done.\n\nMegan hugs him.\n\nDEADPOOL: And that\u2019s why we do it. But mostly the money.\n\nGIRL: Think you could fuck up my step-dad?\n\nDEADPOOL: If I give a guy a pavement facial, it\u2019s 'cause he\u2019s earned it.\n\nHe begins to leave.\n\nMEGAN: Hey, wait! You\u2019re my hero.\n\nDEADPOOL: No, no, no, no, no. That I ain't.\n\nCUT TO: SIDEWALK\nWade walks on a sidewalk. As a man walks past him, Wade hits him in the nuts.\n\nWADE: (Narrating) Nope. Never will be.\n\nMAN: Fuck you, Wade.\n\nWADE: (Narrating) I\u2019m just a bad guy who gets paid to fuck-up worse guys.\n\nHe enters a building.\n\nWADE: (Narrating) Welcome to Sister Margaret\u2019s. It\u2019s like a job fair for mercenaries. Think of us like really fucked up tooth fairies, except we knock out the teeth and take the cash. You best hope we never see your name on a gold card.\n\nWade enters a bar. He greets a few men as he walks over to the bartender.\nWEASEL: Wade Wilson. Patron saint of the pitiful. What can I do for you?\n\nWADE: I\u2019d love a blowjob.\n\nWEASEL: Oh God, me too.\n\nWADE: The drink, moose knuckle. But first\u2026\n\nWade takes out a gold card and places it on the bar. Weasel takes it.\n\nWADE: And I ain\u2019t taking any babysitting money, alright? Make sure that gets back to Miss, uh\u2026\n\nWEASEL: Orlovsky?\n\nWADE: Her.\n\nWEASEL: You sure?\n\nWADE: Mhm.\n\nWEASEL: You know, for a merc, you\u2019re pretty warm-blooded. I bet you let the kid off easy, too.\n\nWADE: Oh, he\u2019s not a bad kid, he\u2019s\u2026 Just a little light stalking. I was way worse than him when I was his age. I was traveling to exotic places. Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville. Meeting new and exciting people.\n\nWEASEL: And killing them, yeah. I\u2019ve seen your instagram. So what was special forces doing in Jacksonville?\n\nWADE: That\u2019s classified. They have wonderful T.G.I. Friday\u2019s.\n\nWEASEL: Alright, Kalua, Bailey\u2019s, and whipped cream. I give you: A Blowjob. Ah, why did you make me make that?\n\nWade gets the attention of one of the waitresses.\n\nWADE: Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly. Could you bring that over to Bob, please? And tell him it\u2019s from Buck.\n\nWEASEL: Remind me what good will come of this?\n\nWADE: I don\u2019t take the shits, I just disturb them.\n\nSuddenly, there\u2019s a commotion. One of the mercs punches another in the face. A fight breaks out. Wade and Weasel clink glasses.\n\nWADE: Cheers. To your health.\n\nWEASEL: Fuck you.\n\nOne of the mercs picks up a stool.\n\nWEASEL: That\u2019s a new stool\n\nThe man breaks the stool over another man\u2019s back.One of the mercs gets the better of the other and knocks him to the floor.\n\nMERC: Stay the fuck down.\n\nWeasel walks over.\n\nWEASEL: Alright, move. Move, move, move, move.\n\nHe holds a mirror up to the face of the merc on the ground.\n\nWEASEL: Yup. Still breathing.\n\nMany of the people in the bar groan.\n\nWEASEL: Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.\n\nWADE: You got me. I picked Boothe in the dead pool. Who\u2019d you pick?\n\nWEASEL: You know, Wade, uh, um\u2026\n\nWADE: No\u2026 You did not bet on me to die.\n\nHe looks up at a chalkboard above the bar that has all of the information for the dead pool.\n\nWADE: You bet on me to die. Wow. Mother fucker, you\u2019re the world\u2019s worst friend. But joke\u2019s on you. I\u2019m living to 102, and then dying, like the city of Detroit.\n\nWEASEL: I\u2019m sorry, I just wanted to win money. I never win anything.\n\nWADE: Oh, whatever. Soldiers of fortune, drinks on me!\n\nEveryone in the bar cheers and raises their glasses to Wade.\n\nWEASEL: Domestic! Nothing imported.\n\nA woman approaches Wade.\n\nVANESSA: Woah, woah, woah, woah, baby. You sure you wanna shoot your full wad?\n\nWADE: Uh\u2026 Tight.\n\nVANESSA: Vanessa.\n\nWADE: Wade. What\u2019s a nice place like you doing in a girl like this?\n\nOne of the other mercs slaps her ass.\n\nMERC: I\u2019d hit that.\n\nWADE: You\u2019d best apologize, before\u2026\n\nVanessa tightly grabs the mercs balls.\n\nWADE: \u2026 Yeah. That.\n\nVANESSA: Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.\n\nMERC: I\u2019m sorry.\n\nWADE: Breath through the nose\n\nMERC: I don\u2019t have a filter between my brain and my-\n\nVanessa grabs his balls even harder.\n\nWADE: Hey, woah, hakuna his tatas! He\u2019s sorry. Get out of here, go. Go cast a spell.\n\nWade puts his hand on Vanessa.\n\nVANESSA: Hey, hands off the merchandise.\n\nWADE: Merchandise, oh. So you uh\u2026 Warm fuzzys for money?\n\nVANESSA: Yep.\n\nWADE: Rough childhood?\n\nVANESSA: Rougher than yours. Daddy left before I was born.\n\nWADE: Daddy left before I was conceived.\n\nVANESSA: Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?\n\nWADE: Where else do you put one out?\n\nVANESSA: I was molested.\n\nWADE: Me too. Uncle.\n\nVANESSA: Uncles. They took turns.\n\nWADE: I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole of a locked closet, which also happens to be -\n\nVANESSA: Your bedroom. Lucky. I slept in a dishwasher box.\n\nWade gasps.\n\nWADE: You had a dishwasher! I didn\u2019t even go to sleep. It was pretty much 24/7 ball gags, brownie mix and clown porn.\n\nVanessa laughs.\n\nVANESSA: Who would do such a thing?\n\nWADE: Hopefully you. Later tonight? Hey, what\u2026 What can I get for, uh\u2026 $275 and a yogurt lite rewards card?\n\nVANESSA: Maybe about forty-eight minutes of whatever the fuck you want.\n\nShe puts the yogurt gift card in Wade\u2019s mouth and walks away. Wade follows her.\n\nWEASEL: Did she just put a gift card in your mouth?\n\nCUT TO: ARCADE\nShot of what appears to be Wade on top of Vanessa.\n\nWADE: It\u2019s time to put balls in holes. You said whatever I want.\n\nVANESSA: I get it.\n\nCamera angle changes to shot of them in front of skeeball machines.\n\nVANESSA: You love skeeball. Apparently more than you love vagina.\n\nWADE: It\u2019s a tough call. I just want to get to know the real you. Not the short, 2-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood.\n\nVANESSA: Balls in holes.\n\nWADE: Balls in holes. Prepare to lose tragically.\n\nVANESSA: Bring it, big man.\n\nWADE: Okay.\n\nRather than rolling the ball, Wade throws it directly into the hole labelled \u2018100\u2019.\n\nVANESSA: Ruh-roh.\n\nWADE: Ruh-roh.\n\nCut to wade walking up to the Arcade counter with a ton of tickets.\n\nWADE: A limited edition, Voltron: Defender of the Universe ring, por favor. I\u2019ve had my eye on this sucker for a while.\n\nVANESSA: And I will take the pencil eraser.\n\nARCADE EMPLOYEE: Okay. You are now the proud protector of the planet. And you, can erase stuff, written in pencil.\n\nWADE: M\u2019lady?\n\nHe takes her arm and they walk away.\n\nVANESSA: Well, I hate to break it to you, but your 48 minutes are up.\n\nWADE: Hey, how many more minutes could I get for this? FYI, five mini-lion bots come together to form one super-lion bot.\n\nVANESSA: (Excitedly) Five mini-lion bots? Three minutes.\n\nWADE: What do we do with the remaining two minutes, thirty seven seconds?\n\nVANESSA: Cuddle?\n\nCut to them having sex.\n\nVANESSA: How long can you keep this up?\n\nWADE: All year?\n\nCut to them having sex on a bed covered in rose petals.\n\nVANESSA: Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nCut to them having sex in a room lit by red lanterns.\n\nWADE: Happy Chinese New Year.\n\nVANESSA: Year of the Dog.\n\nCut to Wade looking stressed in bed.\n\nVANESSA: Relax. And happy International Women\u2019s Day.\n\nWADE: Ah! Nope, nope, nope.\n\nCut to them sitting in chairs and reading.\n\nWADE: Happy Lent.\n\nCut to Wade eating her out.\n\nVANESSA: Ow, Wade!\n\nHe sticks his head up. He\u2019s wearing plastic vampire teeth.\n\nWADE: Happy Halloween.\n\nHe takes out the teeth.\n\nWADE: Happy Halloween.\n\nShe laughs. Cut to them having sex on a table covered in food. She shoves some mashed potatoes into his mouth.\n\nVANESSA: Happy Thanksgiving.\n\nWADE: I love you.\n\nCut to Vanessa sitting in bed. Wade approaches her.\n\nWADE: If your left leg is Thanksgiving and your right leg is Christmas, can I visit you between the holidays?\n\nHe pulls the sheets off of her. She\u2019s wearing an ugly Christmas sweater.\n\nWADE: Ugh, that sweater is terrible! But, it looks good on you.\n\nVANESSA: Red\u2019s your color. Brings out the bloodshot in your eyes.\n\nWADE: Listen, I\u2019ve been thinking.\n\nVANESSA: Really?\n\nWADE: About why we\u2019re so good together.\n\nVANESSA: Why\u2019s that?\n\nWADE: Well, your crazy matches my crazy. And we\u2019re like two jigsaw pieces, you know? Um\u2026 Weird, curvy edges.\n\nVANESSA: Put them together and you can see the picture on top. Wade, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you, but only because you haven\u2019t gotten around to asking me. Will you, um\u2026 Stick it it my -\n\nWADE: Marry me?\n\nHe holds up a ring-pop.\n\nVANESSA: Uhh... Jinx? Where were you hiding that?\n\nShot of Wade\u2019s bare ass.\n\nWADE: Nowhere. I spent one month\u2019s salary, so\u2026\n\nVANESSA: You mean it?\n\nWADE: I do.\n\nVANESSA: That\u2019s my line.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nVANESSA: I love you, Wade Wilson.\n\nWADE: So that\u2019s a\u2026 You\u2019re s\u2019posed to -\n\nVANESSA: Yes!\n\nWADE: Yes! Ha ha ha! I feel just like a little girl!\n\nThey spoon in bed.\n\nWADE: What if I just held on and never let go?\n\nVANESSA: Ride a bitch\u2019s back like Yoda on Luke?\n\nWADE: Oh, Star Wars jokes\u2026\n\nVANESSA: Empire.\n\nWADE: Jesus Christ, it\u2019s like I made you in a computer.\n\nThey kiss. He picks up a camera and takes a picture of them.\n\nWADE: Hey. Perfect. Pee break. Shake it, yeah.\n\nShe shakes the picture to dry it off. He gets up to pee.\n\nWADE: (Narrating) Here\u2019s the thing. Life is an endless series of trainwrecks with only brief commercial like breaks of happiness. This had been the ultimate commercial break.\n\nHe finishes peeing and walks back to bed, taking his shirt off.\n\nWADE: (Narrating) Which meant it was time to return to our regularly scheduled program.\n\nHe falls over on the floor, passing out.\n\nVANESSA: Oh, my God! Wade!\n\nCUT TO: HOSPITAL\nShot of an X-Ray of Wade\u2019s body. There are a number of pinkish blobs. Cut to Wade and Vanessa sitting in a doctor\u2019s office.\n\nWADE: You\u2019re clowning. You\u2019re not clowning? I sense clowns.\n\nDOCTOR: People react to news of late-stage cancer differently. There are certainly options we can look into. Drugs are being developed every day.\n\nWade and Vanessa look at each other.\n\nVANESSA: So what do we do? Surely there must be something we can do. My uncle Ivan was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and all these new experimental drugs\u2026\n\nHer voice fades out. Wade looks at her.\n\nWADE: (Narrating) Vanessa\u2019s already working on plan A, B, all the way through Z. Me? I\u2019m memorizing the details of her face. Like it\u2019s the first time I\u2019m seeing it. Or the last.\n\nDOCTOR: Mr. Wilson. Mr Wilson? Take your time to process this. It\u2019s important not to do anything rash.\n\nCUT TO: BRIDGE\nCut back to the carnage on the bridge. Deadpool is skewering a guy with his swords, and cuts him in half. He puts his sword away.\n\nDEADPOOL: Now, if I were a two-hundred pound sack of assholes named Francis, where would I hide? Oh.\n\nA motorcycle starts. He turns around. The motorcycle speeds past him, shooting. Deadpool jumps into the air, throwing his sword into the front wheel of the motorcycle. The biker flies off. Deadpool walks over.\n\nDEADPOOL: A hush falls over the crowd. Rookie sensation Wade W. Wilson out of Regina, Saskatchewan lines up the shot. His form looks good.\n\nDeadpool kicks the biker in the chest, sending him back down.\n\nDEADPOOL: And that's why Regina rhymes with fun. Ladies and gentlemen, what you're witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge.\n\nDeadpool continues beating the biker.\n\nDEADPOOL: Oh! Giving him the business.\n\nHe throws the biker to the side of the bridge.\n\nDEADPOOL: Incoming!\n\nHe kicks the biker's helmet off, revealing it to be Francis.\n\nDEADPOOL: This is taking unsportsmanlike conduct to a whole new level!\n\nHe stabs his sword through Francis's shoulder and into the bridge barrier, pinning him down.\n\nDEADPOOL: Looking good, Francis. Well rested. Like you've been pitching, not catching. Ringing any bells? No?\n\nHe lifts his mask up.\n\nDEADPOOL: How about now?\n\nFRANCIS: Huh. Wade fucking Wilson. Well hello, gorgeous.\n\nDEADPOOL: Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Sharpei. Yeah, and whose fault is that, Francis? Time to undo what you did to this butterface.\n\nFRANCIS: You should thank me. Apparently I made you immortal. I'm actually quite jealous.\n\nDEADPOOL: Yeah, but this ain't a life worth living, is it? Now, I'm about to do to you what Limp Bizkit did to music in the late '90s.\nColossus walks up behind Deadpool. Deadpool raises his hand, hitting Colossus in the crotch. He feels around for a second.\n\nDEADPOOL: Dad?\n\nColossus throws him into a car.\n\nDEADPOOL: (Narrating) I think we can all agree that shit just went sideways in the most colossal way.\n\nCut to an action figure of Deadpool from the Wolverine Origins movie.\n\nDEADPOOL: (Narrating) Well, maybe not the most.\nCUT TO: WADE & VANESSA'S APARTMENT\nWADE: Now this is my most prized possession.\n\nHe picks up and album by Wham!\n\nVANESSA: Wham?\n\nWADE: No, no, no, no. Wham! Make It Big is the album that George and Andy earned the exclamation point.\n\nVANESSA: So, am I supposed to just smile and wave you out the door?\n\nWADE: Think of it like spring cleaning. Only, if spring was death. God, if I had a nickel for every time I spanked it to Bernadette Peters.\n\nHe picks up a coin bag with Bernadette Peters on it. Vanessa takes it and shakes it.\n\nVANESSA: Sounds like you do. Bernadette is not going anywhere, because you're not going anywhere! Drink.\n\nShe hands him a glass.\n\nWADE: You're right. Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate, and brain. All things I can live without.\n\nVANESSA: You belong here at home. Surrounded by your Ultron, and your Bernadette, and your me.\n\nWADE: Listen, we both know that cancer is a shitshow. Like, Yakoff Smirnoff opening for the Spin Doctors at the Iowa State Fair, shitshow. And under no circumstances will I take you to that show. I want you to remember me. Not the ghost of Christmas me.\n\nVANESSA: Well, I want to remember us!\n\nWADE: I swear to God, I'm gonna find you in the next life, and I'm gonna boombox Careless Whisper outside your window. Wham!\n\nVANESSA: No one is boomboxing shit, okay?\n\nShe sits down next to him.\n\nVANESSA: We can fight this. Besides, I just realized something. You win. Your life is officially way more fucked up than mine.\n\nWADE: I love you.\n\nThey start making out.\nCUT TO: BAR\nWade walks in.\n\nWEASEL: Wade.\n\nWade sits at the bar.\n\nWADE: Wease.\n\nWEASEL: You look like you need a blowjob and a shower. Courtesy calls for the latter first.\n\nWADE: Yeah, how about three shots of Patron?\n\nWEASEL: Yeah, how about Triticum aestivum? Wheat grass. Excellent for the immune system.\n\nWADE: Jesus Christ, you sound like Vanessa. Here, check it out. She's sending away for all these colorful clinic brochures.\n\nHe pulls out a bunch of brochures.\n\nWADE: I'm sure they're all FDA approved. Chechnya. Isn't that where you go to get cancer? We've got China, and central Mexico. You know how they say cancer in spanish?\n\nWEASEL: How?\n\nWADE: El cancer.\n\nWEASEL: Oh. I could have guessed that. Look how happy you look here?\n\nHe shows Wade the picture he took of himself and Vanessa.\n\nWEASEL: Mind if I keep this? Put it up, so I can remember? When you looked alive. At least now I'm gonna win the dead pool, now that you're gonna die tragically of cancer.\n\nWADE: Thanks.\n\nWEASEL: Oh, and that guy over there came in looking for you.\n\nHe hands wade a card with a number on it.\n\nWEASEL: Real grim reaper type. I dunno. Might further the plot.\n\nWade walks over to the man and sits down.\n\nMAN: Ah! Mr. Wilson.\n\nWADE: How can I help you? Besides luring children into a panel van.\n\nMAN: I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.\n\nWADE: Stalker alert.\n\nMAN: My job. Recruitment. I'm sorry you've had such a tough go. But you're a fighter. Special forces, forty-one confirmed kills.\n\nWADE: One every seven weeks. At that rate, most folks get a haircut.\n\nHe takes a sip of his drink.\n\nWADE: It's to wash the taste out. Of being so... impressive.\n\nMAN: And now you spend your days sticking up for the little people.\n\nWADE: People change. What do you want?\n\nMAN: I represent an organization of people that may be able to help. What if I told you we can cure your cancer? And what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of.\n\nWADE: I'd say that you sound like an infomercial. But not a good one, like Slapchop, more Shakeweighty.\n\nWade makes a shakeweight gesture.\n\nMAN: The world needs extraordinary soldiers. We won't just make you better. We will make you better than better. A superhero.\n\nWADE: Look, Agent Smith. I tried the superhero business and it left a mark. But if I ever hit, 'Fuck it', I'll hit you up. Oh, uh, shit. We're within 500 yards of a school, so you may wanna... You know. Yeah.\n\nWade gets up and leaves, going back over to the bar.\n\nWADE: His drinks on him.\n\nCUT TO: WADE AND VANESSA'S APARTMENT\nWade sits in a chair.\n\nVANESSA: Hey, what's going on?\n\nWADE: Hey, sorry. I had a Liam Neeson nightmare. I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it.\nHe gets into bed.\n\nWADE: Hey, uh, they made three of those movies. At some point you have to wonder if he's just a bad parent.\nCut to Wade packing.\n\nWADE: (Narrating) The worst part about cancer isn't what it does to you. But what it does to the people you love. Who knew if this guy could save my life. But I knew there was only one way I could save hers.\n\nHe leaves.\n\nWADE: (Narrating) Isn't that what superheroes do?\n\nWade calls the man.\nCUT TO: BRIDGE\nDeadpool is frozen midair after Colossus threw him.\n\nDEADPOOL:  Okay. Let's pro-con this superhero thing. Pro: they pull down a gaggle of ass. Dry cleaning-discounts, lucrative film deals both origin stories and larger ensemble team movies. Con: They're all lame-ass teacher's pets.\n\nCOLOSSUS: You know I can hear you.\n\nDEADPOOL: I'm not talking to you. I was talking to them.\n\nHe points at the camera.\n\nCOLOSSUS: (To Francis) Stay right here. You've been warned before, Deadpool. This is a shameful and reckless use of your powers. You will both be coming with us.\n\nDEADPOOL: Look, Colossus! I don't have time for the goody-two-shoes bullshit right now! And... you are?\n\nNEGASONIC: Negasonic Teenage Warhead.\n\nDEADPOOL: Negasonic Teenage... What the shit? That's the coolest name ever! So what, you're like his sidekick?\n\nCOLOSSUS: No, trainee.\n\nDEADPOOL: Let me guess. X-men left you behind on, what, shit detail?\n\nNEGASONIC: What does that make you?\n\nDEADPOOL: Pretending you're not here, Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Trade names?\n\nHe punches Francis.\n\nNEGASONIC: Can we go?\n\nDEADPOOL: Look! I'm a teenage girl! I'd rather be anywhere than here. I'm all about long, sullen silences, followed by mean comments, followed by more silences. So what's it gonna be, huh? Long sullen silence, or mean comment? Go on.\n\nNEGASONIC: You've got me in a box here.\n\nDEADPOOL: Ah-hah!\n\nCOLOSSUS: We can't allow this Deadpool. Please, come quietly.\n\nDEADPOOL: You big, chrome, cock-gobbler!\n\nCOLOSSUS: That's not nice.\n\nDEADPOOL: You're really gonna fuck this up for me? Trust me. That wheezing bag of dick tips has it coming! He's pure evil! Besides, nobody's getting hurt!\n\nThe body that splattered onto the highway sign falls off. The three of them turn to look.\n\nDEADPOOL: That guy was already up there when I got here.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Wade, you're better than this! Join us! Use your powers for good.\n\nDeadpool tosses a metal disk at Francis, hitting him in the face.\n\nDEADPOOL: Heads up.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Be a superhero!\n\nDEADPOOL: Listen, the day I decide to become a crime-fighting shit-swizzler, who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners, at the Neverland mansion of some creepy, old, bald, Heaven's Gate-looking mother fucker, on that day... I'll send your shiny happy ass a friend request. But until then, I'm gonna do what I came here to do. Either that, or slap the bitch out of you.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Wade...\n\nNEGASONIC: Hey -\n\nDEAPOOL: Zip it, Sinead!\n\nNEGASONIC: Hey, douchepool!\n\nDEADPOOL: And I hope you're watching!\n\nHe turns around to point at Francis, who is no longer there. He gasps.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Quite unfortunate.\n\nDeadpool looks back and forth at where Colossus is and where Francis was.\n\nDEADPOOL: That does it!\n\nHe jumps up and hits Colossus's head, breaking his hand.\n\nDEADPOOL: Oh, Canada! That's not good.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Wade, please.\n\nDEADPOOL: Cock shot!\n\nWith his good hand, he punches Colossus in the crotch. This does nothing but break his hand.\n\nDEADPOOL: Oh, your poor wife!\n\nCOLOSSUS: You really should stop.\n\nHe holds his broken hands in front of him.\n\nDEADPOOL: All the dinosaurs feared the T-rex.\n\nHe flips up into the air, breaking his foot upon contact with Colossus's head. Negasonic laughs.\n\nDEADPOOL: Ah! I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!\n\nCOLOSSUS: This is embarrassing. Please, stay down.\n\nDEADPOOL: You ever hear of the one-legged man in the ass-kicking contest?\n\nDeadpool gets up and hops on one leg, holding his other three broken limbs up.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Do you have off switch?\n\nDEADPOOL: Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the on switch?\n\nCOLOSSUS: Enough!\n\nColossus hits him into a car. Negasonic laughs. Deadpool moans in pain. Colossus handcuffs him and drags him along.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Let us go talk to the professor.\n\nDEADPOOL: McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines are so confusing. Dead or alive you're coming with me!\n\nCOLOSSUS: You will recover, Wade. You always do.\n\nDeadpool snaps his arm back into place and takes out a knife.\n\nDEADPOOL: (To the camera) You ever see 127 Hours? Spoiler alert.\n\nDeadpool begins cutting his own hand off, escaping the handcuffs.\n\nNEGASONIC: Oh, my God. Nasty.\n\nA spurt of blood hits Colossus in the face.\n\nDEADPOOL: Oh, there's the money shot, baby! Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.\nDeadpool flips off of the bridge and lands in a truck passing underneath. His hand, still in the handcuff, is flipping off Colossus. Cut to Deadpool in the back of the truck.\n\nDEADPOOL: Rock, meet Bottom. When life ends up breath-takingly fucked, you can generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.\n\nCUT TO: DIMLY LIT FACILITY\nWADE is on a stretcher.\n\nWADE: (Narrating) The one that sent you down the road to shittsburgh. This, well, this was mine.\n\nMAN: Mr. Wilson, nothing warms my heart more than a change of someone else's. You finally hit, 'Fuck it'.\n\nWADE: Just promise me you'll do right by me. So I can do right by someone else.\n\nMAN: Of course.\n\nWADE: And please don't make the super suit green. Or animated!\nWade is brought into a large room with a lot of other people. One woman has spikes on her back. Another is bleeding and panting.\n\nWADE: This place seems sanitary. My first request is warmer hands.\n\nSome men put him on a chair and strap him down.\n\nWADE: And, Jesus, a warmer table! You should really come up with a safe word fellas. I'm thinking pork and beans.\n\nA woman comes by and pushes his head down, strapping him in.\n\nWADE: Aren't you a little strong for a lady? I'm calling wang. What's up with the matches? Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?\nShe puts her hand over his mouth.\n\nFRANCIS: Patience, Angel.\n\nShe removes her hand.\n\nFRANCIS: All in good time.\n\nWADE: Are you here for the turn down service or what?\n\nFRANCIS: We have another talker.\n\nWADE: I'm just excited about my first day at super hero camp.\n\nANGEL: Shut the fuck up.\n\nShe puts a rag over his mouth. Francis inspects him.\n\nFRANCIS: Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax. I manage this workshop. My welcome speech used to be filled with euphemisms like, 'This may hurt a little'. 'This may cause you some discomfort'. But I've grown blunt. This workshop is not a government-led program. It's a private institution that turns reclamation projects like yourself into men of extraordinary abilities. But if you think superhuman powers are acquired painlessly, well... I'm injecting with a serum that activates any mutant genes lurking in your DNA. For it to work, we need to subject you to extreme stress.\n\nFrancis puts an IV into Wade's arm and turns on a machine. A blue liquid begins to flow through.\n\nFRANCIS: You've heard the whole, make an omelette break some eggs thing, right? I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was a patient here once myself, you know. The treatment affects everyone differently. It made Angel inhumanly strong. In my case, it enhanced my reflexes, and scorched my nerve endings so I not longer feel pain. And in fact, I no longer feel anything.\nWade starts mumbling. Angel removes his gag.\n\nWADE: Thank you! Thank you. You have something in your teeth. Just in the middle there. Romaine lettuce, or something. It's been bothering me for a long time.\n\nFrancis checks his teeth.\n\nWADE: Ha! Made you look. Hey, is Ajax your actual name? Because it sounds suspiciously made up. What is it really? Kevin? Ruth? Scott? Mitch? Dexter? Is it Basil Fawlty?\n\nFRANCIS: Joke away. The one thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor.\n\nWADE: We'll see about that.\n\nFRANCIS: I suppose we will. He's all yours.\n\nFrancis leaves.\n\nWADE: Oh, come on. You're going to leave me all alone here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?\n\nShe punches him. A montage of experiments on Wade begins, with Francis narrating.\n\nFRANCIS: This is how it's going to work. Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum, so we're going to have to make you suffer. If you're lucky, your mutant genes will activate and manifest in spectacular fashion. If not, well, we'll have to keep hurting you. In new and more painful ways, each more different than the last. Until you finally mutate. Or die.\n\nCut to Wade talking with another man.\n\nWADE: Got a bucket list? I'd really like to light a spliff off of the Olympic Torch.\n\nCUNNINGHAM: Pass it to me right after.\n\nWADE: Let's not forget naked tandem base jumping with the WNBA Sacramento Monarchs.\n\nCUNNINGHAM: Anything on my bucket list would involve public nudity.\n\nWADE: Giving Meredith Baxter Birney a dutch oven.\n\nCUNNINGHAM: No, receiving a dutch oven from Meredith Baxter Birney. Making banana pancakes for my kids.\n\nWADE: Vanessa. I wanna see Vanessa.\n\nFRANCIS: Lovely. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm touched.\n\nCUNNINGHAM: We're just joking.\n\nFRANCIS: No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions. Wouldn't want you giving up on us, now would we?\n\nWADE: Hey, don't take any shit from him, Cunningham. How tough can he be, with a name like Francis.\n\nCUNNINGHAM: Francis?\n\nWADE: That's his legal name. He got Ajax from the dish soap. F, R, A, N, C, I, oops! I snabbed the dry-cleaning tag off your lab coat. FYI, I could probably get you the super hero discount.\n\nFRANCIS: You are so relentlessly annoying.\n\nWADE: Thanks. Never heard that before.\n\nFRANCIS: Why don't you do us all a favor and shut the fuck up? Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.\n\nWADE: Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you. See, here's the problem with round-the-clock torture. You can't really step it up from there.\n\nFRANCIS: Is that what you think?\n\nCut to Wade being strapped down in a machine.\n\nFRANCIS: If this doesn't unlock your mutation, well... Nothing will. Now, what we're going to do is lower the oxygen concentration in there to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating. If your brain waves slow, meaning you're about to pass out, then we'll turn up the O2. If your heart rate slows, meaning you're able to catch your breath, we'll turn it back down. And that's where we'll leave you. Right there.\n\nWADE: Ugh, I thought you guys were dicks before.\n\nFRANCIS: You know the funniest part of all this? You still think we're making you a super hero. You, a dishonorable discharge hook deep in hookers? You're nothing. Our secret, mate, is that this workshop doesn't make super heroes. We make super slaves. We're gonna fit you with a control collar and auction you off to the highest bidder. Who knows what they'll have you do. Terrorizing citizens, putting down freedom fighters. Maybe just mow the occasional lawn.\n\nWADE: What the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nFRANCIS: You're never going home after this. now there's a brave face.\n\nWADE: Wait, wait! Seriously, you actually have something in your teeth now.\n\nFRANCIS: Enjoy your weekend.\n\nWADE: Weekend? Back up, weekend?\n\nFrancis starts the machine. Wade begins choking. Cut to night. His whole body begins to transform.\n\nWADE: (Narrating) Did I say this was a love story? No, it's a horror movie.\n\nWade begins screaming. Cut to day time. Francis comes back and turns off the machine.\n\nFRANCIS: Fucking hell. Looks like someone lost his shot at homecoming king.\n\nWADE: What have you done to me?\n\nFRANCIS: I've merely raised your stress levels high enough to trigger a mutation.\n\nWADE: You sadistic fuck!\n\nFRANCIS: I've cured you, Wade. Now your mutated cells can heal anything. It's attacking your cancer as fast as it can form. You know, I've seen some of the side effects before. I could cure them. But where's the fun in that? Now I'm gonna shut you in again Wade. Not because I need to. Because I want to. Ah, well. Go ahead.\n\nAngel fiddles with the straps.\n\nANGEL: You smell like shit.\n\nWade head butts her.\n\nANGEL: Mother fucker -\n\nFRANCIS: Hey, hey, hey! It's alright! It's alright. I think we owe him that, yeah? Take off. Go on, off you go. Quick question. What's my name? Didn't think so.\n\nHe closes the machine and turns it on.\n\nWADE: (Narrating) Sorry, Francis, my lips are sealed.\n\nIn the machine, Wade reveals that he took a match from Angel. He lights it and throws it towards the oxygen vent. After a few moments, the machine explodes, causing massive damage to the facility and starting a fire. Francis comes down with a fire extinguisher. He sees that Wade escaped from the machine. Wade charges him with a metal pipe and they begin fighting.\n\nFRANCIS: You don't wanna kill me! I'm the only one that can fix your barking mug!\n\nThey continue fighting. Francis gains the upper hand and skewers Wade with a metal pipe, bending it to prevent him from getting up.\n\nFRANCIS: What's my name?\n\nFrancis leaves.\n\nCUNNINGHAM: Wade...\n\nWade looks up to see Cunningham. Cut to much later, after the fire has died out. Wade rises up out of the dirt and rubble.\n\nWADE: (Narrating) I didn't just get the cure to el cancer. I got the cure to el everything. But there was only one thing that really mattered.\nCUT TO: STREET\nVanessa walks down a sidewalk. Wade follows her. A lot of people give him strange looks. He watched Vanessa purchase something at a market and follows her to her apartment. She enters, but he walks away.\nCUT TO: BAR\n\nWADE: No way. I'm not making her life as ugly as mine, man.\n\nWEASEL: Oh, come on, Wade. It can't be that bad.\n\nWADE: Ah, bullshit! I'm a monster inside and out. I belong in a fucking circus!\n\nWEASEL: Wade, Vanessa loves you. She doesn't care what you - Oh. Oh.\n\nWADE: Do you like what you see?\n\nWEASEL: No. You look like an avocado had sex with an older, more disgusting avocado.\n\nWADE: Yeah.\n\nWEASEL: And not gently. Like, it was hate fucking. There was something wrong with the relationship, and that was the only catharsis they could find without violence.\n\nWADE: And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug is the brown shitstick from the mutant factory, and he's gone! Poof.\n\nWEASEL: Yeah, you've got to do something to remedy this, 'cause as of now you only have on course of action.\n\nWADE: Damn straight. Find Francis -\n\nWEASEL: Star in horror films.\n\nWADE: What?\n\nWEASEL: Star in your own horror films. 'Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face fucked a topographical map of Utah.\n\nWADE: Here's what I'm actually going to do. I'm going to work through his crew until somebody gives up Francis, force him to fix this, put a bullet in his skull, and fuck the brain hole.\n\nWEASEL: I don't want to see that or think of it again. But the douchebag does think you're dead, right?\n\nWADE: Yeah.\n\nWEASEL: That's good. You should keep it that way.\n\nWADE: What, like, wear a mask?\n\nWEASEL: Yes, a very thick mask, all the time. I am sorry, you are... haunting. Your face is the stuff of nightmares.\n\nWADE: Like a testicle with teeth.\n\nWEASEL: You will die alone. If, I mean, if you could die. Ideally. For others' sake.\n\nWADE: That'll do.\n\nWEASEL: All you need now is a suit and a nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker, or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie... Oh shit.\n\nWADE: What?\n\nWEASEL: I put all my money on you, and I just realized I'm never going to win the -\n\nWADE: Deadpool. Captain Deadpool. No, just Deadpool. Yeah.\n\nWEASEL: Yeah. To you, Mr. Pool. That sounds like a fucking franchise.\n\nThe clink glasses. Cut to a Deadpool making his costume.\n\nDEADPOOL: This shit's gonna have nuts in it.\n\nHe attacks some guys, shouting 'Where's Francis?' Back at his apartment, he realizes his clothes are covered in blood. Cut to him in a laundry mat. An old blind woman addresses him.\n\nAL: Seltzer water and lemon for blood. Or wear red. Dumbass.\n\nCut to him making a new, red costume. Cut to him interrupting a boxing match and attacking a man there.\n\nDEADPOOL: Don't make me ask twice. Where's Francis?\n\nCut to him in his apartment, stabbing a picture of the man.\n\nDEADPOOL: He made me ask twice. Is it the mask?\n\nCut to him making the newest costume. Cut to a montage of him killing people and asking where Francis is. Cut to an ice rink. A man is bleeding and crawling on the floor. Deadpool follows him with a Zamboni and laughs.\n\nDEADPOOL: You're about to be killed by a Zamboni!\nBack to the montage of killing people, and shouting various insults at people. Finally, Deadpool only has one person left to track down; the man who recruited him. Cut to that man recruiting another man. He gives the man a card and leaves with two guards. Deadpool confronts them.\n\nDEADPOOL: Nice to see you, Jared. I'll take the footlong. Fully loaded.\nThe man runs away. Deadpool kills the two guards and catches up.\n\nDEADPOOL: 41 confirmed kills. Now it's 89. About to be 90.\n\nMAN: Mr. Wilson?\n\nDEADPOOL: Ding ding!\n\nMAN: You're looking very... alive.\n\nDEADPOOL: Ha! Only on the outside.\n\nMAN: This isn't going to end well for me.\n\nDEADPOOL: This is not gonna end well for you, no. Where's your boss?\n\nMAN: I can tell you exactly -\n\nDEADPOOL: Ah, da, da, da, da ,da ,da, da. Oh, you'll tell me. But first, you might want to look away for this.\n\nDeadpool pushes the camera away.\n\nDEADPOOL: Now this little piggy went to...\n\nMAN: Ah!\n\nCut back to Deadpool's apartment. He sticks a knife in a picture of the recruiter.\n\nDEADPOOL: Thank you, Agent Smith.\nCut to Deadpool leaving his apartment and hailing a cab. Dopinder is inside.\n\nDOPINDER: Hop in!\n\nDeadpool gets in, then addresses the camera.\n\nDEADPOOL: And we all know how this turned out.\n\nFast-forward through the cab drive and the bridge fight scene. Deadpool is holding a unicorn plushie and masturbating.\n\nDEADPOOL: Whoops! You weren't meant to see that.\n\nRewind to him escaping Colossus and ending up in the truck.\n\nDEADPOOL: There. All caught up.\n\nCUT TO: OUTSIDE DEADPOOL'S APARTMENT\nDeadpool gets out of the truck.\n\nDEADPOOL: Sorry about bleeding in all of your garbage! Seltzer water and lemon for blood. Whoo! Some kinds of anger can't be managed. Like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered! That said, when it comes time for licking wounds, there's no place like home. And I share that home with someone you've met. The old blind lady from the laundry mat, Al.\n\nAL: God, I miss cocaine.\n\nDEADPOOL: Her. Ah! Fourth wall break in a fourth wall break. That's like... sixteen walls! She's like Robin to my Batman, except she's old. And black. And blind. And I think she's in love with me. Wait, I'm pretty sure Robin loves Batman too.\nHe knocks on the door. Al goes to answer it, but trips and falls.\n\nDEADPOOL: Al?\n\nHe opens the door.\n\nDEADPOOL: Good morning, sleepy head. It smells like old lady pants in here.\n\nAL: Yes, I'm old, I wear pants.\n\nDEADPOOL: But you're no lady.\n\nDeadpool takes off his shoes and puts crocs on.\n\nDEADPOOL: Oh! So comfy.\n\nAL: Upside of being blind, I've never seen you in crocs.\n\nDEADPOOL: You mean my big rubber masturbatin' shoes?\n\nAL: Yes, I know. Downside of being blind. I hear everything in this duplex.\n\nDEADPOOL: Sit on a stick.\n\nAL: Bactine?\n\nDEADPOOL: Yeah. Bactine should do it.\n\nHe lifts up his hand, which is slowly starting to grow back. Al is assembling furniture.\n\nDEADPOOL: How's that Cunen coming along? IKEA doesn't assemble itself, you know.\n\nAL: You're telling me. I don't mind the Cunen. It's an improvement on the Holdall.\n\nDEADPOOL: Please. Anything's an improvement over the Holdall. I'd have taken and Emness or a Tristes over the Holdall. No, I didn't get excited until I saw the Cunen.\n\nAL: Screw please.\n\nDEADPOOL: Here? Now? Just kidding, I know it's been decades.\n\nAL: You'd be surprised.\n\nDEADPOOL: Pretty grossed out.\n\nAL: Ta da.\n\nShe finishes the furniture and sits down. After a moment, it completely falls apart.\n\nAL: I wish I'd never heard of Craigslist.\n\nDEADPOOL: And I quote, 'Looking for blind and likes imperfections, must be good with hands.' Or would you rather I build the ikea and you pay rent?\n\nAL: Why so douchy this morning?\n\nDEADPOOL: Let's recap. The cock-thistle that turned me into this freak slipped through my arms today. Arm. Catching him my only chance to be hot again, get my super sexy ex back, and prevent this shit from happening to someone else. So yeah, today was about as much fun as a sand paper dildo.\n\nHe's grabbed some lube and a unicorn plushie. As he walks by Al into his room, he loudly farts.\n\nDEADPOOL: Hashtag drive by.\n\nCUT TO: WAREHOUSE\nFrancis pulls up outside. Inside, Angel is getting some super slaves ready. Francis walks in.\n\nFRANCIS: Found out who our friend in the red suit is.\n\nCut to Angel repairing his clothes.\n\nFRANCIS: Fucking Wade Wilson. Of course, I'd wear a mask too with a face like that. I only wish I healed the same. Still. We'll put him out of our misery. On our terms.\n\nANGEL: Right. And when he heals?\n\nFRANCIS: He can't. Not if there's nothing left of him to heal. You know, it's funny. I almost missed the fucker. I like a challenge. But he's bad for business. Now let's go and find him.\n\nCUT TO: DEADPOOL'S APARTMENT\nDeadpool sits on the couch. Al comes over with a drink.\n\nAL: Tylenol PM?\n\nDEADPOOL: I'd stick that where you stuck the Bactine. I raided my stash of wisdom teeth Percocet and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.\n\nHe strokes her chin with his hand, which looks like a baby's hand.\n\nDEADPOOL: I appreciate the gesture.\n\nAL: Am I crazy, or is your hand really small?\n\nDEADPOOL: It's about the size of a KFC spork.\n\nAL: I get why you're so pissy. But your mood's never going to right until you find this woman and tell her how you feel!\n\nDEADPOOL: I keep telling you, Mrs. Magoo, she wouldn't have me! If you could see me, you'd understand.\n\nAL: Looks aren't everything.\n\nDEADPOOL: Looks are everything! You ever heard David Beckham speak? It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium! You think Ryan Reynolds got this far on his superior acting method?\n\nAL: Love is blind, Wade.\n\nDEADPOOL: No. You're blind.\n\nAL: So you're just gonna lie there and whimper?\n\nDEADPOOL: No, I'm gonna wait till this arm plows through puberty, and then I'm gonna come up with a whole new Christmas Day plan. In the meantime, you might wanna leave the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand. Go, go, go, go, go ,go.\n\nShe begins to get up.\nCUT TO: THE BAR\nWeasel is telling a joke to some men.\n\nWEASEL: So the doctor says, 'Well the bad news is, you don't have that much time to live?' He says, 'How long do I have?' The doctor says, 'Five.' The guy says, 'Five what?' The doctor says, 'Four, three, two...'\n\nHe and the men laugh. Weasel notices that Francis, Angel, and some of their men have come in.\n\nWEASEL: Can I help you ladies?\n\nFRANCIS: Well, I sure hope so. I heard you might be able to point me in the direction of a, um... A friend of mine. Name of Wade Wilson.\n\nWEASEL: Sorry. I don't know the name.\n\nAngel reaches and grabs something on the back wall.\n\nWEASEL: Hey, you're not supposed to be behind the bar.\n\nANGEL: I recognize that girl.\n\nFRANCIS: This must be Vanessa. I've heard so much about you.\n\nAngel holds Weasel up against the wall. Everyone in the bar pulls out a gun and points it at her.\n\nWEASEL: Um, sweetheart, you might want to look around. This isn't really the place to do something like that.\n\nFRANCIS: Easy, Angel. Put the little man down.\n\nShe puts Weasel down.\n\nFRANCIS: We have everything we need now.\n\nWEASEL: You sure? You don't want any clothes that aren't monochromatic? Have fun at your midnight showing of Blade 2.\nAngel and Francis leave.\n\nWEASEL: Woo. Thanks for having my back, guys.\n\nHe calls Deadpool.\n\nWEASEL: Wade, we have a fucking problem. And by we, I mean you.\n\nCUT TO: STREET\nDeadpool and Weasel walk down a sidewalk.\n\nDEADPOOL: I can't believe I'm doing this. Is there a word for half afraid, half angry?\n\nWEASEL: Yeah, afrangry, I guess. Do you know what you're going to say to her?\n\nDEADPOOL: Ugh, fuck me.\n\nWEASEL: Uh, I'd maybe not start with that.\n\nThey enter a strip club.\nDJ: Hey, coming up on stage right now, give it up for Chastity!\n\nWEASEL: Or, as I like to call her, irony.\n\nDEADPOOL: We've got to find her fast, before numbnuts does.\n\nWEASEL: How do you know she's in here?\n\nDEADPOOL: 'Cause I'm constantly stalking the fox.\n\nWeasel gets distracted by a stripper. Deadpool searches and eventually finds Vanessa.\n\nDEADPOOL: (Narrating) Every time I see her, it's like the first time. Especially from this angle.\n\nHe approaches her, but stops short of getting her attention and instead walks away.\n\nDJ: You can't find love, but you can rent it for three minutes!\n\nCut to Deadpool washing his face in the bathroom.\n\nDEADPOOL: You weak motherfucker! Come on. Come on, get it together. This isn't about me, this is about Vanessa. Here we go. Maximum effort.\n\nCut back to the club.\n\nMAN: Vanessa! Someone out back asking for you. Something about an old boyfriend.\n\nCut to an alley out back. Vanessa walks out and sees someone in the shadows.\n\nVANESSA: I knew it was you. The weird curvy edges. Like a jigsaw puzzle.\n\nThe man walks out of the shadows. It's Francis, not Deadpool.\n\nFRANCIS: You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.\n\nShe tries running, but Angel knocks her out. Cut back into the club. Deadpool approaches Weasel.\n\nDEADPOOL: Hey, hey! Where'd she go?\n\nWEASEL: I saw her head to the back. Go get her tiger.\n\nCut to Deadpool entering the alley out back. He finds his old coin purse on the ground.\n\nDEADPOOL: Fuck... Mother fucker!\n\nCUT TO DEADPOOL'S APARTMENT\nDeadpool is yelling. Weasel tries to calm him down. Deadpool knocks over and beats up a dummy.\n\nDEADPOOL: Chocolate! Jimminy! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Oh, I'm gonna rip this mother fucking -\n\nA phone begins to ring.\n\nDEADPOOL: Find that! Find that, I'm going to get angry!\n\nWeasel gets the phone.\n\nWEASEL: Here, it says Vanessa. No, wait, it's Francis. He says he wants you to come to him.\n\nDEADPOOL: What is that?\n\nWEASEL: That's the shit emoji. You know, it's the turd with the smiling face and the eyes. I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.\n\nDEADPOOL: I need guns.\n\nWEASEL: Okay, which ones.\n\nDEADPOOL: I need all the guns!\n\nWEASEL: Alright.\n\nCut to a montage of Deadpool, Weasel, and Al getting guns from all over the house.\n\nWEASEL: That's about 3000 rounds.\n\nDEADPOOL: Well, we all know what I can do with twelve.\n\nAl comes in holding a gun, pointed at Weasel and Deadpool.\n\nWEASEL: Woah, woah, woah.\n\nDEADPOOL: Careful with that, Ronnie Milsap. We're downrange.\n\nAL: I was gonna spend the night assembling the Volgie, but this is holding my interest.\n\nDEADPOOL: I told you, we're going with the Oordvash, not the Bjorsha, get it through your head or get outta fuck town!\n\nAL: Shit. That's all the pieces in the house.\n\nDEADPOOL: Na, na, na, na, na. Let's go, cough it up. Up, up, up, up, up.\n\nShe pulls her pant leg up to reveal a gun.\n\nDEADPOOL: Ugh, down, down, down.\n\nAL: Fuck you.\n\nWEASEL: Five cal. I like it. Wade. I'd go with you, but, I don't wanna.\n\nDEADPOOL: Listen, Al. If I never see you again, I want you to know that I love you very much. Oh, and also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere in the apartment, right next to the cure for blindness. Good luck.\n\nWEASEL: Wanna get fucked up?\n\nCUT TO: LARGE PLATFORM\nAngel and Francis lead a bound and gagged Vanessa on the platform.\n\nFRANCIS: Put her down over here.\n\nAngel ties her up.\n\nFRANCIS: Go on then.\n\nAngel removes the gag.\n\nVANESSA: Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.\n\nFRANCIS: Well. You're a talker too? You and Wade.\n\nVANESSA: I've been trying to tell you assholes you've got the wrong girl. My old boyfriend, he's dead.\n\nFRANCIS: See, I thought that too. But he keeps on coming back. Like a cockroach. Ugly. Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see how he fights with your head on the block.\n\nCUT TO: THE X-MEN MANSION\nDeadpool runs up to knock on the door, but Negasonic opens it before he can.\n\nDEADPOOL: Ripley! From Alien 3!\n\nNEGASONIC: Fuck, you're old.\n\nDEADPOOL: Ha! Fake laugh, hiding real pain. Go get silver balls.\n\nNEGASONIC: You guys going for a bite? Early bird special?\n\nDEADPOOL: Oh, like there's something wrong with eating before sundown or saving money. No, you know that bad guy that you let go? He's got my girl. You're gonna help me get her back.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Wade, is that you?\n\nDEADPOOL: It's me, Deadpool, and I got an offer that you can't refuse! I'm gonna wait out here, okay? Big house. It's funny that we only ever see two of you. It's almost like the studio couldn't afford another x-man.\nCUT TO: TAXI\nDopinder is driving. Deadpool is in the passenger seat. Colossus and Negasonic are in back.\n\nDEADPOOL: And that is why, in my opinion, the movie cocoon is pure pornography.\n\nDOPINDER: Who brought this twinkly man?\n\nDEADPOOL: Twinkly, but deadly. My chrome-penised friend back there has agreed to do me this solid. In exchange, I told him I would consider joining his boy band.\n\nCOLOSSUS: It's not boy band.\n\nDEADPOOL: Sure it's not. Ah! So, any luck winning Gita back?\n\nDOPINDER: I tried to Mr. Pool, but Bantu is more craftier and handsomer than me.\n\nDEADPOOL: Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.\n\nThe cab drives over a pothole. A scream can be heard from the trunk.\n\nDEADPOOL: Dopinder.\n\nDOPINDER: Hmm?\n\nDEADPOOL: What was that?\n\nDOPINDER: Uh, that was, uh... Bantu, in the trunk.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Ban-who?\n\nDOPINDER: My romantic rival, Bantu. He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing like you said, DP. I'm going to gut him like a tenduri fish, then put his carcass on Gita's doorstep.\n\nDEADPOOL I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely not! It got lost in translation! Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's heart back! (I'm so proud of you). Drop Bantu off, safe and gentle like. (Kill him). And then win Gita back! The old fashioned way, with your boyish charm. (Kidnap her).\n\nNEGASONIC: He's super dead.\n\nDOPINDER: Oh!\n\nDopinder parks the taxi.\n\nDOPINDER: I presume a crisp high five?\n\nDEADPOOL: For you? Ten! Okay guys, let's get out there and make a difference! (You know what to do).\n\nHe and Dopinder give each other thumbs up.\n\nDOPINDER: Knock 'em dead, pool boy!\n\nDEADPOOL: Time to make the chimi fucking changas. Not often a dude ruins your face, wall stomps your sanity, grabs your future baby-momma, and personally sees to four of your five shittiest moments. Let's just say, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.\n\nThe trio approaches the large platform.\nNEGASONIC: Hey, where's your duffel bag?\nDeadpool turns around. Cut to the taxi. Dopinder gets a call from Deadpool. He tries to answer it, causing the car to crash. Bantu starts screaming.\n\nDOPINDER: Bantu?\n\nCut back to the platform.\n\nDOPINDER'S VOICE: Leave a message, and have a happy day!\n\nDEADPOOL: God damn it! I'm gonna do this the old fashioned way. With two swords and maximum effort. Cue the music.\nThe trio starts walking again. A bunch of men with guns come out. Francis calls out from atop the platform.\n\nFRANCIS: Wade Wilson! What's my name?\n\nDEADPOOL: Ooh, I'mma fucking spell it out for you.\n\nFRANCIS: Go get some.\n\nDEADPOOL: Superhero landing, she's gonna do a superhero landing, wait for it!\n\nAngel does a superhero landing.\n\nDEADPOOL: Woo! Superhero landing. You know, that's really hard on your knees. Totally impractical. They all do it. You're a lovely lady, but I'm saving myself for Francis. That's why I brought him.\n\nCOLOSSUS: I'd prefer not to hit a woman, so please, pla -\n\nAngel hits Colossus, sending him flying.\n\nDEADPOOL: I mean... That's why I brought her?\n\nNegasonic is on her phone.\n\nDEADPOOL: Oh, no, finish your tweet. Just give us a second. There you go, hashtag it. Go get her tiger.\nNegasonic runs forward in a firey ball, throwing Angel back.\n\nDEADPOOL: Oh, I so pity the dude who pressures her into prom sex.\n\nANGEL: Alright then. Fire!\n\nThe men with guns start shooting. Negasonic and Deadpool hide behind cover. Colossus gets back up and throws a giant tire, hitting some of the men.\n\nDEADPOOL: Finish fucking her the fuck up!\n\nCOLOSSUS: Language, please!\n\nDEADPOOL: Suck a cock!\n\nColossus and Angel start fighting.\n\nDEADPOOL: Look away, child. Look away!\n\nDeadpool rips off his underwear, then holds it up as a flag of surrender.\n\nDEADPOOL: Wait! Wait!\n\nThe men stop shooting.\n\nDEADPOOL: Hey, you only work for that shit spackled muffin fart! So, I'mma give y'all a chance to lay down your firearms, in exchange for preferential, borderline gentle, possibly lover-like treatment.\n\nThey start shooting again.\n\nDEADPOOL: Fine! Commando.\n\nDeadpool runs out and fights a bunch of the guys. Cut back to Angel and Colossus fighting. Cut back to Deadpool killing a bunch of guys. Negasonic uses her power to crush a few guys. Cut back to Colossus and Angel fighting. Cut back to Deadpool killing guys. Suddenly, he stop just short of killing one.\n\nDEADPOOL: Bob?\n\nBOB: Wade?\n\nDEADPOOL: Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since -\n\nBOB: Jacksonville. TGI Friday's.\n\nDEADPOOL: TGI Friday's!\n\nHe puts his swords away.\n\nDEADPOOL: What the hell! Come here you.\n\nHe head butts Bob, knocking him out.\n\nDEADPOOL: How are the kids? Good? And Gale, she still fixing that tuna casserole? So good. Bad for the waistline if you know what I mean.\nCut to Colossus. He lifts a large object off of Angel Dust. Her boob has fallen out of her shirt. He awkwardly looks away... covering the breast from camera view with his hand.\n\nCOLOSSUS: You are, uh... Very beautiful woman.\n\nANGEL: You are so sweet! Thanks.\nShe takes the opportunity to punch him in the crotch. Cut to Deadpool, who has arranged the bodies of the soldiers he killed into the word 'FRANCIS'.\n\nFRANCIS: Does he write you notes too? He's such a romantic.\n\nDEADPOOL: Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.\n\nFRANCIS: Fire!\n\nThe men on the platform begin shooting. Deadpool runs out of range.\n\nNEGASONIC: Hey! Climb on.\n\nDeadpool nods and runs over. She uses her power to shoot him up onto the platform. He approaches Francis, who has Vanessa in the oxygen depravation machine.\n\nDEADPOOL: Motherfucker should have worn his brown pants. You're right, beautiful! Red really is my color.\n\nVANESSA: Wade?\n\nDEADPOOL: Don't worry, baby. I'm gonna get you out of that shitbox.\n\nFRANCIS: What better way to get inside that head of yours.\n\nDEADPOOL: Oh, you never left.\n\nVANESSA: But you did, asshole!\n\nFRANCIS: Ah, take a deep breath darling. Oh wait, wrong choice of words.\n\nHe turns the machine on. She begins choking.\n\nDEADPOOL: I hope they've blocked pain to your every last nerve, 'cause I'mma go looking!\n\nFRANCIS: You grow back body parts now, Wade? When I'm finished, parts'll have to grow back you.\n\nDEADPOOL: Good one. Yeah, that was a good one. Let's dance. And by dance, I mean let's try to kill each other.\n\nThey begin fighting. A some point, Deadpool throws one of his swords, cracking the glass of the machine. Vanessa starts being able to breathe. Cut to Angel and Colossus fighting. She begins choking him. Cut to Vanessa, who uses the sword to free herself.\n\nFRANCIS: Fine, fists.\n\nDEADPOOL: Sounds like your last Saturday night.\n\nThey start fighting again. Francis stabs a knife into Deadpool's head. Vanessa runs up with the sword and skewers Francis. Deadpool looks up at her and hallucinates a bunch of small cartoon creatures. Francis throws Vanessa. Deadpool takes the knife out of his head. Cut back to Angel and Colossus. Negasonic uses her power to create a massive explosion, causing the platform to begin to fall. Francis gets thrown off by a crate. Deadpool and Vanessa start to slide off.\n\nVANESSA: Wade!\n\nDEADPOOL: I got you, baby. I got a plan, but you're not gonna like it.\n\nHe puts her in the machine. They begin dangling off the edge.\n\nDEADPOOL: Don't worry, I'm totally on top of this.\n\nThe platform begins falling down more rapidly. Colossus carries Angel and Negasonic out of the rubble.\n\nDEADPOOL: Damn it! Maximum effort!\n\nHe flings the machine with Vanessa inside it out of the way of the platform, as the platform falls down. completely. Later, Colossus finds the machine in the rubble, with Vanessa still alive inside. Negasonic helps her out.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Just take it slow.\n\nDEADPOOL: Yoo-hoo! Oh, my God, that was so awe -\n\nDeadpool stands on top of some rubble nearby. Suddenly, Francis tackles him from the side, sending them tumbling down. They begin fighting. Deadpool has the upper hand, audibly breaking bones.\n\nDEADPOOL: There are no words... Me and you... Are headed to fix this butterface.\n\nFRANCIS: What? You stupid fucking idiot. Did you really think there was a cure for that?\n\nDEADPOOL: What?\n\nFRANCIS: You heard me.\n\nDEADPOOL: No, no! So you mean to say, after all this, you cant fix me.\n\nFRANCIS: It sounds a bit stupider when you say it\n\nDEADPOOL: Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?\n\nDeadpool pulls out a gun and puts it to Francis's head.\n\nDEADPOOL: Any last words?\n\nFRANCIS: What's my name?\n\nDEADPOOL: Who fucking cares?\n\nCOLOSSUS: Wade! Four or five moments.\n\nDEADPOOL: I'm sorry?\n\nCOLOSSUS: Four or five moments. That's all it takes.\n\nDEADPOOL: To...?\n\nCOLOSSUS: Be a hero. Everyone thinks it's a full-time job. Wake up a hero, brush your teeth a hero, go to work a hero. Not true! Over a lifetime, there are only four or five moments that really matter. Moments when you're offered a choice. To make a sacrifice, conquer a flaw, save a friend. Spare an enemy. In these moments, everything else falls away. The way the world sees us, the way we -\n\nDeadpool shoots Francis in the head. Colossus vomits.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Why?\n\nDEADPOOL: You were droning on! Sure, I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flatbread, but at least fuckface won't heal from that. If wearing superhero tights means sparing psychopaths, then maybe I wasn't meant to wear 'em. Not everyone monitors a hall like you.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Just promise -\n\nDEADPOOL: Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the lookout for the next four moments. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just a boy about to stand in front of a girl. And tell her... What the fuck am I going to tell her?\n\nCOLOSSUS: Well, heh, you better figure it out.\n\nDEADPOOL: I can't even tell you -\n\nVanessa punches him.\n\nDEADPOOL: I deserve that.\n\nShe punches him again.\n\nDEADPOOL: That too.\n\nShe lifts her knee up. He covers his crotch.\n\nDEADPOOL: No, no, no, no, maybe not the nethers.\n\nVANESSA: Start talking!\n\nDEADPOOL: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For everything. I'm sorry for leaving, I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner. It's been a rough couple of years.\n\nVANESSA: Rough?\n\nDEADPOOL: I live in a crack house. With a family of 12. Every night we spoon for warmth. Everyone fights for Noelle, she's the fattest. There's nothing that we don't share. Floorspace, dental floss, even condoms.\n\nVANESSA: So you live in a house?\n\nDEADPOOL: I should have come and found you sooner. But baby, the guy under this mask, he ain't the same one you remember.\n\nVANESSA: You mean this mask?\n\nShe takes off his mask.\n\nDEADPOOL: And this one.\n\nHe has a picture of Hugh Jackman stapled to his face.\n\nDEADPOOL: And this one. In case the other fell off. Just, yeah, ow, like a bandaid, just give it a good - Audi 5000! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you sure?\n\nVANESSA: I'm sure.\n\nShe takes off the paper.\n\nVANESSA: Wow.\n\nDEADPOOL: Yeah.\n\nVANESSA: Hey, after a brief adjustment period, and a bunch of drinks, it's a face I'd be happy to sit on.\n\nDEADPOOL: I'm not the same underneath this suit either. Super penis.\n\nCOLOSSUS: Come on Wade, language. Young one is present.\n\nDEADPOOL: What are... What are you still doing here? Get out of here, go make yourself useful! You, go be a really big brother to someone. Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn. And you, chicken noodle, nothing compares to you. Sinead O'Connor, 1990.\n\nNEGASONIC: That's alright. You're cool.\n\nDeadpool gasps.\n\nDEADPOOL: What in the ass! That was not mean! I'm proud of you.\n\nCOLOSSUS: We will make an x-man of you yet, Wade.\n\nDEADPOOL: You know, for a second there, it felt like we were three mini lion robots coming together to form one super robot.\n\nNEGASONIC: There's the stupid.\n\nDEADPOOL: Yeah. And now, for the moment I've all been waiting for.\n\nVANESSA: Come here.\n\nThey start making out.\n\nDEADPOOL: Wham! As promised.\n\nThey keep making out.\n\nDEADPOOL: (Narrating) See? You don't need to be a superhero to get the girl. The right girl will bring out the hero in you. Now, let's finish this epic wide shot, pull out, there we go, looks nice, it's gonna be the only thing pulling out tonight. Who doesn't love a happy ending? Till next time, this is your friendly neighborhood pool guy, saying, I'm never gonna dance again, the way I dance with you...\n\nHis voice fades out.\nEND CREDITS\nPOST-CREDITS SCENE: HALLWAY\nDEADPOOL: You're still here? It's over, go home. Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2. Well, we don't have that kind of money. What, are you expecting Sam Jackson to show up, with an eye patch and a saucy little leather number? Go home! Oh! But I can tell you one thing, and it's a bit of a secret: We're gonna have Cable. Amazing character, mechanic arm, time travel. We have no idea who we're gonna cast yet, but it could be anybody. Just need a big guy with a flat top. Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, Keira Knightley. She's got range, who knows. Big secret. Shh. Oh, and don't leave your garbage lying around. It's a total dick move. Chicka-chicka.\nEND MOVIE32Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1667197", "artist_names": "Herman's Hermits", "full_title": "Dandy by\u00a0Herman's\u00a0Hermits",

daughter\u201d\n\n\n(3)\nSong of Spring\nToday I heard a robin sing\nheralding the coming spring\nA song of exultation to the sky\nan ode to earth's awakening\n\nI saw a willow on the hill\nIt's branches greening in the sun\nand all the earth seemed hushed & still\nsleeping streams began to run\n\nI heard a softly rising breeze\nwhispering through the grass\nsinging through the still bare trees\nwaiting winter's chill to pass\n\nI saw the sun, so bright and warm\nwarming the earth after the rain\nthe buds and leaves, no frost to harm\nat least, at last, it's spring again.\n\n(4)\n\nThe Ancients\nIt's my last day with the old giants\nIn mourning I hike the lost trails,\nsniffing the aroma of the bark,\nthat cinnamon of the forest\nUnder tepees of wood\nin a membrane of shadows,\nI stalk the earth, its mammal traces,\nits elusive tracks,\nto sit on a fallen log\nwhere spiders macram\u00e9,\nmoss sloping to my knees\nunaware of invisibles within,\ngrubbing in their tunnels\nA lizard taps my foot,\nresponding, I muse to its touch,\nmy thoughts like Indian visions,\nAnd when daylight mushrooms into night,\nand an owl hoots from cedar,\nI still sit with a lizard on my shoe\nHuddled with the ancients of the woods\n\n\n(5)\n\nEpiphany\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\nIt clings to the cliffed shore,\nto the wintered face of the thistle path,\nto the fingers of the old man's glove\nas he waves his memory homeward\n\nIn that breath between come and go\nshe moves up from the bay;\ngold turns her stride,\nthe line of her dress,\nthe soft sea pulling at her feet\n\nWhen he reaches out\nand the frail birds fly\nand the sun and the sky\nhave married deep into the sea, it clings\n\nEven as his shadow threads retreat,\nit clings, even now as it dissolves to mist\n\n\n(6)\n\nA Return Home, Only Time Will Tell\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\nOh blessed hope !\n\nBoth hardly a believable dream,\nSweltering heat with bloodshed in the street...\nSend the troops home !\nThere is no clear reason for them to roam..,\n\nThese are desolate times !\nFor we have chosen ill faded rhymes..,\nThe casualties are enormous ?\nFor a stated cause that clearly atrocious..,\n\nA mother's cry as the door chime rings,\nA vanishing salute to freedom as the church choir sings !\nLet us look above to all the heavenly love..,\nMerciful one, take this chip off my shoulder..,\n\nStop the senseless fighting before our dear nation grows a bit colder,\nSuddenly, seeds were dropped out of a farmers bag,\nIn time roots spring up fresh out of the fertile soil...\nAs the sun heats up,\n\n\nTime will tell when this harvest will soon boil...\nIn the vast game of life,\nOne's time is so very brief !\nThe soul yearns for its' heavenly relief..,\n\nShare with others who may want to turn over a brand new leaf..,\n\nTime will tell of the true importance of helping one another,\nTo never give into the finish line..,\nNor harsh criticism that our society puts out !\nLike a famous fighter in his final bout !\n\nTime will tell of the return home,\nTo the open arms of a loved one !\n\n(7)\n\nA Valiant Knight\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\nA Valiant Knight\n\nDeath springs a new day basking in the breeze\nIn solemn moments lets pause to think of a place\nA far off castle in the mountains away from it all\nA valiant knight lived in the structure of it's dwelling\nThose days of old where mere men had a noble demise\nA beautiful maiden was in waiting for her knight\nHe would often fight for the cause of stregnth and dignity\nThe draw bridge where the castle stood had a very unique aura\nA mystery of sort sought up in the vast array of crowned nobility\n\nFor the king on his thrown was humble yet greedy\nAlways would take care of himself caring nothing for the needy\nA valiant knight was concerned about the kings trust\nOften they would disagree on who it was to serve\nA joker came in front of the king one day with a magic wand\nWaving the wand in the air then there floated ivy everywhere\nFor the court jester was a fool in the making of his legacy\nThe maiden would often come forth and see\n\nFor she treasured a red rose that was plucked sometime before\nCherished the calling of her stature to the glory of the throne\nA valiant knight would often sing sweet songs in the night\nHad a following of village people that would sit before his feet\nHaving a way of words that he would often share\nThe castle was filled with dragons and warlocks searching for love\nA cause to be brave amidst uncertainty of the kingdom\nThe legacy of golden capulets filled ardent vestibules\nLet us toast to the valiant knight who keeps a watch on all that is good\n\n\n(8)\nHampton Beach\n\nThe smell of fresh fry doe\nTime had elapsed playing at the casino\nFresh lobster with a side order of fries\nThose spacious wonderful sky's\nDown at the shell the continental were playing\nA walk by the lady of a statue in waiting\nFlip flops and the sound of laughter\nA playground for kids in the middle\nThe boardwalk with seagulls flocking over head\nFire works in the midnight air with a cheer\n\n\n(9)\n\nGod's World\nIt is raining again.\nSummer will be over before it ever gets here\nThunder rolls far away, drops\nhit the windshield, the sky turns gray\n\nThe Sunflower, the blue\nDelpinium, the white\nStinkwood drink the moisture\ngreedily. The green and silver\n\nleaves of the Aspens sparkle as the rain hits them, and the\nwind turns them round and round\nThe creek flows on, oblivious to\nthe change in the weather.\n\nA break in the clouds allows a bit of sun to hit the side of a\ntowering mountain\nThree cows slowly wend their way homeward. It is dusk.\nThe gray clouds lift and the sun bursts through,\n\nbefore sliding behind the hills for the night\nIt is God's World. He gives it to us to enjoy and to share with each other\n\n\n(10)\n\nJake's House\nThere was a man whose name was Jake\nWho had a house upon the lake\nEvery morning he would wake\nAnd for breakfast have a piece of cake\n\nHe had a private fishing hole;\nHe always used a long cane pole\nHe fried his fish on red hot coal\nAnd served it in a great big bowl\n\nFor a pet, he had a cat\n\n\n(11)\n\nIn The Zone\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\nIn The Zone\n\nwhispers...\nthrough the dark deranged portals you evoke fear\nfilled with angelic fervor on it's textual base\nyet we dig much deep then ever before\n\ncries in the dark will light the spark of what we need to know\nstill we stand idle as the average novice introduces its spell\nalong again then the sadness evokes a newer feeling\ndwindling through the vain extraction of the never world\n\nwe visually see a flash then a new day approaches\non the lawn two lovers having passionate sex\nthe screams of vile extreme explodes throughout\nperhaps this is the place where Nero tread\n\nyet again I sit alone in my house now huddled in the corner\nthe twilight sun has tainted my inner vision\nthe howls of Satanic laughter gives a piercing shriek through\na candle was lit by the edge of my bed\n\nOne can remain lax in the quietness of the moment\nyet again the setting of the sun\na new day has begun as we embark on the moment\nDoes death hurt you the most or is it fear\n\nYou can equate logic through a firm grasp of the hand\nwhispers again...\nthen a faint cry,\nwe construct living pyramids to honor the dead\n\nA stroke of luck an the impulse ensues\nonto so much more but for what\nare we grasping for straws what are we searching for ?\nquietness again this time I'm in the zone\n\nas if zombie creatures with viscous long fangs that bite\ndripping blood off side we run away to hide\nno one questions anymore no one has a voice\nalone one last time yet feelings of grandeur awake\n\nto the message of hope that spills from the sky\na challenge to be free is a question of time\neyes with spots digging holes in a pool of blood\nSatan laughing again spreads his wings\n\nSuddenly I awake but to what ?\n\n\n(12)\n\nAn End Of The Age Of Innocence Part III\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\nIn our fast paced twentieth century world..,\n\nWe oft' have neglected to stop to smell the roses,\nOft' we used to bow our heads silently to pray,\nAs we reflect back to the sixties is had launched a pad to rebellion !\nWith a vast amount of liberal bias and thinking,\n\nNo wonder why our nation is sinking..,\n\nSinking amidst a cuss pool of mere morality..,\nFor now it is a quite different time,\nA very unique but different type of day..,\nAn end of the age of innocence,\n\nOne hath been enlightened..,\n\nFrom seeking truth,\nSome fresh out of a garbage can..,\nYet for Gods' sake,\nHe hath such an amazing plan !\n\nHence, to shun the broad road,\n\nYet to seek to venture in the narrow..,\nSuch as a distant bird in flight !\nYou might see this creature venture out at night ?\nOf the Eagle nor the Sparrow..,\n\nIt used to mean something to have a sense of common courteous..,\nTo hold open the door for your neighbor ?\nYet for the time being we relent and waiver..,\nWould you prefer another taste of a certain ice cream flavor ?\n\nTo ponder we must be content with who we are in the inside..,\n\nNor, a mere fancy suit or blazing sport's car,\nLife is a roller coaster..,\nIn what you do while busy making other plans..,\nFinding solace among the height of nature.,\n\nSuch to think at what is quite simple,\nAs a young child reflects on his or her poster board,\nPlaying with their magic crayons..,\nFor in eternity it is such a very long time !\n\nTake heed in what you do,\n\nNow is the expectant hour !\nWhat will one choose to do ?\nThere can be no place nor need for any compromise,\nWithin it's vast perpetual spectrum !\n\nOne just can't put a price tag on a genuine but unique heart !\n\nHence, with honest integrity..,\nThe time for change is today !\n\n(13)\n\nHe Was There\nby Mario William Vitale\n\nFrom the inner silence of the lamb he was there\nIn welcoming to the world to share\nWithin the multiple of words the mouth speaks\nAs a heart beats through the passage of time\nTo every poem that was ever written\nTo every burden ever lifted\nTo rivers crossing where people living\nSometimes loving other moments giving\nIn storms that were outside brewing\nWhat is the significance of this love\nIn painted pictures from above\nTo every soldier in a battle\nTo every cow amidst the cattle\nNot a second glance at any real romance\nA field of dreams throughout our head\nFrom both fire and ice will make you think twice\nPerhaps another chance at a roll of the dice\nWhen every kingdom comes thy will be done\nShadows in the shining morn if there's a rose it bears a thorn,\nHe was there in every circumstance\nWhen they tried to throw stones at her\nHe was there drawing a line with his finger in the sand\nIt is my hope that some day all will understand\nA glance at the past will tell us of our future\nAmidst the inner pain & uncertainty\nThrough shadows in a field of dreams\nIn moments of solace amidst the pain\nA light moved out upon the street outside\nA day that wasn't meant to be\nThorn crown was pulled upon his head\nThose shouts of intense anger from the mob\nThere was only one who would help him back on his feet,\nA light that brought only a few to greet\nLet us not run away & hide\nEach one of our sins was placed on that cross\nTo lose the battle now would end in tragic loss\nFather please forgive them for they know not what they do\nHe said the prayer now the rest is up to you\nThat cross that broke a sinful world apart\nWith his blood-soaked crown with spear in side\nTo show the whole world he had nothing to hide\nThe summoned cry brought about healing in the sky\nWatch the free angelic dove fly!\n\n\n\n(14)\n\nMomma Of Pearls\nby Mario William Vitale\n\nSince there's nothing I could find\nThat was worth giving you,\nI sat down to think a while\nAnd write a line or two\nIf I had a magic wand\nI'd wave it just for you,\nAnd give you anything you'd like\nNo matter how many or few\nIf I could give you back the years\nYou so willingly gave to me\nI'm sure that you spend them over again\nThe same as they used to be\nRemember when those days and nights\nInstead of going to the fair\nI'd always say tell me again\nThe story of the three little bears\nI tried to get a strawberry pie\nBut they were out of season\nThen I thought of gold or pearls\nBut knew there was no reason\nAlthough you are so often quiet\nThere's one thing we can say,\nYou will always be our momma of pearls\nforever and a day...\nSo here's your gift; my sweet momma\nMy heart; my soul; my love,\nMy gift to you this Christmas day\nCame strictly from above\n\n(15)\n\nEasement\nby Mario William Vitale\n\nI watched from the porch of the old nursing home\nTheir games and informal plays,\nAnd reveled in memories conjured up\nOf my happy childhood days\nIt was the touch of her warm little hand\nAs she held the rose out to me,\nThat reminded me of my own child's touch\nCaressing me tenderly\nI longed to smooth the tangled curls,\nTo hold her close to me,\nTo tuck fairy kisses in her palm\nFor our mutual ecstasy\nBut she was off like a fleeting fawn\nTo join her friends in play\nAnd I fervently hoped she would return\nWith a sweet smelling clover bouquet\nThe little girl came on another day,\nBringing cookies she had made\nOf sand and water and raspberry caps,\nWe ate them-unafraid!\nShe was back again with comb and brush\nTo tame her windblown hair;\nWhen she leaned on my lap with her story book\nI was content in my answered prayer\n\n\n\n(16)\n\nThe Promise\nby Mario William Vitale\n\nWe promised to love- until death do us part\nNow you're leaving- you're breaking my heart,\nYou found someone else- you love more then me-\nNow it's over- you're setting me free\nYou promised me-there could never be\nAnyone- you could love more then me,\nNow you tell me- that you love him\nAnd my love- you could never share\nYou promised me- our love would last forever\nThat we would always be together,\nNow it's over- just memories remain\nWhat once was happiness-now is pain\n\n(17)\n\nTime\nby Mario William Vitale\n\nTime is one of a series of recurring instance, or repeat action\nAs time goes on, the birth of a child in time you hope that the life of a child...\nwould have the time to develop\nTime to walk, time to talk\nTime to gain, time to lose\nTime to cry, time to laugh\nAs time tick, tocks away, we go on\nhoping that the next second will be\nthe most exciting experience that time can bring\nbut we know that time can bring sorrow\nto make you feel time will never end\nthe moment of pain\nWondering will I have more time\ntime is out of our hand\nas time goes on\nTime is here, time is now\nTime is up\nTime is running out. It's time !\n\n\n\n\n(18)\n\nThe Motorcycle Gang\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\nThe Motorcycle Gang\n\nA venue was set\nFolks came from miles around\nJust to hear the music & get down\nThe band was wailing on their guitar\nA solo was underway\nThe brews were flowing\nSuddenly the leader of the pack rolled in\nIt was the captain along with his faithful regime\nAll those Harley's on a free spirit scene\nThe smell of pot was everywhere what a blur\nIt was all sex, drugs & rock and roll\nThe gang circled around\nA white flag was flown\nThere was a specific truce to part\nThey were running with the wolf pack\nFeelings that there never coming back\nGrab a lady and take her for a swing\nThey all carried a piece\nSuch rebels on the burning strip\nA life on a pleasurable trip\nA soul based on fun out on the run\nNo faith based all run on sight\nNo laboring for the legal tender\nFor that is there right\nGive the finger to the fuzz\nLeather pants with eyes in a trance\nEyes filled with tombstones in their head\nSome have said it's the walking dead\nA rap sheet that runs a mile long\nTake it to the limit is there favorite song\nA free will with a free bird spirit intact\nThey were all legends in there own right\nThere the sons of thunder rolling clowns in life's big circus\n\n(19)\n\nA Gothic Revival Quest\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\nA Gothic Revival Quest\n\nPillars in light fashionable decorum sets the standard\nThose high rise structures with heavenly interior\nThe holy oblation lead to the ultimate construction\nIn matters of trust we can maintain a humane aura\nA heart that devised the good of humanities stake & claim\nAn old lady named Grier used to live in it's dwelling\nA structure well kept yet needs a fix up with the plumbing\nGrier used to frequent her yard with it's barbed wire fence\nTragedy had claimed her late husband's life that left her alone\nShe carries on with a smile in her lone desolation\nA mere place for rest like a long awaited vacation\nWith sincere love in her heart she would often sing\nLetting in the sunshine inside her brilliant dwelling\nA noted poet herself used to write to her hearts content\nThe fashion of her study was filled with perfume & appeal\nStacks of books lined the way the went to her parlor\nShe made music in her head as she was getting ready to sleep\nA sincere whisper of gratitude would always be nestled at her feet\nFor Grier was living smooth to the natural eye\nSought back the pain from within with a simple sigh\nShe dedicates her home to the loving hands of almighty God\nEnough to give her courage amidst a darkened cloud\nSilently awaits the true love to come through the door\nA beacon of light to a much hurting world in need\nSoft lace now decorates the rug with plush moderation\nA sip of tea will bring forth a new year's resolution\nShe has gained yet also has lost humanities heaviest cost\nWith four walls of gothic revival in her unique quest\n\n(20)\n\nIn Times Of Uncertainty\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\nIn Times OF Uncertainty\n\nWe live for self amidst the greed\nIn timeless thought provoked take heed\nSwift viable remorse on record\nIn times of uncertainty\nDon't trust something you don't understand\nThrough a heavy edge proned in trust\nWith a temperment in a midas touch\nFrom a word spoken in the dark\nHas now come to the fullest of light\nIn given moments of happiness to endless fright\nForget the night!\n\nWith no given since of remorse nor shoulder to cry;\n\nAmong the evil creatures at night will fly\nThe times of uncertainty suddenly go by\nAlthough we at times wander as in a nomadic tribe\nYet we will persist through the pain to thank God I'm alive!\n\nSince all the fools sail away\nIt pays to take pride in homage gain\nTo humbly bow the knee to pray\nThen with these promises we chose to fade away\nFrom the things we shared in promises\nThe times of uncertainty away in dire need\nWhile the world outside having viscous fangs that bleed\nDripping blood off side to hide;\nWe really have no reason to run away & hide\n\nThe times of uncertainty & want\n\nMarked on a blotted page intact\nWhen the whole world outside is in a rage!\nGiving each other a heart attack!\n\n(21)\nWoods and Trees\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\nIn late Spring when heros scream\n\nA source of sophistication from faint misery\nInside the thwart hidden silence of the pivotal solace of my mind\nWith mind blowing excursion toward the legally blind inside\nWoods in growing habitation & silence\n\nWoods in distant pathways derived from a slight bite in solace\n\nAfter a warm fire woods will then stand tall amidst uncertainty\nIs is where one could often sport for game\nHunters in woods will drive you totally insane in brain\nIn extreme situations the wood can be an untimely climatic disaster to fathom\n\nWoods\n\nIn significant direct correlation through storms in danger arms wide opened\nWoods can create a swift barrier of thoughtful change,\nA romantic encounter by which the lover shall stray\nIs there any other mental nor mere philisophical way\n\nNature lies dormant amidst its beckoning call\nWith a swift viable pulse derived after the fall\nTransformed by silence of thought provoked listening elm & pine\nCreated in enriched diplomacy from God by his great design\n\nGod again speaks through me from the sound of a wolf intact\n\nHe completes his journey through stregnth by which to resist\nWoods\nWe scenic scope in vast briars taunt\nIn vegetation swine with sukken asps which haunt\n\nVanquished moss covered up in grey filtered steam\n\nAn approaching visible light to follow a dream\nA captivated look into the woods\nEngulfed in moss green briars torn asunder\nTrees fallen in decorated colors\n\nIn the dead of Winter leaves tumble to the ground\n\nWith mice and men walking alone\nOn a crooked path filled with rocks & twigs\nSuch as a bushel filled with acorns & figs\nWithin desolation there crys a fever pitch\nTrees in silence\nTrees in a ditch\nSilence in thought provoking beckoning call\nA combersom message that negates a stall\nWith a figure of speech twisted in a dream turned nightmare\nWhy should we even bother or for that matter really care\nTrees in a Bob Ross brightened country portrait sway feel\nTrees can define sullen wounds that sometime bind\nMake good use of your time within sullen asps which chime\nThroughout its darkened portal without having restraint\nTrees can exhibit a dire need to express\nWith just a little love and a whole lot of tenderness\nMeditation through barbed wire fences filled up in tears\nAbsorbed in concrete fenders filled in ellaborate decorum cheers\nSwitching full gears from sullen tears to that of darkened fears.\n\n\n(22)Fire and Rain\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\nBlood soaked drops of resin dew\n\nInto sweat found nothing new\nShadows prance yet something sticks like glue\nIn battered soil proclaims a dedication\nAmancipation\n\nThe thrill will seek through both fire & explain\nLet me further explain:\nOne in twain yet marked on its blotted page yet clearly intact\nThe pain of refusal of sod amidst its wooden axe\n\nIn flowers ardent resin twain povides a shade\nIn temporal cure for pain amidst the flames\nAs tired as a wretched man I claim we stake to scene\nIn soaked clothes of leaves soaked in debris\n\nWithin timeless cue of sympathy\nShattered beneathe the leaves the falling debris\nIn fruition a braided skeleton etched in modern art\n\nIn reluctance toward the forbidden tree we get ripped apart\n\nFor she lit that inner spark to what it was I have been waiting for !\n\n\n(23)\n\nGive Me Shelter From The Storm\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\nWith faces in the window having storms in the night\n\nYou gave me promises they gave me pain\nWhen will we ever live to understand this game\nGive me shelter from the storm within cause we may never live again\nIn shattered dreams brought through its timely theme\n\nMany are still wandering alone in the darkness of night\n\nA plate of desire poured out with a creme sauce of desolation\n\nAt the mountain top the unique summit has a keen sense of view\nThrough ardent Spring lingers through a papal elect few\nIt's sought after portal of death as glue\nShutters through the spark at morn,\n\nSome would even bother to curse the very day they were actually born;\n\nA sought after portal which breathed in death\nYet still marked on its blotted page very much fully intact,\n\nWorking too hard can give anyone an instant heart attack\nSmoke filled rooms filled up in fetters cry of full forced desolation;\nIn combersome threats the chief negotiator left,\nA fields of dreams coming apart at the seams\n\nA port in storm through emmense pain where through,\n\nGive me shelter from the storm,\nAmidst total sadness with stillness we soon learn to reflect\nJust as in some twilight sun that has tainted my inner vision\nPerhaps its in some one track mind that was fully set on some mission\n\nThe certain timely strain on the heart can light its inner spark;\n\nGive me shelter from the storm amidst the sequence of outer pain,\nIn pain to harm the weary soul in which one can helplessly lose all control\n\nAmidst viable dreams proned in an onslaught filled preminition\nThe sought after portal to death,\nYet still again marked on a blotted page fully intact\nIn timeless combersome threats toward their negotiable left\n\nA field of dreams coming apart at its seams\n\nGive me shelter from the storms of life amidst its inner strife\nAmidst sadness within stillness will learn to reflect;\nJust as in a twilight sun that has tainted my inner vision\nPerhaps its in a one track mind that's head out on a mission\n\nThat certain spark within a strain on a heart can light a timely spark\n\nGive me shelter from its storm\nVery much haunted by an eclipse of the sun\nThrough a quaint rehearsal in its timeless cue\nIn distinguishing truth dismissed from its ultimate error\n\nMany will escape into a quadratic motif through that of choice\n\nA world filled still fixed in telling lies within its tormented souls\nBroken skulls with fragmentation of vile demise\nThat quick fix challenge just not to have to deal with reality.\n\n\n(24)\n\nAura\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\nShades of pine grafted in again resign\nShattered pine in elm certain grove alone\nMy meadow had a thorn certain credit\nThe factual harm of its heartless swarm\nFeatured within in the created design with pine\nEyes sharpened as a willow in garb\nThe tornado sequence has even the fog alone\nAgain tempors fly like never before\nBlatant lies have come at no surprise\nIn parts unknown an aura of repute to harm\nSound the alarm in fetters arm\nChoirs of saints in regard to its beckoning drawn\nEmpire strain inside my brain fragments of cure\nThe surface of the sun has tainted my vision with harm\nSound the alarm agiain my faithful friend by whom we can depend\nShattered glass on the parchment floor\nAura\nAn impulse deep in regards to the heart\nShades of pine will line the volume of scattered pillows\nA willow in derision you made a final decision\nA thought provokoing reason to believe in\nShattered memory's in the moments of innocence with a plight of disbelief\nWe have soon turned over a brand new leaf\nTimeless peaks in a swelll shattered fragments from within\nA great design still sublime in its timeless parts the heart\nAura\nJim Morrison had it\nJanis Joplin couldn't stop it\nJimi Hendrix sought this quick fix\nAn unbellievable call being caught in the mix!\n\n\n(25)\n\nAngel\nWritten by: Mario Vitale\n\n\nFrom a distance the sound of feathers\nA whole host of words often whispered\nAs if you haven't already heard his saving message\nIn bitter silence we slowly become unshackled\nFrom this lying bitter place of cold ego's\nThen angel spreads her wings out on windows peak\nShe then keeps silent from inside her swell;\nAt its cold whispers haunting to dwell\nMany keep to themselves not wanting to be alone\nThen a cold chill sends a rage down my spine tingling like off the vine\nIn time the sun heats up out on waters edge devides\nMany a demon would so often run away & hide\nAngels totally surrenders out on its night scene\nA brandished web of forbidden design,\nFor some the angel would lie in wait to deceive\nIn triumphant sounds of musical magestic beings light the scene\nWe our still here to help egnite its flame\nWhile the entire world outside lies helplessly insane\nOut on its playing field some have no game,\n\nWhen our generation dies so does the other,\nThe angel of darkness will seek to inhabit its light\nShackled from a memory on a certain quest nor plightEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 21, "api_path": "/songs/139000", "artist_names": "The Lovin' Spoonful", "full_title": "Summer in the City by\u00a0The\u00a0Lovin' Spoonful",

head\n\n[Chorus]\nBut at night it's a different world\nGo out and find a girl\nCome on, come on, and dance all night\nDespite the heat, it'll be alright\nAnd babe, don't you know it's a pity\nThe days can't be like the nights\nIn the summer, in the city\nIn the summer, in the city\n[Verse 2]\nCool town, evenin' in the city\nDressin' so fine and lookin' so pretty\nCool cat, lookin' for a kitty\nGonna look in every corner of the city\n'Til I'm wheezin' like a bus stop\nRunning up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop\n\n[Chorus]\nBut at night it's a different world\nGo out and find a girl\nCome on, come on, and dance all night\nDespite the heat, it'll be alright\nAnd babe, don't you know it's a pity\nThe days can't be like the nights\nIn the summer, in the city\nIn the summer, in the city\n[Bridge]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHot town, summer in the city\nBack of my neck getting dirty and gritty\nBeen down, isn't it a pity\nDoesn't seem to be a shadow in the city\nAll around, people

lonely\nSomeone calls on me\nAnd every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse\nAnd curse those faults in me\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAnd then along comes Mary\nAnd does she want to give me kicks\nAnd be my steady chick and give me pick of memories\nOr maybe rather gather tales\nFrom all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees\nWhen we met I was sure out to lunch\nNow, my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\n[Verse 2]\nWhen vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks\nWhose sickness is the games they play\nAnd when the masquerade is played the neighbor folks make jokes\nAt who is most to blame today\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd then along comes Mary\nAnd does she want to set them free\nAnd let them see reality from where she got her name\nAnd will they struggle much when told\nThat such a tender touch as hers will make them not the same?\nWhen we met I was sure out to lunch\nNow, my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\n\n[Flute solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd when the morning of the warning's passed\nThe gassed and flaccid kids are flung across the stars\nThe psychodramas and the traumas gone\nThe songs are left unsung and hung upon the scars\n\n[Chorus 3]\nAnd then along comes Mary\nAnd does she want to see the stains\nThe dead remains of all the pains she left the night before\nOr will their waking eyes reflect the lies\nAnd make them realize their urgent cry for sight no more?\nWhen we met I was sure out to lunch\nNow, my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\nYou might also like[Outro]\nSweet as the punch (Sweet as the punch)\nSweet as the punch (Sweet as the

2]\nDid you ever have to finally decide?\nAnd say yes to one and let the other one ride\nThere's so many changes and tears you must hide\nDid you ever have to finally decide?\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes there's one with deep blue eyes, cute as a bunny\nWith hair down to here and plenty of money\nAnd just when you think she's that one in the world\nYour heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl\n\n[Chorus 3]\nAnd then you know you better make up your mind\nAnd pick up on one and leave the other behind\nIt's not often easy and not often kind\nDid you ever have to make up your mind?\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her\nAnd then you get distracted by her older sister\nWhen in walks her father and takes you a line\nAnd says, \"Better go home, son, and make up your mind\"\n\n[Chorus 4]\nThen you bet you'd better finally decide\nAnd say yes to one and let the other one ride\nThere's so many changes and tears you must hide\nDid you ever have to finally decide?You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/4663205", "artist_names": "Dee Jay & The Runaways", "full_title":
