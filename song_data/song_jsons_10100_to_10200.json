avenue?\nWhen you said you were passin' through\nWas I even on your way?\nI knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)\nBe cool about what I was tellin' you\nYou'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)\nAnd I'd end up more afraid\nDon't say it isn't fair\nYou clearly wer\u0435n't aware that you made me mis\u0435rable\nSo if you really wanna know\n[Chorus]\nWhen I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)\nI'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)\nWish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)\nI wish it wasn't true, mm-mm\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou call me again, drunk in your Benz\nDrivin' home under the influence\nYou scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath\n'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends\nI don't relate to you\nI don't relate to you, no\n'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty\nYou made me hate this city\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd I don't talk shit about you on the internet\nNever told anyone anything bad\n'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything\nAnd all that you did was make me fuckin' sad\nSo don't waste the time I don't have\nAnd don't try to make me feel bad\nI could talk about every time that you showed up on time\nBut I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did\nNever paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I\nShut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid\nSee Billie Eilish LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like[Outro]\nYou ruined everything good\nAlways said you were misunderstood\nMade all my moments your own\nJust fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck

in\nI know it's a lot: the hair, the bod\nWhen you're starin' at a demigod\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat can I say except \"you're welcome\"\nFor the tides, the sun, the sky?\nHey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome\nI'm just an ordinary demi-guy\n[Verse 2]\nHey! What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky\nWhen you were waddling yay high? This guy\nWhen the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below?\nYou're lookin' at him, yo!\nOh, also I lassoed the sun, you're welcome\nTo stretch your days and bring you fun\nAlso I harnessed the breeze, you're welcome\nTo fill your sails and shake your trees\n\n[Chorus]\nSo what can I say except \"you're welcome\"\nFor the islands I pulled from the sea?\nThere's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome, ha!\nI guess it's just my way of being me\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou're welcome, you're welcome\nWell, come to think of it\n\n[Verse 3]\nKid, honestly, I could go on and on\nI could explain every natural phenomenon\nThe tide, the grass, the ground?\nOh, that was Maui just messin' around\nI killed an eel, I buried its guts\nSprouted a tree, now you got coconuts\nWhat's the lesson? What is the takeaway?\nDon't mess with Maui when he's on a breakaway\nAnd the tapestry here in my skin\nIs a map of the victories I win\nLook where I've been, I make everything happen\nLook at that mean Mini-Maui just tickety-tappin'\nHa ha ha ha ha hey\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWell anyway, let me say \"you're welcome\" (You're welcome...ha ha ha)\nFor the wonderful world you know?\nHey,

yellin' in your room\nLike can I get 5 more minutes?\nShit, I ain't really trippin' over school\nLet's get Wiz Khalifa high and\nGet meditated over \"Medicated\"\nGet Wiz Khalifa high and\nThrow your caps in the air like you know you made it\n[Verse]\nI told moms I ain't trippin' over school cause I made it\nSaid, \"Boy you got a son, supposed to be his inspiration\"\nPut a milli' in his bank account\nDon't leave him out I was thinkin'\nI'll never do him wrong like they did the operation\nTook a nigga's vision from him, was a mothafuckin' baby\nSaid a couple years later they can give it back to me\nTechnology is movin' too slow, I'm waitin' patiently\nShit, I don't want it no more, this how I'm meant to be\nRemember young kids in the school used to laugh at him\nGuess I played my numbers real good, check the mathematics\nNiggas broke and Zoovie Zoo up, why they mad at him?\nMan I bought about 12 cars just to blast past 'em\nSwitch cars so much, they don't know which one to blast at\nAnd my bitch so bad and you know her ass fat\nWanna ride through and they is who I'll laugh at\nZoo Gang my crew, won't put nothin' past that\n\n[Hook]\nWhen you wake up in the mornin', ayy\nMom's yellin' in your room\nLike can I get 5 more minutes?\nShit, I ain't really trippin' over school\nLet's get Wiz Khalifa high and\nGet meditated over \"Medicated\"\nGet Wiz Khalifa high and\nThrow your caps in the air like you know you made it, ayy\nWhen you wake up in the mornin', ayy\nMom's yellin' in your room\nLike can I get 5 more minutes?\nShit, I ain't really trippin' over school\nLet's get Wiz Khalifa high and\nGet meditated over \"Medicated\"\nGet Wiz Khalifa high and\nThrow your caps in the air like you know you made it\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nYeah, yeah\nYeah,

counted out so many times, I couldn't count it\nFunny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it\nTo the people that think that I owe you shit\nPayback's a bitch and you know that shit\nY'all niggas gettin' too old for this\nPlease don't think nobody notices\nI've been up for way too many days\nY'all sleep enough for me anyway\nY'all don't be doin' shit anyway\nY'all are not true to this anyway\nOVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O\nEveryone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal\nI go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people\nThey gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws\nBut they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam\nThey told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans\nAnd stay in your place fam\nMy dad is from Memphis, and I am the king\nI should probably just move into Graceland\nMadonna\u2019s a ting I know and I\u2019m the king of pop\nI\u2019m building Never-Never Land\nHow he hate me when I never met the man, woo!\n[Refrain: Drake]\nWe might just get hit with the R.I.C.O\n\n[Verse 2: Meek Mill]\nMeek Milly!\n'Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles\nI'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (Switch it up)\nToday I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle\nFor my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here\nI spend a day what you make a year\nI had to drop this to make it clear\nThat I got it locked like Jamaican hair\nAll theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence\nWhy we even got to take it here?\nWhy we even got to play these games?\nRun up on me, catch a facial there\nIt's the Chasers, what you thought?\nI come through my block like I'm Rico\nPoppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal\nI was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples\nI take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal\nI'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit\nI'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter\nLike Jordan, we back on that bullshit\nWe came up from nothing\nWe started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list\nWe really was doing shit\nI can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants\nI think they recording\nShhh, listen, you hear that?\nYou might also like[Refrain: Drake]\nWe might just get hit with the

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWell I grew up in a real town\nWhere the prom queen had a plastic crown\nAnd we really did just drive around\nCause there wasn't shit to do\nWe didn't know we were real broke\nDaddy rolled them real smokes\nWe drank RC, no real Coke\nOur neighbor had a pool\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nWe got green grass and a few trees\nBut it ain't like what's on TV\n[Chorus]\nThis is real life in the real world\nWe ain't talkin' to no models, we got real girls\nWe get real low, we get real high\nIt ain't all good, baby, but it's alright\nReal life\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe got a dive bar with a real band\nThey play too loud and they're real bad\nBut we're real bored so we still dance\nAnd we stay out way too late\nHit the Waffle House for some real food\nBut that waitress, she's real rude\nShe got real problems, but we do too\nSo we tip her anyway\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nThat's just the way that it is\nThat's just the way that we live\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is real life in the real world\nWe ain't talkin' to no models, we got real girls\nWe get real low, we get real high\nIt ain't all good, baby, but it's alright\nReal life\nYeah, we're lovin' real life\nSee Jake Owen LiveGet tickets as low as $78You might also like[Bridge]\nWe find real love, get real hurt\nFall real hard, shake off the dirt\nPray to God, let's make a deal\nI guess it just got real\n\n[Partial Chorus]\nWe get real low, we get real high\nIt ain't all good, baby, but it's alright\nReal life\nThis ain't no fairy tale\nIt's real life7Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 14, "api_path": "/songs/3035330",

Bank\nAnd a deadbeat husband who always drank\nSo when he didn't come home, she had the gin to thank\nFor the tears in her eyes\nSo Dixie packed up and said her goodbyes, and she went\n\n[Chorus]\nDriving so far away, nobody's gonna find her\nFlying just fast enough to leave it all behind her\nBut she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul\nShe's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy\nAin't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie\nThe heart of Dixie\n[Verse 2]\nIt's a funny thing when your world falls down\nIt's got a way of showing you what you're all about\nNow Dixie's got her wheels pointed south\nAnd she ain't never looking back\nAnd nobody knew she was brave like that\nAnd she went\n\n[Chorus]\nDriving so far away, nobody's gonna find her\nFlying just fast enough to leave it all behind her\nBut she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul\nShe's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy\nAin't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie\nThe heart of Dixie\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah, Dixie woke up to the truth one day\nGrabbed her cheap sunglasses and her lipstick case\nAnd she went\n\n[Chorus]\nDriving so far away, nobody's gonna

white\nI wouldn't change a thing that changed my life\nFor the worse, for the better\nMan, I was gone, gone forever\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe was a cut offs pepper sauce queen\nMan, we were matches and gasoline\nFirst taste of love never will forget\nI was gone and I am not back yet\nI was gone, gone and I am not back yet\n\n[Chorus]\nLooking back at the moments, black white\nI wouldn't change a thing that changed my life\nFor the worse, for the better\nMan, I was gone, gone forever\nThe laughs, the smiles, the trials, the tears\nIt's hard to hate what got me here\nWhat got me here\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe was a straight out of Hollywood smile\nWe missed it all by a country mile\nWent out one night for some cigarettes\nAnd I was gone and I am not back yet\nSee Kenny Chesney LiveGet tickets as
