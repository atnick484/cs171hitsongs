out of every bar on a whim just like the wind blows\nShe's either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup\nTake a drunk girl home\n\nShe's bouncing like a pinball\nSinging every word she never knew\nDancing with her eyes closed like she's the only one in the room\nHer hair's a perfect mess, falling out of that dress\nTake a drunk girl home\n[Chorus]\nTake a drunk girl home\nLet her sleep all alone\nLeave her keys on the counter your number by the phone\nPick up her life she threw on the floor\nLeave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door\nThat's how she knows the difference between a boy and man\nTake a drunk girl home\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat\nThey're singing \"Closing Time\" at that little bar across the street\nIn two by twos, strangers and lovers headed for the covers, hooking up\nThat TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off\nAnd through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighbor\u2019s cigarette cough\nThere's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did\n\n[Chorus]\nTake a drunk girl home\nLet her sleep all alone\nLeave her keys on the counter your number by the phone\nPick up her life she threw on the floor\nLeave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door\nThat's how ya know the difference between a boy and man\nYou take a drunk girl home\nSee Chris Janson LiveGet tickets as low as $38You might also like[Chorus 2]\nYou took a drunk girl home\nIn the sober light of dawn\nShe left you a message she thanks you on the phone\n'Cause you picked up her life she threw on the floor\nYou left the hall lights on walked out and locked the door\nThat's how she knows the difference between a boy and man\nTake a drunk girl home\n\nYou take

that change\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\nYeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling\nMaybe something new is what you're needing\nLike a real life, let your hair down, feel alive\nWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\n[Verse 2]\nSay you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud\nNever had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up\nWell, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove\nBut give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\nYeah, let yourself go, baby, follow that feeling\nMaybe something new is what you're needing\nLike a real life, let your hair down, feel alive\nWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\n\n[Bridge]\nNow the way you're looking says you're living\nI hope I ain't reading wrong\nCause the way you're shining I think you're thinking\nIt's been way too long\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\nYeah, yeah, let yourself go, come on follow that feeling\nMaybe something new is what you're needing\nLike a real life, let your hair down, feel alive, alive\nWhen was the last time, oh\nYou did something for the first time, girl?\nCome on, baby\nWhen was the last

mind, I don't need that\nI make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that\nAnd I see your girl like all the time, all the time though\nI can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do

Lyrics[Intro]\nOkay\nGame face\nThere we go\n\n[Verse 1]\nI've got bipolar disorder\nMy shit's not in order\nI'm overweight, I'm always late\nI've got too many things to say\nI rock mom jeans, cat earrings\nExtrapolate my feelings\nMy family is dysfunctional\nBut we have a good time killing each other\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThey tell us from the time we're young\nTo hide the things that we don't like about ourselves\nInside ourselves\nI know I'm not the only one\nWho spent so long attempting to be someone else\nWell, I'm over it\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't care if the world knows what my secrets are\nSecrets are\nI don't care if the world knows what my secrets are\nSecrets are\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nSo, what?\nSo, what?\nSo, what?\nSo, what?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can't think straight, I'm so gay\nSometimes I cry a whole day\nI care a lot, use an analog clock\nAnd never know when to stop\nAnd I'm passive aggressive\nI'm scared of the dark and the dentist\nI love my butt and won't shut up\nAnd I never really grew up\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nThey tell us from the time we're young\nTo hide the things that we don't like about ourselves\nInside ourselves\nI know I'm not the

it\nSo we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you\nBecause we had a ball\nOnly real music is gonna last\nAll that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow\n[Chorus: Timbaland]\nCash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik\nC.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the\nGet the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar\nD-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)\nCash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M\nGet the-get the-get the-get the-get the\nGet the-get the-get the-get the mon-mon-money\nFrikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)\n\n[Verse 1: Drake]\nYeah\nUh, after hours at Il Mulino\nOr Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino\nThe contract like '91 Dan Marino\nI swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego\nOverly focused, it's far from the time to rest now\nDebates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now\nTook a while, got the jokers out of the deck now\nI'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now\nI hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it\nFuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it\nI'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks\nNo game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all\nMy classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants\nOr work with their parents\nBut thinkin' back on how they treated me\nMy high school reunion might be worth an appearance\nMake everybody have to go through security clearance\nTables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn\nWith the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv\nYeah, I swear shit just started clickin', dog\nYou know it's real when you are who you think you are\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $138You might also like[Chorus: Timbaland]\nCash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik\nC.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the\nGet the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar\nD-d-d-d-dollar-dollar,

is\nYellow diamonds in my Jes\u00fas\nI just might learn to speak Mandarin\nJapanese for the yen that I'm handlin'\nInternational Hov, that's my handle\nMy saint's Chang\u00f3, light a candle\nEl Gran Santo on the mantle\nCase y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh\nShout out to World Wide Wes\nEverywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess\nYes, still Roc La Familia\nSays a lot about you if you not feeling us\nThe homie said, \"Hov, it ain't many of us\"\nI told 'em, \"Less is more, nigga, it's plenty of us\"\n[Chorus: Timbaland]\nCash rules everything around me,

JAY-Z]\nCake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake\nFive hundred million, I got a pound cake\nNiggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake\nGet 'em a red nose, they clown cakes\nThey shoulda never let you 'round cake\nLook at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh\nNow here's the icin' on the cake\nCake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uh\nI'm just gettin' started, oh yeah, we got it, bitch\nI've done made more millionaires than the lotto did\nDame made millions, Biggs made millions\nYe made millions, Just made millions\nLyor made millions, Cam made millions\nBeans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings\nUh, I'm back in my bag\nMy eyes bloodshot, but my jet don't lag\nA pair of Jordan 3's, tryna chase this cash\nGucci airbag just in case we crash\nUh, last night was mad trill\nI'm fresh out of Advil\u2014Jesus, grab the wheel\n[Part II: Paris Morton Music 2]\n\n[Verse: Drake]\nYeah, uh\nLook, fuck all that \"Happy to be here\" shit that y'all want me on\nI'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog\nLike I should fall in line\nLike I should alert niggas when I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy\nAnd not say I'm the greatest of my generation\nLike I should be dressing different\nLike I should be less aggressive and pessimistic\nLike I should be way more nervous and less dismissive\nLike I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit\nAnd do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us\nLike I didn't study the game to the letter\nAnd understand that I'm not doin' it the same\nMan, I'm doing it better\nLike I didn't make that clearer this year\nLike I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that\nThey should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself\nThese are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself\nBut I thought \"Fuck it\", it's worth it to share 'em\nWith someone else other than Paris for once\nI text her from time to time, she a mom now\nI guess sometimes life forces us to calm down\nI told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound\nBut I think she's straight\n'Cause she supported since Hot Beats\nRight before Wayne came and got me out of the back room\nWhere I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have\nIn the hopes for the glory\nHe walked right past in the hallway\nThree months later, I'm his artist\nHe probably wouldn't remember that story\nBut that shit stick with me always\nCouldn't believe when he called me\nYou never know what could happen to you\nAnd I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti\nAnd did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do\nYeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg\nNothing was the same, dawg370Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 10, "api_path": "/songs/197447", "artist_names": "Finatticz", "full_title": "Don't

that\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI go through guys like money flying out the hands\nThey try to change me, but they realize they can't\nAnd every tomorrow is a day I never plan\nIf you're gonna be my man, understand\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't be tamed, I can't be tamed\nI can't be blamed, I can't, can't\nI can't, can't be tamed\nI can't be changed, I can't be tamed\nI can't be, be, I can't be tamed\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya\nI'm not here to sell ya\nOr tell you to go to hell (I'm not a brat like that)\nI'm like a puzzle, but all of my pieces are jagged\nIf you can understand this\nWe can make some magic, I'm wrong like that\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go\nI wanna be a part of something I don't know\nAnd if you try to hold me back, I might explode\nBaby, by now you should know\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI can't be tamed, I can't be tamed (I can't be tamed)\nI can't be blamed, I can't, can't\nI can't, can't be tamed\nI can't be
