for different work and his heart was known to none\nHe left his home and went his lone and solitary way\nAnd he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay\nA quiet man of music denied a simpler fate\nHe tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait\nHe earned his love through discipline - a thundering, velvet hand\nHis gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand\n\n[Chorus]\nThe leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old\nBut his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul\nMy life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man\nI'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band\n[Verse 2]\nMy brothers' lives were different for they heard another call\nOne went to Chicago and the other to St. Paul\nAnd I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel\nLiving out this life I've chose and come to know so well\n\n[Verse 3]\nI thank you for the music and your stories of the road\nI thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go\nI thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough\nAnd, Papa, I don't think I said 'I love you' near enough\n\n[Chorus]\nThe leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old\nBut his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul\nMy life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man\nI'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band\nI am a

telling you lies\nYou look so careless when they're shooting that bull\nDon't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full?\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache\nSee what else your old heart can take\nThe boys say, \"when is he gonna give us some room?\"\nThe girls say, \"God, I hope he comes back soon\"\n[Verse 2]\nEverybody's talking, but you don't hear a thing\nYou're still uptown on your downhill swing\nBoulevard's empty, why don't you come around?\nBaby, what is so great about sleeping downtown?\nThere's plenty of dives to be someone you're not\nYou say you're looking for something you might've forgot\nDon't bother calling to say you're leaving alone\n'Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home\n\n[Chorus]\nTell

gun\nAnd he shoots you dead and he eats your head\nAnd then you're in the man from Mars\nYou go out at night eatin' cars\nYou eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too\nMercurys and Subaru\nAnd you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars\nThen, when there's no more cars you go out at night\nAnd eat up bars where the people meet\nFace to face, dance cheek to cheek\nOne to one, man to man\nDance toe to toe, don't move too slow\n'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars\nHe's eatin' bars, yeah wall to wall\nDoor to door, hall to hall\nHe's gonna eat 'em all\nRap-ture, be pure\nTake a tour through the

fire\nBut nobody wanted to hire a guitar man\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I nearly about starved to death down in Memphis\nI run out to money and luck\nSo I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia\nOn a overloaded poultry truck\nI thumbed on down to Panama City\nStarted picking out some of them all night bars\nHoping I could make myself a dollar\nMaking music on my guitar\nI got the same old story at them all night piers\n\"There ain't no room around here for a guitar man\"\n\"We don't need a guitar man, son\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo I slept in the hobo jungles\nRoamed a thousand miles of track\nTill I found myself in Mobile, Alabama\nAt a club they call Big Jack's\nA little four-piece band was jamming\nSo I took my guitar and I sat in\nI showed them what a band would sound like\nWith a swinging little guitar man\nShow them, son\n\n[Verse 4]\nIf you ever take a trip down to the ocean\nFind yourself down around Mobile\nMake it on out to a club called Jack's\nIf you got a little time to kill\nJust follow that crowd of people\nYou'll wind up out on his dance floor\nDigging the finest little five-piece group\nUp and down the Gulf of Mexico\nGuess who's leading that five-piece band\nWell, wouldn't you know, it's that swinging little guitar man\nYou might also like[Verse 5]\nWell, I came a long way from the car wash\nGot to where I said I'd get\nNow that I'm here I know for sure\nI really have not got there yet\nThink I'll start all over\nSwing my guitar over my back\nI'm going to get myself back on the track\nI'll never, never ever look back\nI'll never be more than

lie in a lost and lonely part of town\nHeld in time in a world of tears, I slowly drown\nGoin' home, I just can't make it all alone\nI really should be holding you, holding you\nLoving you, loving you\n\n[Chorus]\nTragedy\nWhen the feeling's gone and you can't go on, It's tragedy\nWhen the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear\nWith no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere\nTragedy\nWhen you lose control and you got no soul, it's tragedy\nWhen the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear\nWith no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n[Verse 2]\nNight and day, there's a burning down inside of me, aaah\nBurning love with a yearning that won't let me be\nDown I go, and I just can't take it all alone\nI really should be holding you, holding you\nLoving you, loving you\n\n[Chorus]\nTragedy\nWhen the feeling's gone and you can't go on, It's tragedy\nWhen the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear\nWith

head and dead on your feet\nWell another crazy day, you'll drink the night away\nAnd forget about everything\nThis city desert makes you feel so cold\nIt's got so many people but it's got no soul\nAnd it's taking you so long to find out you were wrong\nWhen you thought it held everything\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou used to think that it was so easy\nYou used to say that it was so easy\nBut you're tryin', you're tryin' now\nAnother year and then you'll be happy\nJust one more year and then you'll be happy\nBut you're cryin', you're cryin' now\n\n[Instrumental Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nWay down the street there's a light in his place\nHe opens the door he's got that look on his face\nAnd he asks you where you've been\nYou tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything\nHe's got this dream about buyin' some land\nHe's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands\nAnd then he'll settle down, in some quiet little town\nAnd forget about everything\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut you know he'll always keep movin'\nYou know he's never gonna stop movin'\n'Cause he's rollin', he's the rollin' stone\nAnd when you wake up, it's a new mornin'\nThe sun is shinin', it's a new mornin'\nYou're goin', you're goin' home\nYou might also like[Instrumental Chorus]13Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 8, "api_path": "/songs/435095", "artist_names": "Eddie Money", "full_title": "Baby Hold On

LyricsGUY RAZ, BYLINE: The TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And today on the show, what's original? Is there anything that can, like, we could really say is totally original?\n\nKIRBY FERGUSON: The Big Bang. As far as we know the Big Bang is original.\n\nRAZ: And everything else after that...\n\nFERGUSON: Everything else yeah.\n\nRAZ: ...You know, derivative.\n\nFERGUSON: Yes.\nRAZ: This is Kirby Ferguson, he's a filmmaker and made a series of films called \"Everything Is A Remix\" because, as Kirby explains in those films, every painting, every song, every idea comes from somewhere else. And the basic element of creativity comes from remixing.\n\nFERGUSON: All of our works emerge out of our influences, out of building, you know, upon the works and with the works of other people.\n\nRAZ: Like, for example, Bob Dylan.\n\nRAZ: Here's Kirby from the TED stage.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)\n\nFERGUSON: All right, let's head back to 1964, and let's hear where some of Dylan's early songs came from. We'll do some side-by-side comparisons here.\n\nAll right, this first song you're going to hear is \"Nottamun Town.\" It's your traditional folk tune. After that, you'll hear Dylan's \"Masters of War.\"\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"Nottamun Town\")\n\nJEAN RITCHIE: (Singing) In Nottamun Town, not a soul would look out, not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MASTERS OF WAR\")\n\nBOB DYLAN: (Singing) Come you masters of war and build the big guns. You that build the death planes. You that build all the bombs.\n\nFERGUSON: So that's the same basic melody and overall structure. This next one is \"The Patriot Game,\" by Dominic Behan. Alongside that, you're going to hear \"With God on Our Side,\" by Dylan.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE PATRIOT GAME\")\nDOMINIC BEHAN: (Singing) Come all ye young rebels, and list' while I sing,\n\nfor the love of one's land is a terrible thing.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE\")\n\nDYLAN: (Singing) Oh, my name, it is nothin', my age, it means less, the country I come from is called the Midwest.\n\nFERGUSON: Now, there's a lot of these. It's been estimated that two-thirds of melodies Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed.\n\nRAZ: So I'm hearing all of these Bob Dylan things, right? And, like, it's hard for me to say because we're talking about Bob Dylan. But he stole all of this stuff. If this happened today with Twitter, like within seconds of the release of his record he would be hammered.\n\nFERGUSON: He would be, yeah. I mean, it was a different era, he was a folk musician and the idea back then was not that you came up with original songs. The idea was you took the songs that came before you and you did new things with them, you know. You would write new lyrics to existing melody or vice versa. You contributed to this body of folk music. That was the idea back then. So he wasn't unusual in what he was doing. He was doing what they do in folk music.\n\nRAZ: And this happens all the time in all kinds of music. So take Led Zeppelin for example, who used to listen to another band called Spirit.\n\nFERGUSON: And Spirit were, you know, they haven't really stood the test of time, but they were a reasonably well-known band in the '60s and Zeppelin toured with them.\n\nRAZ: Which could be why this song is not \"Stairway To Heaven.\" It's called \"Taurus.\" And it came out two years earlier. They basically ripped off \"Taurus.\"\n\nFERGUSON: Yeah, they sound a lot a like. And it does sound like the opening of \"Stairway To Heaven\" is fairly difficult to distinguish from that segment of \"Taurus.\"\n\nRAZ: Kirby, there has to be an original idea out there in the world.\n\nFERGUSON: I don't really think so. Again, you can merge things together and you can do that so much that it can be difficult to tell where something came from, you know. You can be layering and layering and layering until the end result is really unrecognizable. But I think human beings aren't really capable of coming up with something from nowhere. Like, I think we just do not do that. We build out of materials. We use tools to make things. That's what we do. I don't think we summon things out of the blue.\nRAZ: And even when we think of something as totally new, totally different, like, Star Wars.\n\nFERGUSON: George Lucas was a famous fan of Akira Kurosawa.\n\nRAZ: He was the Japanese director who made all those samurai films in the '50s and '60s.\n\nFERGUSON: Just the styling of the Jedi Knights is very samurai and the look of Darth Vader, like the look of his helmet looks a lot like the armor of samurai warriors. And, you know, the famous Cantina scene in the first Star Wars.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE\")\n\nALFIE CURTIS: (As Dr. Evazan) I don't like you either. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men.\n\nFERGUSON: There's a bragging bad guy who ends up getting his arm chopped off. That resembles a scene from, I believe, it's \"Yojimbo.\"\n\nRAZ: But here's the thing, nobody thinks of Star Wars as derivative, even though it clearly draws upon Kurosawa's work. So where's the line between copying and building on something that came before?\n\nFERGUSON: I mean, to me it's about how much you - how much mimicry you do, how much of the other artist you are taking. So if you take a large chunk of it, to me that is where you're being derivative, you're being unoriginal. You know, I think you need to be transforming the things that you copy. You need to be recontextualizing them. It's about where are you taking your copying to. And you need to be, you know, transforming and combining those elements in exciting ways.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)\n\nFERGUSON: Now, American copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others. Instead, these laws, and laws around the world, use the rather awkward analogy of property. Now, creative works may indeed be kind of like property, but it's property that we're all building on, and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared.\n\nRAZ: So it's 2007.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSTEVE JOBS: A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough Internet communications device.\n\nRAZ: Steve Jobs on stage at MacWorld, and he introduces the iPhone.\n\nJOBS: These are not three separate devices. This is one device.\n\nRAZ: It's a complete breakthrough.\n\nJOBS: And we have invented a new technology called multitouch - you can do multi-finger gestures on it, and, boy, have we patented it.\n\nRAZ: OK, so that was in 2007. But a year earlier in 2006, an interface designer named Jeff Han gave a TED talk describing the very same technology. And Kirby Ferguson actually showed that footage of Jeff Han in his TED talk.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)\n\nFERGUSON: Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this newfangled technology.\n\nJEFF HAN: Multitouch sensing isn't anything - isn't completely new. I mean, people like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s. The technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility.\n\nFERGUSON: So he's pretty frank about it not being new. So it's not multi-touch as a whole that's patented, it's the small parts of it that are. And it's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent - to promote the progress of useful arts. Now, this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you're the one getting remixed.\n\nRAZ: So remember that Picasso quote that Mark Ronson mentioned a bit earlier? Well, listen to Steve jobs in 1996.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOBS: I mean, Picasso had a saying. He said, good artists copy, great artists steal. And we have, you know, always been shameless about stealing great ideas.\n\nRAZ: OK, so fast-forward 14 years later, 2010, when Google's android phone started to challenge Apple's iPhone. Steve Jobs was quoted saying this.\n\nJOBS: I'm going to destroy android because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermal nuclear war on this. Ok, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.\n\nRAZ: Yeah, I mean, you think about Steve Jobs, right? The idea that he had one point in his career, you know, that admits to sort of stealing great ideas and then later on in his career saying, I will crush those people who steal my ideas, is crazy. I mean, the iPhone, which is an amazingly beautiful piece of technology, is all the result of the work of the people - touchscreen technology, cell phones and GPS and the Internet. Like, without any of those things, that wouldn't exist.\n\nFERGUSON: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nRAZ: So why wouldn't he acknowledge that?\n\nFERGUSON: I think it's a very individualistic fantasy. It makes good stories, talking about individuals, talking about Steve Jobs or Picasso or whoever. It's good stories. And I think that's what we are geared towards. We're geared towards stories that are about individuals because that's how we navigate this world, so we respond to stories that way, whereas telling stories about society, about this incredibly complex mass of human activity, that is a much harder story to tell.\n\nRAZ: So how do we start to think about all this in a completely different way?\n\nFERGUSON: I think it is important to say what you took and from where. I think transparency about what you're doing is a big deal nowadays. And I think most people just want other people to know that, hey, like, that's my bit, you know, that little piece of that thing, that's mine, I did that. And I think just, you know, being more reflective, you know, when you're on the receiving end of getting copied, just think for a moment about where that came from. You know, is it really yours because we definitely fool ourselves about where our ideas come from.\n\nRAZ: Kirby Ferguson, he's a filmmaker.

Don't you know?\nThat it's wrong to take what is given you\nSo far gone, on your own\nYou can get along if you try to be strong\nBut you'll never be strong, 'cause\n[Chorus: Daryl Hall & John

bitch, girl (Bitch, girl), and it's gone too far\n'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)\nSay money but it won't get you too far, get you too far\n\n[Verse 2: Daryl Hall & John Oates]\nHigh and dry, out of the rain\nIt's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain\nAnd don't you know that a love can't grow, ooh\n'Cause there's too much to give, 'cause you'd rather live\nFor the thrill of it all, oh\n\n[Chorus: Daryl Hall & John Oates]\nYou're a rich girl (Rich girl) and you've gone too far\n'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)\nYou can rely on the old man's money\nYou can rely on the old man's money\nIt's a bitch, girl (Bitch, girl), and it's gone too far\n'Cause you know it don't matter anyway, yeah (Rich girl)\nSay money but it won't get you

diplomat\nIn the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps\nHis way into his hat\nWith a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older\nI tripped the merry-go-round\nWith this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin'\nThe calliope crashed to the ground\nThe calliope crashed to the ground!\n[Chorus]\nBut she was blinded by the light\nRevved up like a deuce, another runner in the night\nBlinded

runner in the night\n\n[Verse 2]\nSome silicone sister with a manager mister\nTold me I got what it takes\nShe said, \"I'll turn you on, son, into something strong\nPlay the song with the funky break\"\nAnd go-kart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart\nTo see if it was safe outside\nAnd little Early-Pearly came by in his curly-wurly\nAnd asked me if I needed a ride\nAsked me if I needed a ride!\n\n[Chorus]\nBut she was blinded by the light\nRevved up like a deuce, another runner in the night\nBlinded by the light\nYou might also like[Breakdown]\nShe got down but she never got

always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun\nBut mama, that's where the fun is\n\n[Verse 3]\nSome brimstone, baritone, anticyclone, rolling stone\nPreacher from the east\nSays, \"Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in it's funny bone\nThat's where they expect it least\"\nAnd some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner\nWatchin' the young girls dance\nAnd some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone\nReminding him of romance\nThe calliope crashed to the ground!\n\n[Chorus]\nBut she was blinded by the light\nRevved up like a deuce, another runner in the night\nBlinded

choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay\nAnd at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat\nAnd Mama hollered out the back door, \"Y'all, remember to wipe your feet!\"\nAnd then she said, \"I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge\nToday, Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd Papa said to Mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas\n\"Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please\nThere's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow\"\nAnd Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow\nSeems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\n[Verse 3]\nAnd brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe\nPut a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show\nAnd wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?\n\"I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right\nI saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\"\n\n[Verse 4]\nMama said to me, \"Child, what's happened to your appetite?\nI've been cookin' all mornin', and you haven't touched a single bite\nThat nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today\nSaid he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way\nHe said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd she and Billie Joe was throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nA year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe\nAnd brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo\nThere was a virus going 'round; Papa caught it, and he died last spring\nAnd now Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything\nAnd me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie BridgeYou might also like12Embed"}, {"_type": "song",
