yeah\nNever been the one to cling\nAnd I don't like to be needed (But now)\nI guess that's all changed\nThat's why I get mad at your folks\n'Cause I don't want you to go (Nah babe)\nI want you to

got me so into it\nI'm gone but I don't understand\nSo amazing, captivating, elevating\nAny way you try to put it I wanna be your man\nSo if you (if you wanna put me on)\nI don't mind it's alright,

against?\nI have, I been protested and demonstrated against\nPicket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times\nSick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind\nAll this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'\nTempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'\nNot takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'\nKeep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'\nLeave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth\nSee, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out\nLook at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now\nAin't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)\nI said I'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it\nSo before they throw me inside my coffin and close it\nI'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73\nBefore I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD\nI was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months\nMy faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch\n\u2018Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye\nNo, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die\nI look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side\nEven if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try\nTo make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes\nBut I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today\nWhat I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb\nBut the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun\n\u2018Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both\nIt's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)\nI said I'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition\nTake a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'\nBut put yourself in my position, just try to envision\nWitnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen\nBitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'\nGoin' through public housing systems, victim of M\u00fcnchausen's Syndrome\nMy whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't\n'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?\nWasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?\nSo you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?\nBut guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely\nAnd Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony\nAnd Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful\nBut you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)\nSee, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong\nBitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!\nBut how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!\nYou selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!\nRemember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)\nWell, guess what? I am dead\u2014dead to you as can be!\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)\nI said I'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet229Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 15, "api_path": "/songs/1530", "artist_names": "Styles P", "full_title": "Good Times by\u00a0Styles\u00a0P", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/62e117c8e251e95e7b91e3ac20020258.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/62e117c8e251e95e7b91e3ac20020258.315x315x1.jpg", "id": 1530, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 19, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1663391411, "path": "/Styles-p-good-times-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 6, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Styles-p-good-times-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2002, "month": 8, "day": 11}, "release_date_for_display": "August 11, 2002", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Aug. 11, 2002", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/62e117c8e251e95e7b91e3ac20020258.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/62e117c8e251e95e7b91e3ac20020258.315x315x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 6, "hot": false, "pageviews": 64990}, "title": "Good Times", "title_with_featured": "Good Times", "updated_by_human_at": 1663391411, "url": "https://genius.com/Styles-p-good-times-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/75", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6c5932098d41a5ced5400fc5a03de529.535x143x1.jpg", "id": 75, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/74a3f84b14b0c248b8975c8dfbe10a51.824x824x1.png", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Styles P", "slug": "Styles-p", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Styles-p", "iq": 1309}, "artist": "Styles P", "lyrics": "Good Times Lyrics[Chorus (Styles P)]\n\"I get high, I get high, I get high, I get high\nI get high, I get high, I get high, I get high\nI get high on your memory, high on your memory\nHIGH on your memory...\"\n\"I get high - high - high - high\" (Every day)\n\"I get high - high - high - high\" (Every night)\n\"I get high - high - high - high\" (All the time)\n\"High-ighhhhhhh...\"\n[Verse 1]\nEveryday I need an ounce and a half, S.P\nThe only flower that you know, with a bounce and a half\nListen kid, I need a mountain of cash so I could roll up\nHop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave\nI get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around\nIt take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)\nAnd I'd rather roll somethin' up;

for you\n\n[Chorus]\nSo why are you running away?\nWhy are you running away?\n[Verse 2]\nI did enough to show you that I\nWas willing to give and sacrifice\nAnd I was the one who was lifting you up\nWhen you thought your life had, had enough\nAnd when I get close, you turn away\nThere's nothing that I can do or say\nSo now I need you to tell me the truth\nYou know I'd do that for you\n\n[Chorus]\nSo why are you running away?\nWhy are you running away?\n\n[Bridge]\nIs it me?

be?\"\nI said, \"The good stuff\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nHe didn't reach around for the whiskey\nHe didn't pour me a beer\nHis blue eyes kind of went misty\nHe said \"You can't find that here\"\n[Chorus

that she looks with the rice in her hair\nEating burnt suppers the whole first year\nAnd asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up\nYeah, man, that's the good stuff\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass\nAnd I smiled and said, \"I'll have some of that\"\nWe sat there and talked as an hour passed, like old friends\nI saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare\nIt was a pretty girl with bouffant hair\nHe said, \"That's my Bonnie\nTaken about a year after we were wed\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nHe said, \"Spent five years in the bottle\nWhen the cancer took her from me\nBut I've been sober three years now\n'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey\n\n[Chorus 2]\nWas the sight of her holding my baby girl\nThe way she adored that string of pearls\nI gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl\nMarried his high school love\nAnd it's a new T-shirt saying, \"I'm a Grandpa\"\nBeing right there as our time got small\nAnd holding her hand, when the

'cause you could duck to the Feddy Govs\nSorry, my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes\nBenz convoys with the wagon on the side\nOnly big boys keep deuces on the ride\nGucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side\nMan, I make a buck, why scram?\nI'm tryna show y'all who the fuck I am\nThe jewels is flirting, be damned if I'm hurting\nLegend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland\nPlatinum on

that's just as heavy as my name\nSo much dough, I can't swear I won't change\nExcuse me if my wealth got me full of myself\nCocky, something that I just can't help\n'Specially when them twenties is spinning like windmills\nAnd the ice thirty-two below minus the wind chill\nFilthy, the word that best defines me\nI'm just grinding, man, y'all never mind me\nYou might also like[Chorus:

lake\nConsider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake, I'm grindin'\n[Verse 4: Pusha T]\nI move 'caine like a cripple\nBalance weight through the hood, kids call me Mr. Sniffles\nOther hand on my

eyes\nSpreading those lies, and\nWell, I don't wanna live a lie\nToo many sleepless nights\nNot mentioning the fights\nI'm sorry to say, lady\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm walking away from the troubles in my life\nI'm walking away, oh, to find a better day\nI'm walking away from the troubles in my life\nI'm walking away, oh, to find a better day\nI'm walking away\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I'm so tired, baby\nThings you say, you're driving me away\nWhispers in the powder room, baby\nDon't listen to the games they play\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nGirl, I thought you'd realize\nI'm not like them other guys\n'Cause I saw them with my own eyes\nYou should've been more wise, babe\nWell, I don't wanna live a lie\nToo many sleepless nights\nNot mentioning the fights\nI'm sorry to say, lady\nYou might

1]\nBoy, I saw you soon as you came bouncin' through the door\nYou, and your mans, and them just took over the floor\nStarted doing your thing\nAnd it made me notice you even more\nThe way you turned around and looked at me seemed as though\nYou must've somehow felt me staring on the low\nSomething tells me you're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't even gonna front\nI ain't even gonna lie\nSince you walked up in the club\nI've been giving you the eye\nWe can dance if you want\nGet it crackin' if you like\nMust be a full moon\nFeel like one of those nights\n[Verse 2]\nWhy is this the first time that I'm seeing you around?\nCould you be visiting, or are you new in town?\nYeah, whatever the case\nI'm feeling you right here and right now\nYour smile and all the love you showing lets me know that you\nLike what you see and wanna get to know me too\nThis could very well be the start of something special\nHappy that I met you\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't even gonna front\nI ain't even gonna lie\nSince you walked up in the club\nI've been giving you the eye (Giving you the eye)\nWe can dance if you want  (Dance if you want)\nGet it crackin' if you like (Crackin' if you like)\nMust be a full moon (A full moon)\nFeel like one of those nights\nI ain't even gonna front (Even gonna front)\nI ain't even gonna lie (Even gonna lie)\nSince you walked up in the club (Walked up in the club)\nI've been giving you the eye (Giving you the eye)\nWe can dance if you want (Whoa, oh)\nGet it crackin' if you like (Crackin' if you like)\nMust be a full moon\nFeel like one of those nights\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nI didn't think that I'd come here tonight\nMeet someone like you\nStart feeling the way I do\nSeems like we've known each other most of our lives\nAfter one conversation, this must be right\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't even gonna front (Even gonna front)\nI ain't even gonna lie (Ooh, baby)\nSince you walked up in the club (Hey, yeah)\nI've been giving you the eye\nWe can dance if you want\nGet it crackin' if you like\nMust be a full moon\nFeel like one of those nights (Oh)\nI ain't even gonna front\nI ain't even gonna lie (I ain't even gonna lie)\nSince you walked up in the club\nI've been giving you the eye (Whoa, oh)\nWe can dance if you want (Whoa, oh)\nGet it crackin' if you like (Whoa, oh)\nMust be a full moon (Whoa, oh)\nFeel like one of those nights\nI ain't even gonna front (Even gonna front)\nI ain't even gonna lie (Even gonna lie)\nSince you walked up in the club (Walked up in the club)\nI've been giving you the eye (Giving you the eye)\nWe can dance if you want (Dance if you want)\nGet it crackin' if you like (Crackin' if you like)\nMust be a full moon (A full moon)\nFeel like one of those nights (One of those nights)3Embed"},

the bow to stern light\nSecondhand from a dealer in Atlanta\nI rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her\nWe put on a shine, put on a motor\nBuilt out of love, and made for the water\nRan her for years, 'til the transom got rotten\nA piece of my childhood will never be forgotten\n\n[Chorus]\nIt was just an old plywood boat\nWith a '75 Johnson and electric choke\nA young boy, two hands on the wheel\nI can't replace the way it made me feel\nAnd I would turn her sharp\nAnd I would make it whine\nHe'd say, \"You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides\"\nJust a little lake 'cross the Alabama line\nBut I was king of the ocean\nWhen Daddy let me drive\n[Verse 2]\nJust an old half ton short bed Ford\nMy Uncle bought new in '64\nDaddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking\nA couple of burnt valves and he had it going\nHe'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load\nDown a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road\nI'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals\nSmiling like a hero that just received his medal\n\n[Chorus]\nIt was just an old hand me down Ford\nWith three speed on the column and a dent in the door\nA young boy, two hands on the wheel\nI can't replace the way it made me feel and\nI would press that clutch\nAnd I'd keep it right\nHe'd say \"A little slower son, you're doing just fine\"\nJust a dirt road with trash on each side\nBut I was Mario Andretti\nWhen Daddy let me drive\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm grown up now, three daughters of my own\nI let them drive my old Jeep\nAcross the pasture at our home\nMaybe one day they'll reach back in their file\nAnd pull out that old memory\nAnd think of me and smile and say\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIt was just an old worn out Jeep\nWith rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet\nA young girl, two hands on the wheel\nI can't replace the way it made me feel\nAnd he'd say \"Turn it left\" and \"Steer it right\"\nStraighten up girl now, you're doing just fine\nJust a little valley by the river where we'd ride\nBut I was high on a mountain\nWhen Daddy let me drive\nWhen Daddy let me drive\nOh he let me drive\n\n[Outro]\nIt was just an old plywood boat\nWith a '75 Johnson and

saving grace\nWhat if he's an angel?\n\nThere's a man and there's a woman\nLiving right above you in apartment G\nThere's a lot of noise coming through the ceiling\nAnd it don't sound like harmony\n\nYou can sit there with your TV turned up\nWhile the words and his anger fly\nBut come tomorrow when you see her with her shades on\nCan you look her in the eye?\n\nWhat if she's an angel sent here from Heaven\nAnd she's making certain that you're doing your best\nTo take the time to help one another\nBrother are you going to pass that test?\n\nYou can go on with your day to

would've happened\nIf you weren't so wise beyond your years, I would've been able to control myself\nIf it weren't for my attention, you wouldn't have been successful, and if\nIf it weren't for me, you would never have amounted to very much\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOoh, this could be messy\nBut, but you don't seem to mind, and\nOoh, don't go telling everybody, and\nA overlook this supposed crime\n[Chorus]\nWe'll fast forward to a few years later\nAnd no one knows except the both of us\nAnd I have honored your request for silence\nAnd you've washed your hands clean of this\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're essentially an employee and I like you having to depend on me\nYou're a kind of prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and one day, you'll say you learned all you know from me, and\nAnd I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian\nI know you sexualize me like a young thing would, and I think I like ya\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOoh, this could get messy\nBut, ooh, you don't seem to mind\nDude, don't go telling everybody\nAnd overlook this supposed crime\n\n[Chorus]\nWe'll fast forward to a few years later\nAnd no one knows except the both of us\nAnd I've more than honored your request for silence\nAnd you've washed your hands clean of this\n\n[Bridge]\nWhat part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept?\nWhat part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?\nWhat with this distance, it seems so obvious?\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nJust make sure you don't tell on me, especially to members of your family\nWe best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse\nI wish I could tell the world 'cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly\nI might wanna marry you one day, if you watch that weight and keep your firm body\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOoh, this could be messy, and\nOoh, I don't seem to mind, and\nOoh, don't go telling everybody\nAnd overlook this supposed crime\n\n[Chorus]\nWe'll fast forward to a few years later\nAnd no one knows except the both of us\nAnd I have honored your request for silence\nAnd you've washed your hands clean of this\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOoh, this could get messy, but\nOoh, I don't

day\nWhen it's rainin' inside and you're all alone\nAll alone, yeah!\n[Hook]\n'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you make that sound\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you're in the news\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you sing the blues\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\n[Verse 1: Andre 3000]\nTake a little trip, hater, pack up your mind\nLook forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find\nI caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought he could rhyme\nNow if his momma is a quarter, daughter must be a dime\nI gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-\n-ation, I don't even play the radio neither\nOnly if I need to know the sports or the weather\nI'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck\nSee ain't nothing changed, hit the stage\nSet a date, sucker, in battle we can engage\nI'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you\nThrow the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do\nWith my back against the wall; crack his back, y'all\nNaw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it\nThrow a curl in it\nDread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it\nWhatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote\nAnd this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off\nI take my shades off\nIf you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise\nBecause the whole-whole world-world...\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause the whole world loves it when

Moss\nRide that bitch off like a brand new horse\nI'm rollin' my stones, gather no moss\nMommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off\nOr rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk\nBack, back, forth, forth\nGet that sailor on course, course\nMake that track a corpse, corpse\nRap, roll, utterly rocked\nWith my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock\nCadillac OutKast, just won't

the TV and everything is lookin' dismal\nWent in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol\nNeed it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches\nLike a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate\nWait, back to the enemy of the state\nIs the Republicans or Democratic candidate?\nDebate, now even the black box hold the fate\nClueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break\nHate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this\nIf you want to, you can dub it to your hit list\nI know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list\nWhen it come to this music, we stay relentless\nPursuing all that's pursuable\nDoing, God-willing, all things that are doable\nThe only liable limitation is yourself, Dre\nSet it on the right and I'll set it on the left,

(Bumpin\u2019 Me Against The Wall) Lyrics[Chorus 2x: Mystikal and Pharrell]\nYou keep bumping me against the wall\nYeah I know I let you slide before\nBut until you seen me...trust me\nYou ain't seen bouncin' back\n\n[Verse 1: Mystikal]\nI really be throwin' my words\nStanding 'em up, and jammin' on the one\nThat ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum\nSwift flip kicks landing from the tongue\nMore dramatic than Batman and Robin, ba na na na na na\nThe one that be handling business, be sharper than a thumb tack\nThe one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back\nAnd you gone respect me, appreciate where I run at\nYou ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that\nI gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious\nYou don't even much want to see the rest\nI'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set\nI ain't even started yet\nSo if you ain't ready you better get ready\nKnow I do it better when I'm being opposed\nAh stick ya chest out, keep ya chin up\nAnd sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get up\n[Chorus 2x: Mystikal and Pharrell]\nYou keep bumping me against the wall\nYeah I know I let you slide before\nBut until you seen me...trust me\nYou ain't seen bouncin' back\n\n[Verse 2: Mystical]\nNo matter what happened, that's only once, it's shame on you\nYou come up and here and do it again then its shame on me\nSometimes we be getting in trouble you didn't want learn\nSometimes we be getting so rude you ain't want see\nI accept my wages like the way that I fail\nI grow, I take strides and but 'em under my belt\nI learned from you just like you learned from me\nI plead, I pray for peace and perfect harmony\nSomebody say fool you better keep on rapping\nStop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happen\nI told them look you better mind yo business\nChange yo' way of thinking and keep on living\nDone started some trouble and you ain't been out since\nCause you stuck inside scared watching CNN\nJust take the precaution so yo life a be better\nTell my friends to call me I ain't accepting no letters\n\n[Chorus 2x: Mystikal and Pharrell]\nYou keep bumping me against the wall\nYeah I know I let you slide before\nBut until you seen me...trust me\nYou ain't seen bouncin' back\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Mystical]\nOh you heard about it, yeah you had to\nHmm-huh, I know you change ya mind you ain't the only one with bad news\nI know that they made you feel strange huh\nYou was right in the middle complaining and forgot what you was cryin bout\nIt could be you time and it might be\nYou can't do nothing about it, its God will thats just how life be\nOne day it hit 'cha then its gone\nAnd I'm serious and you ain't never even gone feel it until it hit home\nThat's when the pain run sharper and deeper\nYou ain't eat that's when the days feel slow and long\nI know you miss 'em so it's time to uplift 'em\nTry to pick the pieces up and find a way to drive on\nI tell you the truth so don't lie to me\nGet back Satan don't bother me\nAnd that's the way its gotta be\nAnd when its over and done with I hope you proud of me\n\n[Chorus 2x: Mystikal and Pharrell]\nYou keep bumping me against the wall\nYeah I know I let you slide before\nBut until you seen me...trust me\nYou ain't seen bouncin' back\n\n[Outro 2x: Mystikal and Pharrel]\nYou keep bumpin\u2019 me against the

dreams since then you've had\nHave come and gone that time might show\nBut stress, don't you let it\nDon't you forget it\nTrust you'll find your way to love\nHope is what your heart is made of\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd don't you forget it\nDon't you forget your way home\nFor that little girl\nHold on to your world\nAnd don't you forget it\nDon't you forget your way home\nFor that little girl\nHold on to your world\n[Verse 2]\nYou're worlds apart\nFrom first where life would start\nUnderstanding what it means to have got\nNothing but your heavy broken heart\nThe memory of what used to be\nWith change comes responsibility\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't you forget where you are\nAin't where you've been\nLife's lessons that\nMade you into a woman\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd don't you forget it\nDon't you forget your way home\nFor that little girl\nHold on to your world\nAnd don't you forget it\nDon't you forget your way home\nFor that little girl\nHold on to your world\n\nYeah yeah\nHold on,  hold

"Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWhere were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?\nWere you in the yard with your wife and children\nOr working on some stage in L.A.?\nDid you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke\nRising against that blue sky?\nDid you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor\nOr did you just sit down and cry?\nDid you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones\nAnd pray for the ones who don't know?\nDid you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble\nAnd sob for the ones left below?\nDid you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue\nAnd the heroes who died just doing what they do?\nDid you look up to heaven for some kind of answer\nAnd look at yourself and what really matters?\n[Chorus]\nI'm just a singer of simple songs\nI'm not a real political man\nI watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell\nYou the difference in Iraq and Iran\nBut I know Jesus and I talk to God\nAnd I remember this from when I was young\nFaith, hope and love are some good things he gave us\nAnd the greatest is love\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhere were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?\nWere you teaching a class full of innocent children\nOr driving down some cold interstate?\nDid you feel guilty because you're a survivor\nIn a crowded room did you feel alone?\nDid you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?\nDid you dust off that Bible at home?\nDid you open your eyes, hope it never happened\nClose your eyes and not go to sleep?\nDid you notice the sunset the first time in ages\nOr speak to some stranger on the street?\nDid you lay down at night and think of tomorrow\nOr go out and buy you a gun?\nDid you turn off that violent old movie you're watching\nAnd turn on \"I Love Lucy\" reruns?\nDid you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers\nDid you stand in line and give your own blood?\nDid you just stay home and cling tight to your family\nThank God you had somebody to love?\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'm just a singer of simple songs\nI'm not a real political man\nI watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell\nYou the difference

here  to the twilight\nThere's a dead end to my left, there's a burning bush to my right\nYou aren't in sight\nYou aren't in sight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDo you want me\nLike I want you?\n[Chorus]\nOr am I standing still\nBeneath a darkened sky?\nOr am I standing still\nWith the scenery flying by?\nOr am I standing still?\nOut of the corner of my eye\nWas that you passing me by?\n\n[Verse 2]\nMothers on the stoop, boys in souped-up coupes on this hot summer night\nBetween fight and flight, is the blind man's sight and a choice that's right\nI roll the window down, feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town\nFeel broken down, ah\nI feel broken down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDo you need me\nLike I need you?\n\n[Chorus]\nOr am I standing still\nBeneath a darkened sky?\nOr am I standing still\nWith the scenery flying by?\nOr am I standing still?\nOut of the corner of my eye\nWas that you passing me by?\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nSweet sorrow\u2014he said, \"Call tomorrow\"\nSweet sorrow\u2014he

said, \"old Chevy\" somehow caught my eye\nThe lady didn't know the year or even if it ran\nBut I had that thousand dollars in my hand\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn\nWith thirty years of dust and dirt on that green Army tarp\nAnd when I pulled the cover off, it took away my breath\nWhat she called a Chevy was a sixty-six Corvette\n[Verse 3]\nI felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills\nWhat a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel\nI opened up the glove box and that's when I found the note\nThe date was nineteen sixty-six and this is what he wrote\n\n[Chorus]\nHe said, \"My name is Private Andrew Malone\nAnd if you're reading this, then I didn't make it home\nBut for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true\nThis car was once a dream of mine, now it belongs to you\nAnd though you may take her and make her your own\nYou'll always be riding with Private Malone\"\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell, it didn't take me long at all, I had her running good\nI loved to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood\nI had her shining like a diamond and I'd put the ragtop down\nAll the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town\n\n[Verse 5]\nThe buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right\nBut it picked up that oldie show, especially late at night\nI'd get the feeling sometimes, if I turned real quick I'd see\nA soldier ridin' shotgun in the seat right next to me\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIt was a young man named Private Andrew Malone\nWho fought for his country and never made it home\nBut for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true\nThis car was once a dream of his, back when it was new\nHe told me to take her and make her my own\nAnd I was proud to be riding with Private Malone\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, one night it was raining hard, I took the curve too fast\nI still don't remember much about that fiery crash\nSomeone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out\nThey didn't get his name, but I know without a doubt\n\n[Chorus]\nIt was a young man named Private Andrew Malone\nWho fought for his country and never made it home\nBut for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true\nThis car was once a dream of his, back when it was new\nAnd I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along\nYeah, that night, I was riding with Private Malone\nOh, thank

talkin bout; runnin your mouth, like you know me\nYou gon' fuck around and show why the \"Show Me\" get called the \"Show Me\"\nWhy one-on-one you can't hold me if your last name was Hanes\nOnly way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants\nNo resident of France; but you swear I'm from Paris\nHundred-six karats - total? Naw that's per wrist\nTrying to compurr this - my chain to yo' chain\nI'm like Sprint or Motorola - no service, out of your range\nYou out of your brains, thinkin' I'mma shout out your name\nYou gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame\nAll that pressure you applyin' it's time to ease off\nBefore I hit you from the blindside takin your sleeves off\nAs much as we's floss, still hard to please boss\nDon't be lyin' bitchin' and cryin' - suck it up as a loss\nCause your, acts is wack, your whole label is wack\nAnd matter fact, eh eh-eh eh a-hold that\n[Chorus]\nI.. am..  #1 - no matter if you like it\nHere take it sit down & write it\nI.. am.. number one\nHey hey hey hey hey hey - now let me ask you man\nWhat does it take to be #1?\n2 is not a winner and three nobody remembers (hey)\nWhat does it take to be #1?\nHey hey hey hey..\n\n[Verse 2]\nDo you like it when I shake it for ya, daddy? Move it all around?\nLet you get a peep before it touches the ground?\nHell yeah ma I love a girl that's willin to learn\nWillin' to get in the driver's seat and willin to turn\nAnd not concerned about that he say, she say, did he say\nWhat I think he said? Squash that, he probably got that off eBay\nOr some, Internet access some, website chat line\nMad cause I got mine, don't wind up on the flat line\nOhh if my uncle could see me now\nIf he could see how many rappers wanna be me now\nStraight emulatin my style right to the \"down down\"\nCan't leave out the store now better wait 'til they calm down\nI got hella shorties, comin askin, \"Yo where the party?\"\nOhh lordy - will I continue to act naughty?\nMixing Cris' and Bacardi, got me thinkin' fo' sho'\nI'm not a man of many words but there's one thing I know - Pimp\nSee Nelly LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like[Chorus]\nI.. am.. number one - no matter if you like it\nHere take it sit down and write it\nHey I.. am.. number one\nHey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey\nTell me now Dirty\nWhat does it take to be number one?\nTwo is not a winner and three nobody remembers (tell me)\nWhat does it take to be number one?\nHey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey\n\n[Verse 3]\nCheck it, uhh, check, yo\nAiyyo I'm tired of people judgin' what's real Hip-Hop\nHalf the time you be them niggas who fuckin album flop\nYOU KNOW! Boat done sank and it ain't left the dock\nC'MON! Mad cause I'm hot; HE JUST - mad cause he not\nYou ain't gotta gimme my props, just gimme the yachts\nGimme my rocks, and keep my fans comin in flocks\n'Til you top the Superbowl, keep your mouth on lock\nShhhhh.. {*crickets*} I'm awake, ha ha ha!\nI'm cocky on the mic but I'm humble in real life\nTaking nothin for granted blessin e'rything on my life\nTrying to see a new light at the top of the roof\nBaby name not Sigel but I speak The Truth\nI heat the booth - Nelly actin so uncouth\nTop down shirt off in the coupe, spreadin the loot\nWith my family and friends, and my closest of kin\nAnd I'll do it again if it means I'mma win\n[Chorus]\nHey\nDirty I.. am.. number one - no matter if you like it\nHere take it sit down and write it\nI..I..I am.. number one\nTwo is not a winner and three

baby knows me better than I do\nFunny how a woman has that over a man\nI can do anything with her here beside me\nLeaning on her is where I make my stand\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere would we be without the love of a woman\nStanding behind her man even when he's wrong\nThe true pure undying love of a woman\nMakes a man a fool to think he can make it alone\n[Verse 2]\nMy daddy was a wild one when he was younger\nEverybody told my mama he'd be hard to tame\nFull of himself he said 'sir' to nobody\nBut you oughta see him come a runnin' when mama calls his name\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere would we be without the love of a woman\nStanding behind her man even when he's wrong\nThe true pure undying love of a woman\nMakes a man a fool to think he can make it alone\n\n[Verse 3]\nA man goes crazy trying to catch his feelings\nToo much pride or maybe the words come out wrong\nBut that's okay 'cause he's still her hero\nSteady as a rock, her love keeps rolling along\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere would we be without the love of a woman\nStanding behind her man even when he's wrong\nThe true pure undying love of a woman\nMakes a man a fool to think he can make it alone\n\n[Tag]\nMakes a man a fool to think he can make it aloneSee Travis Tritt LiveGet tickets as low as $17You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/1001169", "artist_names": "112", "full_title": "Dance
