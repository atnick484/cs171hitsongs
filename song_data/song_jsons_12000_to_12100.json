sunshine since I don't know when\nI'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on\nBut that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I was just a baby, my mama told me, \"Son\nAlways be a good boy, don't ever play with guns\"\nBut I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die\nWhen I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry\n[Verse 3]\nI bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car\nThey're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars\nWell, I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free\nBut those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine\nI bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line\nFar from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay\nAnd I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues awayYou might also like25Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/808590", "artist_names": "Andy Kim", "full_title": "How'd We

Blues LyricsINTRO\n\nRobert Johnson - Me and The Devil Blues\n\nEarly this morning, When you knocked upon my door\nEarly this morning, oooh, When you knocked upon my door\nI said Hello Satan, I believe it's time to go\n\nBRIDGE 1 [THEJONESMOB]\n\nI wanna spark a doobie in school\nSo I can spark the idea that we don't wanna follow rules\nBut I'm independent and the crowd will squish me beneath\nSee I'm the only one trying so I'm seen as the least\nNow if the whole world came and said fuck education\nNo one would protest, It'd be the choice of the nation\nIt's the amount of people who make the movements happen\nAnd for now it's me against the world, captain\n\nVERSE 1: [THEJONESMOB]\n\nSatan be tempting us\nBut we feel as if we're tempting ourselves because we ain't seen the presence of hell\nI guess Satan is imagination\nIt's self benefit that lead's us into damnation\n\nTell me who would give a buck to an old fiend\nWho can't eat yet owns the money for a Rollie\nYou selfish fucker now this old man won't eat\nBut you rap bout ice on your wrist until you go cheap\n\nKill a man to save yourself, I speak for most humans\nI would, given I lived moment then I'd do it\nTo break a life, rather than take it away\nIs a form of murder like the Eye's breaking of J\n\nSince these rich men murder, I must too\nIf I my soul be unto Satan so I can live and truly party\nBut I ain't trying to party\nI mean, why gain the world and lose your soul if you can't even choose the cost\nYou might also likeWatch a conspiracy video on youtube and y'all say\n\u201cgolly, guess the truth's beyond me\u201d\nYour idea of New World Order is based off\nImmortal Technique and a youtube vid, stupid kids\n\nThis a movement kids, and y'all need proof to stop me\nI could prove to Gotti, that J got the wrong theme\nCause worshiping another human ain't great\nYou can't pray for nothing but your own fate\n\nIt's in your brain, these secret spirits don't exist\nNo one's gone say zip if you don't believe this phony shit\nIts paper tigers in your mind, stop your moaning kid\nLike homie, you don't know me but the whole world owe me, strip\n8\nNo one listens to you, but they can see you speaking\nHearing and listening are different, do you perceive me\nYou've got a voice but it ain't that loud\nMe too, but I ain't that proud\n\nBRIDGE 2 [THEJONESMOB]\n\nI wanna spark a doobie at home\nSo I can spark the idea that my parents don't own/ me\nBut I'm independent and the crowd'll squish me beneath\nSee I'm the only one trying so I'm seen as the least\nBut if the children said I don't want a mom or dad\nThe parent's would decide on the children they had\nIt's the amount of people who make the movements happen\nAnd for now it's me against the world, captain\n\nVERSE 2 [THEJONESMOB]\n\nI thought these fucks were a racist group\nBut now that black men represent them it's like they ate the truth\nBack in the day, sadly, a black voice ain't the truth\nNow their voice can rap and that's music so they take the news\n\nOver since the media is focused on the music and if music reps\nIlluminati then they got their way with you\nWho throws up the triangle when they watch the throne\nAnd say they ought to know who J reps if it's not his own\n\nLabel, who's he repping, I can't watch it if I'm sitting on it\nI ain't even like this chair dog I'm just shitting on it 3:32\nNow I'm living life with a promise\nGuess my soul is worth a whole fucking lot if Satan's grip is on it\n\nLike dog you if really want us all to go to hell\nJust toss money to each of us then your plan be going well\nLike damn we overwhelmed, the western world so stressed\nI bet most would throw away religion just to own himself\n\nNone of y'all are atheists, y'all are pagans\nNot the kind that worships witches and dragons\nYou worship riches and wealth and bitches and health\nAnd all of those who generally just live for themselves\n\nYou are your own god, have you not noticed it?\nIf not, tell me why are you living your life knowing it 3:55\nWill one day crumble and be forgotten\nIf you don't worship something your existence would be rotten\n\nAnd if you've got no gods then you've got no goals, 4:04\nBut you have goals, they're sex, money, and benefit, woah\nThose are your gods, no it's just what I like to do\nYou like it cause you seek inner pleasure to enlighten you\n\nYou believe in this mental presence of greatness\nAs humans we know living bored ain't fit for man\nYou need the sex and broads to make it real life\nAnd the drugs and laughter to make it feel right\n\nBRIDGE 3 [THEJONESMOB]\n\nI wanna spark a doobie in jail\nSo I can spark the idea that I don't like the bail\nI'm independent so the crowd will squish me beneath\nSee I'm the only one trying so I'm seen as the least\n\nSee if all the inmates admit they sposed to be there\nThe bail wouldn't count, either way it don't seem fair\nIt's the amount of people who make the movements happen\nAnd for now it's me against the world, captain\n\nVERSE 3 [THEJONESMOB]\n\n4:45\nLast night Robert Johnson came to me in a dream\nHe said it's time to go Matt, you've been leaving a sweet\nReason for us to take you: see you're scheming up schemes\nThat make Satan look phony folks believe that he's weak\n\nI said Rob, look folks ain't ever worship Satan\nSo don't act like they follow him, in fact this world hates him\nThey love themselves and they love their money\nBut they don't know that's Satan thinks it himself, ain't it funny\n5:11\nLook at these arrogant white folk who say that they're Christians\nBecause they go to church once a week and feel above the system\nYou're still worshiping money over your god\nLuke 16:13 your religion is a fraud\n\nThat don't mean there ain't a heaven\nThat just means if there is one you ain't choosing brethren who's sent in\nSo who's to blame for making Illuminati a pop fad\nNot bad, cause now kids live in fear to talk bad\n\nRob was like, \u201c nice speech and shit 5:22\nBut you know nothing bout the devil you a feeble kid\nYou are talking like you know shit and even if\nYou did you're still coming with me deeper kid\u201d\n\nI said Rob, I know you're doing your job\nBut you were just like me fore you turned that knob\nLet the devil the in your house, and revel about\nTil he took your soul and laughed and made you tremble and shout\n\nSee I ain't letting no one in my brain until they break me\nYou'd think it was a rape scene, shit I'm not even eight teen\nStatutory shit, but for now I'll keep my slate clean\nAnd make cream like a hypocrite with a fake dream\n\nBRIDGE 4 [THEJONESMOB]\n\nI wanna spark a doobie at church\nI can spark the idea that it ain't getting us hurt\nBut I'm independent and the crowd will squish me beneath\nSee I'm the only one trying so I'm seen as the least\n\nSo if the whole congregation says that weed is for Jesus\nI'd spark a doobie in church, and wouldn't have to make reasons\nIt's the amount of people who make the movements happen\nAnd for now it's me against the world, captain\n\nVERSE 4 [THEJONESMOB]\n\nGuess don't matter how we each wanna make a fortune\nSince what we hear is tied lies of fake distortion\nThey hate overpopulation yet they hate abortion\nBank's are forfeit so we got all these gangstas morphing\n6:31\nInto pop stars cause the game twisted out proportion\nI make the music, but to publish I hafta ask beforehand\nNo man is favored less his pen works in his sword hand\nBut in a war I prefer the sword, damn\n\nFor six minutes I'm on a roll repeating\nThe same facts over and over to you fuckers til you know the meaning\nIt's the government talking - course there's no deceiving\nThey paid me to make this, you don't know, oh believing\n6:51\nLies it what ties into fear, making life demeaning\nCause we're in fear yet you don't even know the key and\nThe key is that you're living in fear of what you won't believe in\nSince you think it's fake, yet fear is real and normal even\n\nFuck censorship we got wives of soldiers cheating\nOn their husbands, and they don't even show the freedom\nThat their husbands fighting for yet the war is more than beating\nForeigners up, its taking them to court to see them\n7:11\nOn trial to make them admit the whole war they breathe and\nOur governments do this and still we don't notice even\nThis ain't a

loveliest of them all was the Unicorn\n\nThere were green alligators and long necked geese\nSome humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees\nSome cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born\nThe loveliest of all was the Unicorn\n\nNow God seen some sinning and it gave Him pain\nAnd He says \"Stand back, I'm going to make it rain.\"\nHe says \"Hey brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do\nBuild me a floating zoo. And take some of them...\nGreen alligators and long necked geese\nSome humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees\nSome cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born\nDon't you forget My Unicorn.\"\n\nOld Noah was there to answer the call\nHe finished up making the ark just as the rain started fallin\nHe marched in the animals two by two\nAnd he called out as they went through, \"Hey Lord, I got your...\"\n\nGreen alligators and long necked geese\nSome humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees\nSome cats and rats and elephants, but Lord I'm so forlorn\nI just can't see no Unicorn.\"\n\nThen Noah looked out through the driving rain\nThem Unicorns were hiding, playing silly games\nKicking and splashing while the rain was pouring\nOh them silly Unicorns\n\nThere were green alligators and long necked geese\nSome humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees\nNoah cried \"Close the door, cause the rain is pouring\nAnd we just can't wait for no Unicorn.\"\n\nThe ark started movin, it drifted with the tide\nThem Unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried\nAnd the waters came down and sort of floated them away\nAnd that's why you'll never seen a Unicorn... to this very day\nYou might also likeYou'll see green alligators and long necked geese\nSome humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees\nSome cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born\nYou're never

hates dad\nLast night you shoulda heard the fight they had\nGave little sister another bad dream\nShe woke us all up with a terrible scream\n[Chorus]\nSkip a rope, skip a rope\nOh, listen to the children while they play\nNow ain't it kinda funny what the children say?\nSkip a rope\n\n[Verse 2]\nCheat on your taxes, don't be a fool\nNow what was that they said about a golden rule?\nNevermind the rules, just play to win\nAnd hate your neighbor for the shade of his skin\n\n[Chorus]\nSkip a rope, skip a rope\nOh, listen to the children while they play\nNow ain't it kinda funny what the children say?\nSkip a rope\n\n[Verse 3]\nStab 'em in the back, that's the name of the game\nAnd mommy and daddy are who's to blame\n\n[Chorus]\nSkip a rope, skip a rope\nJust listen to your children

floor\nI was feeling kinda seasick\nBut the crowd called out for more\nThe room was humming harder\nAs the ceiling flew away\nWhen we called out for another drink\nThe waiter brought a tray\n[Chorus]\nAnd so it was that later\nAs the miller told his tale\nThat her face, at first just ghostly\nTurned a whiter shade of pale\n\n[Bridge 1]\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe said, there is no reason\nAnd the truth is plain to see\nBut I wandered through my playing cards\nAnd would not let her be\nOne of sixteen vestal virgins\nWho were leaving for the coast\nAnd although my eyes were open\nThey might have just as well've been closed\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd so it was that later\nAs the miller told his tale\nThat her face at first just ghostly\nTurned a whiter shade of pale\n\n[Bridge 2]\nYou might also like[Additional Verse]\nShe said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'\nThough in truth we were at sea\nSo I took her by the looking glass\nAnd forced her to agree\nSaying, 'You must be the mermaid\nWho took Neptune for a ride.'\nBut she smiled at me so sadly\nThat my anger straightway died\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd so it was that later\nAs the miller told his tale\nThat her face at first just ghostly\nTurned a whiter shade of pale\n[Verse 4]\nIf music be the food of love\nThen laughter is its queen\nAnd likewise if behind is in front\nThen dirt in truth is clean\nMy mouth by then like cardboard\nSeemed to slip straight through my head\nSo we crash-dived straightway quickly\nAnd attacked the ocean bed\n[Chorus]\nAnd so it was that later\nAs the miller told his tale\nThat her face at first just

touch the green, green grass of home\n\n[Spoken:]\nThen I awake and look around me\nAt the four grey walls that surround me\nAnd I realize, yes, I was only dreaming\nFor there's a guard and there's a sad old padre -\nArm in arm we'll walk at daybreak\nAgain I touch the green, green grass of home\n\n\nYes, they'll all come to see me in the shade\nOf that old oak tree\nAs they lay me neath the

sound of a big war bird\n\n[Verse 2]\nUp in the sky, a man in a plane\nBaron von Richthofen was his name\nEighty men tried, and eighty men died\nNow, they're buried together on the countryside\n[Chorus]\nTen, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more\nThe Bloody Red Baron was rollin' up the score\nEighty men died tryin' to end that spree\nOf the Bloody Red Baron of Germany\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn the nick of time, a hero arose\nA funny-lookin' dog with a big black nose\nHe flew into the sky to seek revenge\nBut the Baron shot him down (Curses, foiled again!)\n\n[Chorus]\nTen, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more\nThe Bloody Red Baron was rollin' up the score\nEighty men died tryin' to end that spree\nOf the Bloody Red Baron of Germany\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow, Snoopy had swore that he'd get that man\nSo he asked the Great Pumpkin for a new battle plan\nHe challenged the German to a real dogfight\nWhile the Baron was laughin', he got him in his sight\n\n[Musical Interlude]\nYou might also like[Verse 5]\nThat Bloody Red Baron was in a fix\nHe tried everything, but he'd run out of tricks\nSnoopy fired once and he fired twice\nAnd that Bloody Red Baron went spinnin' out of sight\n\n[Chorus]\nTen, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more\nThe Bloody Red Baron was rollin' up the score\nEighty men died tryin' to end that spree\nOf the Bloody Red Baron of Germany\n\n[Outro]\nWell, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more\nThe Bloody Red Baron was rollin' up the score2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/773465",

C'mon, c'mon!\n\n[Camera clicking]\n\nMEDIC: Another bag here.\n\nRAWLS: Christ. Sergeant?\n\nLANDSMAN: Yeah.\nRAWLS: Who are the primaries?\n\nLANDSMAN: Cole and Norris. Cole's here, and Norris is at the hospital.\n\nRAWLS: What do you need?\n\nLANDSMAN: Room to work. I keep ordering people off the scene, and between narcotics, D.E.A. and the two districts, we keep collecting more and more bodies around here.\n\nRAWLS: Nobody move! I said, nobody fucking move! If you have not been assigned a specific task by a homicide detective, you need to step away from this crime scene. Is there anybody doesn't understand a direct order? If you have not specifically been instructed otherwise, then remove your useless interfering asses from the area. Now! Slow this thing down to a crawl. Give these bastards no chance to fuck up in a meaningful way.\n\nLANDSMAN: Okay.\n\nBUNK: Aah! Wedged all the way to the back.\n\nLANDSMAN: She couldn't get to it.\n\nBUNK: Well, she taped it up front, but as soon as she put any weight on these worn-ass car seats, they pulled the tape off. Gun slid back behind the mesh as they drove, probably.\n\nRAWLS: Christ. Where was her support?\n\nLANDSMAN: There were they were several blocks distant. I think she got turned around in the alleys, she gave her 20 as the north side of Warwick.\n\nRAWLS: They went there on the shots?\n\nLANDSMAN: This, uh... Foxtrot finally found her.\nRAWLS: So, we had two units covering the north side and a helicopter up on top. And no one saw any vehicles in flight.\n\n[Police radio chatter]\n\nLANDSMAN: Bunk... Terry, Mike, c'mon.\n\nHERC: What the fuck happened?\n\nNORRIS: You didn't have an eyeball?\n\nDANIELS: On those streets, there's no way you can eyeball it. She was throwing out 20s as best she could.\n\nNORRIS: Understood, I'm just asking.\n\nDANIELS: The link we have to this is Savino Bratton. A minor lieutenant to our target, Barksdale. I gave your people all that at the scene.\n\nNORRIS: And we're hitting his last knowns. We're on that. The set-up was more than him. Casings are and her Glock was full up, so.\n\nBURRELL: How bad?\n\nNORRIS: Chest wound, no exit. Through-and-through to the throat. She wasn't stabilized.\n\nDANIELS: They had the pressure pants on her. Trying to push up the pulse.\n\nNORRIS: They put those pants on you, it ain't good.\nBURRELL: Right.\n\nNORRIS: So, you're on Baker when you hear the shots. Where was the second car?\n\nDANIELS: Um, Warwick, I think.\n\nNORRIS: Okay. You've got everything and to the west is the railbed.\n\nDANIELS: What did Foxtrot see?\n\nNORRIS: Nothing moving except our units.\n\nCOMMISSIONER: Lieutenant... I know just how you feel. This is the toughest job a police commissioner has. I don't think I'll ever get used to it.\n\nNORRIS: Um, this is Lieutenant Daniels.\n\nCOMMISSIONER: Oh, right, right, of course. This entire department stands behind Detective Greggs in every possible way. I just thought you should know that.\n\nDANIELS: Yes, sir.\n\nPA SYSTEM: Please report to room 12. ... Please report to room 12.\n\nBUNK: Jaybird. We have a runner.\n\nLANDSMAN: Yeah, we're gonna need casts of these two imprints.\n\nDETECTIVE: Put the lab tech on. 11-39.\n\nD.E.A. COP: It's not that the money is anyone's primary concern. I understand that. I'm not going to be standing here giving a shit about the money when you people have lost... Well, one of your own who might... I mean, Jesus, this is awful. On the other hand, if we can get to this Savino character quick--\n\nRAWLS: Hey! Fuck your money.\n\n[Sirens]\n\nRAWLS: Jimmy? You hurt?\n\nMcNULTY: No. It's hers.\n\nRAWLS: C'mon, get up. Let's go, up with you. C'mon.\n\nMcNULTY: Couldn't talk, couldn't breathe. Nothing. She went into the ambo that way. Is she, uh... The fuck did I do?\n\nRAWLS: C'mon, walk.\n\nLANDMAN: What's that?\n\nRAWLS: What's our plan, Ray?\n\nCOLE: Bunk and Jay stay with the scene. Keeley and Crutchfield are at the office typing the warrants for this Savino fuck.\n\nRAWLS: Who's on the autopsy? Me, I'm at the morgue. Norris and Holley stay at shock trauma in case she sits up and talks.\n\nRAWLS: We're laser printing the car, right?\n\nCOLE: 'Course, Worden's on that.\n\nD.E.A. COP: You're in command for the city, right?\n\nRAWLS: Major Rawls, homicide.\n\nD.E.A.

We got a wire up.\n\nHERC:So?\n\nFREAMON: So we got a wire up on some motherfucker that just shot a cop. If somebody talks, if somebody gets on the wrong phone and says the wrong fuckin' thing about what happened here tonight, where the fuck do you want to be?! HERC: Church roof?\n\nCARVER: Yeah, you and me. Sydnor takes the McCulloh street phone.\n\nFREAMON: Anybody get in contact with Kima's people?\n\nCARVER: Shit. I'll do that first, meet you at the church.\n\nLANDSMAN: Bunk, Mike.\n\nLITTLE MAN: Wonder who that bitch was.\n\nBEY: Always some shit, right?\n\nLITTLE MAN: Yeah.\n\n(Phone ringing) Male: Yo.\n\nBEY: Done.\n\nSTRINGER: Alright.\n\nBEY: Let's get outta here.\n\nLITTLE MAN: Yeah.\n\nLANDSMAN: Lab tech to this spot.

Yeah, yeah.\n\nLANDSMAN: (Chuckling) you're camped here. Nobody touches this shit, nobody even comes near it until the tech does his recovery. Whoa. Hello.\n\nBUNK: He stopped running.\n\nLANDSMAN: Either he got tired or--\n\nBUNK: Or he got into a car.\n\nLANDSMAN: Right. 11-34.\n\nMALE ON THE RADIO: Go ahead, 11-34.\n\nBUNK: I'm in the 3,000 block of Lanvale backing up to the C.S.X. Bed. I need a lab unit and a D.P.W. Crew with a jackhammer.\n\nMALE ON THE RADIO: A jackhammer?\n\nBUNK: Gonna keep a bit of road, K.G.A.\n\nDANIELS: Alive. In the O.R.\n\nRAWLS: My people at the scene have heard this already. It's a copy of the original.\n\nCHIEF: Okay, we brought a machine-- where the fuck is--\n\nDETECTIVE: Sir.\n\nCHIEF: Oh, here it is, here. Yeah, put it there.\n\n[Music playing]\n\nMALE: Don't fuck with this count.\n\nDANIELS: That's Savino. I'll be right back with ya shit.\n\nGREGGS: Where are we? That sign said Longwood, but I could swear this is Warwick.\n\nORLANDO: Hoppers be turning the sign poles to fuck with y'all.\n\nGREGGS: I make it we're on the north side of Warwick, in an alley, I don't know, shit, half a block west. I hope y'all copy that. This got the right feel for you?\n\nORLANDO: He better not be long 'cause, see, I don't know where the stash is, and if they draggin' us all over this part of town, you know--\n\nGREGGS: What's that?\n\nBURRELL: Oh, Jesus.\n\nGREGGS: Somethin' ain't right.\n\nORLANDO: What?\n\nGREGGS: Shit ain't right. Oh, Christ.\n\nMALE: Fucker.\n\n[Gunshots]\n\nGREGGS: signal 13, signal 13. What the fuck?\n\nDANIELS: She can't reach the gun.\n\nGREGGS: What the fuck?

You did a lot of shit here. You played a lot of fucking cards and you made a lot of fucking people do a lot of fucking things they didn't want to do. This is true. We both know this is true. You, McNulty, are a gaping asshole. We both know this. Fuck if everybody in C.I.D. doesn't know it. But fuck if I'm gonna stand here and say you did a single fucking thing to get a police shot. You did not do this, you fucking hear me? This is not on you. No, it isn't, asshole. Believe it or not, everything isn't about you. And the motherfucker saying this, he hates your guts, McNulty. So you know if it was on you, I'd be the sonofabitch to say so. Shit went bad. She took two for the company. That's the only lesson here.\n\nCOPS: Police! Police! Police, let me see your hands!

Two pages to stringer tonight, right? Only this one after the shooting.\n\nPREZ: Who's o-7? And what phone is he asking for stringer to call him back?\n\nBEY: Shit went good, but there was--\n\nSTRINGER: Hold on.\n\nRADIO: Officer was shot around 12:30 this morning. The officer may have been undercover...\n\nSTRINGER: Alright, so, talk.\n\nBEY: Like i said, it went good, except there was this bitch curled up in the back-seat. Surprised the shit out of us.\n\nSTRINGER: Uh-huh.\n\nBEY: Didn't even see her 'til the shit popped off. I mean, if it was up to me, I'd let the girl walk, she didn't look like the talkin' type. But Little Man seen her, and bugged out, let a couple go.\n\nSTRINGER: Savino didn't tip y'all off to that bitch?\n\nBEY: Wasn't no time for that. He get up out the car, we see him go up the block like we said, right? After that, he out of sight and we bring it home like we planned, baby.\n\nSTRINGER: Well, Shorty was a cop. And she ain't dead. Where'd y'all put the guns?\n\nBEY: She wasn't no cop, man. She look like one of Orlando's ho's.\n\nSTRINGER: Bey, where the fuck are the guns?\n\nBEY: A storm drain off of Park Heights, man. What the fuck is wrong with Little Man? I mean, this motherfucker bugged out one time. Well, he gonna bug out again, when he find out Shorty's a fuckin' cop? I mean, c'mon, man. Savino got a story that he can keep to and he know it, but Little Man, he always been fuckin' weak like that. Little Man gotta go. Yo, you hear me? Yo, this shit gonna get real heavy. You understand me, Bey? We gotta fall back. I wanna see how it go with this Savino bullshit, see how they go past that. But if the shit don't hold, or if this motherfuckin' cop wake up and start talkin' shit, then you gotta go sky up. Where you got your peoples at?\n\nBEY: New York... Jersey, Cleveland.\n\nSTRINGER: Alright, so, um, Philly, D.C. You know what I'm sayin'? No profile, no connections, no noise. You feel me, right? Alright. We gotta be careful.\n\n[Muffled voices]\n\nCHERYL: Jesus. Look, sorry. It's alright, you just scared me.\n\nCARVER: I, uh... I work with Kima. Uh... Kima, she, uh...\n\nCHERYL: Kima, Kima's at work.

Dr. Jones to the nurses' station.\n\nSURGEON: We can't really know for sure.\n\nCARVER: Lieutenant? I'm sitting over there with Kima's girl and, I mean, maybe somebody from the department or the city, maybe might want to say something.\n\nBURRELL: Who's here from the family? A daughter, you say?\n\nCARVER: A daughter? Officer Greggs has a girl?\n\nDANIELS: A roommate. The family's in Richmond, driving up first thing today, but the roommate's already here.\n\nBURRELL: I'll do it myself.\n\nCARVER: No problem. If we lose her, he can always pose for the funeral.\n\nNORRIS: Still need a right door for Savino. His last knowns, his girlfriend, his mama, all empty holes.\n\nLANDSMAN: Tracers picked up a couple hairson one of the hoodies. That's something.\n\nBUNK: So, either these motherfuckers are a pair of neighborhood yo's, who lucked into $30,000 on a street stickup or...\n\nLANDSMAN: Or they're pros who set up in an alley on one side of the tracks, then slip over to the other side where they park their ride.\n\nBUNK: What about the post?\n\nCOLE: Cause and manner of death on Mr. Blocker is homicide, to wit, close-range G.S.W.'S to the shoulder, chest and left arm. Nine millimeter, suitable for comparison.\n\nNORRIS: We pulled something different from the back seat of the car, right?\n\nBUNK: Yeah, 380, semi-jacketed. Casings were different, too. So, we confirmed the two shooters.\n\nFREAMON: Print hit. Wynton \"Little Man\" Rice, enforcer in the two-two-one, a definite connect to Barksdale's world.\n\nLANDSMAN: Print hit? Print hit from what?\n\nFREAMON: Soda can. Dropped at the pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere. Still had a little fizz in it when i got there.\n\nLANDSMAN: What the fuck is this pay phone at Park Heights and Belvedere?\n\nFREAMON: It's a phone from which some motherfucker paged Stringer Bell 20 minutes after the shooting. I dusted the phone, too, but it was smudged.\n\nLANDSMAN: So, we got a Barksdale pro in the northwest, ringing up the boss minutes after the deed. So much for the amateur-hour theory.\n\nNORRIS: Good pull. You are?\n\nFREAMON: Freamon, Lester Freamon.\n\nNORRIS: Where you workin'?\n\nFREAMON: Pawn shop unit.\n\nDEE: I mean, how you gonna shoot a police, yo? Ain't no percentage in that, you know what I'm sayin'?\n\nPOOT: For real.\n\nDEE: Somebody around here do that shit, you know every knocko in the world be down here, buin' heads.\n\nBODIE: I guess them Park Heights nigga's just ain't got no fuckin' common sense. A lotta heart, just no sense.\n\nBOY: Hey, yo, Poot. Wallace on the phone, yo.\n\nPOOT: Yeah?\n\nDEE: Wallace?\n\nPOOT: Nigga ring me up twice a day whether he got shit to say or not. Homesick motherfucker makin' me bug, yo.\n\nDEE: Yo, where's he at, yo?\n\nPOOT: At the shore with his grandma, down there...\n\nBODIE: Surfin' or some bullshit. Or something.\n\nPA SYSTEM: Dr. Zellesky, you have a call on line five. Dr. Zellesky, you have a call on line five.\n\n[Pager beeping]\n\n[Tires screeching]\n\nCOP: You just use that phone?\n\nBUBBLES: Yeah, a little earlier, man. Y'all might wanna go to Mosher\nStreet.\n\nCOP: Just now, you used it?\n\nBUBBLES: Yeah.\n\nCOP: Man downtown needs to talk to you.\n\nBUBBLES: Man downtown? Okay, make some sense for this for me, please, alright? I ain't never been so clean in my whole damn life.\n\nCOP: Look, man, I'm just doin' my job.\n\nBUBBLES: Okay.\n\nPOOT: What up, Mr. Beachfront property?\n\nWALLACE: Naw, fool, I told you, I'm bayside. My grandmother on the bayside.\n\nPOOT: Still, man, you on vacation and not bringin' me with you. How you get all the way down there, anyhow?\n\nWALLACE: I took a bus.\n\nPOOT: Well, shit, tell me how to go and I grab a 'hound, too. Come down there and hang with your ass.\n\nWALLACE: No, man, it ain't like that, yo. The air down here all sticky. Worse than Baltimore, yo. And these crickets, louder than a motherfuck. Can't get no sleep. I don't think I'm cut out to be no country-ass nigga, man.\n\nOPERATOR: Please deposit two dollars for an additional two minutes.\n\nWALLACE: Shit, I gotta go.\n\nPOOT: You can take a nigga up out the Westside, but you can't take--\n\n[busy signal]\n\nHOLLEY: What's your name?\n\nBUBBLES: Look, I didn't do shit here, okay?\n\nHOLLEY: I asked you your name.\n\nBUBBLES: Naw, this shit ain't right.\n\nHOLLEY: Who'd you try to page, shitbird?\n\nBUBBLES: Why the fuck do you care, okay? I mean...\n\nHOLLEY: You have exactly three more seconds to explain yourself to me, asshole.\n\nBUNK: One shooter definitely opened the passenger door, so, any latent prints from that side of the car. (Muffled shouting )\n\nHOLLEY: Why'd you page her, shitbird?!\n\nBUBBLES: Get off me. Get off me!\n\nHOLLEY: You think this is a fucking game?!\n\nBUBBLES: I wanna talk to detective Greggs.\n\nHOLLEY: You can't, motherfucker.\n\nBUBBLES: Then, McNulty then, this shit ain't right, sir!\n\nSANTANGELO: Savino, Savino. Mope ain't around.\n\nHERC: (Speed dialing and ringing) Yeah, one of them low-rise hopper's on tower phone two.\n\nFREAMON: Okay.\n\n[Camera clicking]\n\nPREZ: Maybe he forgot the number.\n\n[Camera clicking]\n\nSANTANGELO: The fuck was that?\n\nHERC: You don't know? We just caught a re-up off a tower stash. Fourth floor, south side, second unit down. (Speed dialing and ringing)\n\nDANIELS: Put that away. Put that away and work the case.\n\nMcNULTY: Can I ask you something ? How much of this case would you\ngive up to get her back?\n\nDANIELS: That's not the point.\n\nMcNULTY: Well, how much?\n\nDANIELS: All of it. But it doesn't work that way. You can't give it back. I'm sitting here with a hospital progress report that shows no fucking progress. She's not conscious, she's intubated. She's had a trach and a lung collapse, and if she's got a shred of luck, the shot she took to the neck didn't catch any spine.\n\n[Phone ringing]\n\nMcNULTY: It wasn't worth it.\n\nPREZ: Homicide for McNulty on line two.\n\nDANIELS: Do your job.\n\nMcNULTY: Yeah?\n\nBUNK: So how you doin' with it?\n\nMcNULTY: I'll live.\n\nBUNK: Yeah? Well, listen, Jimmy, we had a little dust-up over here. Holley mighta beat one of your girl's C.I.'S on spec.\n\nMcNULTY: What is he, a short guy? Mumbles a lot?\n\nBUNK: Yeah, that's him. You might wanna roll past and squelch this shit before it gets outta hand.\n\nMcNULTY: Yeah.\n\nSTRINGER: It ain't worth it, man.\n\nAVON: Naw.\n\nSTRINGER: It ain't worth it at 10 times the price.\n\nAVON: A fucking cop, man. A cop! How stupid is this motherfucker?! If you see a bitch in the car, change it up. We can go to Orlando another fuckin' day.\n\nSTRINGER: Savino say he was tryin' to signal, but he in the dark, he don't know where Bey's at, or where they comin' from.\n\nAVON: Nothin' breakin' our way, man, damn.\n\nSTRINGER: We gotta burn this shit. This is cop money, it's probably marked somehow. The guns are in the sewer, Bey's a rock, so that's cool. But it's the bitch cop. If she wake up and start talkin', she gonna put little man in there, Bey in there.\n\nAVON: What up with little man?\n\nSTRINGER: He's scared. He shot a cop.\n\nAVON: Fuck.\n\nSTRINGER: But I put Bey on that.\n\nAVON: What about Savino?\n\nSTRINGER: Well, Savino, he gotta eat the charge, but he knew that. So if he keep his story tight, he gonna be alright.\n\nAVON: Yeah, we knew Orlando was a snitchin' motherfucker, man. Fuck him, but this cash got us caught up.\n\nSTRINGER: I know, man, that's my fault, man. Bey and Savino came to me with the idea that, yo, if they take Orlando, they can take the cash, too. I was like, alright, y'all get your payday.\n\nAVON: Yo, how the fuck is Orlando gonna front this type of cash? What it say?\n\nSTRINGER: I know, I know. I fucked up, I know.\n\nAVON: A-ight, take this trash outside, fuckin' burn it. Tell wee-Bey to clean up the mess 'fore he jet.\n\nHOLLEY: He was throwin' 911 messages to her pager. I asked him why, he raised up. Shit got outta hand.\n\nMcNULTY: Does he know?\n\nBUNK: Uh-uh.\n\nBUBBLES: Hey, McNulty, man. What they doin' over there, man? It's fucked up.\n\nMcNULTY: Last night, she got shot.\n\nBUBBLES: Where the fuck were you at? Where were you?\n\nMcNULTY: I was there.\n\nLANDSMAN: Hey, Bunk. We got no good latents on the passenger side door.\n\nBUNK: What about the dash?\n\nLANDSMAN: Call the lab.\n\nBUBBLES: So, what can I do?\n\nMcNULTY: Well, for one thing you can roll around the projects, see who's missing. Who ain't around. You okay with that?\n\nBUBBLES: Yeah, yeah, I just, um... I been keepin' it kinda close, you know? Ain't been around the projects much lately, you know what I'm sayin'?\n\nMcNULTY: You beefin' with someone down there?\n\nBUBBLES: Naw. No, I'm not beefin' with...\n\nMcNULTY: Eyes open, Bubbs. For Kima. Hang loose, I'll get you a ride.\n\nMcNULTY: Where are we with Savino?\n\nBUNK: Ah, still M.I.A.\n\nMcNULTY: Enough of this bullshit.\n\nLEVY: Well, if he calls me for anything, I'll tell him to turn himself in. You know I'm going to do that.\n\nMcNULTY: Not good enough.\n\nLEVY: Excuse me?\n\nMcNULTY: We need him now.\n\nRONNIE: No, thanks.Perhaps as an officer of the court, you could endeavor to--\n\nMcNULTY: Ronnie here is being polite. She's a member of your twisted little tribe, so she's putting it into your twisted little language. Me? I wouldn't wipe my ass with a Baltimore lawyer, no offense.\n\nLEVY: None taken.\n\nMcNULTY: I mean, I'm willing to let you ratfuckers suborn perjury, and blow smoke up a judge's ass and jury-tamper your balls off, without losing the slightest bit of my sunny disposition. And fuck me if I don't let you structure your cash into briefcase fees, either. That's between you and the I.R.S. And neither one of you is anybody's friend, right?\n\nRONNIE: I think what Jimmy is trying to say is--\n\nMcNULTY: No, what Jimmy is saying is if you want me to keep my nose closed to your shit, then you're gonna have to throw me something when I need it, and right now I need Savino Bratton in bracelets.\n\nLEVY: I don't know where he is.\n\nMcNULTY: Well, you repped him the last four felonies. I'm guessing you can get word to him if you want to. A police may die, Maury, and Savino was there. He comes in this afternoon, and he takes the drug charge at least.\n\nLEVY: Or what?\n\nMcNULTY: Or we send tactical teams into his momma's every night, 'til there's no house left to worry about. And you get a target letter from the state's attorney's office, followed by subpoenas for every fucking bank account in your fucking name. And let's see if all those cash deposits match the reported income.\n\nLEVY: I'm hearing this from him, and I understand that he's distraught. I understand that. Am I hearing this from the state's attorney's office as well?\n\nRONNIE: You are.\n\nLEVY: I'll see what I can do.\n\nRONNIE: Fuck you, Jimmy! You didn't tell me that was coming.\n\nMcNULTY: He'll bring him in.\n\nRONNIE: He will if he can, that's not the point.\n\nMcNULTY: Well, what's the point?\n\nRONNIE: The point is that Maury Levy is a past officer of the monumental bar association, and unless I want to spend my whole life as a fucking A.S.A.., I can't spend my afternoons pissing on people who matter.\n\nMcNULTY: Another career in the balance.\n\nRONNIE: Fuck you.\n\nMcNULTY: No, fuck you. If only half you motherfuckers at the district attorney's office didn't want to be judges, didn't want to be partners in some downtown law firm, if half of you had the fucking balls to follow through, you know what would happen?\n\nRONNIE: Oh.\n\nMcNULTY: A guy like that would be indicted, tried and convicted. And the rest of 'em would back up enough, so we could push a clean case or two through your courthouse. But no, everybody stays friends. Everybody gets paid. And everybody's got a fucking future.\n\nRONNIE: You'll just use anyone, won't you?\n\nPREZ: So, I been searchin' the logs for pager hits that used an 0-7 code, right? It comes up now and then on D'Angelo's pager. Stringer's too, but less often. Most of the time, there's nothing to place the guy, but check it.\n\nFREAMON: And this is on Stringer's page?\n\nPREZ: It comes back to the pay phone in the emergency room at Maryland general hospital.\n\nFREAMON: Let me guess. The date of this page is the same day that Stinkum got killed.\n\nPREZ: And Wee-Bey got shot in the leg.\n\nFREAMON: That was the talk on the wire, anyway.\n\nPREZ: You go to Maryland general and pull the E.R. records for that morning, you're gonna find Wee-Bey in the pile. 0-7 is Wee-Bey, it's gotta be.\n\nFREAMON: And we have Wee-Bey and Little Man at the pay phone at Park Heights, 20 minutes after the ambush, throwing a page to Stringer.\n\nRAWLS: We're all over town for this piece-of-shit Savino.\n\nBURRELL: With ties to the Barksdale organization?\n\nDANIELS: Yes, sir.\n\nBURRELL: What else?\n\nDANIELS: Well, the case is progressing. We're starting to glean some possible shooters from the wiretap.\n\nBURRELL: You know, I asked for the controlled buy. I put one of our people in harm's way. So, right now I want to make sure that we are doing everything.\n\nCHIEF: We are, sir, we're on it.\n\nBURRELL: Good. The commissioner wants raids citywide. Every door we can take. Any addresses we can write on, anything connected to a narcotics case. C.I.D., Tactical, the D.E.U.'S and tomorrow, on the 6:00 news, we put a lot of fucking dope on the table. A lot of it!\n\nDANIELS: Dope on the table?\n\nBURRELL: We need to let them know who we are. We can't for one minute let them think that this will stand. The commissioner wants to send a message, Lieutenant. You make sure you and your people do everything possible to see that it is heard.\n\nDANIELS: Dope on the damn table.\n\nCHIEF: Hey, it's like the man said. We're letting them know who we are.\n\nDANIELS: Yeah? And who the hell are we?\n\nLEVY: Again, for the record, let's make clear that Mr. Bratton has not been mirandized and that what is said at this juncture is for purposes of a proffer. Agreed?\n\nNATHAN: Agreed.\n\nLEVY: Okay, then. Here you go. That's baking soda. Which Mr.. Bratton intended to sell to Orlando Blocker. You can keep it with our compliments.\n\nLANDSMAN: Where's the money?\n\nLEVY: Mr. Bratton did not receive money. He left it in the car when he went to retrieve the sham cocaine. If you were recording the transaction, the tape will confirm this.\n\nMcNULTY: And he wasn't around for the shooting either. In fact, he doesn't know who the shooters are.\n\nLANDSMAN: And God knows he wasn't in on the setup. I mean, it was pure dumb luck that he left them in an dead-end alley and they were shot-to-shit just two minutes later.\n\nBUNK: This is bullshit! A police is down.\n\nLEVY: Mr. Bratton had no knowledge that the young woman was a police officer. And no intention of doing anything other than defrauding Mr. Blocker of $30,000. Ms. Nathan?\n\nNATHAN: No charge if he gives us the shooters. And if he testifies, we'll find a way to squeeze him into the federal witness program.\n\nLEVY: As I indicated, Mr. Bratton has no idea who shot Mr. Blocker or the undercover officer. Best you can do is 286-b.\n\nMcNULTY: What the hell is that?\n\nRONNIE: Distribution of sham C.D.S., Three year maximum, $5,000 fine.\n\nMcNULTY: That's it?\n\nRONNIE: If he took the cash, we could go to d, but the tape has him leaving the money.\n\nLANDSMAN: Three years.\n\nNATHAN: A cop was shot, Maury. So, if we convict, he'll do every damn day of the three.\n\nSAVINO: I can do the three, ain't no thing.\n\nBUNK: And the $5,000 fine? Oh, shit, you still up 25, right?\n\nMcNULTY: Nicely done.\n\nBUYER: Gimme two, yo.\n\n[Radio playing]\n\nDEE: Damn, Orlando, yo. I still can't believe that shit.\n\nBODIE: Man, all this shit behind this motherfucker. Who the fuck was he?\n\nDEE: He ran a club for my uncle, yo.\n\nBODIE: Yeah?\n\nDEE: Yeah, first Stink, and now him.\n\nBODIE: Yeah, man, and I heard the cop's been all in Savino's shit too.\nHe ain't been around.\n\nDEE: Little Man, neither.\n\nBODIE: Somebody could get to cleanin' up shit around here.\n\nDEE: True. You can't just be goin' around, droppin' five-oh like that, yo.\n\nBODIE: You know how your uncle is when people get to fuckin' up, man. He start takin' that shit personal, man.Look like a couple more nigga's gonna get dropped.\n\nDEE: Yo, what up?\n\nBOY: You Dee?\n\nDEE: Yeah.\n\nBOY: They sayin' you need to get with Stringer, right away, yo.\n\nBODIE: See? You movin' up in the world. As long as you don't fall in with the trash they takin' out.\n\nDEE: Yeah, whatever, nigga. I'll be right back.\n\nPOOT: Tower boys all nervous and shit. Little Man ain't post for work. Ain't answer his pager neither.\n\nBODIE: See?\n\nDANIELS: I'm not gonna lie. She's got swelling around the vertebrae from a through and through, and some indications of partial paralysis. That might go away when the swelling goes down, it might not either. Her family is with her.\n\nPREZ: What the fuck is up with homicide? Are we on the shooters yet?\n\nCOLE: They're working it hard.\n\nDANIELS: The departmental response is to take doors tomorrow morning. Citywide. Every unit, every district is kicking in any drug-connected address they can write on. We're gonna do the same.\n\nMcNULTY: Lieutenant, is that--\n\nDANIELS: Except... We're gonna hold back on the main stash, the house up in northwest we tracked off the wire, for one thing, we advance this case more by sitting on that location. For another, raids that are too much on the bulls-eye will have Barksdale changing up. We might blow the wire altogether.\n\nFREAMON: We got two addresses in the low-rises that are probables, and another two rowhouses off the avenue that have been used to stash as recently as last week. But this, this here is the best bet for a good rip. Herc picked up on it yesterday.\n\nHERC: Fourth floor, end unit on the south side of the two-two-one, they're droppin' the re-ups out of the window to the hoppers who run it off.\n\nCARVER: What if they change up the appartment?\n\nHERC: Well they do that every day. Yesterday was the fifth floor on the north side.\n\nFREAMON: We're gonna have a man on the church watching with a cell phone. They change up, we call the duty judge who orally amends the warrant.\n\nDANIELS: We hit everything at 1100 hours. But the squad that takes the high-rise needs to stage at 0500. We need to be inside before the building even wakes up. Anyone who wants to sleep tonight, he needs to start typing his ass off right now.\n\nDEE: What's up? Why ain't the club open?\n\nSTRINGER: You goin' with Bey. Hey, yo, Bey. Keep it clean. Don't make no mistakes.\n\nDEE: Goin' where?\n\nSTRINGER: What the fuck you waitin' for?\n\n[Muffled talking]\n\nBURRELL: Stop bullshittin' me!\n\nDANIELS: The main stash. He knows we're on it. He knows we held it back.\n\nFREAMON: The deputy. We grab a senator's bag man in the projects, he knows that. State police come in here with a cooperator, he knows that, too.\n\nMcNULTY: It's like fucking clockwork.\n\nFREAMON: He's got a rat. Here, in the detail.\n\nDANIELS: In the beginning, when we started, Burrell had me. I pipelined everything to that motherfucker. But now...\n\nFREAMON: He lost you. So, now he's picked up someone else. That's how they do.\n\n[Chattering]\n\n[Laughing]\n\nMcNULTY: Can we talk?\n\nPHELAN: Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.\n\nMcNULTY: It's Burrell, he's gotta back off already.\n\nPHELAN: What now?\n\nMcNULTY: We're on a prime location. Barksdale's stash. Instead of sitting on it and making cases off it, he wants us to write a paper and take the door.\n\nPHELAN: Why?\n\nMcNULTY: Dope on the table. It's a photo op to make us all feel better about Kima Greggs catching a bullet or two.\n\nPHELAN: Oh, Christ.\n\nMcNULTY: You need to rip him a new one, your Honor.\n\nPHELAN: Ah... I don't know, Jimmy.\n\nMcNULTY: You back on the ticket, huh?\n\nPHELAN: It was just the usual bullshit. They're just, um, dickin' me around, trying to get another black face on the ticket, make it four-and-one to even up for the last time. The governor had to promise two new appointments so, now we're back where we were. That's all it was.\n\nMcNULTY: That's all?\n\nPHELAN: Half-assed hack politics, Jimmy. It has nothing to do with your case.\n\nMcNULTY: I need you on this. So, who's my daddy now?\n\n[Music playing]\n\nBEY: I just do what the fuck they tell me, you know? It ain't on me to know what the fuck they have in mind.\n\nDEE: Look, Bey.\n\nBEY: Now it come down to this crazy shit. Yo, turn in this alley right here. Right there.\n\n[Car radio]\n\nBEY: The fuck you stoppin' for? Go! (Barking) Inside, man, let's go. This dude is crazy.\n\nDEE: Yo, Bey, man.\n\nBEY: Get in, motherfucker. We ain't got all night for this shit. Man, get in here. Go ahead, man. What's wrong with you? Check it out, Dee. I need you to feed 'em while I'm gone. You gonna give 'em different food for each tank, too, alright? But don't worry, I'm gonna show ya what to do, c'mere. These are my tetras. You got Kimmy, Alex, Aubrey and Jezebel in here somewhere. I don't know, she think she cute. You take two pinches of whatever food I got next to each tank. They set for the day. You see, they ain't no problems. Just beautiful as hell, Dee. I'm gonna go upstairs, and pack some shit.\n\nDEE: Yo, Bey! Where we goin', man?\n\nBEY: Philly. You gonna take the truck back, but first I got to go upstairs, grab some shit, show you what to do with my tanks, right?\n\nDEE: Philly, yo?\n\nBEY: We shot a knocko, Dee.\n\nBUBBLES: No Savino. No Little Man, no Wee-Bey either. And then, the Barksdale kid from the pit he's out the mix, too. You think it was them that did it?\n\nMcNULTY: Wee-Bey, Savino, Little Man.\n\nBUNK: Yeah, that's what we we're hearing too. We got pick-ups on these motherfuckers and miles of N.C.I.C. Bullshit. Warrants for blood and hair, too.\n\nMcNULTY: It's Bey and little man, shooter one and shooter two. I feel it, Bunk.\n\nBUNK: Yeah, well, right now, we need our girl to wake up... And say so.\n\nMcNULTY: Alright. You did good, Bubbs.\n\nBUBBLES: McNulty, you know, um... The situation is different for me. I mean, for me, I'm--\n\nDANIELS: Mount up.\n\nMcNULTY: I gotta go. Prez will get you a ride, okay?\n\n[Helicopter hovering]\n\nCOP: Move out.\n\n[Tires screeching]\n\nMALE: Five-oh, five-oh.\n\nCOPS: Police, police! Police! Go, go, go! Show your hands, asshole! Down on the ground. Move it, move it!\n\nDANIELS: McNulty, Freamon, check the basement.\n\nSYDNOR: Clear?\n\nSWAT: All clear.\n\nHERC: Bathroom's clear.\n\nDANIELS: Check the mattress. Check under the bed, check all the drawers, check every fucking inch of this room.\n\nCARVER: Got anything?\n\nHERC: No.\n\nCOP: Bingo.\n\nSYDNOR: Got it.\n\nHERC: There she goes.\n\nDANIELS: Bag it.\n\nCARVER: Let's do it.\n\n[Cameras clicking]\n\nCOMMISSIONER: That's fine police work, Erv.\n\nCOMMISSIONER: Ladies and gentlemen, what you see on the table in front of you, represents our department's answer to a culture of death and drugs. And when an officer falls in this war, others stand ready and carry the fight to the very doorstep of those responsible. Now this is only the beginning, I can assure you. But today, a message has been sent. And believe me, this message is being heard loud and clear, by all those who seek profit and power in the importation and sale of illegal drugs.\n\nPREZ: Slow. Bullshit on the McCulloh street phone, nothing on the towers.\n\nMcNULTY: Who's on the rooftop?\n\nPREZ: No one. Fuck it.\n\nWALLACE: Hey yo, where the money, man?\n\nMALE: How much you need?\n\nWALLACE: Yo, the bus cost like 18, man.\n\nMALE: Your grandma ain't got it?\n\nWALLACE: I ask her, she gonna try to stop me from bookin'. I'm tellin' you, boy, this country-ass shit got me all messed up. I'm sayin', you need to send me sothing for the bus, yo. I'm dyin' here, all broke and shit.\nMALE: Yeah, I feel you. Well, when do you want to come home?\n\nWALLACE: When the money get here.\n\nMALE: Alright, I'm gonna.\n\n[Machines beeping]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again\nHurting me more and more\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMaybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside\n'Cause each day that passes by\nYou got me never knowing if I'm coming or going\n[Chorus]\nBut I, I love you\nThis old heart, darling, is weak for you\nI love you, yes, I do (Yes, I do)\n\n[Verse 2]\nThese old arms of mine miss having you around\nMakes these tears inside start pouring down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAlways with half a kiss, you remind me of what I miss\nThough I try to control myself\nLike a fool I start grinnin'\n'Cause my head starts spinnin'\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I, I love you\nThis old heart, darling, is weak for you\nI love you, yes I do, yes I do\n\n[Verse 3]\nOoh, I try hard to hide my hurt inside\nThis old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'\nThe way you treat me leaves me incomplete\nYou're here for the day, gone for the week now\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nBut if you leave me a hundred times\nA hundred times I'll take you back\nI'm yours whenever you want me\nI'm not too proud to shout it\nTell the world about it\n\n[Outro]\n'Cause I, I love you\nThis old heart, darling, is weak for you\nI love you\nThis old heart, darling, is weak for you (Darling, I'm)\nI love you (Weak for you)\nThis old heart (Darling, I'm), darling, is weak for you (Mad about you)\n(Darling, I'm) I love you (Weak for you)\nYes, I do (Darling, I'm), yes, I do (Mad about you)\n(Darling, I'm) I love you (Weak for you)\nYes, I do (Darling, I'm), darling (Mad about you)1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

(What was this \"If You Want Me\"?   Not a  hit,  really-it had  been  the  flip-side   of \"Bewildered.\" What was it doing in the  list of hits? It sounded good.)  \"I Don't Mind!\" C. \"Be-WIL-dered!\u201d C-sharp. (At  this  point, there's what  sounds like  the first  bit we've  lost from  the  tape \u2013 just a tiny  dropout, but  perhaps  there  was  something edited out  there.) \"Million-dolla sella 'LOST Someone'!\" Not  just a million-seller, mind you, but a million-dollar seller, at a time when a single usually cost 79 cents. \"Lost Someone\" had been  a No. 2 R&B hit,  but  given  that  it only got  up to No.  48 on  the  pop  charts,  that  particular distinction is unlikely. The  band hits a D. \"The very latest  release, 'NIGHT Train'!\" Well, no \u2013 \"Shout and Shimmy\" and \"Mashed Potatoes U.S.A.\" had come out since \"Night Train\" \u2013 but it had  been his biggest hit  that  year. D-sharp.  \"It's  everybody  'Shout and SHIMMY'!\" We'll be hearing  more about  that in a minute. E.GOLD\"Brown has perhaps a dozen 'gold' records to his credit,\u201d the little unbylined puff piece in that week's New York Amsterdam News announced. That was pushing it \u2013 he'd only had 15 chart  singles by that  point. James  Brown didn't  have a certified gold single until 1972's \"Get  On the Good  Foot,\" although King evidently didn't  bother with RIAA gold and platinum  certification. Still, for an Apollo audience, Gonder had a lot of familiar song titles to mention.\n\nThere are an awful lot of citations of chart numbers and dates in this book. Live with them. They are an essential  part of James  Brown's  art.  His  genius is the genius of rolls of tickets tom  off one by one, of money handed  over  for  records,  of the hit. The great James Brown  songs  are  popular,  the  popular  James  Brown songs are great. As George W.S. Trow wrote in another, darker  context, \"It's  a Hit! Love it! It's a Hit.  It loves you because you love it because it's a Hit!\" \"You come to see my show,\" Brown sang. \"That's why James Brown loves you  so.\" \"This is a hit!,\" he  declared as the  tape rolled  for \"Papa's Got a Brand  New  Bag\"; he cut it out of the released  record, but persuaded some  of the other artists  whose  records he produced around that  time  to yell  the  same  thing, so  it  might work  its  magic  for them  too.\n\nLook  at his singles  discography, and  ignore the  instrumentals, the duets,  the reissues,  the  throwaways on King's subsidiary label  Bethlehem, the  Christmas and novelty records-just concentrate on the songs he threw his weight  behind. A pattern emerges, or rather an unbroken block:  between \"Money Won't  Change You\u201d in July  1966  and  \"Hot (I Need  To Be Loved, Loved, Loved,  Loved)\" nine years later, James Brown had over sixty consecutive chart  hits. On  his own terms, he was an unstoppable champion, and  those  terms  were  people paying  to hear  him sing, and being  reassured that  what they  were  paying  for  was popular.\n\nThat's why he wanted  to make Live at the Apollo so badly:  he  could  demonstrate that  being  James Brown was itself a hit.  All he had  to do was get it on  tape.THE CATALOGUE OF  HITSBack at  the  Apollo,  Gonder's speech  has  been  setting up a couple  of subliminal effects. Starting with \"You've Got  the  Power,\"  and  running  through  \"Bewildered,\u201d there's  a steady 6/8 rhythm to the words he accents and the band's stabs \u2013 a tick-tock swing that's at pretty much the  same  tempo  as  Brown's  ballads.  There's also a hidden message in those emphases-Crazy-Me- You-Think-Want-Mind-Be-WILL-Lost-Night-Shimmy! This  is a night  for  total  abandon,  the suggestion goes; for thoughts  to become desires and then to simple be, through  sheer will; a night to be lost to shimmying.\n\n(A young man named Danny Ray was waiting in the wings. He'd  just been hired, that week, as James Brown's valet; a few years later,  he'd  take over the emcee  job, which he still holds today, and his introductions to the James  Brown show  have been  patterned  on  Gonder's ever since.)\n\nGonder's still going. \"Mr.  Dynamite\"-Mr. Dynamite  had been the title of two movies, one from 1935, adapted from Dashiell Hammett's story \"On the Make,\u201d and  the  other   from  1941,  starring   Lloyd  Nolan   as Tommy N. Thornton (nice initials)-\"the amazing Mr. Please, Please himself, the star of the show\"-as if there could be any doubt, as Gonder is almost erupting with conviction-\"JAMES BROWN AND  the  FAMOUS FLAMES!\"THE SCRATCHThe horns buck--one, two, three, four, five, all on a G chord that's climbed  up an octave since Gonder started his litany.  It's  the  beginning of a fanfare  to announce the  Hardest Working Man  In Show  Business's  arrival: three  choruses of a perky  little  blues  riff. Brown  glides onto  stage  during the  third, and  probably does  some high-powered   footwork,  judging    by   the    screams. Twenty-nine years old and as flexible as a piece of yarn, he  can  dance  faster  and  harder than  anyone, rippling his body,  floating over  a wooden floor  as if it's  water-slicked  ice.\nThe perky  little  blues  riff has  a name,  although it was never  credited on  any  edition of Live at the Apollo until 2004: it's  \"The  Scratch.\" Brown   and  his  band (including Les Buie on guitar  and Hubert Perry on bass, still with  the  band  at the  Apollo) had  recorded it as an instrumental on October 4, 1960. (\"The Scratch\" is also a close cousin of Henry Mancini's \"Peter Gunn\" theme, which  had  been  a hit for  Ray Anthony in 1959;  Duane Eddy's version  charted for  the  first  time  on  October 10,  1960.)  Brown's version  appeared as the  B-side  of \"Hold It\"  in January 1961,  and  the  band  played  it  as his entrance music  at least  through mid-1963.\n\nAs the band bats down the last note again and again, you can almost see James Brown's feet slide frictionlessly into position behind the microphone.I'LL GO CRAZYJames Brown steps up to the front  of the Apollo stage, gazes out over 1500 thoroughly warmed-up faces, and assesses matters  with a huge  holler.  He  feels all right, and he wants to make sure everybody knows it. The third time he announces  it, he gives the \"all\" an enormous melismatic rush, swooping around  at least twelve notes just to prove he can; then, as he takes a breath, guitarist Les Buie whacks sharply at his strings,  and we're into \"I'll  Go  Crazy.\"THE MISSING SONGExcept we're  not: there's  almost certainly  at least one song missing from the set on Live at the Apollo. In those days, JB usually opened  his shows with his latest hit. In October  1962,  that  was \"Shout  and Shimmy,\"  which had made No. 16 on the R&B chart (No. 61 pop) back in August. Recorded  February  9, 1961 (the same day as \"Lost  Someone\"  and \"Night Train\"), it starts with the I-feel-all-right routine, and then proceeds to a truly shameless ripoff of the Isley Brothers' 1959 hit \"Shout.\u201d\n\n(Really,  truly  shameless. The \"I feel all right\" business  is derived  from  the  beginning of the  second half of the Isleys' record, and the rest of the record is basically the  fast  parts  of \"Shout,\" with  the  gospel  inflections removed and  the  word  \"shimmy\" added.  It wasn't  the last  time JB  would  appropriate the  Isleys'  work  as his own, either: \"It's My Thing,\" his protegee Marva Whitney's  1969  single,  credited to J. Brown/M. Whitney, could  be charitably described as an answer  song  to the Isleys'  \"It's Your  Thing.\" It  could   be  less  charitably described as a cover  that  changes the  pronouns.)\n\n...4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1041655", "artist_names": "The Hollies", "full_title": "Look Through Any Window by\u00a0The\u00a0Hollies", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/801c71725a44181fe64a9a11c844805e.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/801c71725a44181fe64a9a11c844805e.590x590x1.jpg", "id": 1041655, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 6261923, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1663766525, "path": "/The-hollies-look-through-any-window-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-hollies-look-through-any-window-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1965, "month": 8, "day": 27}, "release_date_for_display": "August 27, 1965", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Aug. 27, 1965", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/801c71725a44181fe64a9a11c844805e.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/801c71725a44181fe64a9a11c844805e.590x590x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Look Through Any Window", "title_with_featured": "Look Through Any Window", "updated_by_human_at": 1663766663, "url": "https://genius.com/The-hollies-look-through-any-window-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/29611", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/aeb4e2a0851e55fcd6ed5fad0f88a099.968x402x1.png", "id": 29611, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/67695e02cbf0d10a24bce0d0f1d658df.287x287x1.jpg", "index_character": "h", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "The Hollies", "slug": "The-hollies", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-hollies"}, "artist": "The Hollies", "lyrics": "Look Through Any Window Lyrics[Verse 1]\nLook through any window, yeah\nWhat do you see?\nSmilin' faces all around\nRushin' through the busy town\n\n[Chorus 1]\n(Where do they go?)

ninety-ninth floor of my block\nAnd I sit at home looking out the window\nImagining the world has stopped\nThen in flies a guy\nWho's all dressed up just like the Union Jack\nSays, I've won five pounds\nIf I have his kind of detergent pack\n\n[Chorus]\nI said, \"Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud\nHey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud\nHey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud\nDon't hang around 'cause two's a crowd\nOn my cloud, baby\"\n[Verse 2]\nThe telephone is ringing\nI say, \"Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?\"\nA voice says, \"Hi, hello, how are you?\"\n\u201cWell, I guess I'm doing fine\u201c\n\u201cIt's three AM, there's too much noise\nDon't you people ever want to go to bed?\nJust because you feel so good\nDo you have to drive me out of my head?\u201d\n\n[Chorus]\nI said, \"Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud\nHey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud\nHey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud\nDon't hang around 'cause two's a crowd\nOn my cloud, baby\"\nYeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nI was sick and tired, fed up with this\nSo I decided to take a drive downtown\nIt was so very quiet and peaceful\nThere was nobody, not a soul around\nI laid myself out\nI was so tired and I started to dream\nIn the morning the parking tickets were just like flags\nStuck on my windscreen\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI said, \"Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud\nHey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud\nHey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud\nDon't hang around 'cause two's a crowd\nOn my cloud,\"\n\n[Outro]\nHey (Hey), you (You), get

be (Ain't that peculiar)\n[Verse 2]\nOh, you tell me lies that should be obvious to me\nBut I'm so much in love with you baby, 'til I don't want to see\nThat things you do and say are designed to make me blue\nIt's a doggone shame my love for you makes all your lies seem true\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut if the truth makes love last longer\nWhy do lies make my love stronger (Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't that peculiar, baby (Ain't that peculiar)\nPeculiar as can be (Ain't that peculiar)\nAin't that peculiar\nA peculiar-arity, hey, hey (Ain't that

that's lost a toy\nMaybe baby, you think these tears I cry are tears of joy\nA child can cry so much until you do everything they say\nBut unlike a child, my tears don't help me to get my way\nYou
