Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)\n\n(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)\n\nLONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.\n\n(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!\n\nJOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father! Little father!\n\nTHE BABES AND SUCKLINGS\n\nClap clap hands till Poldy comes home,\nCakes in his pocket for Leo alone.\n\n\n(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)\n\n\nBABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.)

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!\n\n\nTHE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!\n\n\n(The rams' horns sound for silence.

He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.\n\nBROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.\n\nBANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.\n\n(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)\n\nBRINI, PAPAL NUNCIO (In papal zouave's uniform, steel cuirasses as breastplate, armplates, thighplates, legplates, large profane moustaches and brown paper mitre.)

Bloom is a cod. A CRAB (In bush ranger's kit.) What did you do in the cattlecreep behind Kilbarrack?\n\nA FEMALE INFANT (Shakes a rattle.) And under Ballybough bridge?\n\nA HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?\n\nBLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.\n\nTHE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!\n\n(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)\n\nTHE ARTANE ORPHANS\n\nYou big, you bog, you dirty dog!\nYou think the ladies love you!\n\n\nTHE PRISON GATE GIRLS\n\nIf you see kay\nTell him he may\nSee you in tea\nTell him from me.\n\n\nHORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.\n\n(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)\n\nMESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.\n\nBLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!\n\n(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)\n\nREUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.\n\n(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)\n\nTHE CITIZEN Thank heaven!\n\nBLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.\n\n(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)\n\nTHE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.\n\n(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.\n\n(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)\n\nTHE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!\n\nELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\n\nZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.\n\nFLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.\n\nSTEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.\n\n(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)\n\nTHE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.\n\nLYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.\n\n(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now.

I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.)

'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo!

Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.)

Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches.

Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready.

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's.

R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead.

Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware!

Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers.

Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!\n\n\n(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand.

Meanwhile, Healy is approached by a waitress\nWAITRESS: Drink?\nHEALY: No, I... (STUTTERS)\nHealy is still given a drink, while we see March grabbing one for himself. Healy sniffs, puts the glass on a stand... that turns out to be a woman bending over. He picks it back again.\nHEALY: Hey, uh... Sorry.\nAs March continues drinking, a SLOW ROCK SONG is PLAYING and he tries talking to the bartender\nMARCH: It's the killer bees.

Amelia, but March doesn't recognize her\nMARCH: I'm not gonna hurt you. No, I'm just looking for my gun. (opens jacket to show empty holster) So...\nAmelia runs. March looks puzzled before searching through the ground, eventually finding his gun and leaning against a tree.\nMARCH:(PANTING) I got it! So...There you go, March.March, March, he's our man. If he can't do it, no one can. March.\n\nJAZZ MUSIC PLAYING, as Healy walks through the party; down the slope, March then tries to light a cigarette, and his lighter illuminates a dead man's body. The cigarette starts dangling from his mouth.\nBack at the party, Healy is still searching\nHEALY: March. March.\n\nMARCH is SNORTING, WHEEZING, and LAUGHING  NERVOUSLY as he struggles to find a breath to scream Healy's name.\nMARCH: Healy! Healy! Healy!Healy! Come on.

I'll take you to her. Come on.\nHOLLY:Okay.\n\nDownhill, March and Healy are carrying the body.\nHEALY: What I can't figure out is how you saw him from all the way up there. You didn't fall down the fucking hill, did you? Did you fall down the hill?\nMARCH:I had like two, three drinks, tops.\nHEALY: Yeah, that's why you can't walk straight.\nMARCH:Oh, excuse me.I'm carrying a dead body and I have his schwantz in my face. So, I'm sorry I'm not Bakishnarov.\nHEALY: You can't even say Baryshnikov. You did, didn't you? You fell down that fucking hill. You get drunk, you lose your gun, you take a header off the balcony and now you're gonna tell me it's like a hallowed, time-honoured detective ploy, right?\nMARCH:It was very slippery up there, okay? I was... I was in the pool.\nHEALY: You were in the pool?\nMARCH:Yeah.\nHEALY: Why?\nMARCH: I had to question the mermaids. What were you doing while I was working?

Bye.\nHealy stumbles upon the Older Guy. Once they recognize each other, Older Guy tries grabbing his gun, while Healy throws a drink at him. Everyone around screams and runs away as the two men start fighting.\nOnce Older Guy's gun goes off, MARCH turns his head. The two men keep fighting, with the gun eventually being fired at the Tree Man, who falls down the balcony. March is startled. Healy manages to make the gun fall in a hot tub, while getting punched by Older Guy. They continue their struggle,  with Older Guy even getting a knife. March tries getting to the location where they fight, but the staircase is filled with people\nMARCH : Excuse me. Excuse me.\n\nMeanwhile, in Blue Face's car...\nHOLLY: I need to go right now.\nBLUEFACE: Don't touch...\nHolly punches him in the face\nHOLLY: Get away from me.\nOutside, a worried Amelia talks to the valet.\nAMELIA: I need my keys. I need my car. Hurry.\nBLUEFACE: [to Holly] Don't fucking move.\nAMELIA (O.S.): Hurry. I need my keys.\nBlueface is SHUSHING Holly as he grabs his gun. He opens the door, points the gun at Amelia...\nAMELIA:Hello? Please! Hurry, hurry. Now!\nHolly slams the door on his hand, making the shot hit the valet's box of keys. Everyone screams, and Holly rolls out the car.\nBLUEFACE: Fuck! Motherfucker, my fucking hand!\nHOLLY: Amelia! Run!\nAmelia runs, while PEOPLE keep GROANING and Holly closes the door before rushing out of there, going  after Amelia.\nMarch runs to outside the house, pushing the obstructing people into the pool.\nInside the car, Blueface has recovered himself...\nBLUEFACE: Drive the fucking car.\n...and TYRES SCREECHING are heard as it goes away, just as March arrives. He looks both ways, finds nothing, but then  the valet calls him.\nVALET:Hey, man. The girl in your trunk, she was in that car.\nMARCH runs towards a guy standing next to his open  car and throws him on the ground\nMAN: Johnny's car!\nMarch starts the vehicle and closes the door.\nJOHNNY: Hey, man, what are you doing with my car?\nTYRES SCREECHING as March continues to leave.\nBy the hot tub, Healy manages to stick Older Guy's knife into a fusebox, making him fall on his back unarmed, while Healy is thrown into the edge of the tub. When Older Guy recovers, he punches Healy in the head, presses him towards the tub, trying to drown him.\nOLDER GUY: Motherfucker!\nIt all stops once a shot is fired from within the tub, hitting Older Guy's knee. He falls on his back,while Healy returns to the surface, the gun in his hand.\nOLDER GUY: Oh, shit.\nHealy throws more punches into Older Guy, making him fall on his back.\nHEALY: I swear to God, you get up, I'll shoot you in the cock.\nOLDER GUY: (SLURRING) I can pay you.\nHEALY:Trying to negotiate with me?\nOLDER GUY: You'll never see me again.\nHEALY:Where are you gonna be?\nOLDER GUY: Michigan.\nHEALY:Michigan works.\n\nHealy walks away, tossing the gun back into the hot tub. When he gets by the balcony, he can see the street below, where Amelia, followed by Holly, are running away. A screeching limo stops, and Blue Face gets out to run after the girls. Healy starts going away from the house.\nOn the road, Blue Face hears TYRES SCREECHING - it's March in the car he hijacked. Blue Face shoots the windshield, leading March to skid, and then run up a tiny hill to crash the car. A startled March tries to recover, Blue Face runs for the women again, and as March groans, Healy appears in front of the car.\n\nHEALY: You okay? Does the car still go? Well, stop fucking around. Come on.\n\nHealy continues his run, and then March gets a determined look in his face before starting the engine. But the car is stuck between the dirt and the sidewalk.\nMARCH: Fuck!\n\nNot far, Blue Face catches up with Amelia and Holly, who are now side by side.\nBLUEFACE: Freeze!You guys are fast.\nAmelia embraces Holly.\nBLUEFACE Whoo! (LAUGHS)\nHOLLY:There's a...\nAmelia tries shutting her up. As We hear a CAR HONKING, and said vehicle, a van, runs over Blueface.

Wait.\nAMELIA: What the hell are you doing?\nHOLLY: He's hurt. We need to help him.\nAMELIA: Are you crazy? Stay away from him.\nHOLLY: Just... Just hang on.

I'll get help. It's all right.\nHealy arrives.\nHOLLY: A car hit him. We need an ambulance.\nHEALY: Holly, go and see if you can flag somebody down. He's in a bad way.\nHolly agrees and runs away, and Healy crouches to take Blueface's dropped gun, unload it and clean the fingerprints.\nBLUEFACE: (GROANS)You.\nHEALY:Yeah, me.\nBLUEFACE:You ever hear of John Boy? By now he's heard of you. They're flying him in. (CHUCKLES) Now he's gonna kill that private cop and his whole fucking family. And then he's gonna come for you. You ain't got long to live.\nHEALY:Well, buddy, none of us do.\nHEALY chokes Blueface using the handkerchief that cleaned the gun; Holly returns\nHOLLY: Healy, there's no one here.\nHEALY:He didn't make it.\nHolly looks at Blueface, and then notices a CAR APPROACHING. It's March. Holly breathes in relief, and runs to embrace her father.\nMARCH: Are you okay?\nHOLLY: Yeah.\nHealy nods to March, and they hear SIRENS WAILING\nHEALY:(SIGHS) And that'll be the cops.\n\nCut to FRONT OF THE HOUSE\nThe police have surrounded the street.\nMAN: Okay, Holly...\nOFFICER: What do you want me to do with them?\nMARCH: Look, pal, you already got our statements.

I work for the Department of Justice.\nMARCH: Okay. Well, that explains basically nothing.\nJUDITH: I... I'm Amelia's mother.\n\nCut to DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nIn the reception, Tally is doing magic tricks to distract Holly...\nTALLY: Holly, are you still frowning? (GASPS) What's in my hand? What? (she makes a card appear in her hand, Holly GASPS, Tally LAUGHS)\nHOLLY: I know how you do that.\n...while in Judith office, Judith talks to Healy and March.\nJUDITH: Hello. Sit. First of all, I wanna say thank you. We've been watching interviews, and it sounds like you might have saved my daughter's life.\nHEALY: That was mostly Holly.  His daughter.\nMARCH:It's genetics.\nJUDITH: Would you like a mint?\nMARCH:Uh, yeah.\nJUDITH: I need your help. But I wanna know if I can trust you.\nHEALY: I'm kinda getting the idea that, you know, you might not have much choice.\nJUDITH: Well, my situation is very delicate.\nHEALY: Hey, that's where I know you from, right? The TV. You're prosecuting that car company thing.\nJUDITH: The lawsuit for the catalytic converter. Yes. That's half my day. The other half I spend on pornography.\nMARCH: Hmm. What kind? Like which films? What's your favourite?\nHEALY: No, no. Uh, anti. Anti-porn.\nMARCH: Right.  Like a crusader.  Should I be writing this down?\nHEALY: Yeah, write it down.\n[he grabs a pen and paper]\nJUDITH: The Vegas mob is trying to spread its porn operation to Hollywood Boulevard. (SCOFFS)  And I'm doing everything I can to stop it.\nMARCH:Thank you. Porn is bad.\nHEALY: Something I don't understand. Your daughter, she did a film with Sid Shattuck. Now, why would she do that when she knows that's just gonna be extremely professionally\nembarrassing for you?\nJUDITH: 'Cause she wanted to. She lashes out. We have a difficult relationship.\nMARCH: Mothers and daughters, it's tough.\nJUDITH: But there's no film, not any more. There was a fire. Um... A friend of Amelia's, he...\nHEALY: Dean. Yeah, we went to his house. Well, what's left of his house.\nMARCH: Mrs Kuttner, why do you think everyone involved with this film is dying?\nJUDITH: I have no idea, Mr March. I wish I did. I only know that Amelia's in danger.\nHEALY: Why don't you put her in protective custody? I mean, after tonight, she's probably very scared. She... She might wanna be at home.\nJUDITH: She doesn't trust me. She thinks I am the government. She thinks I'm behind all of this. Somewhere she's out there and she won't call home because she thinks her mother's going to have her killed.\n(JUDITH SNIFFLING as Healy and March look at each other)\nHEALY (extending the bloody handkerchief): Here. You wanna use that?\nJUDITH: No, thank you.\nHEALY:No?\nJUDITH: I wanna hire you both. Please, find her, protect her.\nMARCH: Okay, you can hire us, but we're not cheap. (Judith is writing a check, with \"TEN THOUSAND\" in the value) This is very intensive work and something like this, I'd say couldn't do it for less than $5,000.\nJUDITH: Okay. (throws away the check)\n(March leans over to check reception, as Holly is doing card tricks as TALLY LAUGHS)\nHOLLY: Yes, I got it.\nTALLY: Okay, I gotta get mine now.\nMARCH: Can I take this?\nJUDITH: Fine.\nMARCH: Does Tally have one of... Shall we have hers as well? Just in case you're not... You know, we need to get in touch with somebody.\n\nCut to MARCH'S HOUSE\nHealy walks to March, who is tossing cigarette buns into an empty pool and drinking.\nHEALY: So what's this? World's biggest ashtray?\nMARCH: (SIGHS) Fuck it, it's... It's a rental. We're only here until we rebuild the old place anyway.\nHEALY:Rebuild?\nMARCH: Yeah. It burned down.\nHEALY:Hey, you know, something's actually bugging me. I found this in Shattuck's office.\nHe shows the cow note.\nMARCH: What is that, a pig? (CHUCKLES)\nHEALY:No, it's a pink cow.\nMARCH: Oh, it's a cow.\nHEALY:When Amelia gave me your address, she gave it to me on a piece of paper like this, handwriting like that.\nMARCH: I think you're onto something.\nHEALY:Mmm-hmm.\nMARCH: Can we talk about it tomorrow afternoon?\nHEALY:Yeah, we can do that.\nMARCH: Thanks.\n(JACKSON CLEARS THROAT and starts walking away)\nMARCH: Hey, aren't you that diner guy? Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. I gotta know.\nHEALY:I don't wanna get into it right now.\nMARCH: You gotta get into it. I gotta know. You're the diner guy.\nHEALY: (SIGHS)All right.\nMARCH: Yes.\nHEALY:All right, about a year ago...\nMARCH: Yes.\nAs Healy tells the story, flashbacks showing the events also appear\nHEALY:...I was at a diner in Hollywood and this asshole with a shotgun started threatening people.\nMarch is lying on his back.\nMARCH:  I love it. It's the best story I've ever heard.\nIn the flashback, Healy grabs the shotgun, and hits the guy in the face with it\nHEALY: So I did something about it. I acted. I didn't plan to, I didn't, you know. I just did it. I took that guy out. I didn't even get paid for it. So I ended up with a bullet in the bicep and 500 bucks of hospital bills. It was stupid, really. When I think about it, it was the best day of my life.\nMarch is SNORING\nHEALY: Just for a moment, I felt useful. All right.\n\nCut to EMPTY LOT\nHealy is driving back, when he notes Holly in the lot again. There, she is reading, this time holding with a flashlight.\nHOLLY: \"Had Mademoiselle Blanche been in England before? What part of France did she come from? Mademoiselle Blanche replied politely but with reserve.\"\nHEALY:Hey.\nHOLLY:Hey.You've got your foot in the toilet.\nHEALY:I have? (SIGHS)\nHOLLY:Now you're getting the carpet all wet.\nHEALY:Was this your room?\nHOLLY:No, it was Mom and Dad's.\nHEALY:Your dad tells me you're rebuilding.\nHOLLY:Does it look rebuilt to you?\nHEALY:Not especially.\nHOLLY:Dad barely ever comes here. He feels guilty, I guess.\nHEALY:Because? Hmm?\nHOLLY:Oh, the fire. Mom kept on complaining about a leak in the furnace, but Dad, you know, he's got his nose thing,\nso he couldn't smell the gas. Anyways, I should probably\nget back to my book.\nHEALY:All right.\nHOLLY:Mr Healy? Are you a bad person? What did you do to tha1t man tonight? Did you kill him?\nHEALY:Of course not.\nHOLLY:That's good. I knew you couldn't do something like that.\nHEALY:Don't stay up too late, all right?\nHe enters his car again, reflects a bit, and closes his eyes.\nCut to OUTSIDE MARCH'S HOUSE, DAY\nHolly is driving March's car as he, clearly hammered, vocalizes along with the radio and bangs on the car door. Healy is waiting outside the house, when Holly parks by hitting  somethin g in the ground loudly. They turn their heads, and get concerned as they see Healy.\nMARCH:Shit.\nNow both are outside, Holly with a box and March with a recently washed suit.\nHEALY: I didn't know what time you'd get here. You said afternoon.\nMARCH: Well, uh, we were at the bank getting your money. (Hands Healy an envelop) There it is, half, minus a few hundred, you know, for, uh, that car that we crashed. I thought you'd wanna chip in for that.\nHEALY: Sure.\nMarch shows Healy the suit.\nMARCH: What do you think?\nHEALY: It's purple.\nMARCH: It's maroon.\nHolly SIGHS as she walks towards the door.\nHOLLY: We stopped at a bar. That's why we're late.\n\nCut to MARCH'S KITCHEN\nHEALY: So, Amelia's note. Burbank Airport. Western flight D. I figure she's trying to skip town. How do you wanna do this?\nMARCH: (EXHALES) I don't know. I say we wait a couple of days, call Kuttner and see if we can squeeze a second instalment out of her. (extends his glass as if toasting and chugs)\nHEALY: A second instalment?\nHOLLY: You don't wanna call too soon. Gotta act like you're onto something, like you've been working hard. Then, day three, ask for more money. (fake smile)\nMARCH: Well, she's putting a negative spin on it, but, yeah, that's the idea.\nHEALY: Kuttner paid us. Me. She paid me to do a job, right? I'm not gonna lie to her.\nMARCH: And I respect that. That's why I'll lie to her.\nHey, I shelled out 400 bucks for a detective. Someone who finds clues, huh?\nMARCH: I found Sid Shattuck's corpse, didn't I?\nHEALY:Found it? You fell on it.\nMARCH: I guess I don't understand why we're not celebrating. I mean, we just got paid. We're all having a drink in the afternoon.\nMarch and Healy stare at him\nMARCH: What?\nHEALY:Forget about it, all right?\nMARCH:  (SIGHS) Oh, would you just... Would you hold on for a goddamn second?\nHOLLY:You're the world's worst detective.\nMARCH: I'm the worst?\nHOLLY:Yeah.\nMARCH: The world's worst?\nHOLLY:Didn't you hear me the first time?\nMarch opens the the fridge to show his newspaper ad.\nMARCH: Got a cool ad, though. So...\nHOLLY:(SCOFFS) Why do you have to be such a fuck-up, huh? You go around and you drink and you lie and stuff and people hate you.\nMARCH: Sweetheart, don't say, \"and stuff.\" Just say...\nHOLLY:I hate you!\nShe SIGHS and turns her back on him.\nMARCH: That works.\nHEALY: I'll find the girl myself.\nMARCH: You're gonna find her yourself. Okay. Well, say hi to her when you do.\nHEALY:I will.\nHealy is almost going through the open door...\nMARCH: Course, you're not gonna find her at the airport, seeing as how it's not a flight.\n...and walks back\nMARCH: Did he stop?\nHOLLY:Yeah.\nMARCH: Your note, look at it. It's not a flight. Every airport has an overflight curfew from 10:00 to 6:00, Burbank included. And that top number is today's date but reversed like the European way, which makes sense when you look at FLT and you think it's not \"flight,\" it's probably \"flat,\" like apartment.\nHEALY: And Burbank APT West?\nMARCH: Burbank Apartments West. It's a dump. Fuck it, I'll show you.Holly, go to Janet's this time. But for real.\nHOLLY:Jessica's.\nMARCH: Jessica's. We've gotta go to work.\nHOLLY: Do you want your keys?\nHEALY: I'm driving.\nHolly smiles once the DOOR SHUTS\nCut to CONSTRUCTION SITE, NIGHT\nMarch and Healy drive and get to where Burbank Apartments West was supposed to be, but there is only an empty lot with an excavator and a billboard. They get off the car and ask a man walking his dog\nHEALY: Excuse me. We're lo oking for the Burbank Apartments.\nMAN: Oh, they're gone. Tore them babies down, um, going on about two years now.\nThe frustrated Healy turns to March, not saying a word...\nMARCH: To the airport, then? (CLEARS THROAT)\n\nCut to HEALY'S CAR, ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT\nMARCH: Well, they used to have an overflight curfew.\nHEALY: It's all right. It's all right. It's okay.\nMARCH:They did.\nHEALY: Yeah.\nMARCH:And they still should if they changed them. They should, they should change them back.\nAs a descending AIRCRAFT's ENGINE ROARS, March notices something...\nMARCH:Pull over.\nHEALY: What?\nMARCH:Pull over.\nHe grabs the wheel to force the car to stop.\nHEALY:  Hey, what the fuck?\nHealy then notes the building in front of them...\nHOLLAND: The Western Hotel. The Burbank Airport Western Hotel.\nHEALY: She's meeting somebody. Okay.\n\nCut to HOTEL BAR\nAfter the two go through the door they head to the bar.\nBARTENDER: Evening. What can I get you?\nMARCH: Information. Have you seen this girl? She probably came in in the last half hour.\nBARTENDER:(SCOFFS) Hey, I just work here.\nMARCH:Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. That's why I'm asking you.\nBARTENDER:Hmm. Memory gets a little foggy, you know.What's in it for me?\nMARCH:He'll stop doing it.\nBARTENDER:(CHUCKLES) Doing what?\nHealy slams his face onto the counter.\nBARTENDER:Ow!\nMARCH: That.\nBARTENDER:Fuck!\nHEALY:Now, we can do this the easy way or we can... We're currently doing it the easy way.\nBARTENDER:Okay. Jesus. The penthouse. She's in the penthouse, top floor.(SIGHS) Are you happy?\nMARCH: Yeah.\nBARTENDER:Guys, listen. You... You don't wanna go up there, all right? Trust me. These New York guys are up there. Uh, business guys. They got fucking bodyguards. Kind that had their balls removed. What's that called? Huh?\nHEALY: Marriage?\nBARTENDER:Yeah. Uh... Just chill here, you know. She's gotta come back down. Have a couple of cold ones on me?\nHEALY: Oh, not for me.\nHOLLAND: He makes a strong argument, though.\nBARTENDER:You see? Reasonable. Very reasonable. Now, your buddy, that was the problem, he wasn't reasonable.\nHEALY: Our buddy?\nHOLLAND: Yeah, we don't have friends.\nBARTENDER:The other guy looking for Amelia, he wasn't with you?\nHEALY:Where'd he go?\nBARTENDER:Got in the elevator right before you guys came in.\nHEALY:Did you get a name?\nBARTENDER:John something.\nHEALY:Did you actually witness him getting into the elevator?\nBARTENDER:No, it was told to me by a wise old Indian. Of course I fucking witnessed it.\nHEALY:Right.\nMARCH: What the hell's going on?\nHEALY:Oh, it just makes sense. It connects up.\nMARCH:What makes sense?\nHEALY:John Boy. Oh, just something that Blueface mentioned, yeah.\nMARCH:What do you mean, he mentioned?Mentioned how?\nHEALY:Oh, you know, he... \"There's a guy coming to kill you.\" That kind of crap.\nMARCH: Yeah. We should probably just stay here.\nHEALY: Smart move. Unless, of course, he's up there killing her right now.\nMARCH:Nobody's getting killed at the Burbank Airport Hotel.\nHEALY:Because?\nMARCH:That would be national news.\nHEALY:Yeah, so?\nMARCH:Oh, so when's the last time you were on national news?\nHEALY:February.\nMARCH:Really?\nHEALY:Yeah.\nMARCH:For what?\nHEALY:I got shot, in a diner.\nMARCH:Where?\nHEALY:In my arm. I told you this last night.\nMARCH:We should call the cops.\nHEALY:No. It'll take too long. I mean, she could die.\nMARCH: You just said it was the right move to stay down here.\nHEALY:No, I said smart move. Different.\nThe two then walk to elevator.\nCut to ELEVATOR\nThey enter, BREATHE DEEPLY and stand in the regular pose.\nMARCH: Munich.\nHEALY: What?\nMARCH: A guy without his balls. It's a Munich.\nHEALY: Munich is a city in Germany. M\u00fcnchen. Munich. Yeah.\nMARCH: Right. Hitler only had one ball.\n(ELEVATOR DINGS.)\n\nCut to PENTHOUSE FLOOR\nJACKSON: All right, here we go.\nOn the corridor, a MAN is CHOKING, with his throat slit\nMAN: Hey! (GRUNTING) Whoa!\nThe man who just yelled is hit with MUFFLED GUNSHOTS. March and Healy just press the elevator button and walk back inside... witnessing besides them a man being thrown out the window.\nCut to HEALY'S CAR, OUTSIDE HOTEL\nHealy is rushing away, the TYRES SCREECHING. Then they hear SIRENS WAILING...\nHEALY: Oh, shit.\nHealy enters in a nearby one-way alley, BRAKES SCREECHING, as the police cars are coming to the hotel. After they all pass...\nMARCH:What are we doing?\nHEALY: I can't just leave.\nMARCH:Why?\nHEALY: She's in danger, man. We have to do something about it.\nMARCH:She's dead.\nHEALY: What do you mean, she's dead?\nMARCH:Come on!\nHEALY: She's not dead.\nMARCH:Open your eyes, man.\nHEALY: You don't know that.\nMARCH: She's fucking dead!\nHEALY: You don't know she's...\nAmelia lands feet-first on the car. She walks to the hood, tries to shoot at them, but the recoil knocks her off her feet and she goes unconscious on the street below. They open the car and retrieve her\nCut to LIVING ROOM\nTelevision BEEPING on a game of PONG. It's Holly and Jessica in March's house. March and Healy enter, the latter carrying Amelia.\nMARCH: What are you doing here?\nHOLLY: Holy shit, you got her.\nMARCH: You're supposed to be at Jessica's.\nJESSICA: Yeah, sorry, Mr March. My sister kicked us out. She's having a guy over.\nMARCH:  Your sister's such a slut.\nJESSICA: Yeah, I know.\n\nCut to Holly's bedroom\nAmelia is put on Holly's bed\nHEALY: Hello? Amelia. Should you shake her shoulder? Maybe... You know, my brother used to flick my ear. Like that. I hated that.\nHOLLY: We shouldn't be violent.\nMARCH:You got a brother?\nJESSICA: You could just hit her.\nHEALY:Yeah.\nMARCH:Really?\nJESSICA: Like really hard.\nHEALY:I've got a family.\nHOLLY: It's not practical.\nJACKSON: We probably shouldn't hit her if we want her to talk to us.\nAmelia awakens\nHEALY: It's okay.\nAMELIA:You were supposed to get those guys off of me.\nMARCH: Do you know who they were? Do you know who sent them?\nAMELIA:Yeah. It was my mother.\nHEALY: Would you mind starting from the top because...\nAMELIA:Why? It doesn't matter.\nMARCH: I'm sorry, it doesn't matter? You just shot at us. I think it matters.\nAMELIA:Okay, okay. I made a film. I made a film with Dean, my boyfriend. And the idea was that we were gonna, you know, like make this experimental film, like an artistic film.\nMARCH:Porno film.\nAMELIA:It's not a porno. (SIGHS) Look, do you even know who my mother is?\nHEALY: Yes, we do. We... We've actually met your mother.\nAMELIA:(SCOFFING) What did she tell you, that I'm crazy?(STAMMERS) That I was just lashing out?\nHEALY: Something like that. She might have mentioned...\nAMELIA:Yeah, well, my mother is a criminal. She's one of them.\nMARCH: Who's them? What's them?\nAMELIA: One of the insiders. One of the capitalist, corporate suppressors. You know, they want us dead, man. We're just in their crosshairs, you know. We're just pawns.\nJESSICA: Gosh.\nAMELIA: (SIGHS) Ow.\nMARCH: Hey. (WHISTLES SLOWLY, the girls leave) And what does this have to do with the birds?\nJACKSON: Yeah.\nAMELIA:My mom's supposed to be working for the Justice Department, right?\nHEALY: Sure, she's prosecuting the catalytic converter case.\nAMELIA:Yeah, only she's not. She's not prosecuting it. The auto makers, she's gonna let 'em walk.\nMARCH: But they have the evidence.\nAMELIA:Yes, they have evidence. They have memos proving that Detroit conspired to suppress the converter, proving they would rather poison our air than spend a little bit of money. But my mom, she's gonna say that's not enough. She's gonna lie because... Because she's on the take. Money again, right? Mammon, that's her god. That fascist crony...\nMARCH: Okay, okay.\nAMELIA:...bogart!\nMARCH: All right, all right, just... Just back up a little bit. (SIGHS) Why not just go straight to the police?\nAMELIA:(LAUGHING) She is the police. She's the head of the Justice Department.\nHEALY: You... You've got a point.\nMARCH: Okay, or the newspaper?\nAMELIA:They all work together. God, have you been living under a rock?\nHEALY:All right, so then your solution -was you make a porn film.\nAMELIA:(SIGHS) It's not a porno!\nMARCH: You know, I have neighbours.\nAMELIA:I made a statement.\nHEALY: Right.\nAMELIA:And yeah, yeah, my statement contained nudity.\nMARCH:Porno nudity.\nAMELIA: Art. That's just the commercial element, okay? Okay? Sid said we had to have that. And the reality was we were getting our message out there. And... And it was all in the film, names and dates and everything, everything that my mom was doing, and once it was out there, once it was in theatres, there's no way that they could suppress it. There's no way that they could cover it up.\nMARCH: So let me get this straight. You made a porno film where the point was the plot?\nAMELIA:(SIGHS) What's your hang-up, man?\nJACKSON: It's not the sex. It's... It's what's in the story.\nAMELIA:My mom found out. (SIGHS) She killed Dean and destroyed the film.\nHEALY: Your mom killed Dean?\nAMELIA:Of course. She killed Misty, too.\nHOLLY: And Sid Shattuck?\nAMELIA: Yeah.\nMARCH: Okay, so it's like Jack the Ripper and then your mom, basically.\n(Amelia SIGHS)\nHOLLY: So what are you gonna do?\nAMELIA: I don't know. I'm just really tired, you know.\nHEALY: Uh, all right, okay. So, uh, you... We're just gonna talk about it and we'll think and you get some rest.\nMARCH: Yeah, just get some rest.\n\nThey all walk back to the corridor.\nMARCH:What do you think?\nHOLLY:I like her.\nJESSICA:I like her dress.\nMARCH:It's a nice dress. But she's a loon. According to her, her mother's single-handedly gonna wipe out all of Western society.\nHEALY: Well, yeah. However, there are people trying to kill her, right?\nMARCH: Like John Boy.\nHOLLY: Who's John Boy?\nJESSICA: He's on The Waltons.\nHEALY: No, different John Boy.\nMARCH: Well, we think.\nHEALY: Think, yeah. Pretty sure.\n(TELEPHONE RINGING)\nMARCH: Can't be sure, though. Yeah.\n\nThe call is from Judith's office.\nTALLY: Mr March, I just got a call from Judith. She didn't explain herself. Said she needed $100,000 in cash.\nMARCH: $100,000? Why?\nTALLY: I don't know. -I think she's involved in something shady maybe.\nMARCH: Well, her daughter certainly seems to think so.\nTALLY: What, Amelia? You found Amelia?\nMARCH: Yes. She fell on our car. We were just talking and she fell on our car. Anyway, she's here. You should come over.\nTALLY: I... I'll send the family doctor.\n(SIGHS)\nTALLY: Okay, look, Mr March...\nMARCH: Holland, please.\nTALLY: I've got a bad feeling about this. Would you be willing to carry the money for me?\n\nCut to OUTSIDE DEPT OF JUSTICE\nHEALY: I wish I knew who to believe on this one.\nMARCH: Well, the kid's a write-off, I'll tell you that much.\nHEALY: Maybe they're both telling the truth.\nMARCH: We're downstairs. She's coming down. What do you mean, they're both telling the truth? What the fuck does that mean?\nHEALY: I got a friend, right? Secret Service. Worked the Nixon detail. This was after they threw him out of office. No. Anyway, you know, Nixon's driving around one day around San Clemente. Just him and a few agents.\nMARCH: Yeah.\nHEALY: And they come across this car accident, right? There's a guy pinned under a car. Anyway, Nixon gets out, runs over to check on the guy, you know, leans down, and Nixon says to him, \"You're gonna be okay, son. You're gonna be all right.\" And right then the guy dies.\nMARCH: I don't get it.\nHEALY: Think about it from that guy's point of view, okay? The guy who died. He's lying there on the ground, staring up at the sky, near death, and then former president Richard Nixon appears before him and tells him he's gonna be fine. Now, did he think that's normal, right, that before they die, everybody sees Nixon?\nMARCH: You're expecting an angel and you get Nixon.\nHEALY: Exactly. Right?\nMARCH: Yeah.\nHEALY: It's the same situation, just a vastly different point of view.\nMARCH: So there's two ways to look at something.\nHEALY: Yeah.\nMARCH: That's the point of the story?\nHEALY: Yeah.\nMARCH: Yeah, just say that.\nHEALY: What?\nMARCH: Well, you just lead me on this epic fucking journey with this story, and 10 minutes later, the point is that there's two ways to look at something. Just... You could just say that.\nHEALY: You didn't like that story?\nMARCH: That would be awful.\nHEALY: Wouldn't it, right?\nMARCH: Yeah.\nHEALY: It would suck, right?\nMARCH: Oh.\nTally then appears, handing them a briefcase.\nMARCH: Hey.\nTALLY: Thank God. $100,000. Packed it myself. Just... It's not common you find such nice people in the world.\nMARCH: (LAUGHS)I'm sorry about him. He just wanted to come along. I don't know why. But I'll call you, you know, when we make the drop.\nTALLY: Thank you.\n\nCut to MARCH'S CAR\nMARCH:  Are you nervous at all?\nHEALY: Me? No. I got insurance. [shows a holster in his ankle] This baby right here.\nMARCH: Is that an ankle gun?\nHEALY: That is an ankle gun, yeah.\nMARCH: That's pretty sweet.\nHEALY: Uh-huh.\nMARCH: I'm falling asleep at the wheel here, man. I'm gonna need you to drive. I'm gonna pull over up here.\nHEALY: You don't have to pull over. The car can drive itself.\nMARCH: What?\nHEALY: Just take your hands off the wheel, man.\nSaid and done, the car is driving itself\nMARCH: Hmm. I didn't know it could do that.\nHe then lights a cigarette\nHEALY: Where you been, man? Every car can do this.\nWe then see a (smoking) giant bee is in the backseat.\nBUMBLE: Yeah, March, where the fuck have you been, man? Idiot. You didn't know that?\nMARCH: You fly everywhere. You don't even drive.What do you know?\nHEALY:  He's got a point there, Bumble.\nBUMBLE: Yeah, whatever. I used to fly all the time, but now the smog is just disgusting, man. It's just this pollution is out of control. All the bees are riding around in cars these days.\nHEALY: Wake up! Wake up!\nA sleeping March is revealed on the wheel\nHEALY: March! Wake up! (TYRES SQUEALING, cones being hit and flying, we're back to reality...) March! Wake up!\nMarch wakes up, sees he's losing control and tries to put the car back on the road, SHRIEKING like a girl again\nHEALY: Shit. Shit.\nBut they end up crashing against water barrels, causing the briefcase to fall out and spill the contents everywhere. It's not money, but a bunch of paper clippings.\nHEALY: That's not money.\nMARCH: Tally packed it herself. She said so. Why? Why would she send us off on some wild fucking goose chase?\nHEALY:Amelia.\nMarch in a payphone. The LINE is only BEEPING, he angrily puts it back and rushes to the car\nCut to MARCH'S HOUSE\nJessica is on the phone while Holly plays Solitaire.\nJESSICA: No, like The Waltons. Yeah? Yeah, on TV. Richard something? Yeah. Who's that actor?\nHOLLY: Jessica, get off the phone.\nJESSICA:  Yeah. Anyway, so this new John Boy's like a murderer or something. Uh-huh.\n(DOORBELL RINGS)\nJESSICA: Shit. Now it's gonna bug me.\nHolly opens the door, it's a man in black with a mole in his face (Matt Bomer)\nMAN:You must be Holly. Dr Malek.\nHOLLY:Hi.\n\"MALEK\":Hi.\nHOLLY:She's inside. Come in.\n\"MALEK\":Thank you.\nHe enters\nJESSICA: Yeah, I don't know...\n\"MALEK\":You mind fetching your dad?\nHOLLY:Uh, he's running an errand.\n\"MALEK\":Back anytime soon?\nHOLLY:Oh, hour, tops.\n\"MALEK\":Fine. Now, then, Nurse Holly, how's our patient? [nods to Jessica] That's her?\nHOLLY:Oh, no, that's Jessica.  What she's got you can't fix.\n\"MALEK\":(CHUCKLES) You are very funny.\nHOLLY: (points to the bedrooom) In there. Asleep. Slight fever.\n\"MALEK\":Hmm. On drugs you think? Maybe smoking the reefer? What was she saying?Was she making sense?\nJESSICA: Hold on. Um... Holly, what's the name of the guy on The Waltons that plays John Boy? With the hockey puck on his face?\nHOLLY: (CHUCKLES) That show's for retards. Dr Malek, would you like a cookie? Just baked them.\nJESSICA:There's none left. I looked, remember?\nHOLLY: No, there's a couple. Doctor?\nHolly goes to the kitchen...\nJOHN-BOY:I could be persuaded. After I have a look at Sleeping Beauty.\n...and takes the gun from the cookie pot, cocks it as she points it at John-Boy, who extends his arms and SIGHS\nJOHN-BOY:Nurse Holly.\nHe drops his suitcase, which makes a THUDDING noise\nJOHN-BOY:Holly, what are you doing? Are you crazy?\nHOLLY: There are handcuffs behind the bar, asshole. Get them.\nJOHN-BOY:This is really slowing me down, Holly.\nJESSICA: What's going on?\nHOLLY: Jessica, it's him. He's the guy.\nJOHN-BOY:Jessica, if you help me with this,[takes out a knife] I'll only kill Holly.\nCut to March's car approaching, and then back to the house\nHOLLY: Jessica, dial 911.\nJOHN-BOY:Jessica, I wouldn't do that if I were you.\nMarch parks just as Jessica runs towards them. John-Boys tackles her and throws the girl through the window besides the door.\nCut to OUTSIDE MARCH'S HOUSE\nJessica is thrown out the window, just as March and Healy have stopped outside the house\nMARCH:You hear that?\nThey see John-Boy walk in front of the house\nMARCH: Excuse me.\nJOHN-BOY:Evening.\nMARCH: You hear that sound just a second ago?\nJohn-Boy opens his car's trunk, goes down to get something\nJOHN-BOY:Oh, yeah, just now. That was me. [he rises again, wielding a Tommy Gun] I threw that little girl out the window.\nJohn-Boy fires the machine gun, hitting only the car as March and Healy take cover. Eventually his magazine is depleted\nMARCH: Cover me.\nAs March leaves, Healy shoots a pistol, hitting John Boy's car. John Boy reloads his tommy gun and fires again. Healy is forced to duck quickly.\nHEALY: God.\nWhile March keeps running back, John-Boy continues shooting, and Healy returns fire once the assassin's bullets stop again. When March gets near the door, he grabs Jessica and carries her. Healy starts running towards the house as John-Boy reloads, eventually hiding behind a generator under a palmtree.\nCut to INSIDE MARCH'S HOUSE\nMarch enters the house, carrying Jessica.\nMARCH: Holly!\nHolly rushes from a nearby room\nHOLLY: Dad!\nMarch points at a closet\nMARCH: Get in.\nHOLLY: Is she okay?\nMARCH:  Get down.\nOutside, Healy is hiding from John Boy's attack while taking bullets from his pocket. Back inside, as March and Holly approach the closet, Amelia comes out of it screaming\nAMELIA:Fucking fascists! (GASPS when he sees March with Jessica)\nMARCH: Jesus!\nAMELIA: (covering her mouth) Sorry.\nMARCH: (pointing forward) Get in.\nAmelia retreats into the closet, while March puts the unconscious Jessica in it and Holly enters as well.\nMARCH: Okay, come here. [he embraces Holly] Stay in here and don't move.\nHOLLY: Okay.\nHe closes the door\nMARCH: Okay. Okay.\nThe closet door opens, an arm carrying a handgun waving\nHOLLY: Wait, wait. Dad, Dad, here you go.\nMARCH:Jesus!\nThe startled March takes the gun\nOutside, John Boy stops firing again, March shoots, and  March comes in from the front door and does it too. John Boy looks into the trunk, grabs a pistol and fires it with one hand while shooting with the tommy gun in the other at the house, forcing March back in.\nCut to CLOSET\nJessica is rubbing her eyes while Amelia is getting up.\nHOLLY:Jessica. I think she's awake.\nAmelia moves towards the window\nHOLLY: Wait, where are you going? What are you doing?\nAMELIA: Tell Mr Healy thanks for nothing.\nshe jumps out the window\nCut to OUTSIDE\nJohn Boy now has an AK-47. He fires in the space between March and Healy, missing both but damaging the palm tree above the latter plentifully. The tree creaks, and just as it starts falling on the house, Healy runs towards the kitchen window, firing his last bullets at John Boy.\nCut to KITCHEN\nHealy GROANS after going through the window.\nHEALY: Fuck!\nBullets hit the kitchen as Healy searches for ammo. March enters.\nMARCH:Are you okay?\nHEALY: March, gun, gun!\nHe throws the gun... and hits the window, making it go through the glass\nHEALY: Fuck!\nMARCH:Shit!\n\nJohn Boy is still firing as March grabs the cookie jar and runs towards Healy. Once the shooting stops, he turns the jar around and gives bullets to Healy\nMARCH: Here.\nOutside, John Boy ran back to the car and shot with the pistol until he heard a SIREN WAILING.  He closes the trunk, and runs towards the wheel as Healy's shots hit his windshield. John Boy then runs away, TYRES SCREECHING. March rises from his crouched position...\nMARCH:He's gone.\n\n...and runs towards the closet. Holly gets out to see him.\nMARCH: He's gone.\nhe's PANTING, and then notices Jessica is awake\nMARCH:Hey.\nJessica gestures, looking both hurt and sleepy. March looks to both sides and then Holly points out the window. March goes to it, and Amelia is nowhere in sight.\nMARCH: Shit.\nJohn-Boy driving away, listening to a SIREN WAILING. Right in front of him, appears Amelia running.  She flags down the car, asking for help.\nJOHN-BOY:Wow.\nHe stops, Amelia leans on the open passenger door window.\nAMELIA:Please, I need to get out of here.\nGUNSHOT, a now dead Amelia falls on the street. John-Boy  leaves\nCut to OUTSIDE MARCH'S HOUSE\nA CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS, as a photographer takes a picture of Amelia's corpse, which then is covered by a blanket. Healy looks at it with a defeated look before walking along the police cars, while an equally desolate March stares at the horizon. Pan up, the sun starts rising\nCut to POLICE STATION, DAY\nMarch and Healy walk along with a cop in a suit.\nMARCH: She had her fucking daughter killed, Perry. Please tell me they're at least gonna question her.\nPERRY: They haven't and they're not going to.\nHEALY: Because?\nPERRY: Because she's the head of the Justice Department. Oh, and, by the way, you're welcome. (LAUGHS) You're out, free on your own recognisance. You get to walk. There should be like a statue of me in your fucking house. I'm sorry, guys. You're gonna lose this one, all right? Your word against hers. No evidence. You lose. You better seriously think about changing your story.\n\nCut to STREET\nAs \"A Horse with no Name\" plays, we see Holland, Holly and Healy in a taxi, stuck in traffic. They see the birds flying away...\nHEALY: Oh, fuck it.\nMARCH: Maybe they're right. Maybe the goddamn birds can't breathe.\nHEALY: Amelia, Misty, Dean, Shattuck, all dead. The rest of us just get to choke.\nHOLLY: (SIGHS) I need a drink.\n\nCut to OUTSIDE MARCH'S HOUSE\nThe cab stops by the house isolated with a police line.\nHEALY: How much do I owe you, buddy?\nCAB DRIVER: 12 bucks, pal.\nHOLLY: I always hated that palm tree.\nMARCH: Never trusted it.\n(Holly CHUCKLES)\nMARCH: Go inside and get your stuff.\nHOLLY:Okay.\nShe goes into the house.\nMARCH:We'll go stay in a hotel or something. We'll get room service.\nA car arrives. It's Mrs. Glenn.\nMRS. GLENN: Mr March.\nMARCH:Mrs Glenn.\nMRS. GLENN:I need to talk to you.\nMARCH:(CHUCKLING) What a wonderful surprise.\nMRS. GLENN:Is that your house?\nMARCH:We're remodelling. Listen, this isn't a great time.\nMRS. GLENN:It is a great time. He is supposed to be looking for my niece.\nHEALY: Really?\nMRS. GLENN:Because I saw her. But nobody believes me. Why will nobody believe me?\nHEALY:I'm sure I don't know, ma'am.\nMRS. GLENN:I saw her in her house through the front window as clear as day, writing something at a desk. She was wearing a blue pinstriped jacket.\nHEALY: I've seen that jacket, sure, yeah.\nMARCH: What do you mean, you saw that jacket?\nHEALY:In Shattuck's office. It was there with a bunch of other clothes.\nMARCH: That jacket was in Sid Shattuck's office?\nHEALY:Yeah. It was bagged up. It had Misty's name on it and the name of the movie.\nMARCH: It's wardrobe for the film. It's wardrobe for the film. Holy fucking shit.\nMRS. GLENN:Oh!\nMARCH: Sorry. Mrs Glenn, I need you to take us to Misty's house. I need you to show us exactly what you saw.\n\nCut to MISTY'S HOUSE, SUNSET\nThey park outside the house, Mrs. Glenn points at the window\nMRS GLENN: There. There. That's the window. I was coming around that corner and I saw her through that window.\nNow they're inside. Mrs. Glenn finds it different from the memory.\nMRS GLENN:But, no, it was here. The desk was here.\nHEALY: No desk there now.\nMarch is crawling on the floor.\nMRS GLENN: Well, I don't know what to say.\nHOLLY: Dad, what are you doing?\nMARCH: Give me a second.\nHe pushes a button under a table, with a WHIRRING noise it opens and reveals a projector.\nMARCH: World's worst detective, huh? You did see your niece, Mrs Glenn. You saw her on that wall, at a desk, in a pinstriped suit.\nHEALY: So what she saw was a movie?\nMARCH: Not a movie. The movie. The movie.\nHEALY: But the film burned up.\nMARCH:Well, how did she see it two days after it supposedly burned up? And the wardrobe matches perfectly.\nHEALY: So Amelia had a second print? She had a copy?\nMARCH:Wouldn't you?\nHOLLY: And she gave that copy to Misty. So she comes here, checks the film against that wall...\nMARCH:Lily sees it through that window.\nHOLLY: And Amelia splits and takes the film.\nHEALY: And goes where?\nMARCH:Oh, for fuck... I mean, can't we get to the next...\nHEALY: The Western Hotel to meet the businessman.\nMARCH:Distributors. She was screening it for the distributors. She was showing them the film. It's out there. The film exists. Now we just have to find it.\nHolly finds a note on the floor.\nHOLLY: Guys, look. \"Opening night, 9:00 p.m.\" Signed, Chet.\nMARCH: Fucking Chet.\nHEALY: The protestor guy?\nMARCH:Give me that shit. [she gives him the note] She was planning something with Chet. Opening night?\nHOLLY:The LA auto show. It's today, right?\nHEALY: Yeah. Big party. Mucky-mucks. Loads of press. If you wanted to get a story out there, right?\nMARCH: And fucking Chet's a projectionalist.\nMRS GLENN: Please stop talking. I've been listening to everything you said. Does this mean... Does this mean that my niece is dead?\nMARCH: Yes! I mean, you know, yes.\nMrs. Glenn gets sad, Holly sighs.\nMARCH: She was murdered. I'm sorry.\nJACKSON: Mmm-hmm.\nHOLLY: But we're gonna bring down the people who did it.\nMARCH: Yeah, and for a deeply discounted rate, so...\n\nCut to CAR EXPO\nTelevision footage of the vehicles showcased at the expo.\nMC: Welcome to Los Angeles and the 1978 Pacific Coast Auto Show.

And you are?\nMARCH: In a hurry.\nHEALY: Thanks, buddy.\nBUDDY: How'd you know my name was Buddy?\nHealy is lockpicking the door, with Holly warning him the surroundings are clear. He opens, and both men  go through.\nCut to EXPO\nWOMAN (VO): The Malibu sedan. This year's edition is looking spectacular. Come and see it, folks.\nLots of fancy people walk around the expo cars, including Bergen Paulsen, the executive interviewed on that report March watched in the bathtub.\nCut to PROJECTION ROOM\nHealy is checking the film reels.\nHEALY: It's just a bunch of cars. Motor City Pride. That's not it.\nMARCH: Shit.\nHEALY: That's not the film.\nMarch looks below the open film can before searching elsewhere.\nMARCH: Fucking Chet. He's probably still got it stashed somewhere.\nTally enters with a  gun, Holly tries to follow but  the door is closed in her face. The men turn to see Tally, the new person, who cocks her gun to point at both.\nMARCH: Tally. Oh, my God, you look incredible. How do you get your hair to... It's magnificent. (STUTTERS, as Healy gives a negative look) Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but there's been some foul play. Do you know that that suitcase that you gave us, somebody switched it out. There was no money in it.\nHealy facepalms.\nTALLY: (CHUCKLES) No shit. Weapons on the floor. Now.\nHEALY:(SIGHS) I guess you killed the projectionist, huh?\nHealy tosses his gun to the ground. March does the same\nTALLY: No. My associate's out looking for him now. We'll find him.\nHEALY:Tally, let me ask you something. You ever really killed anybody?\nTALLY: In Detroit, yeah. Three times.\nHEALY:Really?\nTALLY: That's where this all started. The Detroit show. That bitch Misty shooting her mouth off about her new movie.\nMARCH:Tally, this is not you. You're not a murderer.\nHEALY:She just said she killed three people.\nMARCH:I know, but I'm saying deep down.\nHEALY:Hey, look, one's a mistake. By the time you get to three...\nMARCH:Don't paint her with that brush. I guess it's easy to live in your world, right, where everyone sits in their place.\nHEALY:See what's in front of you. She's got a gun and she's killed three...\nMARCH:Come on, man. You don't know her upbringing.\nHEALY:You gotta face the situation.\nMARCH:You don't know what she...\n(KNOCKING ON DOOR)\nHOLLY: Room service.\nMarch gets on the floor, starts searching through Healy's ankles\nMARCH:Shit. No.\nTALLY: What's wrong with him?\nHEALY:I... I don't know. I'm gonna ask him. March?\nMARCH:Yeah?\nHEALY:Uh, what the fuck are you doing?\nMARCH:Did you move it?\nHEALY:Move what?\nMARCH:The fucking gun.\nHEALY:What gun?\nMARCH:The fucking ankle gun.\nHEALY:Who told you I had an ankle gun?\nMARCH:You did.

Are you serious?Are you fucking serious?\nMARCH:Oh, shit.\nHEALY:Yeah.\nMARCH:Did I dream that?\nHEALY:Yeah, you moron, you dreamt it.\nMARCH:No, no, no, no.

Holly, you can come in now.\nShe opens the door, Holly enters, pushing a food trolley.\nTALLY: (CHUCKLES) Very clever, Holly.\nHOLLY: Thanks. I thought so.\n(Holly throws coffee in Tally's face, she GASPS)\nTALLY: Why did you just throw cold coffee on me?\nHOLLY: I got it in the hallway. I thought it was hot.\nMARCH: I like where your head's at, sweetheart. That really could have worked out.\nTALLY:All right, you know, everybody, in the corner.\nCome on.\nTally ends up slipping on the poured coffee, YELPS...\nTALLY:Shit!\n...and falls, , pulling the trigger to hit a window whileknocking herself unconscious\nMARCH: Well, that really worked out.\nHEALY: Yeah.\nThey get their guns back, while Healy also disarms Tally.\nMARCH:Now we just gotta find that fucking Chet before John Boy does.\nHEALY: Yeah. Well, that guy said he was going for a drink. You take the roof bar. I'll take downstairs.Well done, kiddo.\nHOLLY:Thanks.\nAs they leave, March puts a cushion under Tally's head, and even pats her before going\nCut to DOWNSTAIRS BAR\nJohn-Boy walks to Chet, who is drinking in the bar counter.\nJOHN-BOY: You the projectionist?\nCHET: Mmm-hmm. (CLEARS THROAT)\nJOHN-BOY: Look, we got a problem on nine. Someone knocked over the projector. The film's all over the floor.\nCHET: Film's on the floor? Really?\nJOHN-BOY: Yeah, it's a mess. You follow me?\nChet takes a last sip before getting up to follow him.\nCut to UPSTAIRS BAR\n\"Escape (The Pi\u00f1a Colada Song)\" is PLAYING in the fancy location, as the ELEVATOR DINGS.

In the bar, March eventually grabs a snack near the counter, earning him the notice of...\nBARTENDER:Hey, pal, what can I do you for? [March gestures negatively] Free drinks. What do you have?\nMarch turns  with a more interested look.\nCut to STORAGE ROOM\nHealy is questioning a janitor.\nHEALY: Little guy, stringy hair.\nJANITOR: [pointing] I think they went out through those doors.\nHealy walks out to a backyard full of empty containers.\nHEALY: Hey, Chet?

Hey, Chet.\n(CHET MOANS)\nHEALY: Amelia's film, where is it?\n\nCut to EXPO\nJOHN-BOY: (to a walkie-talkie) The film is in the projector. Repeat, it's in the projector.\n\nCut to UPSTAIRS BAR\nOlder Guy is responding in a table right behind where Holly is. She notes the conversation is interesting...\nOLDER GUY: (to walkie-talkie) But we already checked that.\n\n\nCut to STORAGE ROOM\nCHET: Spliced in.\nHEALY:What?\n\nCut to EXPO\nJOHN-BOY: [looking upwards to the projection room] It's spliced into the middle of it, right in the other film. Go get it.\n\nCut to UPSTAIRS BAR\nOLDER GUY:On my way.\nHolly tries following him, the ELEVATOR DINGS... and the Older Guy turns, noticing his pursuer.\nOLDER GUY:Don't you know it's rude to eavesdrop?\nOlder Guy brings Holly next to the now clearly wasted March in the bar counter.\nOLDER GUY:I got a gun pointed directly at your daughter's spine. Come with me. (to Holly) Come on, baby.\nThey step back, March puts on his shades and turns around to see both.

It's  sleazy footage, with a women moaning with the text \"A Savage Sid Shattuck production\" appears. After that comes Misty Mountains topless along with the credits \"Misty Mountains In\" and \"How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy?\"\nPAULSEN: Oh, my God.\n\n\nCut to ROOF\nMARCH: Fuck, fuck.\nOLDER GUY: Do you want her to see you like this?\n(MARCH CONTINUES CRYING)\nOLDER GUY: You fucking drunk. Oh, don't start that crying shit.\nMARCH:I fucked up.\nOLDER GUY: You drunk motherfucker, you.\nMARCH:I love you.\nOLDER GUY:  It's embarrassing.\nMARCH:I'm sorry. Duck.\nHOLLY: What?\nMARCH: [taking off his shades] Duck.\nHe punches the Older Guy.\nOLDER GUY: Motherfucker!\nOlder Guy goes for March, who is going for his gun. March punches him again beforing shooting Older Guy in the chest, who in response tries pulling Holly along as he falls down the edge; March tackles him, he lets her go. Both are falling towards the pool, Older Guy bloodily splats on the ground while March hits the water.\nCut to EXPO\nPORN ACTOR: Well, I'm Bulging Paulsen and I represent the Detroit auto manufacturers. That's who the hell I am.\nPaulsen himself is disgusted, as all the other patrons give an \"Oooh\" reaction he walks away.\nMISTY: You poison our air. The people won't stand for it.\nAngry John-Boy also walks out.\nCut to POOL\nMarch is down the water, seemingly about to pass out, when something makes him get an amused look.\nMARCH: Nixon! [he sees \"Tricky Dick\" inside the pool] No!\nHe GRUNTS and starts swimming away and out the water.\nCut to EXPO\nJohn Boy keeps on walking in the expo as the movie plays. He then turns to find the projector room...\nMISTY: (O.S.) I might be persuaded to change my mind. Perhaps if we came to a monetary arrangement. I'll take a wire transfer. It's a Union Federal account. Number 22-12. Just tell them the exact amounts.\n...and John-Boy tries shooting at the projector, while everyone else starts SCREAMING and running away in panic\n-He's got a gun!\n\nCut to POOL\nMarch is now floating in the pool, listening to gun shots before a spinning car nearby explodes.\nCut to PROJECTION ROOM\nThe bullets have hit the projector, and both the falling glass and the fire alarm wake up Tally.\nCut to POOL\nMarch now goes for the pool ladder to leave.\nCut to EXPO\nNearby, Healy has returned, and tries dodging the running people. He eventually sees March getting in the expo, and trying to shoot John-Boy, hitting the glasses near him. John-Boy crouches and tries to shoot March, who rolls over a spinning Chevrolet which is hit.\nMARCH: Oh, my God.\nMarch is BREATHING DEEPLY, preparing his next strike, when John-Boy turns around and notices he is against a car in spinning platform.\nMARCH: Three, two, one.\nMarch gets up, also sees he's spinning. John-Boy shoots, hits the rearviewmirrors next to March.\nMARCH:Jesus!\nHe falls down and starts crawling away. Healy shoots and hits the lamp near John-Boy, who cowers back. Both men keep on firing until John-Boy is out of bullets, and March is next to Healy.\nHEALY: How'd you get down here? I told you to go to the roof. Did you fall?\nMARCH: Yeah.\nMarch prepares his gun as John-Boy fires again, hitting the car between the men.\nHEALY: Jesus Christ, are you kidding?\nMARCH: I think I'm invincible. It's the only thing that makes sense. I don't think I can die.\nHEALY: Where's the film?\nMARCH: It's up there. We just gotta go get it.\nThe camera pans up back to the projector room...\nCut to PROJECTION ROOM\n...where Holly has just entered, and is seeing Tally holding a pair of scissors in front of the projector table. Tally sees Holly, and throws the scissors, which as Holly ducks quickly are impaled into the door. Once she rises up again, Holly runs for the table, eventually being grabbed by Tally in the shoulder.\nTALLY: You get out of here, you little shit.\nHOLLY kicks Tally in the knee, and she SCREAMS falling to the ground, releasing Holly, who goes on to grab the film can. Tally rises up as Holly is holding the can in front of her.\nTALLY: You give me that, you fucked-up little hippy.\nHOLLY: You want it? Go get it.\nHolly tosses the uptight can, making it roll like a wheel.\nTALLY: No!\nTally tries getting it, but it's too late: the can rolls and falls down the window\nCut to EXPO\nClose-ups of March, Healy and eventually Paulsen with two thugs behind him seeing the can falling. Once it hits the ground, it bounces until it stops by the car that exploded.\nPAULSEN:Get me that fucking film. Move it.\nThe thugs leave, and then we see March doing the same.\nMARCH: Cover me.\nHEALY (O.S.): What? March, March , March!\nMarch runs through the lobby, John Boy sees him and takes aim, with March returning fire. Then someone approaches John-Boy from behind.\nGUARD: Drop your weapon!\nJohn Boy punches the guy and shoots another guard that approaches. Paulsen's people run through the lobby, Healy tackles two of them, throwing them on the ground. March finds the film can near a fire, tries to grab it and instantly drops the hot can.\nMARCH: Fuck.\nHealy is punching the two thugs, and then turns around to talk to March\nHEALY: March, go. I got this.\nMarch wraps the movie can in some cloth, grabs it and runs away as Healy continues fighting the thugs. He passes by John Boy finishing off the guard, by punching him more and then shooting him. He then turns, seeing March leaving...\nCut to CONVENTION ROOM\n...March runs down the escalator, jumps off it into a table, which flips and drops him on the floor. Luckily, March also misses being shot by John Boy as he's picking himself up. March runs, another bullet hits the wall next to March, and when he turns around a bit, John Boy hits right in the film can, the impact pushing March into the window behind him. He breaks the window, and while falling the can slips from his hands. March crawls after the rolling can as it falls down the balcony....\nCut to ENTRANCE\n...crashing through a glass ceiling atop a car below. Sliding to stand on the street, March is hit by one of Paulsen's men, who runs towards the can and grabs it. Just as March gets near the guy, bullets hit near him.\nCut to BALCONY\nIt's John Boy in a nearby balcony.\nHEALY: Hey!\nJohn Boy turns to see who yelled, it's Healy, who jumps on him, making John Boy drop his gun.\nCut to ENTRANCE\nDown on the street, March is running when a taxi passenger opens his door, pushing March towards a nearby car.\nPASSENGER: Hey!\nAfter hitting the parked car, March is hit by a moving one. The driver honks and screams as March rolls and falls with his back at the windshield. Eventually March sees the man with the film and runs towards him. He grabs him by the shoulder, then in the waist.\nMAN: Run! Just run!\n\nCut to BALCONY\nHealy and John Boy keep on fighting. When Healy flips John Boy over, he sees a grenade pin around his finger. As he runs away, John Boy is struggling to takes off his jacket.\nCut to ENTRANCE\nThe thug attacked by March finally lets the can loose. Another one of Paulsen's men goes out the door at tries shooting at March, hitting a nearby car. Eventually John-Boy's jacket falls on this thug's arm, exploding.\nCut to BALCONY\nJohn Boy jumps back at the flames rise from the street, and is tackled by Healy.   Holly comes by the door, sees Healy atop John-Boy, choking him.\nHOLLY: Mr Healy, what are you doing?\nHEALY: Go away, Holly.\nHOLLY: Healy, stop. You don't have to kill him.\nJohn Boy tries fighting back, but fails.\nHOLLY: Mr Healy, if you kill this man, I will never speak to you again.\nHealy turns to stare at Holly...\nCut to ENTRANCE\nDown on the street March tumbles towards the can. As he grabs it, the message on his hand now reads something different as one word is smudged : \"YOU WILL BE HAPPY\". He GROANS.\nCut to BALCONY\n...and lets off of John Boy's throat. He COUGHS\nHEALY: Congratulations, buddy. You owe your life to a 13-year-old girl.\nHealy then punches him unconscious. Holly approaches Healy. Down in the street, March holds up the film can in triumph. Healy gets up, Holly smiles. Afterwards, March extends the pinky from his broken hand to Holly. She replies with the same gesture. March sits on the sidewalk, his back towards a parked car. On the balcony, Healy pats Holly in the head.\nHEALY: Come on, let's go down and see your dad.\nThey walk back inside\nCut to ENTRANCE\nThe SIRENS WAIL.\nMARCH: And that would be the cops.\nMarch grabs a cigarette as the police cars park in front of the hotel. The cops from the first car go for him as March lights the cigarette.\nOFFICER: Sir? Sir, are you all right? Sir, is anyone left in the building?\nOFFICER 2: He's not responsive.\nOFFICER: All right, let's find out who else is...\nMARCH:(VO): And sometimes, sometimes... You just win.\n\nCut to DEPT. OF JUSTICE\nMarch and Healy are sitting in the reception's chairs. Healy then sees Judith is approaching...\nHEALY: Jesus Christ. Oh, shit.\nMARCH: You know what? Don't even talk to her. Don't even look at her, man.\nMarch puts on his shades just as Judith sits in chairs backing them.\nMARCH: Fuck.\nJUDITH: Oh, boys, boys. You really think you got something done here. Do you have a clue what just happened? It was protocol. I followed protocol.\n(MARCH SPEAKING FAKE GERMAN)\nJUDITH:What's wrong with him?\nHEALY: I believe he's making a connection between you and Adolf Hitler.\nJUDITH: Read the fucking newspaper. What's good for Detroit is good for America.\nHEALY: Unbelievable.\nJUDITH:The America I love owes its life to the Big Three.\nHEALY:But it's all right for you to fail your daughter?\nJUDITH:Detroit had her killed.\nMARCH: I think I read about that. The whole city got together, took a vote. Big turnout.\nJUDITH:I wanted her safe. That's why I hired you two.\nHEALY:You're going to jail, Mrs Kuttner.\nJUDITH:I might be going to jail, but it won't make a difference. You can't take Detroit down.And if I'm not there to take care of it, someone else will be.\nMARCH: Okay. Well, we shall see.\n\nCut to STREET\n(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING as March drives to a bar. It's Christmas season,and a Santa Claus is on the street)\nSANTA: Merry Christmas, everybody. Merry Christmas!\nCut to BAR\nInside the bar, March finds Holly besides the doorstep.\nMARCH: Jesus. Where is he?\nHolly points offscreen. Healy is smoking a cigar at the bar counter. March takes a seat besides him.\nMARCH: Scotch.\nHEALY: Did you see the TV?\nMARCH:Yeah, I saw.\nHEALY: They're gonna let them off,the car companies, scot-free. Not enough evidence of collusion, you see.\nMARCH:I heard.\nHEALY: The sun went up, the sun went down. Nothing changes, just like you said.\nMARCH:Look, they got away with it. Big surprise, you know?(SIGHS) People are stupid. But they're not that stupid. The point is five years tops, we're all driving electric cars from Japan, anyway. Mark my words. Look at this. [grabs his tie] You ever see the bad-breath tie? [EXHALES on the tie, then puts in front of Healy's mouth] Breathe on it.\nHealy giggles, then exhales, leading the tie to shrivel. Healy laughs.\nMARCH: Works every time. Kills Holly. At least you're drinking again.\nHEALY:Yeah. I feel great.\nMARCH:You know, nobody got hurt.\nHEALY:A few people got hurt.\nMARCH:I'm saying I think they died quickly, though, so I don't think that they got hurt. [takes out a newspaper] Look at this.\nHe shows an ad featuring caricatures of both, 'The Nice Guys Agency'\nMARCH:I'm sorry you look Filipino.\nHEALY:I do. Or I look Mexican.\nMARCH:And we already got our first case. Old lady in Glendale.\nHEALY:Mmm-hmm.\nMARCH:Thinks her husband's sleeping with Lynda Carter.\nHEALY:Wonder Woman?\nMARCH:Or Lynda Carter. That's what we have to figure out.\nHEALY:Right.\nMARCH:But he's 82, so it's time-sensitive. What do you say?\nA bee is BUZZING on the counter.\nMARCH: Shit.\nTries to hit the bee with the paper, then CLEARS THROAT. Healy gets a drink bottle to toast with March's scotch glass.\nMARCH: To the birds.\nHEALY: Hallelujah.\nMarch sips from the glass, Healy chugs straight from the bottle.\nEND CREDITS1Embed"},

Five to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name again? Dignam. Yes. Vere dignum et iustum est. Brother Swan was the person to see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.\n\nA onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.\n\nFather Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words: If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.\n\n\u2014Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?\n\nFather Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.\n\nFather Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call.\n\u2014Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.\n\nFather Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.\n\nFather Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.\n\n\u2014Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?\n\nA zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish. Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?\n\nO, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.\n\nFather Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.\n\nFather Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.\n\n\u2014But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said.\n\nThe boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:\n\n\u2014O, sir.\n\n\u2014Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.\n\nMaster Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.\nMr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam's court.\n\nWas that not Mrs M'Guinness?\n\nMrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. How did she do?\n\nA fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he say?... such a queenly mien.\n\nFather Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will (D.V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according to their lights.\n\nFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.\n\nA band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys.\n\nFather Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.\n\nNear Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now it was an office or something.\n\nFather Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.\n\nFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.\n\nFather Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable. In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.\n\nMoored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.\nOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. of saint Francis Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.\n\nOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.\n\nAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.\n\nFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.\n\nIt was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.\n\nFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.\n\nFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.\n\nAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been absolved, pray for me. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.\n\nFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.\n\nFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le Nombre des \u00c9lus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were God's souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.\n\nAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.\n\nThe Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.\n\nFather Conmee, walking, thought of his little book Old Times in the Barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.\n\nA listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, with her husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.\n\nFather Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.\n\nDon John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.\n\nIt was a charming day.\n\nThe lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind. Moutonner, the French said. A just and homely word.\n\nFather Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.\n\nFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivory bookmark told him the page.\n\nNones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.\n\nFather Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast. Deus in adiutorium.\n\nHe walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to Res in Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae.\n\nA flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.\n\nFather Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary. Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum.\n\nCorny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.\n\nFather John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.\n\nCorny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.\n\nConstable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.\n\n\u2014That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher.\n\n\u2014Ay, Corny Kelleher said.\n\n\u2014It's very close, the constable said.\n\nCorny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.\n\n\u2014What's the best news? he asked.\n\n\u2014I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.\n\nA onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner, skirting Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:\n\n\u2014For England...\n\nHe swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled:\n\n\u2014home and beauty.\n\nJ. J. O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.\n\nA stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.\n\nHe halted and growled angrily:\n\n\u2014For England...\n\nTwo barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.\n\nHe swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply:\n\n\u2014home and beauty.\n\nThe gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card Unfurnished Apartments slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the path.\nOne of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel's cap, saying:\n\n\u2014There, sir.\n\nKatey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.\n\n\u2014Did you put in the books? Boody asked.\n\nMaggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.\n\n\u2014They wouldn't give anything on them, she said.\n\nFather Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.\n\n\u2014Where did you try? Boody asked.\n\n\u2014M'Guinness's.\n\nBoody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.\n\n\u2014Bad cess to her big face! she cried.\n\nKatey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.\n\n\u2014What's in the pot? she asked.\n\n\u2014Shirts, Maggy said.\n\nBoody cried angrily:\n\n\u2014Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?\n\nKatey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:\n\n\u2014And what's in this?\n\nA heavy fume gushed in answer.\n\n\u2014Peasoup, Maggy said.\n\n\u2014Where did you get it? Katey asked.\n\n\u2014Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.\n\nThe lacquey rang his bell.\n\n\u2014Barang!\n\nBoody sat down at the table and said hungrily:\n\n\u2014Give us it here.\n\nMaggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs:\n\n\u2014A good job we have that much. Where's Dilly?\n\n\u2014Gone to meet father, Maggy said.\n\nBoody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:\n\n\u2014Our father who art not in heaven.\n\nMaggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed:\n\n\u2014Boody! For shame!\n\nA skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay.\n\nThe blond girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.\n\n\u2014Put these in first, will you? he said.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.\n\n\u2014That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.\n\nShe bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.\n\nBlazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.\n\nH. E. L. Y.'S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.\n\nHe turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain's length.\n\n\u2014Can you send them by tram? Now?\n\nA darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the hawker's cart.\n\n\u2014Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?\n\n\u2014O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.\n\nThe blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.\n\n\u2014Will you write the address, sir?\n\nBlazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.\n\n\u2014Send it at once, will you? he said. It's for an invalid.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir. I will, sir.\n\nBlazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket.\n\n\u2014What's the damage? he asked.\n\nThe blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits.\n\nBlazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.\n\n\u2014This for me? he asked gallantly.\n\nThe blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, she said.\n\nBending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.\n\nBlazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.\n\n\u2014May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.\n\n\u2014Ma! Almidano Artifoni said.\nHe gazed over Stephen's shoulder at Goldsmith's knobby poll.\n\nTwo carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men's arms frankly round their stunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.\n\n\u2014Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee, ALMIDANO ARTIFONI SAID, quand' ero giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo \u00e8 una bestia. \u00c9 peccato. Perch\u00e8 la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via. Invece, Lei si sacrifica.\n\n\u2014Sacrifizio incruento, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.\n\n\u2014Speriamo, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. Ma, dia retta a me. Ci rifletta.\nBy the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.\n\n\u2014Ci rifletter\u00f2, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.\n\n\u2014Ma, sul serio, eh? Almidano Artifoni said.\n\nHis heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.\n\n\u2014Eccolo, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi. Addio, caro.\n\n\u2014Arrivederla, maestro, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed. E grazie.\n\n\u2014Di che? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!\n\nAlmidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.\n\nMiss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.\n\nToo much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion? Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.\n\nThe disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.\n\nMiss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:\n\n\u201416 June 1904.\n\nFive tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny's corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L. Y.'S and plodded back as they had come.\n\nThen she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not nicelooking, is she? The way she's holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won't keep me here till seven.\n\nThe telephone rang rudely by her ear.\n\n\u2014Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five. Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go after six if you're not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and six. I'll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.\n\nShe scribbled three figures on an envelope.\n\n\u2014Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from SPORT was in looking for you. Mr Lenehan, yes. He said he'll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five.\n\nTwo pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.\n\n\u2014Who's that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?\n\n\u2014Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.\n\n\u2014Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.\n\nThe vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.\n\n\u2014How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?\n\n\u2014No, Ned.\n\n\u2014He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.\n\n\u2014That's right, Ned Lambert said. That's quite right, sir.\n\n\u2014If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...\n\n\u2014Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I'll get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here or from here.\n\nIn the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.\n\nFrom a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.\n\n\u2014I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won't trespass on your valuable time...\n\n\u2014You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next week, say. Can you see?\n\n\u2014Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.\n\n\u2014Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.\n\nHe followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars. With J. J. O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O'Connor, Wexford.\n\nHe stood to read the card in his hand.\n\n\u2014The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint Michael's, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He's writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me. He's well up in history, faith.\n\nThe young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.\n\n\u2014I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O'Molloy said.\n\nNed Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.\n\n\u2014God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? I'm bloody sorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside. He mightn't like it, though. What? God, I'll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.\n\nThe horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:\n\n\u2014Woa, sonny!\n\nHe turned to J. J. O'Molloy and asked:\n\n\u2014Well, Jack. What is it? What's the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.\n\nWith gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.\n\n\u2014Chow! he said. Blast you!\n\n\u2014The dust from those sacks, J. J. O'Molloy said politely.\n\n\u2014No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught...\n\nHe held his handkerchief ready for the coming...\n\n\u2014I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call him... Chow!... Mother of Moses!\n\nTom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.\n\n\u2014See? he said. Say it's turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.\n\nHe slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.\n\nLawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king's bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.\n\n\u2014See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over. The impact. Leverage, see?\n\nHe showed them the rising column of disks on the right.\n\n\u2014Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.\n\n\u2014See? Tom Rochford said.\n\nHe slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four. Turn Now On.\n\n\u2014I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good turn deserves another.\n\n\u2014Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience.\n\n\u2014Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly. When you two begin\n\nNosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.\n\n\u2014But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.\n\n\u2014Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.\n\nHe followed M'Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.\n\n\u2014He's a hero, he said simply.\n\n\u2014I know, M'Coy said. The drain, you mean.\n\n\u2014Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.\n\nThey passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.\n\nGoing down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest and all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.\n\n\u2014The act of a hero, he said.\n\nAt the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.\n\n\u2014This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam's to see Sceptre's starting price. What's the time by your gold watch and chain?\n\nM'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at O'Neill's clock.\n\n\u2014After three, he said. Who's riding her?\n\n\u2014O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.\n\nWhile he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.\n\nThe gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.\n\n\u2014Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an earthly. Through here.\n\nThey went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker's cart.\n\n\u2014There he is, Lenehan said.\n\n\u2014Wonder what he's buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind.\n\n\u2014Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, Lenehan said.\n\n\u2014He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.\n\nLenehan laughed.\n\n\u2014I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. Come over in the sun.\n\nThey crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.\n\nMaster Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.\n\n\u2014There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d'Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...\n\n\u2014I know, M'Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.\n\n\u2014Did she? Lenehan said.\n\nA card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street.\n\nHe checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.\n\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...\n\n\u2014I know, M'Coy said. The year the missus was there...\n\nLenehan linked his arm warmly.\n\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing glees and duets: Lo, the early beam of morning. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.\n\nHe held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:\n\n\u2014I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what I mean?\n\nHis hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.\n\n\u2014The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. And what star is that, Poldy? says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. That one, is it? says Chris Callinan, sure that's only what you might call a pinprick. By God, he wasn't far wide of the mark.\n\nLenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.\n\n\u2014I'm weak, he gasped.\n\nM'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy.\n\n\u2014He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not one of your common or garden... you know... There's a touch of the artist about old Bloom.\n\nMr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, then of Aristotle's Masterpiece. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.\n\nHe laid both books aside and glanced at the third: Tales of the Ghetto by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.\n\n\u2014That I had, he said, pushing it by.\n\nThe shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.\n\n\u2014Them are two good ones, he said.\n\nOnions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.\n\nOn O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.\n\nMr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.\n\nHe opened it. Thought so.\n\nA woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.\n\nNo: she wouldn't like that much. Got her it once.\n\nHe read the other title: Sweets of Sin. More in her line. Let us see.\n\nHe read where his finger opened.\n\n\u2014All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For raoul!\n\nYes. This. Here. Try.\n\n\u2014Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her deshabill\u00e9.\n\nYes. Take this. The end.\n\n\u2014You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare. The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.\n\nMr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman.\n\nWarmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (for Him! For Raoul!). Armpits' oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (her heaving embonpoint!). Feel! Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!\n\nYoung! Young!\n\nAn elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.\n\nPhlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains. The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.\n\nMr Bloom beheld it.\n\nMastering his troubled breath, he said:\n\n\u2014I'll take this one.\n\nThe shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.\n\n\u2014Sweets of Sin, he said, tapping on it. That's a good one.\n\nThe lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.\n\nDilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.\n\nThe lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:\n\n\u2014Barang!\n\nBang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.\n\nMr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row. He halted near his daughter.\n\n\u2014It's time for you, she said.\n\n\u2014Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder? Melancholy God!\n\nDilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.\n\n\u2014Stand up straight, girl, he said. You'll get curvature of the spine. Do you know what you look like?\n\nHe let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.\n\n\u2014Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.\n\nMr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.\n\n\u2014Did you get any money? Dilly asked.\n\n\u2014Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.\n\n\u2014You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.\n\n\u2014How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.\n\nMr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James's street.\n\n\u2014I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?\n\n\u2014I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here.\n\nHe handed her a shilling.\n\n\u2014See if you can do anything with that, he said.\n\n\u2014I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.\n\n\u2014Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're like the rest of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. Low blackguardism! I'm going to get rid of you. Wouldn't care if I was stretched out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead.\n\nHe left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.\n\n\u2014Well, what is it? he said, stopping.\n\nThe lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.\n\n\u2014Barang!\n\n\u2014Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.\n\nThe lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly:\n\n\u2014Bang!\n\nMr Dedalus stared at him.\n\n\u2014Watch him, he said. It's instructive. I wonder will he allow us to talk.\n\n\u2014You got more than that, father, Dilly said.\n\n\u2014I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there's all I have. I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.\n\nHe drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.\n\n\u2014Can't you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.\n\nMr Dedalus thought and nodded.\n\n\u2014I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell street. I'll try this one now.\n\n\u2014You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning.\n\n\u2014Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something. I'll be home shortly.\n\nHe put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.\n\nThe viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.\n\n\u2014I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.\n\nThe lacquey banged loudly.\n\nMr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently:\n\n\u2014The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn't do anything! O, sure they wouldn't really! Is it little sister Monica!\n\nFrom the sundial towards James's gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James's street, past Shackleton's offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive. Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.\n\nI smiled at him. America, I said quietly, just like that. What is it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true? That's a fact.\n\nGraft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's always someone to pick it up.\n\nSaw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy appearance. Bowls them over.\n\n\u2014Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\n\n\u2014Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\n\nMr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street club toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.\n\nAham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road. Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.\n\nNorth wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.\n\nMr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course. Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash like that. Damn like him.\n\nAham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.\n\nDown there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope. Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife drove by in her noddy.\n\nBad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too. Fourbottle men.\n\nLet me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn down here. Make a detour.\n\nMr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin Distillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.\n\nDenis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.\n\nMr Kernan approached Island street.\n\nTimes of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly's. No cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.\n\nDamn good gin that was.\n\nFine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Masterly rendition.\nAt the siege of Ross did my father fall.\n\nA cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.\n\nMr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.\n\nHis Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a pity!\n\nStephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's fingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.\n\nBorn all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.\n\nShe dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.\n\nOld Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.\n\nAnd you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.\n\nTwo old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled.\n\nThe whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A look around.\n\nYes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say right, sir. A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed.\n\nStephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes' hearts.\n\nHe turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.\n\n\u2014Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.\n\nTattered pages. The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Cur\u00e9 of Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney.\n\nI might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. Stephano Dedalo, alumno optimo, palmam ferenti.\n\nFather Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.\n\nBinding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this. Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:\n\n\u2014Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen.\n\nWho wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's charms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your wool.\n\n\u2014What are you doing here, Stephen?\n\nDilly's high shoulders and shabby dress.\n\nShut the book quick. Don't let see.\n\n\u2014What are you doing? Stephen said.\n\nA Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. Nebrakada femininum.\n\n\u2014What have you there? Stephen asked.\n\n\u2014I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously. Is it any good?\n\nMy eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring. Shadow of my mind.\n\nHe took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal's French primer.\n\n\u2014What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?\n\nShe nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.\n\nShow no surprise. Quite natural.\n\n\u2014Here, Stephen said. It's all right. Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on you. I suppose all my books are gone.\n\n\u2014Some, Dilly said. We had to.\n\nShe is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.\n\nWe.\n\nAgenbite of inwit. Inwit's agenbite.\n\nMisery! Misery!\n\n\u2014Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\n\n\u2014Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\n\nThey clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.\n\n\u2014What's the best news? Mr Dedalus said.\n\n\u2014Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I'm barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.\n\n\u2014Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?\n\n\u2014O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.\n\n\u2014With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.\n\n\u2014The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm just waiting for Ben Dollard. He's going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.\n\nHe looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.\n\n\u2014I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He's always doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!\n\nHe put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.\n\n\u2014There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.\n\nBen Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.\n\nAs he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:\n\n\u2014Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.\n\n\u2014Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.\n\nMr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard's figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:\n\n\u2014That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day?\n\n\u2014Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.\n\nHe stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:\n\n\u2014They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.\n\n\u2014Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to God he's not paid yet.\n\n\u2014And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.\n\nCashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.\n\nBen Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth a deep note.\n\n\u2014Aw! he said.\n\n\u2014That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.\n\n\u2014What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?\n\nHe turned to both.\n\n\u2014That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.\n\nThe reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles.\n\nBen Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.\n\n\u2014Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He's a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He's well worth seeing, mind you. Come along. I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don't... Wait awhile... We're on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.\n\n\u2014For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.\n\nBen Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.\n\n\u2014What few days? he boomed. Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent?\n\n\u2014He has, Father Cowley said.\n\n\u2014Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the particulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?\n\n\u2014That's right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He's a minister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?\n\n\u2014You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.\n\nHe led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.\n\n\u2014Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.\n\n\u2014The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.\n\nThe policeman touched his forehead.\n\n\u2014God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.\n\nHe signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.\n\nBronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.\n\n\u2014Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.\n\n\u2014You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.\n\n\u2014Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.\n\nJohn Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.\n\nOn the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.\n\nThe castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.\n\n\u2014Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.\n\n\u2014Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the five shillings too.\n\n\u2014Without a second word either, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.\n\nJohn Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.\n\n\u2014I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.\n\nThey went down Parliament street.\n\n\u2014There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's.\n\n\u2014Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.\n\nOutside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.\n\nJohn Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches.\n\n\u2014The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.\n\nThey followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.\n\n\u2014And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.\n\nThe tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.\n\n\u2014Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.\n\nLong John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.\n\n\u2014Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.\n\nHell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him. Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.\n\nLong John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.\n\nMartin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.\n\n\u2014What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.\n\nJimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.\n\n\u2014O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness' sake till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!\n\nTestily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning's flank and passed in and up the stairs.\n\n\u2014Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don't think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.\n\nWith John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.\n\n\u2014Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.\n\n\u2014Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nLong John Fanning could not remember him.\n\nClatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.\n\n\u2014What's that? Martin Cunningham said.\n\nAll turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.\n\n\u2014What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.\n\n\u2014The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.\n\nAs they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines:\n\n\u2014Parnell's brother. There in the corner.\n\nThey chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.\n\n\u2014Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mulligan said. That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.\n\nJohn Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.\n\n\u2014I'll take a m\u00e9lange, Haines said to the waitress.\n\n\u2014Two m\u00e9langes, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.\n\nWhen she had gone he said, laughing:\n\n\u2014We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed Dedalus on Hamlet.\n\nHaines opened his newbought book.\n\n\u2014I'm sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.\n\nThe onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:\n\n\u2014England expects...\n\nBuck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.\n\n\u2014You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering Aengus I call him.\n\n\u2014I am sure he has an id\u00e9e fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be. Such persons always have.\n\nBuck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.\n\n\u2014They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet. The joy of creation...\n\n\u2014Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It's rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.\n\nBuck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to unload her tray.\n\n\u2014He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does he write anything for your movement?\n\nHe sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.\n\n\u2014Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write something in ten years.\n\n\u2014Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all.\n\nHe tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.\n\n\u2014This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don't want to be imposed on.\n\nElijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks.\n\nAlmidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard. Behind him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.\n\nCashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.\n\nAt the corner of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke's lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth bared he muttered:\n\n\u2014Coactus volui.\n\nHe strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.\n\nAs he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.\n\n\u2014God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You're blinder nor I am, you bitch's bastard!\n\nOpposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.\n\nAfter Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns. Gob, that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh, that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That's me in mourning. When is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.\n\nMaster Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.\n\nIn Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.\n\nNo Sandymount tram.\n\nMaster Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I'm in mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight. Then they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's name.\n\nHis face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.\n\nPa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be a good son to ma. I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he's in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.\n\nWilliam Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.\n\nThe cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl's a Yorkshire girl.\n\nBlazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the cort\u00e8ge:\n\nBut though she's a factory lass\nAnd wears no fancy clothes.\nBaraabum.\nYet I've a sort of a\nYorkshire relish for\nMy little Yorkshire rose.\nBaraabum.\n\nThither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H. Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson, C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn's hotel Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street by Trinity's postern a loyal king's man, Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer's hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent's. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy's path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing door.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/2414006", "artist_names": "Fargo (T.V Series)", "full_title": "Waiting for Dutch by\u00a0Fargo\u00a0(T.V Series)", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/9f8d0bba326728a4dd75a4fb2ff7c849.300x200x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/9f8d0bba326728a4dd75a4fb2ff7c849.610x407x1.jpg", "id": 2414006, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 320737, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1464211580, "path": "/Fargo-tv-series-waiting-for-dutch-annotated", "pyongs_count": 4, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Fargo-tv-series-waiting-for-dutch-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2015, "month": 10, "day": 25}, "release_date_for_display": "October 25, 2015", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Oct. 25, 2015", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/9f8d0bba326728a4dd75a4fb2ff7c849.300x200x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/9f8d0bba326728a4dd75a4fb2ff7c849.610x407x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Waiting for Dutch", "title_with_featured": "Waiting for Dutch", "updated_by_human_at": 1464211580, "url": "https://genius.com/Fargo-tv-series-waiting-for-dutch-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/639147", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/16fbe4718edef2d666978bdfe13070b3.250x158x1.png", "id": 639147, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/16fbe4718edef2d666978bdfe13070b3.250x158x1.png", "index_character": "f", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Fargo (T.V Series)", "slug": "Fargo-tv-series", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Fargo-tv-series"}, "artist": "Fargo (T.V Series)", "lyrics": "Waiting for Dutch LyricsEXT.

He whistles to his brother Bear, signaling him to get off the chair he\u2019s sitting on. Bear stands up, but blocks Dodd\u2019s way. Dodd slightly shoves Bear as he moves to the chair. Bear walks over to a shelf nearby and picks off a piece of bread.\n\nOTTO (to Dodd and Bear): Soon as you ladies are done dancing\u2014\n\nFloyd: You're right. We're light, even though the transport dollars went up.

Otto is lying in bed being tended to by Floyd. Bear is in the kitchen picking at food from the fridge.\nEXT. WAFFLE HUT- NIGHT\nRye parks his car in front of the restaurant. He sniffs cocaine off his left hand, while remembering Dodd saying to him: \u201cYou're the comic in a piece of bubble gum!\u201d He sees the judge through a window taking a seat at a table.\nINT. WAFFLE HUT- NIGHT\nRye enters the Waffle Hut. He stares at the judge seated at the table. Rye walks over to take a seat by the counter. He wipes his nose with a napkin and puts it in an ashtray. He turns his head to look at the judge.\n\nWAITRESS: Special's tuna melt and fries. Pie is humbleberry.\n\nRYE: Just coffee.\n\nRye sees a black cook in the kitchen looking at the customers orders. The waitress pours Rye a cup of coffee. He looks back to the judge.  There is a family at the table next to the judge chatting.\n\nMAN: Everything\u2019s taken care of, see? They didn\u2019t even charge us for the fries.\n\nWAITRESS (to Rye): Sugar?\n\nRYE: Uh, you know, you're freaking me out a little.\n\nThe waitress leaves the sugar by Rye and walks away to clean the counters. Rye takes the sugar and pours it into his coffee. He sips it. He turns his attention back to the judge.\n\nMAN: Honey, I don\u2019t know about your day, but my day was crazy\u2026 he squeezes and the mustard goes all over his shirt. And he now has no shirt to wear, so now\u2026\n\nThere is laughter coming from the family at the table next to the judge. Everyone there then leaves.\n\nMAN: I got to pay up. I'll meet you at the cash register.\n\nFamily walks out of the restaurant, with the man paying at the register. Rye continues to stare at the judge.\n\nWAITRESS: How was everything?\n\nMAN: Oh, yeah. Real good.\n\nWAITRESS: Oh, good.  I'll get your change.\n\nCash register dings\n\nWAITRESS: There you are.\n\nMAN: Thanks.\n\nCut to Rye walking to the Judges table and sitting opposite from her.\n\nRYE: Hi.\n\nJUDGE: No.\n\nRYE: What do you mean, \"No?\"\n\nJUDGE: Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying.\n\nThe judge looks at her burger and signals for the waitress.\n\nRYE: First of all, I'm not selling anything. And second--\n\nThe waitress arrives at the table\n\nJUDGE: He needs to make me another burger. This one's a coaster.\n\nWAITRESS: Yes, ma'am.\n\nThe waitress takes the plate and walks away.\n\nRYE: Hey. Your majesty. You're gonna change your mind about\nsomething- a case.\n\nJUDGE: Or what?\n\nRYE: Or you'll find out, is what. This isn't one of those optional check \"A\" or \"B\" scenarios. I'm gonna change your mind.\n\nJudge (sighing): One day, the Devil came to God and said, \"Let's make a bet between you and me for the soul of a man.\" And from on high they looked down on Job, a devout man, religious. And the Devil said, \"I can change his mind and make him curse your name. \" And God said, \"Try and you will only fail.\" So the Devil begins. He kills Job's herds and takes his fields. He plagues him with boils and throws him on the ash heap. But Job's mind remains unchanged. So I ask you, son, if the Devil couldn't change Job's mind, how the hell are you gonna change mine?\n\nRYE: What?\n\nJUDGE: You're a little dim, aren't you?\n\nRYE: Listen, this is-- There's two ways this can go-\n\nJUDGE: Is one of them the hard way?\n\nRYE: Easy\u2014(pounds table) --- You know what? There's a fella who needs to get his hands on some typewriters.\n\nJUDGE: Ugh. Christ. You're with that fool.\n\nRYE: And you're gonna- Yeah. You\u2019re-\n\nThe judge looks into her purse and pulls out bug spray\n\nJUDGE: Son, you have three second to pick your ass up and get out of here, or I'm gonna squash you like a bug.\n\nRYE (laughing): Okay, look, bitch-- I'm the one do\u2014\n\nThe judge sprays Rye\u2019s face.\n\nRYE (gagging): God damn, my eyes!\n\nRye stands in agony\n\nJUDGE: Now scram before I call the cops!\n\nRye pulls his gun out of his coat\n\nJUDGE: Oh, crap.\n\nRye shoots the judge. The cook in the kitchen sees this, grabs\na pan, and quickly runs out the door leading to the dining area. He screams and charges towards Rye with the pan in hand, but Rye shoots him down before he could reach him. The waitress behind Rye screams in a panic and drops the coffee picture, shattering it. She is also shot down. Rye is breathing heavily. The judge surprisingly rises up from behind Rye and stabs him in the back with a knife. Rye grunts at the wound, then turns and fires three more rounds at the judge. The judge falls back and lands on the table, her blood spilling out and colliding with a spilled glass of milk. Rye is in pain from his knife wound. Struggling, he pulls out the knife from his back.\nCut to Rye stealing from the cash register. He is alerted by the door bell. He walks over to find the waitress gone.\n\nRYE: Shhh- Shit!\n\nEXT. WAFFLE HUT- NIGHT\nRye sees the wounded waitress walking away, struggling to escape.\n\nRYE: Sh- Shit!\n\nRye pulls out his gun and walks up closer to shoot the waitress, but he is out of ammo.\n\nRYE: Shit! Shhhhhit!\n\nRye reloads. He shoots the waitress, and she drops dead in the snow. Rye runs up to the fallen body, gun still pointed at her. He breathes heavily, looking panicked with what to do.  A bright light captures Rye\u2019s attention. He walks over closer to where the light is approaching. The light comes closer, revealing itself to be a UFO. Rye stares at it in awe. The UFO stops for a few seconds to where Rye is before speeding off in the distance. Still distracted by what he saw, he is struck unaware by an incoming car from behind. The car halts to an immediate stop, and we see an unconscious Rye jammed in the windshield headfirst. The car drives off.\nINT. SOLVERSONE RESIDENCE\nLou is reading his daughter Molly a bedtime story as the camera scans various rooms in the house, such as the dining room where unfinished dinner plates, glasses, and silverware are still on the table, and the living room which looks messy with toys and the like scattered around. Betsy is carrying a laundry basket with clean clothes upstairs and puts some clothes in a drawer. The telephone rings.\n\nLOU (laughing): \"'Oh, whocky!' Cried Joel. 'See what you've done, Polly Pepper?' but Polly didn't hear. Over the big, flat door-stone she sped and met Ben with Little David coming in the gate. His face was just like Phronsie's! And with a cold, heavy feeling at her heart, Polly realized this was no play. 'Oh, Ben!' She cried, flinging her arms around his neck and bursting into tears. 'Don't! Please. I-I wish you wouldn't. Phronsie's got 'em, and that's enough. 'Got what?' Asked Ben, while Davie's eyes grew to their widest proportions. 'Oh, measles!' Cried Polly, bursting out afresh. 'Hatefulest, horridest measles! And now you're taken!' 'Oh, no, I ain't,' responded Ben cheerfully, who knew what measles were. 'Wipe up, Polly. I'm all right.\"'Only my head aches and my eyes feel funny. ' Polly, only half reassured, gulped down her sobs and the sorrowful trio repaired to mother. 'Oh, dear me,' ejaculated Mrs. Pepper, sinking in a chair at the dismay at the sight of Ben's red face. 'Whatever will we do now?'\"\n\nLou turns the book to look at the front\n\nThis is a funny book, huh? Yeah.\n\nMOLLY: Yeah.\n\nBETSY: Phone call, hon. It's the shop.\n\nLOU: Okay, you (kisses Molly) Sleep, huh?\n\nMOLLY: OKAY\n\nBETSY: I'll be back in a minute to tuck you in.\n\nMOLLY: Okay.\n\nINT. SOLVERSONE RESIDENCE- DOWNSTAIRS\n\nBETSY: Murder, Eunice says. Three of them over at the Waffle\nHut.\n\nLOU (sighing): Hey, uh, you-- you had your thing today.\n\nBETSY: Yeah.

Tell him not to go inside. Hank on his way?\n\nSpeaking indistinctly\n\nLOU: Okay. You too.\n\nHangs up phone.\n\nLOU: Got to go, hon. You okay getting her to bed?\n\nBETSY: Yeah. She's six, not, you know, Pol Pot.\n\nLOU: Okay. Call if you need, you know, whatever.\n\nBETSY: Mm-hmm.\n\nEXT. WAFFLE HUT- NIGHT\nLou parks at the restaurant, where he meets a man.\n\nMAN: I left my rig there. I hope that's okay. I'm the one who\ncalled it in, see? Stopped for waffles, you know? With the blueberries. They come frozen this time of year, I know-\n\nLou follows a trail blood leading away from the restaurant, finding the dead waitress at the spot she was shot down by Rye.\n\nMAN: - but I-I put my coat on her. It seemed only right.\n\nLou lifts a part of the coat off her.\n\nLOU: Yeah.\n\nMAN: \"Yeah,\" it's okay about the coat, or\u2026?\n\nINT. WAFFLE HUT- NIGHT\nLou enters the restaurant and sees the blood splatter on the floor and two dead bodies. He puts the flashlight away. He continues scanning the scene, and sees the empty cash register open.\n\nLOU (sighing): Yeah.\n\nLou walks over to where the judge\u2019s dead body is. He takes out a pen and notepad. The doorbell rings and a man in police uniform enters. Lou nods at the man, who is the sheriff.\n\nHANK: Well, this is a deal.\n\nLOU: I count three dead.\n\nHANK: Saw the waitress in the parking lot?\n\nLOU: Mm. I think she caught one there, then staggered out. Gunman followed, made things permanent.\n\nHank shines his flashlight on the dead cook and approaches him.\n\nHANK: That's Henry Blanton. Got the single-season touchdown record in 10th grade. 31. Still stands.\n\nLou flashes his light on the judge\u2019s body.\n\nHANK: Yeah. Don't know her.\n\nLOU: North Dakota plates on a Mercedes outside.\n\nHANK: Tourist, you're thinking?\n\nLOU: Mm.\n\nHANK: How's Betsy?\n\nLOU: You mean you didn't call her before you came over?\n\nHANK: Well, yeah. Just being polite. Give you a chance to talk\nabout your feelings, should you be so disposed.\n\nLOU: She's good. Yeah. Ordered this kit of recipe cards. Saw it on the TV. So now every night, we eat delicacies of the world.\n\nHANK: Mm. Some men like that. Variety.\n\nLOU: Mm. She put a souffl\u00e9 on the table last night-- perfectly good casserole-- and lit it on fire with a kitchen match.\n\nHANK: Huh?\n\nLOU: Oh, which reminds me-- you're invited for dinner\ntomorrow.\n\nHANK: 6:00?\n\nLOU: Mm-hmm.\n\nHank (inhaling sharply): I'll bring a suit of armor.\n\nCamera lingers over the dead cook.\nEXT. WAFFLE HUT- NIGHT\nHank and Lou are inspecting the road.\n\nLOU: Skid marks.\n\nHANK: Yeah. I see them. 'Course, connecting those to this deal here would be what we call \"jumping to a conclusion.\u201d Based on the number of bodies, I'm thinking we've got one car too many in the parking lot.\n\nSplit-screen- the right half shows an object covered in snow while the left shows Lou walking over towards it. It is revealed to be a dollar-bill covered in blood.\n\nLOU: Yeah. So, the shooter's got a wound or two in him from the steak knife. Two blood trails lead out. One to the waitress, now deceased. The other to the road here, where he absconds, leaving a few dollars behind.\n\nHANK Uh-huh. Why not take his own car?\n\nLOU: Unclear at this time.\n\nHank spots something up above.\n\nHANK: There's a shoe in that tree.\n\nLOU: There sure is.\n\nHANK: So, uh, this a local matter or do the State Police want it?\n\nLOU: We do not.\n\nHANK (chuckling): Local matter it is.\n\nLOU: And, of course, any support the State can provide.\n\nHANK: Yeah, of course. See you tomorrow night, then, eh?\n\nLOU: 6:00. Be ready for anything.\n\nLou walks away.\n\nHANK: That's a shoe, all right.\n\nINT.

Ho Chi Minh was just a front man. Enemy number one straight out of central casting. AKA a stuffed shirt for the military industrial complex.\n\nSONNY: The what's that, now?\n\nKARL: Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Ike's farewell address? The military industrial complex.

Racist pricks.\n\nLOU: It's a diner robbery in Minnesota, Karl. Not a presidential\nassassination.\n\nKARL: Oh, sure. That's how it starts-- with something small like a break-in at the Watergate Hotel. But just watch. This thing's only getting bigger.\n\nBJORN: G-53. G-53.\n\nLOU: Well, I better get home. Betsy had her chemo today.\n\nKARL: God!\n\nKarl smashes his fist against the table.\n\nSONNY: What is it, Karl?\n\nKARL: It's just-- God damn. Unacceptable is what it is. A woman like that in the prime of her. With a young daughter. Tell her if John McCain could hold out for 5 1/2 years against Viet Cong thumbscrews, she can beat this cancer bullshit in her sleep.\n\nLOU: I'll make sure to mention that.\n\nLou takes his leave.\nEXT.

I'm-- I'm such a bumble sometimes.\n\nAnother thump in the distance.\n\nED: What the heck?\n\nPeggy grabs hold of Ed affectionately.\n\nPEGGY: I-I love you, too, hon, so, so much.

I better go see what that\u2014\n\nCut to Ed heading to the garage.\n\nPEGGY: We can-- I'll wear that nightie you like.\n\nPeggy nervously cups her hands to her face. Ed turns on the garage light, revealing a car with a large hole windshield, stained with blood.\n\nEd: What the-- Hon?\n\nPeggy slowly takes a look at the car.\n\nPEGGY: Didn't I tell you? I kind of hit a deer.\n\nED: You hit a-- Are you-- you okay?\n\nPEGGY: Yeah, no, I-I'm just, you know, shook up, mostly.\n\nEd walks closer to the car.\n\nED: Geez.

Can we go in the kitchen?\n\nThere is heavy breathing accompanying the thumps.\n\nED: Heck, hon, did you bring the deer home?\n\nEd moves closer to where the noise is coming from.\n\nPEGGY: Hon, don't.\n\nEd walks to a small narrow part of the garage. He taps his flashlight continuously to get it working and see what is making that sound. the flashlight flickers on and off, revealing a figure in the corner.\n\nPEGGY: Hon, don't.\n\nEd continues tapping the flashlight.\n\nPEGGY: Hon! Come back! Don't.\n\nThe flashlight finally turns on fully.\n\nED: Ah, geez. T-there's a-- It's a man. There's a man in the\u2014\n\nThe deranged man charges at Ed with a knife in hand. A struggle ensues. Ed pushes the man back into a stack of tires. He grabs a garden knife out of a bag of fertilizer close by him. The man charges at Ed again, but Ed manages to stab him with the garden knife in the abdomen. Ed pulls it out and the man falls dead on the ground, covered in blood. Ed is panting heavily.\n\nED: Oh, my God. Oh-- oh, my God.\n\nPeggy walks over to Ed and puts a hand on his shoulder.\n\nPEGGY: Hon.\n\nEd is caught off guard and accidentally elbows Peggy\u2019s head.\n\nED: Geez, hon. Sorry.

You-- you said a deer.\n\nThe flashback shows Peggy getting out of the car and looking around nervously. She gets back in the car. The blood leaking out of Rye\u2019s head is dripping on the car seat, where Peggy\u2019s stuff is at. She whimpers and moves her stuff away from the blood.\n\nED: You hit him. Why-- why didn't you go to the police or the hospital?\n\nPEGGY: He ran out into the road, hon. What was I supposed to do?\n\nED: Yeah, so-- so you brought him home, made dinner-- Hamburger Helper.\n\nThe flashback shows Peggy arriving at the house, pulling up in the garage with Rye still stuck in the window. She turned off the garage light. The split-screen appears focusing on Peggy trying to clean herself up.\nPEGGY: I panicked, okay?\n\nED: We-- we got to call the police. Why didn't you call the police?\n\nPEGGY: - No.\n\nED: - We gotta-- Maybe he's not\u2014\n\nPEGGY: No, no. No. I-- I-- Hon, listen to me. I ran over him. Hit and run.

You-- Then, hon, look at me. If we're gonna get clear of this, then we're gonna have to clean it up. Pretend it didn't happen.\n\nEd and Peggy sit on the steps.\n\nPEGGY: 'Cause if this comes out, if this-- then all the things you want, that we want-- that's over. (Scoffs) I go to jail and maybe you also. And then there's no shop and no family. No kids.\n\nED: Okay. Okay, then. We-- we clean it up.\n\nPEGGY: We clean it up.\n\nINT.

KANSAS CITY HEADQUARTERS\nA projection on the wall reading KANSAS CITY NORTHERN EXPANSION STRATEGY 1979-1980.\n\nJOE: So, as you see on page 16 of the prospectus, the main component of our Northern expansion strategy involves the absorption of the Gerhardt Family Syndicate (next slide shows the Gerhardt household.) headquartered in Fargo, ND.\n\nThe projection changes to a map. Joe stands.\n\nJOE: Now, the Gerhardts control trucking and distribution for the entire Northern Midwest. It's a family business started in 1931 by Dieter Gerhardt (next slide changes to a picture of the aforementioned name.)\n\nMike Milligan lights a cigar and starts smoking.\n\nJOE: Now deceased, and taken over in 1950 by his son Otto (next slide is a picture of Otto.) Now, not in the report but of relevance to this meeting, Old Otto had a stroke yesterday in the family compound in North Dakota.\n\nHAMISH BROKER: Leaving who in charge?\n\nJOE: Unclear. (Next slide is a picture of Floyd) His wife, Floyd, she's tough, but, you know, a girl. And then there are the three sons\u2014(Next slide is a picture of the three brothers, from right to left) Dodd, Bear, and Rye. And of course they all want their shot at the throne, which the boys in Research think provides a tactical opportunity for us to move aggressively to acquire or absorb their operation.\n\nHAMISH BROKER: And if you can't\u2026 and the current business owners resist?\n\nJOE: We liquidate.\n\nNext slide is a white page.\nSilence for a moment\n\nHAMISH BROKER: Approved.\n\n[End Credits]4Embed"},

LyricsHENCE loathed Melancholy\nOf Cerberus, and blackest midnight born,\nIn Stygian Cave forlorn\n'Mongst horrid shapes, and shreiks, and sights unholy,\nFind out som uncouth cell,\nWhere brooding darknes spreads his jealous wings,\nAnd the night-Raven sings;\nThere under Ebon shades and low-brow'd Rocks,\nAs ragged as thy Locks,\nIn dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell.\nBut com thou Goddes fair and free,\nIn Heav'n ycleap'd Euphrosyne,\nAnd by men, heart-easing Mirth,\nWhom lovely Venus at a birth\nWith two sister Graces more\nTo Ivy-crowned Bacchus bore;\nOr whether (as som Sager sing)\nThe frolick Wind that breathes the Spring,\nZephir with Aurora playing,\nAs he met her once a Maying,\nThere on Beds of Violets blew,\nAnd fresh-blown Roses washt in dew,\nFill'd her with thee a daughter fair,\nSo bucksom, blith, and debonair.\nHaste thee nymph, and bring with thee\nJest and youthful Jollity,\nQuips and Cranks, and wanton Wiles,\nNods, and Becks, and Wreathed Smiles,\nSuch as hang on Hebe's cheek,\nAnd love to live in dimple sleek;\nSport that wrincled Care derides,\nAnd Laughter holding both his sides.\nCom, and trip it as ye go\nOn the light fantastick toe,\nAnd in thy right hand lead with thee,\nThe Mountain Nymph, sweet Liberty;\nAnd if I give thee honour due,\nMirth, admit me of thy crue\nTo live with her, and live with thee,\nIn unreproved pleasures free;\nTo hear the Lark begin his flight,\nAnd singing startle the dull night,\nFrom his watch-towre in the skies,\nTill the dappled dawn doth rise;\nThen to com in spight of sorrow,\nAnd at my window bid good morrow,\nThrough the Sweet-Briar, or the Vine,\nOr the twisted Eglantine.\nWhile the Cock with lively din,\nScatters the rear of darknes thin,\nAnd to the stack, or the Barn dore,\nStoutly struts his Dames before,\nOft list'ning how the Hounds and horn\nChearly rouse the slumbring morn,\nFrom the side of som Hoar Hill,\nThrough the high wood echoing shrill.\nSom time walking not unseen\nBy Hedge-row Elms, on Hillocks green,\nRight against the Eastern gate,\nWher the great Sun begins his state,\nRob'd in flames, and Amber light,\nThe clouds in thousand Liveries dight.\nWhile the Plowman neer at hand,\nWhistles ore the Furrow'd Land,\nAnd the Milkmaid singeth blithe,\nAnd the Mower whets his sithe,\nAnd every Shepherd tells his tale\nUnder the Hawthorn in the dale.\nStreit mine eye hath caught new pleasures\nWhilst the Lantskip round it measures,\nRusset Lawns, and Fallows Gray,\nWhere the nibling flocks do stray,\nMountains on whose barren brest\nThe labouring clouds do often rest:\nMeadows trim with Daisies pide,\nShallow Brooks, and Rivers wide.\nTowers, and Battlements it sees\nBoosom'd high in tufted Trees,\nWher perhaps som beauty lies,\nThe Cynosure of neighbouring eyes.\nHard by, a Cottage chimney smokes,\nFrom betwixt two aged Okes,\nWhere Corydon and Thyrsis met,\nAre at their savory dinner set\nOf Hearbs, and other Country Messes,\nWhich the neat-handed Phillis dresses;\nAnd then in haste her Bowre she leaves,\nWith Thestylis to bind the Sheaves;\nOr if the earlier season lead\nTo the tann'd Haycock in the Mead,\nSom times with secure delight\nThe up-land Hamlets will invite,\nWhen the merry Bells ring round,\nAnd the jocond rebecks sound\nTo many a youth, and many a maid,\nDancing in the Chequer'd shade;\nAnd young and old com forth to play\nOn a Sunshine Holyday,\nTill the live-long day-light fail,\nThen to the Spicy Nut-brown Ale,\nWith stories told of many a feat,\nHow Faery Mab the junkets eat,\nShe was pincht, and pull'd she sed,\nAnd he by Friars Lanthorn led\nTells how the drudging Goblin swet,\nTo ern his Cream-bowle duly set,\nWhen in one night, ere glimps of morn,\nHis shadowy Flale hath thresh'd the Corn\nThat ten day-labourers could not end,\nThen lies him down the Lubbar Fend.\nAnd stretch'd out all the Chimney's length,\nBasks at the fire his hairy strength;\nAnd Crop-full out of dores he flings,\nEre the first Cock his Mattin rings.\nThus don the Tales, to bed they creep,\nBy whispering Windes soon lull'd asleep.\nTowred Cities please us then,\nAnd the busie humm of men,\nWhere throngs of Knights and Barons bold,\nIn weeds of Peace high triumphs hold,\nWith store of Ladies, whose bright eies\nRain influence, and judge the prise\nOf Wit, or Arms, while both contend\nTo win her Grace, whom all commend.\nThere let Hymen oft appear\nIn Saffron robe, with Taper clear,\nAnd pomp, and feast, and revelry,\nWith mask, and antique Pageantry,\nSuch sights as youthfull Poets dream\nOn Summer eeves by haunted stream.\nThen to the well-trod stage anon,\nIf Jonsons learned Sock be on,\nOr sweetest Shakespear fancies childe,\nWarble his native Wood-notes wilde,\nAnd ever against eating Cares,\nLap me in soft Lydian Aires,\nMarried to immortal verse\nSuch as the meeting soul may pierce\nIn notes, with many a winding bout\nOf lincked sweetnes long drawn out,\nWith wanton heed, and giddy cunning,\nThe melting voice through mazes running;\nUntwisting all the chains that ty\nThe hidden soul of harmony.\nThat Orpheus self may heave his head\nFrom golden slumber on a bed\nOf heapt Elysian flowres, and hear\nSuch streins as would have won the ear\nOf Pluto, to have quite set free\nHis half regain'd Eurydice.\nThese delights, if thou canst give,\nMirth with thee, I mean to live.3Embed"},

This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\nBut one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.\nIn a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned.\nInstead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\" But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. 1963 is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\n\nBut there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.\n\nWe must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. They have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.\nAs we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied, as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating \"For Whites Only.\" We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\n\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.\n\nGo back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.\n\nI say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.\"\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\nI have a dream today.\nI have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\n\nThis is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\n\nThis will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, \"My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.\"\n\nAnd if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!\nLet freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!\n\nLet freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California!\n\nBut not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!\n\nLet freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!\n\nLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.\n\nAnd when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, \"Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\"184Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2054473", "artist_names": "The Delfonics",

you\n[Verse 2]\nI just want to know about\nThe rooms behind your minds\nDo I see a vacuum there\nOr am I going blind?\nOr is it just uh, remains from vibrations\nAnd echoes long ago\nThings like \"Love the World\"\nAnd uh, \"Let your fancy Flow\"\n\n[Chorus]\nIs this true?\nPlease let me talk to you\nLet me talk to you\n\n[Verse 3]\nI have lived here before, the days of ice\nAnd of course this is why I'm so concerned\nAnd I come back to find the stars misplaced\nAnd the smell of a world that has burned\nA smell of the world that has burned\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah well, maybe\nMaybe it's just a change of climate\nI can dig it\nI can dig it baby, I just want to see\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nSo where do I purchase my ticket?\nI would just like to have a ringside seat\nI want to know

Martin", "lyrics": "A Dance With Dragons: Part 1 Dreams And Dust LyricsTYRION\n\nHe drank his way across the narrow sea.\n\nThe ship was small, his cabin smaller, but the captain would not allow him abovedecks. The rocking of the deck beneath his feet made his stomach heave, and the wretched food tasted even worse when retched back up. But why did he need salt beef, hard cheese, and bread crawling with worms when he had wine to nourish him? It was red and sour, very strong. Sometimes he heaved the wine up too, but there was always more.\n\n\u201cThe world is full of wine,\u201d he muttered in the dankness of his cabin. His father never had any use for drunkards, but what did that matter? His father was dead. He\u2019d killed him. A bolt in the belly, my lord, and all for you. If only I was better with a crossbow, I would have put it through that cock you made me with, you bloody bastard.\n\nBelowdecks, there was neither night nor day. Tyrion marked time by the comings and goings of the cabin boy who brought the meals he did not eat. The boy always brought a brush and bucket too, to clean up. \u201cIs this Dornish wine?\u201d Tyrion asked him once, as he pulled a stopper from a skin. \u201cIt reminds me of a certain snake I knew. A droll fellow, till a mountain fell on him.\u201d\n\nThe cabin boy did not answer. He was an ugly boy, though admittedly more comely than a certain dwarf with half a nose and a scar from eye to chin. \u201cHave I offended you?\u201d Tyrion asked, as the boy was scrubbing. \u201cWere you commanded not to talk to me? Or did some dwarf diddle your mother?\u201d That went unanswered too.\nWhere are we sailing? Tell me that.\u201d Jaime had made mention of the Free Cities, but had never said which one. \u201cIs it Braavos? Tyrosh? Myr?\u201d Tyrion would sooner have gone to Dorne. Myrcella is older than Tommen, by Dornish law the Iron Throne is hers. I will help her claim her rights, as Prince Oberyn suggested.\nOberyn was dead, though, his head smashed to bloody ruin by the armored fist of Ser Gregor Clegane. And without the Red Viper to urge him on, would Doran Martell even consider such a chancy scheme? He might clap me in chains instead and hand me back to my sweet sister. The Wall might be safer. Old Bear Mormont said the Night\u2019s Watch had need of men like Tyrion. Mormont might be dead, though. By now Slynt may be the lord commander. That butcher\u2019s son was not like to have forgotten who sent him to the Wall. Do I really want to spend the rest of my life eating salt beef and porridge with murderers and thieves? Not that the rest of his life would last very long. Janos Slynt would see to that.\n\nThe cabin boy wet his brush and scrubbed on manfully.\n\n\u201cHave you ever visited the pleasure houses of Lys?\u201d the dwarf inquired. \u201cMight that be where whores go?\u201d Tyrion could not seem to recall the Valyrian word for whore, and in any case it was too late. The boy tossed his brush back in his bucket and took his leave.\n\nThe wine has blurred my wits. He had learned to read High Valyrian at his maester\u2019s knee, though what they spoke in the Nine Free Cities \u2026 well, it was not so much a dialect as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues. Tyrion had some Braavosi and a smattering of Myrish. In Tyrosh he should be able to curse the gods, call a man a cheat, and order up an ale, thanks to a sellsword he had once known at the Rock. At least in Dorne they speak the Common Tongue Like Dornish food and Dornish law, Dornish speech was spiced with the flavors of the Rhoyne, but a man could comprehend it. Dorne, yes, Dorne for me. He crawled into his bunk, clutching that thought like a child with a doll.\n\nSleep had never come easily to Tyrion Lannister. Aboard that ship it seldom came at all, though from time to time he managed to drink sufficient wine to pass out for a while. At least he did not dream. He had dreamed enough for one small life. And of such follies: love, justice, friendship, glory. As well the dream of being tall. It was all beyond his reach, Tyrion knew now. But he did not know where whores go.\n\n\u201cWherever whores go,\u201d his father had said. His last words, and what words they were.  The crossbow thrummed, Lord Tywin sat back down, and Tyrion Lannister found himself waddling through the darkness with Varys at his side. He must have clambered back down the shaft, two hundred and thirty rungs to where orange embers glowed in the mouth of an iron dragon. He remembered none of it. Only the sound the crossbow made, and the stink of his father\u2019s bowels opening. Even in his dying, he found a way to shit on me.\n\nVarys had escorted him through the tunnels, but they never spoke until they emerged beside the Blackwater, where Tyrion had won a famous victory and lost a nose.\n\nThat was when the dwarf turned to the eunuch and said, \u201cI\u2019ve killed my father,\u201d in the same tone a man might use to say,\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve stubbed my toe.\u201d\n\nThe master of whisperers had been dressed as a begging brother, in a moth-eaten robe of brown roughspun with a cowl that shadowed his smooth fat cheeks and bald round head. \u201cYou should not have climbed that ladder,\u201d he said reproachfully.\n\n\u201cWherever whores go.\u201d Tyrion had warned his father not to say that word. If I had not loosed, he would have seen my threats were empty. He would have taken the crossbow from my hands, as once he took Tysha from my arms. He was rising when I killed him.\n\n\u201cI killed Shae too,\u201d he confessed to Varys.\n\n\u201cYou knew what she was.\u201d\n\u201cI did. But I never knew what he was.\u201d\n\nVarys tittered. \u201cAnd now you do.\u201d\n\nI should have killed the eunuch as well. A little more blood on his hands, what would it matter? He could not say what had stayed his dagger. Not gratitude. Varys had saved him from a headsman\u2019s sword, but only because Jaime had compelled him. Jaime \u2026 no, better not to think of Jaime.\n\nHe found a fresh skin of wine instead and sucked at it as if it were a woman\u2019s breast. The sour red ran down his chin and soaked through his soiled tunic, the same one he had been wearing in his cell. The deck was swaying beneath his feet, and when he tried to rise it lifted sideways and smashed him hard against a bulkhead. A storm, he realized, or else I am even drunker than I knew. He retched the wine up and lay in it a while, wondering if the ship would sink. Is this your vengeance, Father? Has the Father Above made you his Hand? \u201cSuch are the wages of the kinslayer,\u201d he said as the wind howled outside. It did not seem fair to drown the cabin boy and the captain and all the rest for something he had done, but when had the gods ever been fair? And around about then, the darkness gulped him down.\n\nWhen he stirred again, his head felt like to burst and the ship was spinning round in dizzy circles, though the captain was insisting that they\u2019d come to port. Tyrion told him to be quiet and kicked feebly as a huge bald sailor tucked him under one arm and carried him squirming to the hold, where an empty wine cask awaited him. It was a squat little cask, and a tight fit even for a dwarf. Tyrion pissed himself in his struggles, for all the good it did. He was crammed face-first into the cask with his knees pushed up against his ears. The stub of his nose itched horribly, but his arms were pinned so tightly that he could not reach to scratch it. A palanquin fit for a man of my stature, he thought as they hammered shut the lid. He could hear voices shouting as he was hoisted up. Every bounce cracked his head against the bottom of the cask. The world went round and round as the cask rolled downward, then stopped with a crash that made him want to scream. Another cask slammed into his, and Tyrion bit his tongue.\n\nThat was the longest journey he had ever taken, though it could not have lasted more than half an hour. He was lifted and lowered, rolled and stacked, upended and righted and rolled again. Through the wooden staves he heard men shouting, and once a horse whickered nearby. His stunted legs began to cramp, and soon hurt so badly that he forgot the hammering in his head.\n\nIt ended as it had begun, with another roll that left him dizzy and more jouncing. Outside, strange voices were speaking in a tongue he did not know. Someone started pounding on the top of the cask and the lid cracked open suddenly. Light came flooding in, and cool air as well. Tyrion gasped greedily and tried to stand, but only managed to knock the cask over sideways and spill himself out onto a hard-packed earthen floor.\n\nAbove him loomed a grotesque fat man with a forked yellow beard, holding a wooden mallet and an iron chisel. His bedrobe was large enough to serve as a tourney pavilion, but its loosely knotted belt had come undone, exposing a huge white belly and a pair of heavy breasts that sagged like sacks of suet covered with coarse yellow hair. He reminded Tyrion of a dead sea cow that had once washed up in the caverns under Casterly Rock.\n\nThe fat man looked down and smiled. \u201cA drunken dwarf,\u201d he said, in the Common Tongue of Westeros.\n\n\u201cA rotting sea cow.\u201d Tyrion\u2019s mouth was full of blood. He spat it at the fat man\u2019s feet. They were in a long, dim cellar with barrel-vaulted ceilings, its stone walls spotted with nitre. Casks of wine and ale surrounded them, more than enough drink to see a thirsty dwarf safely through the night. Or through a life.\n\n\u201cYou are insolent. I like that in a dwarf.\u201d When the fat man laughed, his flesh bounced so vigorously that Tyrion was afraid he might fall and crush him. \u201cAre you hungry, my little friend? Weary?\u201d\n\n\u201cThirsty.\u201d Tyrion struggled to his knees. \u201cAnd filthy.\u201d\n\nThe fat man sniffed. \u201cA bath first, just so. Then food and a soft bed, yes? My servants shall see to it.\u201d His host put the mallet and chisel aside. \u201cMy house is yours. Any friend of my friend across the water is a friend to Illyrio Mopatis, yes.\u201d\nAnd any friend of Varys the Spider is someone I will trust just as far as I can throw him.\n\nThe fat man made good on the promised bath, though. No sooner did Tyrion lower himself into the hot water and close his eyes than he was fast asleep. He woke naked on a goose-down feather bed so soft it felt as if he had been swallowed by a cloud. His tongue was growing hair and his throat was raw, but his cock was as hard as an iron bar. He rolled from the bed, found a chamber pot, and commenced to filling it, with a groan of pleasure.\n\nThe room was dim, but there were bars of yellow sunlight showing between the slats of the shutters. Tyrion shook the last drops off and waddled over patterned Myrish carpets as soft as new spring grass. Awkwardly he climbed the window seat and flung the shutters open to see where Varys and the gods had sent him.\n\nBeneath his window six cherry trees stood sentinel around a marble pool, their slender branches bare and brown. A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo\u2019s blade in hand. He was lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders. So lifelike did he seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of painted marble, though his sword shimmered like true steel.\n\nAcross the pool stood a brick wall twelve feet high, with iron spikes along its top. Beyond that was the city. A sea of tiled rooftops crowded close around a bay. He saw square brick towers, a great red temple, a distant manse upon a hill. In the far distance, sunlight shimmered off deep water. Fishing boats were moving across the bay, their sails rippling in the wind, and he could see the masts of larger ships poking up along the shore. Surely one is bound for Dorne, or for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea He had no means to pay for passage, though, nor was he made to pull an oar. I suppose I could sign on as a cabin boy and earn my way by letting the crew bugger me up and down the narrow sea.\n\nHe wondered where he was. Even the air smells different here. Strange spices scented the chilly autumn wind, and he could hear faint cries drifting over the wall from the streets beyond. It sounded something like Valyrian, but he did not recognize more than one word in five. Not Braavos, he concluded, nor Tyrosh Those bare branches and the chill in the air argued against Lys and Myr and Volantis as well.\n\nWhen he heard the door opening behind him, Tyrion turned to confront his fat host. \u201cThis is Pentos, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust so. Where else?\u201d\n\nPentos. Well, it was not King\u2019s Landing, that much could be said for it.\n\n\u201cWhere do whores go?\u201d he heard himself ask.\n\n\u201cWhores are found in brothels here, as in Westeros. You will have no need of such, my little friend. Choose from amongst my servingwomen. None will dare refuse you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlaves?\u201d the dwarf asked pointedly.\n\nThe fat man stroked one of the prongs of his oiled yellow beard, a gesture Tyrion found remarkably obscene. \u201cSlavery is forbidden in Pentos, by the terms of the treaty the Braavosi imposed on us a hundred years ago. Still, they will not refuse you.\u201d Illyrio gave a ponderous half bow. \u201cBut now my little friend must excuse me. I have the honor to be a magister of this great city, and the prince has summoned us to session.\u201d He smiled, showing a mouth full of crooked yellow teeth. \u201cExplore the manse and grounds as you like, but on no account stray beyond the walls. It is best that no man knows that you were here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere? Have I gone somewhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cTime enough to speak of that this evening. My little friend and I shall eat and drink and make great plans, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, my fat friend,\u201d Tyrion replied.\n\nHe thinks to use me for his profit. It was all profit with the merchant princes of the Free Cities. \u201cSpice soldiers and cheese lords,\u201d his lord father called them, with contempt. Should a day ever dawn when Illyrio Mopatis saw more profit in a dead dwarf than a live one, Tyrion would find himself packed into another wine cask by dusk. It would be well if I was gone before that day arrives. That it would arrive he did not doubt; Cersei was not like to forget him, and even Jaime might be vexed to find a quarrel in Father\u2019s belly.\n\nA light wind was riffling the waters of the pool below, all around the naked swordsman. It reminded him of how Tysha would riffle his hair during the false spring of their marriage, before he helped his father\u2019s guardsmen rape her. He had been thinking of those guardsmen during his flight, trying to recall how many there had been. You would think he might remember that, but no. A dozen? A score? A hundred? He could not say.\n\nThey had all been grown men, tall and strong \u2026 though all men were tall to a dwarf of thirteen years. Tysha knew their number. Each of them had given her a silver stag, so she would only need to count the coins. A silver for each and a gold for me. His father had insisted that he pay her too. A Lannister always pays his debts.\n\n\u201cWherever whores go,\u201d he heard Lord Tywin say once more, and once more the bowstring thrummed.\n\nThe magister had invited him to explore the manse. He found clean clothes in a cedar chest inlaid with lapis and mother-of-pearl. The clothes had been made for a small boy, he realized as he struggled into them.\n\nThe fabrics were rich enough, if a little musty, but the cut was too long in the legs and too short in the arms, with a collar that would have turned his face as black as Joffrey\u2019s had he somehow contrived to get it fastened. Moths had been at them too. At least they do not stink of vomit.\n\nTyrion began his explorations with the kitchen, where two fat women and a potboy watched him warily as he helped himself to cheese, bread, and figs. \u201cGood morrow to you, fair ladies,\u201d he said with a bow. \u201cDo you know where whores go?\u201d When they did not respond, he repeated the question in High Valyrian, though he had to say courtesan in place of whore. The younger, fatter cook gave him a shrug that time.\n\nHe wondered what they would do if he took them by the hand and dragged them to his bedchamber. None will dare refuse you, Illyrio claimed, but somehow Tyrion did not think he meant these two. The younger woman was old enough to be his mother, and the older was likely her mother. Both were near as fat as Illyrio, with teats that were larger than his head. I could smother myself in flesh. There were worse ways to die. The way his lord father had died, for one. I should have made him shit a little gold before expiring. Lord Tywin might have been niggardly with his approval and affection, but he had always been open-handed when it came to coin.The only thing more pitiful than a dwarf without a nose is a dwarf without a nose who has no gold.\n\nTyrion left the fat women to their loaves and kettles and went in search of the cellar where Illyrio had decanted him the night before. It was not hard to find. There was enough wine there to keep him drunk for a hundred years; sweet reds from the Reach and sour reds from Dorne, pale Pentoshi ambers, the green nectar of Myr, three score casks of Arbor gold, even wines from the fabled east, from Qarth and Yi Ti and Asshai by the Shadow. In the end, Tyrion chose a cask of strongwine marked as the private stock of Lord Runceford Redwyne, the grandfather of the present Lord of the Arbor. The taste of it was languorous and heady on the tongue, the color a purple so dark that it looked almost black in the dim-lit cellar. Tyrion filled a cup, and a flagon for good measure, and carried them up to the gardens to drink beneath those cherry trees he\u2019d seen.\n\nAs it happened, he left by the wrong door and never found the pool he had spied from his window, but it made no matter. The gardens behind the manse were just as pleasant, and far more extensive. He wandered through them for a time, drinking. The walls would have shamed any proper castle, and the ornamental iron spikes along the top looked strangely naked without heads to adorn them.\n\nTyrion pictured how his sister\u2019s head might look up there, with tar in her golden hair and flies buzzing in and out of her mouth. Yes, and Jaime must have the spike beside her, he decided. No one must ever come between my brother and my sister.\n\nWith a rope and a grapnel he might be able to get over that wall. He had strong arms and he did not weigh much. He should be able to clamber over, if he did not impale himself on a spike. I will search for a rope on the morrow, he resolved.\n\nHe saw three gates during his wanderings\u2014the main entrance with its gatehouse, a postern by the kennels, and a garden gate hidden behind a tangle of pale ivy. The last was chained, the others guarded. The guards were plump, their faces as smooth as babies\u2019 bottoms, and every man of them wore a spiked bronze cap. Tyrion knew eunuchs when he saw them. He knew their sort by reputation. They feared nothing and felt no pain, it was said, and were loyal to their masters unto death. I could make good use of a few hundred of mine own, he reflected. A pity I did not think of that before I became a beggar.\n\nHe walked along a pillared gallery and through a pointed arch, and found himself in a tiled courtyard where a woman was washing clothes at a well. She looked to be his own age, with dull red hair and a broad face dotted by freckles. \u201cWould you like some wine?\u201d he asked her. She looked at him uncertainly. \u201cI have no cup for you, we\u2019ll have to share.\u201d The washerwoman went back to wringing out tunics and hanging them to dry. Tyrion settled on a stone bench with his flagon. \u201cTell me, how far should I trust Magister Illyrio?\u201d The name made her look up. \u201cThat far?\u201d Chuckling, he crossed his stunted legs and took a drink. \u201cI am loath to play whatever part the cheesemonger has in mind for me, yet how can I refuse him? The gates are guarded. Perhaps you might smuggle me out under your skirts? I\u2019d be so grateful; why, I\u2019ll even wed you. I have two wives already, why not three? Ah, but where would we live?\u201d He gave her as pleasant a smile as a man with half a nose could manage. \u201cI have a niece in Sunspear, did I tell you? I could make rather a lot of mischief in Dorne with Myrcella. I could set my niece and nephew at war, wouldn\u2019t that be droll?\u201d The washerwoman pinned up one of Illyrio\u2019s tunics, large enough to double as a sail. \u201cI should be ashamed to think such evil thoughts, you\u2019re quite right. Better if I sought the Wall instead. All crimes are wiped clean when a man joins the Night\u2019s Watch, they say. Though I fear they would not let me keep you, sweetling. No women in the Watch, no sweet freckly wives to warm your bed at night, only cold winds, salted cod, and small beer. Do you think I might stand taller in black, my lady?\u201d He filled his cup again. \u201cWhat do you say? North or south? Shall I atone for old sins or make some new ones?\u201d\n\nThe washerwoman gave him one last glance, picked up her basket, and walked away.\n\nI cannot seem to hold a wife for very long, Tyrion reflected. Somehow his flagon had gone dry. Perhaps I should stumble back down to the cellars. The strongwine was making his head spin, though, and the cellar steps were very steep. \u201cWhere do whores go?\u201d he asked the wash flapping on the line. Perhaps he should have asked the washerwoman. Not to imply that you\u2019re a whore, my dear, but perhaps you know where they go. Or better yet, he should have asked his father. \u201cWherever whores go,\u201d Lord Tywin said. She loved me. She was a crofter\u2019s daughter, she loved me and she wed me, she put her trust in me.\n\nThe empty flagon slipped from his hand and rolled across the yard. Tyrion pushed himself off the bench and went to fetch it. As he did, he saw some mushrooms growing up from a cracked paving tile. Pale white they were, with speckles, and red-ribbed undersides dark as blood. The dwarf snapped one off and sniffed it. Delicious, he thought, and deadly.\n\nThere were seven of the mushrooms. Perhaps the Seven were trying to tell him something. He picked them all, snatched a glove down from the line, wrapped them carefully, and stuffed them down his pocket. The effort made him dizzy, so afterward he crawled back onto the bench, curled up, and shut his eyes.\n\nWhen he woke again, he was back in his bedchamber, drowning in the goose-down feather bed once more while a blond girl shook his shoulder.\n\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d she said, \u201cyour bath awaits. Magister Illyrio expects you at table within the hour.\u201d\n\nTyrion propped himself against the pillows, his head in his hands. \u201cDo I dream, or do you speak the Common Tongue?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, my lord. I was bought to please the king.\u201d She was blue-eyed and fair, young and willowy.\n\n\u201cI am sure you did. I need a cup of wine.\u201d\n\nShe poured for him.\n\n\u201cMagister Illyrio said that I am to scrub your back and warm your bed.\n\nMy name\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014is of no interest to me. Do you know where whores go?\u201d\n\nShe flushed.\n\n\u201cWhores sell themselves for coin.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr jewels, or gowns, or castles. But where do they go?\u201d\n\nThe girl could not grasp the question.\n\n\u201cIs it a riddle, m\u2019lord? I\u2019m no good at riddles. Will you tell me the answer?\u201d\n\nNo, he thought. I despise riddles, myself. \u201cI will tell you nothing. Do me the same favor.\u201d The only part of you that interests me is the part between your legs, he almost said. The words were on his tongue, but somehow never passed his lips. She is not Shae, the dwarf told himself, only some little fool who thinks I play at riddles. If truth be told, even her cunt did not interest him much. I must be sick, or dead. \u201cYou mentioned a bath? We must not keep the great cheesemonger waiting.\u201d\n\nAs he bathed, the girl washed his feet, scrubbed his back, and brushed his hair. Afterward she rubbed sweet-smelling ointment into his calves to ease the aches, and dressed him once again in boy\u2019s clothing, a musty pair of burgundy breeches and a blue velvet doublet lined with cloth-of-gold. \u201cWill my lord want me after he has eaten?\u201d she asked as she was lacing up his boots.\n\n\u201cNo. I am done with women.\u201d Whores.\n\nThe girl took that disappointment too well for his liking. \u201cIf m\u2019lord would prefer a boy, I can have one waiting in his bed.\u201d\n\nM\u2019lord would prefer his wife. M\u2019lord would prefer a girl named Tysha. \u201cOnly if he knows where whores go.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s mouth tightened. She despises me, he realized, but no more than I despise myself. That he had fucked many a woman who loathed the very sight of him, Tyrion Lannister had no doubt, but the others had at least the grace to feign affection. A little honest loathing might be refreshing, like a tart wine after too much sweet.\n\n\u201cI believe I have changed my mind,\u201d he told her. \u201cWait for me abed. Naked, if you please, I\u2019ll be a deal too drunk to fumble at your clothing. Keep your mouth shut and your thighs open and the two of us should get on splendidly.\u201d He gave her a leer, hoping for a taste of fear, but all she gave him was revulsion. No one fears a dwarf. Even Lord Tywin had not been afraid, though Tyrion had held a crossbow in his hands. \u201cDo you moan when you are being fucked?\u201d he asked the bedwarmer.\n\n\u201cIf it please m\u2019lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might please m\u2019lord to strangle you. That\u2019s how I served my last whore. Do you think your master would object? Surely not. He has a hundred more like you, but no one else like me.\u201d This time, when he grinned, he got the fear he wanted.\n\nIllyrio was reclining on a padded couch, gobbling hot peppers and pearl onions from a wooden bowl. His brow was dotted with beads of sweat, his pig\u2019s eyes shining above his fat cheeks.\n\nJewels danced when he moved his hands; onyx and opal, tiger\u2019s eye and tourmaline, ruby, amethyst, sapphire, emerald, jet and jade, a black diamond, and a green pearl. I could live for years on his rings, Tyrion mused, though I\u2019d need a cleaver to claim them.\n\n\u201cCome sit, my little friend.\u201d Illyrio waved him closer.\n\nThe dwarf clambered up onto a chair. It was much too big for him, a cushioned throne intended to accommodate the magister\u2019s massive buttocks, with thick sturdy legs to bear his weight. Tyrion Lannister had lived all his life in a world that was too big for him, but in the manse of Illyrio Mopatis the sense of disproportion assumed grotesque dimensions. I am a mouse in a mammoth\u2019s lair, he mused, though at least the mammoth keeps a good cellar. The thought made him thirsty. He called for wine.\n\n\u201cDid you enjoy the girl I sent you?\u201d Illyrio asked.\n\n\u201cIf I had wanted a girl I would have asked for one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she failed to please \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cShe did all that was required of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope so. She was trained in Lys, where they make an art of love. The king enjoyed her greatly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI kill kings, hadn\u2019t you heard?\u201d Tyrion smiled evilly over his wine cup. \u201cI want no royal leavings.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you wish. Let us eat.\u201d Illyrio clapped his hands together, and serving men came running.\n\nThey began with a broth of crab and monkfish, and cold egg lime soup as well. Then came quails in honey, a saddle of lamb, goose livers drowned in wine, buttered parsnips, and suckling pig. The sight of it all made Tyrion feel queasy, but he forced himself to try a spoon of soup for the sake of politeness, and once he had tasted it he was lost. The cooks might be old and fat, but they knew their business. He had never eaten so well, even at court.\n\nAs he was sucking the meat off the bones of his quail, he asked Illyrio about the morning\u2019s summons. The fat man shrugged.\n\n\u201cThere are troubles in the east. Astapor has fallen, and Meereen. Ghiscari slave cities that were old when the world was young.\u201d The suckling pig was carved. Illyrio reached for a piece of the crackling, dipped it in a plum sauce, and ate it with his fingers.\n\n\u201cSlaver\u2019s Bay is a long way from Pentos.\u201d Tyrion speared a goose liver on the point of his knife. No man is as cursed as the kinslayer, he mused, but I could learn to like this hell.\n\n\u201cThis is so,\u201d Illyrio agreed, \u201cbut the world is one great web, and a man dare not touch a single strand lest all the others tremble.\n\nMore wine?\u201d Illyrio popped a pepper into his mouth.\n\n\u201cNo, something better.\u201d He clapped his hands together.\n\nAt the sound a serving man entered with a covered dish. He placed it in front of Tyrion, and Illyrio leaned across the table to remove the lid. \u201cMushrooms,\u201d the magister announced, as the smell wafted up. \u201cKissed with garlic and bathed in butter. I am told the taste is exquisite. Have one, my friend. Have two.\u201d\n\nTyrion had a fat black mushroom halfway to his mouth, but something in Illyrio\u2019s voice made him stop abruptly. \u201cAfter you, my lord.\u201d He pushed the dish toward his host.\n\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d Magister Illyrio pushed the mushrooms back. For a heartbeat it seemed as if a mischievous boy was peering out from inside the cheesemonger\u2019s bloated flesh. \u201cAfter you. I insist. Cook made them specially for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid she indeed?\u201d He remembered the cook, the flour on her hands, heavy breasts shot through with dark blue veins. \u201cThat was kind of her, but \u2026 no.\u201d Tyrion eased the mushroom back into the lake of butter from which it had emerged.\n\n\u201cYou are too suspicious.\u201d Illyrio smiled through his forked yellow beard. Oiled every morning to make it gleam like gold, Tyrion suspected. \u201cAre you craven? I had not heard that of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Seven Kingdoms it is considered a grave breach of hospitality to poison your guest at supper.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere as well.\u201d Illyrio Mopatis reached for his wine cup. \u201cYet when a guest plainly wishes to end his own life, why, his host must oblige him, no?\u201d He took a gulp. \u201cMagister Ordello was poisoned by a mushroom not half a year ago. The pain is not so much, I am told. Some cramping in the gut, a sudden ache behind the eyes, and it is done. Better a mushroom than a sword through your neck, is it not so? Why die with the taste of blood in your mouth when it could be butter and garlic?\u201d\n\nThe dwarf studied the dish before him. The smell of garlic and butter had his mouth watering. Some part of him wanted those mushrooms, even knowing what they were. He was not brave enough to take cold steel to his own belly, but a bite of mushroom would not be so hard. That frightened him more than he could say. \u201cYou mistake me,\u201d he heard himself say.\n\n\u201cIs it so? I wonder. If you would sooner drown in wine, say the word and it shall be done, and quickly. Drowning cup by cup wastes time and wine both.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mistake me,\u201d Tyrion said again, more loudly. The buttered mushrooms glistened in the lamplight, dark and inviting.\n\n\u201cI have no wish to die, I promise you. I have \u2026\u201d His voice trailed off into uncertainty. What do I have? A life to live? Work to do? Children to raise, lands to rule, a woman to love?\n\n\u201cYou have nothing,\u201d finished Magister Illyrio, \u201cbut we can change that.\u201d He plucked a mushroom from the butter, and chewed it lustily. \u201cDelicious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mushrooms are not poisoned.\u201d Tyrion was irritated.\n\n\u201cNo. Why should I wish you ill?\u201d Magister Illyrio ate another. \u201cWe must show a little trust, you and I. Come, eat.\u201d He clapped his hands again. \u201cWe have work to do. My little friend must keep his strength up.\u201d\n\nThe serving men brought out a heron stuffed with figs, veal cutlets blanched with almond milk, creamed herring, candied onions, foul-smelling cheeses, plates of snails and sweetbreads, and a black swan in her plumage. Tyrion refused the swan, which reminded him of a supper with his sister. He helped himself to heron and herring, though, and a few of the sweet onions. And the serving men filled his wine cup anew each time he emptied it.\n\n\u201cYou drink a deal of wine for such a little man.\u201d\n\n\u201cKinslaying is dry work. It gives a man a thirst.\u201d\n\nThe fat man\u2019s eyes glittered like the gemstones on his fingers. \u201cThere are those in Westeros who would say that killing Lord Lannister was merely a good beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had best not say it in my sister\u2019s hearing, or they will find themselves short a tongue.\u201d The dwarf tore a loaf of bread in half. \u201cAnd you had best be careful what you say of my family, magister. Kinslayer or no, I am a lion still.\u201d\n\nThat seemed to amuse the lord of cheese no end.\n\nHe slapped a meaty thigh and said, \u201cYou Westerosi are all the same. You sew some beast upon a scrap of silk, and suddenly you are all lions or dragons or eagles. I can take you to a real lion, my little friend. The prince keeps a pride in his menagerie. Would you like to share a cage with them?\u201d\n\nThe lords of the Seven Kingdoms did make rather much of their sigils, Tyrion had to admit. \u201cVery well,\u201d he conceded. \u201cA Lannister is not a lion. Yet I am still my father\u2019s son, and Jaime and Cersei are mine to kill.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow odd that you should mention your fair sister,\u201d said Illyrio, between snails. \u201cThe queen has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head, no matter how humble his birth.\u201d\n\nIt was no more than Tyrion had expected. \u201cIf you mean to take her up on it, make her spread her legs for you as well. The best part of me for the best part of her, that\u2019s a fair trade.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would sooner have mine own weight in gold.\u201d\n\nThe cheesemonger laughed so hard that Tyrion feared he was about to rupture.\n\n\u201cAll the gold in Casterly Rock, why not?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gold I grant you,\u201d the dwarf said, relieved that he was not about to drown in a gout of half-digested eels and sweetmeats, \u201cbut the Rock is mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust so.\u201d The magister covered his mouth and belched a mighty belch. \u201cDo you think King Stannis will give it to you? I am told he is a great one for the law. Your brother wears the white cloak, so you are heir by all the laws of Westeros.\u201d\n\n\u201cStannis might well grant me Casterly Rock,\u201d said Tyrion, \u201cbut for the small matter of regicide and kinslaying. For those he would shorten me by a head, and I am short enough as I stand. But why would you think I mean to join Lord Stannis?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy else would you go the Wall?\u201d\n\n\u201cStannis is at the Wall?\u201d Tyrion rubbed at his nose. \u201cWhat in seven bloody hells is Stannis doing at the Wall?\u201d\n\n\u201cShivering, I would think. It is warmer down in Dorne. Perhaps he should have sailed that way.\u201d\n\nTyrion was beginning to suspect that a certain freckled washerwoman knew more of the Common Speech than she pretended. \u201cMy niece Myrcella is in Dorne, as it happens. And I have half a mind to make her a queen.\u201d\n\nIllyrio smiled as his serving men spooned out bowls of black cherries in sweet cream for them both. \u201cWhat has this poor child done to you that you would wish her dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven a kinslayer is not required to slay all his kin,\u201d said Tyrion, wounded. \u201cQueen her, I said. Not kill her.\u201d\n\nThe cheesemonger spooned up cherries. \u201cIn Volantis they use a coin with a crown on one face and a death\u2019s-head on the other. Yet it is the same coin. To queen her is to kill her. Dorne might rise for Myrcella, but Dorne alone is not enough. If you are as clever as our friend insists, you know this.\u201d\n\nTyrion looked at the fat man with new interest. He is right on both counts. To queen her is to kill her. And I knew that.  \u201cFutile gestures are all that remain to me. This one would make my sister weep bitter tears, at least.\u201d\n\nMagister Illyrio wiped sweet cream from his mouth with the back of a fat hand. \u201cThe road to Casterly Rock does not go through Dorne, my little friend. Nor does it run beneath the Wall. Yet there is such a road, I tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am an attainted traitor, a regicide, and kinslayer.\u201d This talk of roads annoyed him.\n\nDoes he think this is a game?\n\n\u201cWhat one king does, another may undo. In Pentos we have a prince, my friend. He presides at ball and feast and rides about the city in a palanquin of ivory and gold. Three heralds go before him with the golden scales of trade, the iron sword of war, and the silver scourge of justice. On the first day of each new year he must deflower the maid of the fields and the maid of the seas.\u201d Illyrio leaned forward, elbows on the table. \u201cYet should a crop fail or a war be lost, we cut his throat to appease the gods and choose a new prince from amongst the forty families.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemind me never to become the Prince of Pentos.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your Seven Kingdoms so different? There is no peace in Westeros, no justice, no faith \u2026 and soon enough, no food. When men are starving and sick of fear, they look for a savior.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey may look, but if all they find is Stannis\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot Stannis.\n\nNor Myrcella.\u201d\n\nThe yellow smile widened.\n\n\u201cAnother. Stronger than Tommen, gentler than Stannis, with a better claim than the girl Myrcella. A savior come from across the sea to bind up the wounds of bleeding Westeros.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine words.\u201d Tyrion was unimpressed.\n\n\u201cWords are wind. Who is this bloody savior?\u201d\n\n\u201cA dragon.\u201d The cheesemonger saw the look on his face at that, and laughed.\n\n\u201cA dragon with three heads.\u201d7Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/3986592", "artist_names": "Shorty Long", "full_title": "Night Fo' Last by\u00a0Shorty\u00a0Long", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/cc4dde3eb7c11647becbe0c725ca82ae.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cc4dde3eb7c11647becbe0c725ca82ae.741x741x1.jpg", "id": 3986592, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 381464, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1538251699, "path": "/Shorty-long-night-fo-last-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Shorty-long-night-fo-last-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1968, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1968", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1968", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/cc4dde3eb7c11647becbe0c725ca82ae.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cc4dde3eb7c11647becbe0c725ca82ae.741x741x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Night Fo\u2019 Last", "title_with_featured": "Night Fo' Last", "updated_by_human_at": 1625320661, "url": "https://genius.com/Shorty-long-night-fo-last-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/365093", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/97a46d6597869a4205b7cb60affd556a.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 365093, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/97a46d6597869a4205b7cb60affd556a.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Shorty Long", "slug": "Shorty-long", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Shorty-long"}, "artist": "Shorty Long", "lyrics": "Night Fo\u2019 Last Lyrics[Chorus]\nChild, you oughta been there, night fo' last\nSeen sister [?] shakin' her tailfeather\nYou oughta been there, night fo' last\nWatching grandpa getting his thing together\n\n[Verse 1]\nThen grandpa headed onto the floor\nSaid hold my cane, son, and watch me go\n'Cause I'm feeling sixteen, not sixty-four\nAnd all of the hippies started screaming and screaming\nGo grandpa go!

grim reaper\nGrowin up I ain\u2019t get love from my mama\nChildhood filled with a bunch of drama\nExperiences gave me all this trauma\nBut I still only kill cause I wanna\nI\u2019m insane yea nothing can stop me\nThe things I do yea they\u2019re pretty shockin\nKilling animals is stuff I do often\nShot that boy with my little brother watchin\n\nI took 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 shots and I ran em down\nThen I ran em down\nThen I ran em down\nThen I ran em down\nThen I ran em down\nThen I ran em down\n\nIt took 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 cops just to get me down\nJust to get me down\nJust to get me down\nJust to get me down\nJust to get me down\nJust to get me down\n\nNah dawg, it\u2019s not forreal dog\nRobert Harris didn\u2019t have a choice to kill dog\nHis childhood was messed up that\u2019s forreal dog\nHis mind is messed up he doesn\u2019t have free will dog\nSince he was lil dog, it went downhill dog\nHis mom would squeal dog, her love concealed dog\nBarbara harris said he had to kill dog\nThe way to control his feels dog\nThat\u2019s why he took those kids up the hill dog\nYou might also likeHe took 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 shots and he ran em down\nThen he ran em down\nThen he ran em down\nThen he ran em

him down\n\nHe had a choice, man he had a choice\nHarris chose wrong man, he used his own voice\nFree Will exists, that boy Harris was bad\nYou can\u2019t sit there and blame the mom and dad\nThe choice is always yours, that you can\u2019t deny\nWhat you choose to do is up your own mind\nYes, no, maybe so the choice is up to you\nHarris chose to kill, he made that gun go boomEmbed"}, {"_type":

In those days the slopes of the mountains which encircled the valleys were densely covered with luxuriant trees; these plantations began to disappear during the civil wars, and in a greater degree after the war, on account of the increase of naval construction in the building trade of Zurrosa, Duesto, Salve, and Ripa.\n\nWhen beautiful chestnut woods and forests of oak covered the southerly brows of Archanda and Berriz,\n\np. 186\nwhich now are almost bereft of vegetation, and also along the base of the valley where, God be praised! they substituted for the ancient trees the no less beautiful embellishment, and one more useful, of numbers of quintas, splendid houses, gardens, orchards, and manufactories, there lived a happy couple.\n\nOn the brow of the mountain Berriz, in the centre of a plantation of luxuriant chestnuts, there existed, during the three first decades of the seventeenth century, a house surrounded by some acres of arable land. That homestead, and the happiness of its inmates, no doubt inspired in the people a song or ditty which I heard for the first time in those plantations, and which runs as follows:\n\nTener herencia en campo bello,\nYuna casa en la herencia,\nYen la casa pan y amor,\nEs grande felicidad.\n\n(\"To possess an inheritance in a lovely land, and in that inheritance a house, and in that house bread and love, is indeed a great happiness.\")\n\nAnd in truth they were very happy, Martin and Prudencia, as they were called by the dwellers of Aurrecoechea. Their love began in the holy occupation of labour.\n\nPrudencia dwelt in the house of Aurrecoechea, whose\n\np. 187\n\nacres had to yield the sustenance necessary for herself and her mother, the only member remaining of her family, and she was too old and helpless to work. In another house, close to that of Prudencia, lived Martin, who also had to support by his labour in the paternal home his aged parents who could no longer earn their bread.\n\nSome of the work done by the tillers of land in the Biscayan provinces demands the united labour of two or more persons. Hence it is that a woman is never seen alone digging or tilling the ground, because the field labourer or farmer, who has no one of his family to assist him in his hard work, and is too poor to hire labourers and pay wages, digs in exchange with any of his neighbours who may be similarly situated; that is to say, they join together and work alternately on each other's land.\n\nWhen the season for digging commences, which is that when the sky begins to clear up and shows a cloudless blue, the birds to sing on the trees, and the flowers to spring up on the banks, Martin and Prudencia used to join together and work alternately on each other's land; and in that occupation, which I do not hesitate in calling a holy one, since it is a holy labour, that of him who sows the land by the sweat of his brow in order that it may produce the fruits with which to maintain his family--there sprang up in the hearts of these two,\n\np. 188\n\nhonoured and comely beings a pure affection which grew and became strengthened.\nIt is easier to comprehend than it is to explain the sweet charm which their labour must have possessed for those two young people, that labour shared together, and in which they learned to love one another in a supreme degree. Both lost almost at the same time their parents, and both felt that they remained alone in the world; but when Prudencia saw Martin in his house, and Martin in that of Prudencia, a hope rose up which smiled upon their lives, and then both felt that they were not left alone in the world.\n\nOne lovely spring morning Prudencia left her house at the same moment as Martin left his, and both met on the slope of the hill and descended to the plain, where they entered the Church of San Pedro de Deustua. An hour later they ascended the mountain, Prudencia leaning lovingly on his arm, and instead of parting company to enter each one into their house, they both went into the house of Prudencia, because it had become a fact that love and the permission of the church had rendered common property both their inheritances.\n\nFor two years did Martin and Prudencia live together. Poor indeed they were as regards the riches of this world, but rich in love and happiness, and no doubt it was then that some versifier of the mountains of Goyerry or of the plains of Olaveaga composed the Basque ditty\n\np. 189\n\nwhich I have humbly rendered into English. But as in this world there is never complete felicity, so also was the happiness of Martin and Prudencia incomplete, because often when Martin heard in Aurrecoechea the bells of Santa Maria de Bego\u00f1a ringing for mass, he used to say--\n\n\"We must have a mass said to beseech the Virgin to implore our Lord to give us, through her intercession, what is wanting to complete the joy of our home.\"\n\n\"Yes, we must indeed,\" Prudencia would reply, blushing and full of joy.\n\nII.\n\nMartin and Prudencia were overjoyed when the young wife felt that their desires were to be realized, but their joy was very quickly turned into sorrow.\n\nOn one autumn evening they were both in the chestnut wood. Martin had climbed a tall tree the branches of which he was beating with a long stick, while Prudencia gathered the chestnuts, as they fell, into a basket. Suddenly a cry was heard in the chestnut plantation where Martin was, and he fell to the ground uttering a cry of terror, followed by another from Prudencia. She ran to help her husband, and filled the wood with cries for assistance; and the neighbours quickly hastened to render help; but it was all of no avail. Martin, who\n\np. 190\n\nhad fallen to the ground owing to the breaking down of the branch upon which he was standing, had ceased to exist. In the bitterness of her grief Prudencia heard the bells of Bego\u00f1a, which happened to be tolling for the dead; and she prayed in her agony that the Lord might relieve her of the weight of her life, but instantly remembering the unborn fruit of their happy union, she repented of that impulse of despair, and cried out--\n\n\"No! do not heed my petition, O my God! I wish for life to dedicate it to the innocent babe which Thou hast given me to bear!\"\nTwo months later Prudencia gave birth to a beautiful boy which cost its mother fearful suffering.\n\nEight years passed since Ignacio was born, and for these eight years the life of the mother had been one long chain of anguish and deep sacrifices to preserve the existence of that child who was born vacillating between life and death; but at length life triumphed, thanks to the mother's care.\n\n\"It is appalling to consider how much that child has cost you,\" used the pious hermit of San Bartolomeo de Berriz to say to Prudencia; \"if there is a child in the world who ought to love its mother, it is most certainly your son.\"\n\nOn hearing these words Prudencia was unable to restrain her tears. Was it because her son did not love\n\np. 191\n\nher as much as her love and great sacrifices deserved? Most undoubtedly it was.\n\nThere are few mothers who have not the right to call their children ungrateful! There are few sons who, after losing their mothers, do not feel in the depths of their hearts the remorse of not having loved them as much as they deserved!\n\nIgnacio seemed to view with indifference the love and the tender solicitude of his mother whom he treated with disaffection, which in the unreflecting age of eight was not a very guilty act, but which nevertheless gave signs of that ingratitude and coldness of heart with which the son of Prudencia would repay the hapless mother her love and maternal solicitude and sacrifices. Up to his seventh year the child was reared weak and sickly, but on attaining this age his health began to improve wonderfully, and one year later he was one of the most robust, healthy children who frequented the shores of Ibaizabal. It was on the shores of Ibaizabal, and not on the heights of Goyerri, that Ignacio was to be found at all hours of the day, against the will of his mother; who feared that some misfortune would befall him on the water, but she in vain opposed his descent to the river.\n\nPrudencia wished her son to become attached to the paternal home, to cultivate the land and the trees which surrounded it, and to pursue the agricultural\n\np. 192\n\npursuits of his country; but the water and boats and sailors were all in all the thoughts and love of the child. For him there was no field so beautiful as the wide expanse of the blue water, nor dwelling more lovely and desirable than a ship, nor society more agreeable than that afforded by the rough mariners, whose brows had become bronzed, and who had grown old wrestling with the tempest and fighting with pirates. Whenever his mother came to seek him in Olaveaga or Zorroz-aurre, she always found him exercising himself, rowing in a boat, or climbing a ship's mast, or playing on the deck of some vessel, or in the dingy alehouse frequented by the sailors, and where they met to spin their yarns, perfectly absorbed with the narrative of the adventures encountered by some crew.\n\nIf it had cost Prudencia many and dire sorrows to rear up her child, her trials were no less now when she beheld with dismay the growing love for the sea which he was daily manifesting.\n\nThe fond ambition of a mother can never be realized on beholding in her children the wish to leave their paternal home to seek the life of solitude and the constant perils of a life spent on the seas; and the ambition of Prudencia had been that her son should always remain at her side, cultivating the fields sown with patient love, and cheering the hearth around which so many tears had been shed by her.\n\np. 193\n\nIgnacio, on attaining his twelfth year, could read and write fairly well, thanks to his natural intelligence and the constant efforts of his mother to make him attend school, but certainly not due to his love of study. During the long winter evenings his mother insisted on his reading aloud books which were of a religious character, or such as recounted the history of the glories of the land of his birth; but the only book which Ignacio loved to read was a fantastic narrative of the voyages of Columbus, Elcano, and other navigators, and some romances, in which, for the amusement of the public, were related incredible accounts of maritime scenes which fired the imagination of that poor boy, who really seemed as though he had come into this world solely to torment and grieve his tender mother. The romantic and exaggerated narratives which the sailors daily recounted completed the pernicious effects produced by the injudicious reading he had pursued, on the vivid imagination of Ignacio. One day his mother bade him consider that he was already of an age to assist her in the arduous labour of cultivating the fields and tending the cattle. Ignacio to this replied, what his mother had long feared to bear, that he did not like the life of an agriculturalist, and he was firmly resolved to take to that of a sailor and proceed to sea.\n\nIn vain did Prudencia endeavour to dissuade her son\n\np. 194\n\nfrom his resolve: the son insisted upon it; and thus the years passed until Ignacio completed his twentieth year, more and more decided upon exchanging the peaceful life, which was offered him by the surroundings of Monte Berriz, for the turbulent life of a seaman on the vast solitudes of the ocean.\n\nThe love of Prudencia for her son, in place of diminishing by the cold correspondence it met with from Ignacio, became, on the contrary, more ardent, deeper, more vivid, and firmer than it had ever been! Prudencia only existed to love God and her son. If any maternal love deserved the name of idolatry or madness, most assuredly it was that of this hapless mother.\n\nIII.\n\nThe pleadings and the tears of Prudencia did not suffice to deter Ignacio from his resolution of casting himself on the ocean, after a few limited voyages on the Cantabrian seas, which hitherto had only deprived Prudencia of his society for a few days. She felt she could not exist without him, and one day Ignacio ran up from the shore to impart to his mother the sad news that he had determined upon undertaking a voyage, which would be of some months' duration. And this was not the only resolution he had formed, and which he imparted to his\n\np. 195\n\ndisconsolate mother. He had decided that they should dispose of the house and land where his father had lived from his birth until he came to dwell in Aurrecoechea, and with the proceeds of the sale to purchase a beautiful swift ship which had been put up for sale on the shores of Zorroz-aurre. The tears and pleadings of his mother to deter him from doing this were met by Ignacio with his usual argument--that if he were to die a violent death, it would be just the same to meet it on the sea as on land, as had happened to his father, who met his death in the peaceful chestnut plantation of Goyerri.\n\nPrudencia wrestled for a long time before she consented to the project of her son; but at length she was overruled; but what was most singular was the fact that, instead of acknowledging and understanding the selfish proceeding of her son, who was selling the paternal homestead and filling his mother with sorrow merely to gratify a caprice, her love, in place of growing weaker, became daily more strengthened as though it were fed by her abundant tears.\n\nSome days after this, Ignacio, radiant with joy and pride, was directing the management of his ship, which had been manned and prepared for leaving the calm waters of Ibaizabal, whilst his mother was weeping unconsolably on the shore where a few moments previously her son had given her a cold farewell accompanied by these unfeeling words: \"Come, come, we\n\np. 196\n\nhave had enough of this crying; good-bye for six months.\"\n\nThe ship slowly sailed away, carried along solely by the wind, because, as its master already considered himself quite a sea hero, he would not descend to the vulgar recourse of employing a towing rope! Prudencia did not remove her eyes, blinded by weeping, from watching the ship, waiting for the last sign of farewell of her son; but the ship disappeared behind the Monte del Sepulcro, without Ignacio remembering to turn to give one last look towards his disconsolate mother.\n\nIn those days there did not exist, as in our time, beautiful grassy acres along the plains of Elorrieta and Zorroz-aurre, which extended to the right of Ibaizabal from the Monte del Sepulcro to the white, well-populated district of Olaveaga, which then could only boast of a dozen houses, and what at the present day are fruitful lands and orchards, dotted by cheerful dwellings, was then sterile land overrun with rushes and washed by the waves.\n\nWith her heart torn asunder by grief, Prudencia crossed the place covered with bulrushes and reeds, and with slow steps ascended the slope of Goyerri, turning at every step to cast a look towards the north-west, seeking the ship which carried her son.\n\nOn reaching the chestnut wood of Aurrecoechea, she sought, as was her wont, for the tall chestnut tree, on the\n\np. 197\n\ntrunk of which was nailed a simple wooden cross, to shed a tear and repeat a prayer, and this day she cast herself on her knees close to the tree, and watered with her abundant tears the ground which had been steeped with the life-blood of her husband. This ground was on that occasion covered with flowers, and the blue hues of their petals seemed to be reminding her of the celestial Jerusalem wherein the All-powerful reserves unspeakable joys for the sad ones of this earth.\n\n\"Blessed are those that believe!\" said Christ; and whereas Prudencia had faith and believed, she deposited there her sorrow on the breast of an Invisible Being. When she rose up from her knees to continue her walk to her sad, lonely home, she appeared quite comforted and freed from her great heavy burthen. On approaching her house she cast a last look behind. The sun, which was fast becoming hidden behind the mountains of the Encartaciones, was bathing with vivid rays the turbulent waters between Cape Lucero and Cape Villano, and, favoured by its resplendency, Prudencia distinguished and recognized her son's craft, and with eyes fixed on the ship she continued motionless until it disappeared in the mists of the evening.\n\nPerchance the mother thought that at the same moment as she watched lovingly the ship, that fond eyes on board were full of tears, seeking amid the chestnut groves of Berriz for the white house of Aurrecoechea.\n\np. 198\n\nIV.\n\nThe plains which at the present day are known under the name of shores of Lamiaco were at the commencement of the seventeenth century called reed plantations, of Dondiz. Dondiz was the name of the cheerful, small village which stands on the green hills that overlook Lamiaco, and it was in this valley that an old man related to me the sad story of Prudencia, while he smoked his pipe and watched the herds pasturing on the grassy meadows.\n\nIn the Basque language, as also in Castillian, the name of Lamia implies one of the fantastic creations of the popular mind. Lamia is a class of water fairy which differs from a mermaid in this: that while the latter only dwells in the sea, and her singing allures men for evil, the former lives both in the sea and in the rivers, and her singing attracts men to them in order to render them happy.\n\nTo the bed of rushes on the shores of Dondiz was given the Basque name of \"Lamiaco,\" which, literally translated, means the shores of the Lamia. \"But why was this shore of Dondiz called Lamiaco?\" We shall learn further on. In the seventeenth century those plains, which are at the present day fruitful lands, thanks to the industrial character of the people, and will soon rival the best cultivated acres of Biscay, were\n\np. 199\n\novergrown beds of dark rushes and dismal marshes, which the people believed were the haunts of monsters and wandering spirits.\n\nBut let us return to Prudencia. Nearly six months had elapsed since the departure of Ignacio, and the poor mother had received no tidings of him. In vain did she come down to Olaveaga and Zorriz-aurre every day, with the object of asking the sailors who returned from America for news of her son. No one could give her any tidings of Ignacio, nor of his ship. But as the term of six months had not yet expired of his absence when he had promised to return, Prudencia still had hopes.\n\n\"Should her son not return,\" said the hermit of San Bartolomeo, \"what will become of poor Prudencia, who only lives because she expects her son to come back?\n\nPrudencia would every day take the high road from the plains of Aurrecoechea, which skirts the southerly brow of Monte Berriz, and ends on the summits which are renowned in the modern history of Spain under the name of Banderas. Here she would stop and spend whole hours with eyes fixed on the ocean, always hoping to see on that vast sheet of moving waters the appearance of her son's ship, which she felt sure she could not mistake for any other. But the ship of Ignacio never appeared among the great number which daily passed the fearful line of swelling waves that\n\np. 200\n\nextends from the broken rocks of Algorta to those of Santurce.\n\nHer hopes began to wane when at the end of six months Ignacio had not returned. Yet Prudencia still continued every day to ascend to the summit of Berriz, to return more and more disappointed. In proportion as the poor mother lost hope her life visibly declined.\n\nOne afternoon she stood as usual on that height with eyes fixed on the far distant horizon. The sun was setting, inundating with light the gulf which extends between Capes Lucero and Villano, just as it had done on the day when the bark of Ignacio had crossed that water. Suddenly a white sail appeared in the far distance, lit up by the sun's rays, and Prudencia, uttering a cry of joy, descended the slope west of the Monte del Sepulcro, crossed the stream by a high narrow wooden bridge extending from the sombre tower of Luchana, crossed the plain and rocks of Aspr\u00e9, and entered the reed marshes of Dondiz at the moment when the bark was saving the bar of Santurce. Prudencia had lost sight of the vessel behind one of the many peaks and rocks which hid it from her sight, but she continued to walk on along the shore, which was now comparatively dry owing to the low tide. Her heart beat wildly, her breathing was painfully laboured, while a feeling of anxious expectation was taking possession of her soul similar to that felt by the prisoner in a dungeon who\n\np. 201\n\nknows that the first person to enter in is to bring him the sentence of death or liberty.\n\nOn coming out from behind a rock she suddenly found herself close to the much-longed-for ship, and, giving a cry of intense pain, she fell to the ground senseless, as though she had been struck down by a ray of lightning. Her heart and her eyes had deceived her. That ship before her was not the one of her son Ignacio. After some time she recovered consciousness, and, making a supreme effort, she sadly and slowly took the road to Ibaizabal as though she had lost the last hope which remained to her on earth.\n\nWhen she reached Aurrecoechea the night was far advanced, and when the clock of the monks of Burce\u00f1a struck twelve the soul of Prudencia left its earthly tenement, and was ascending to heaven.\n\nV.\n\nFurther on than Aurrecoechea, almost on the summit of the mountain, there existed a beautiful hermitage dedicated to the apostle, Saint Bartholomew, and about the year 1379 some pious men, desirous of leading a life of prayer, and of sheltering the travellers who traversed those plains, which in those days were bereft of habitations and covered by dense forests, in which abounded\n\np. 202\n\nmany wild animals, joined themselves together and constituted a monastic order.\n\nIn 1429 the hermitage of Berriz was erected into a convent of Augustinians, and in 1515 the community removed to the neighbourhood of Bilbao, where the pious knight, Tristan de Leguizamor, gave them the land for founding their new house and for erecting a new church.\n\nA century later--that is to say, in the first half of the seventeenth century--a pious woman took care of the hermitage of Saint Bartholomew, which has subsisted almost to our days, and this holy woman often participated in the troubles of Prudencia, and very frequently assisted her with wise counsels. The nun of Berriz, as this servant of God was called, had great fame for sanctity, and from her life of prayer and devout contemplation it was currently believed that her enlightened spirit could pierce the veils of the future.\n\nAt the moment when Prudencia breathed her last sigh, the nun of Berriz was kneeling in prayer before the holy altar of the apostle, and was favoured with a. singular vision. It seemed to her that the temple of Saint Bartholomew had disappeared from view, and that the gates of heaven stood in its place. She saw Prudencia surrounded by ineffable light and accompanied by a legion of happy mothers, whose love and maternal sacrifices had obtained for them the aureole of\n\np. 203\n\nthe saints, and was approaching to the throne of God, who spoke to her in this wise:\n\n\"Thou wast saintly as a daughter, as a wife, and as a mother; and because thou hast loved much and suffered greatly in the world, much eternal glory shalt thou have in heaven!\"\n\n\"My God! I thank Thee!\" cried Prudencia, smiling with ineffable joy, yet a tear glistened in her eyes.\n\n\"Dost thou perchance think this an insufficient reward for thy trials and sorrow?\"\n\nNo, my God! for this is more than I deserve.\"\n\n\"Why, then, does a tear glisten in thine eyes?\"\n\n\"Because there yet remains in me an atom of human weakness, and I am thinking that if my son returns to his native shores, there will be no one left to receive and welcome him!\"\n\n\"I, who can do all things, will complete thy glory by dispelling in thy heart that last sorrow which binds thee to earth. Release that last atom of human nature from thy celestial nature, and, animated by thy holy motherly love, fly back to the shores of Dondiz!\"\n\nThis brief dialogue concluded, the eyes of Prudencia, freed from the last earthly tear, shone with celestial joy because Prudencia was now one of the blessed, and no longer the earthly mother. And in an instant the strange vision disappeared from the sight of the nun of Saint Bartholomew.\n\np. 204\n\nA short time after this the people began to call the reed marshes of Dondiz, Lamiaco, because among its rush-beds commenced to be heard the singularly sweet song of Lamia, which is still heard, and will continue to be heard, as long as the sons of this land depart from its noble shores. The song of Lamia is heard whenever a ship leaves the waters of Ibaizabal to breast those of the ocean, and carries in her a child of its mountains. All the harmonies of the fatherland, beautified and glorified by the voice of angels, are united together in that song. The melody of the pipe and the timbrel which cheer the valleys; the songs with which our mothers and nurses lulled us to sleep in our cradles; the zensuac, the ijuijac, and ujuju of the mountaineers as they call each other from mountain to mountain, and from valley to valley. Their dreams, their martial joys, and their love anxieties; the song of the high road, and the murmur of the valley, and the noise of the windmill, and the hammers of the forge, which publish their industry. The ringing of their church bells, the thousand distant, lively rumours which wake up the plains and fields when feasts are held on festival days, the singing of the birds, the sighing of the breeze, and the roar of the sea waves as they dash against our coasts--in one word, all the melodies, all the songs, all the noises which constitute the breath, the life, the voice of the Basque existence, are united together in the song of the\n\np. 205\n\n[paragraph continues] Lamia. And this song is sweet and alluring; and the ears that once hear it never can forget it; and the heart which beats on hearing it will never cease to beat for the fatherland towards which those who have departed far from it always yearn to return, because in their ears never ceases to resound the song of Lamia.\n\nIn course of time the house in which Ignacio was born, and where so many tears had been shed by his hapless mother, was converted into a convent of Capuchin Trinitarians, whose melancholy ruins I am beholding from the window of the room in which I am writing this; and it is a proud fact that the Venerable Father Matthias de Marguina, the first superior of that holy house, was in the habit of applying the holy sacrifice of the mass for the salvation of the son of Prudencia.\n\nAs regards the son of Prudencia, he never returned, nor ever will return, to his native shores, because God, whose justice finds a reward for all that is meritorious, and punishment for all that is evil, does not give to the monster who despises filial love the sweetest felicity of this earth--that of returning to the fatherland after he has sighed for it in his exile.Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

that runs away from me\nDreams that just won't let me be\nBlues that keeps on bothering me\nChains that just won't set me free\n\nToo far away from you and all your charms\nJust out of reach of my two empty arms\n\nEach night in dreams, I see your face\nMemories, time cannot erase\nAnd I awake and find you gone\nAnd I'm so blue and all alone\nSo far away from you, so sweet and warm\nJust out of reach of my two empty arms\n\nThat lonesome feeling all the time\nKnowing that you could not be mine\nDreams that hurt me in my sleep\nVows that we could never keep\n\nSo far away from you and all

LyricsOne Saturday night, Tsukuru and Haida were up talking late as usual when they turned to the subject of death. They talked about the significance of dying, about having to live with the knowledge that you were going to die. They discussed it mainly in theoretical terms. Tsukuru wanted to explain how close to death he had been very recently, and the profound changes that experience had brought about, both physically and mentally. He wanted to tell Haida about the strange things he\u2019d seen. But he knew that if he mentioned it, he\u2019d have to explain the whole sequence of events, from start to finish. So as always, Haida did most of the talking, while Tsukuru sat back and listened.\n\nA little past 11 p.m. their conversation petered out and silence descended on the room. At this point they would normally have called it a night and gotten ready for bed. Both of them tended to wake up early. But Haida remained seated, cross-legged, on the sofa, deep in thought. Then, in a hesitant tone, something unusual for him, he spoke up.\n\n\u201cI have a kind of weird story related to death. Something my father told me. He said it was an actual experience he had when he was in his early twenties. Just the age I am now. I\u2019ve heard the story so many times I can remember every detail. It\u2019s a really strange story\u2014it\u2019s hard even now for me to believe it actually happened\u2014 but my father isn\u2019t the type to lie about something like that. Or the type who would concoct such a story. I\u2019m sure you know this, but when you make up a story the details change each time you retell it. You tend to embellish things, and forget what you said before. ... But my father\u2019s story, from start to finish, was always exactly the same, each time he told it. So I think it must be something he actually experienced. I\u2019m his son, and I know him really well, so the only thing I can do is believe what he said. But you don\u2019t know my father, Tsukuru, so feel free to believe it or not. Just understand that this is what he told me. You can take it as folklore, or a tale of the supernatural, I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s a long story, and it\u2019s already late, but do you mind if I tell it?\u201d\n\nSure, Tsukuru said, that would be fine. I\u2019m not sleepy yet.\n\n* * *\n\n\u201cWhen my father was young, he spent a year wandering around Japan,\u201d Haida began. \u201cThis was at the end of the 1960s, the peak of the counterculture era, when the student movement was upending universities. I don\u2019t know all the details, but when he was in college in Tokyo, a lot of stupid things happened, and he got fed up with politics and left the movement. He took a leave of absence from school and wandered around the country. He did odd jobs to earn a living, read books when he had the time, met all sorts of people, and gained a lot of real-life, practical experience. My father says this was the happiest time of his life, when he learned some important lessons. When I was a kid, he used to tell me stories from those days, like an old soldier reminiscing about long-ago battles in some far-off place. After those bohemian days, he went back to college, and returned to academic life. He never went on a long trip ever again. As far as I know, he\u2019s spent his time since just shuttling back and forth between home and his office. It\u2019s strange, isn\u2019t it? No matter how quiet and conformist a person\u2019s life seems, there\u2019s always a time in the past when they reached an impasse. A time when they went a little crazy. I guess people need that sort of stage in their lives.\u201d\nYoung Haida was able to indulge himself in reading and contemplation. He no longer cared what was happening in the real world.\nThat winter Haida\u2019s father worked as general handyman at a small hot-springs resort in the mountains of Oita Prefecture in southern Japan. He really liked the place and decided to stay put for a while. As long as he completed his daily tasks, and any other miscellaneous jobs they asked him to undertake, the rest of the time he could do as he pleased. The pay was minimal, but he got a free room plus three meals a day, and he could bathe in the hot springs as often as he liked. When he had time off he lay around in his tiny room and read. The other people there were kind to this taciturn, eccentric Tokyo student, and the meals were simple but tasty, made with fresh, local ingredients. The place was, above all, isolated from the outside world\u2014there was no TV reception, and the newspapers were a day late. The nearest bus stop was three kilometers down the mountain, and the only vehicle that could make it from there and back on the awful road was a battered old jeep owned by the inn. They\u2019d only just recently gotten electricity installed.\n\nIn front of the inn was a beautiful mountain stream where one could catch lots of firm, colorful fish. Noisy birds were always skimming over the surface of the stream, their calls piercing, and it wasn\u2019t unusual to spot wild boar or monkeys roaming around nearby. The mountains were a treasure trove of edible wild plants. In this isolated environment, young Haida was able to indulge himself in reading and contemplation. He no longer cared what was happening in the real world.\n\n\nTwo months into his stay at the inn, he began to chat with a guest who was staying there. The man appeared to be in his mid-forties. He was tall, with lanky arms and legs, and short hair. He wore gold-framed glasses, and he had a receding hairline, which made the top of his head as smooth as a freshly laid egg. He had walked up the mountain road alone, a plastic travel bag hanging from one shoulder, and had been staying at the inn for a week. Whenever he went out, he invariably dressed in a leather jacket, jeans, and work boots. On cold days he would add a wool cap and a navy-blue muffler. The man\u2019s name was Midorikawa. At least that was the name he signed in the guest book at the inn, along with an address in Koganei City in Tokyo. He meticulously paid in cash every morning for the previous night\u2019s stay.\n\n(Midorikawa? \u201cGreen river.\u201d Another person with a color, Tsukuru thought, but said nothing and listened to the rest of the story.)\n\nMidorikawa didn\u2019t do anything special. He spent time soaking in the open-air bath, took walks in the nearby hills, or lay in the kotatsu\u2014the foot-warmer table\u2014 reading the paperbacks he\u2019d brought with him (mostly mindless mysteries). In the evening he\u2019d enjoy two small bottles of hot sake\u2014no more, no less. He was as taciturn as Haida\u2019s father, and never spoke unless absolutely necessary, though it didn\u2019t seem to bother the people at the inn. They were used to these sort of guests. All of the people who came to this remote, backwoods hot springs were odd, those who stayed long term even more so.\n\n\nOne morning, just before dawn, Haida was soaking in the open-air hot spring next to the river when Midorikawa came to bathe and started talking to him. For some reason Midorikawa seemed to have taken a deep interest in this young odd-job worker. It might have stemmed, in part, from the time he saw Haida on the porch reading a book by Georges Bataille.\nI\u2019m a jazz pianist from Tokyo, Midorikawa said. I had some personal disappointments, and the daily grind was wearing me down, so I came alone to this quiet place deep in the mountains, hoping to rest up. Actually, I set out without any plan, and just happened to land here. I like it, everything\u2019s stripped to the bare essentials. I hear you\u2019re from Tokyo too?\n\nAs he soaked in the hot water in the dim light, Haida explained, as briefly as he could, his own situation. How he\u2019d taken a leave of absence from college and was traveling around the country. Besides, the campus was blockaded, he added, so there was no reason to stay in Tokyo.\n\nAren\u2019t you interested in what\u2019s going on now in Tokyo? Midorikawa asked. It\u2019s quite a spectacle. One uproar after another, every day. Like the whole world\u2019s turned upside down. Don\u2019t you feel bad that you\u2019re missing out?\n\nThe world isn\u2019t that easily turned upside down, Haida replied. It\u2019s people who are turned upside down.\nThe world isn\u2019t that easily turned upside down, Haida replied. It\u2019s people who are turned upside down. I don\u2019t feel bad about missing that. Midorikawa seemed to appreciate the younger man\u2019s curt, direct way of speaking.\n\nI wonder if there\u2019s anyplace around here where I might play the piano, Midorikawa asked Haida.\nThere\u2019s a junior high school on the other side of the mountain, Haida replied. After school\u2019s out for the day, they might let you play the piano in their music room. Midorikawa was happy to hear this. If it isn\u2019t any trouble, he said, could you take me there? Haida relayed this request to the inn\u2019s owner, who instructed him to escort Midorikawa to the school. The owner phoned the junior high to set it up. After lunch, the two of them hiked over the mountain. The rain had just stopped falling, so the path was slippery, but Midorikawa, shoulder bag slung diagonally across his shoulders, strode quickly, sure-footed, down the path. Though outwardly a city person, he was much more robust than he appeared.\n\n\nThe keyboard of the old upright piano in the music room was uneven, and the tuning was off, but overall it was tolerable. Midorikawa sat down on the creaky chair, stretched out his fingers, ran through all eighty-eight keys, then began trying out a few chords. Fifths, sevenths, ninths, elevenths. He didn\u2019t seem too pleased with the sound, but appeared to get a certain physical satisfaction from the mere act of pressing down on the keys. As Haida watched the nimble, resilient way his fingers moved over the keyboard, he decided that Midorikawa must be a pretty well-known pianist.\n\n\nAfter trying out the piano, Midorikawa took a small cloth bag from his shoulder bag and gingerly placed it on top of the piano. The bag was made of expensive cloth, the opening tied up with string. Somebody\u2019s funeral ashes, maybe? Haida thought. It seemed like placing the bag on top of the piano was his habit, whenever he played. You could tell by the practiced way he went about it.\n\nMidorikawa hesitantly began playing \u201c\u2019Round Midnight.\u201d At first he played each chord carefully, cautiously, like a person sticking his toes into a stream, testing the swiftness of the water and searching for a foothold. After playing the main theme, he started a long improvisation. As time went by, his fingers became more agile, more generous, in their movements, like fish swimming in clear water. The left hand inspired the right, the right hand spurred on the left. Haida\u2019s father didn\u2019t know much about jazz, but he did happen to be familiar with this Thelonious Monk composition, and Midorikawa\u2019s performance went straight to the heart of the piece. His playing was so soulful it made Haida forget about the piano\u2019s erratic tuning. As he listened to the music in this junior-high music room deep in the mountains, as the sole audience for the performance, Haida felt all that was unclean inside him washed away. The straightforward beauty of the music overlapped with the fresh, oxygen-rich air and the cool, clear water of the stream, all of them acting in concert. Midorikawa, too, was lost in his playing, as if all the minutiae of reality had disappeared. Haida had never seen someone so thoroughly absorbed in what he was doing. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Midorikawa\u2019s ten fingers, which moved like independent, living creatures.\n\nIn fifteen minutes Midorikawa finished playing, took out a thick towel from his shoulder bag, and carefully wiped his perspiring face. He closed his eyes for a while as if he were meditating. \u201cOkay,\u201d he finally said, \u201cthat\u2019s enough Let\u2019s go back.\u201d He reached out, picked up the cloth bag on the piano, and gently returned it to his shoulder bag.\n\n\u201cWhat is that bag?\u201d Haida\u2019s father ventured to ask.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good-luck charm,\u201d Midorikawa said simply.\n\n\u201cLike the guardian god of pianos?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s more like my alter ego,\u201d Midorikawa replied, a weary smile rising to his lips. \u201cThere\u2019s a strange story behind it. But it\u2019s pretty long, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m too worn out to tell it right now.\u201d\n\nHaida stopped and glanced at the clock on the wall. Then he looked at Tsukuru. He was, of course, Haida the son, but Haida the father had been his same age in this story, and so the two of them began to overlap in Tsukuru\u2019s mind. It was an odd sensation, as if the two distinct temporalities had blended into one. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the father who had experienced this, but the son. Maybe Haida was just relating it as if his father had experienced it, when in reality he was the one who had. Tsukuru couldn\u2019t shake this illusion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting late. If you\u2019re sleepy I can finish this later.\u201d\n\nNo, it\u2019s fine, Tsukuru said. I\u2019m not sleepy. In fact, he\u2019d gotten his second wind, and wanted to hear the rest of the story.\n\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll continue,\u201d Haida said. \u201cI\u2019m not very sleepy either.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nThat was the only time that Haida heard Midorikawa play the piano. Once he had played \u201c\u2019Round Midnight\u201d in the junior-high music room, Midorikawa seemed to lose all interest in playing again. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to play anymore?\u201d Haida asked, trying to draw him out, but a silent shake of Midorikawa\u2019s head was his only response. Haida gave up asking. Midorikawa no longer planned to play the piano. Haida wished he could hear him perform just one more time.\n\nMidorikawa had a genuine talent. Of that there was no doubt. His playing had the power to physically and viscerally move the listener, to transport you to another world. Not the sort of thing one could easily create.\n\nBut what did this unusual talent mean for Midorikawa himself? Haida couldn\u2019t quite grasp it. If you possessed a talent like Midorikawa did, was it amazingly blissful, or was it a burden? A blessing or a curse? Or something that simultaneously contained all of these components? Either way, Midorikawa didn\u2019t seem like a very happy person. His expression switched between gloom and apathy. A slight smile would occasionally rise to his lips, but it was always subdued and a little ironic.\n\nOne day as Haida was chopping and carrying firewood in the backyard, Midorikawa came over to him.\n\n\u201cDo you drink?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cA little bit,\u201d Haida replied.\n\n\u201cA little bit\u2019s fine,\u201d Midorikawa said. \u201cCan you have some drinks with me tonight? I\u2019m tired of drinking alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have some chores to do in the evening, but I\u2019ll be free at seven thirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Come to my room then.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n\nWhen young Haida arrived at Midorikawa\u2019s room, dinner was already laid out for both of them, along with bottles of hot sake. They sat across from each other, eating and drinking. Midorikawa ate less than half of his dinner, mainly drinking the sake, serving himself. He didn\u2019t say anything about his own life, instead asking Haida about where he had grown up (in Akita) and about his college life in Tokyo. When he learned that Haida was studying philosophy, he asked a few technical questions. About Hegel\u2019s worldview. About Plato\u2019s writings. It became clear that he had systematically read those kinds of books. Mysteries weren\u2019t the only books he read.\n\n\u201cI see. So you believe in logic, do you?\u201d Midorikawa said.\n\n\u201cI do. I believe in logic, and I rely on it. That\u2019s what philosophy\u2019s all about, after all,\u201d Haida replied.\n\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t much like anything that\u2019s at odds with logic?\u201d\n\n\u201cApart from whether I like it or not, I don\u2019t reject thinking about things that aren\u2019t logical. It\u2019s not like I have some deep faith in logic. I think it\u2019s important to find the point of intersection between what is logical and what is not.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you believe in the devil?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe devil? You mean the guy with horns?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Whether he actually has horns or not, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you mean the devil as a metaphor for evil, then of course I believe in him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about if this metaphor for evil takes on actual form?\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say, unless I actually saw him,\u201d Haida said.\n\n\u201cBut once you saw him, it might be too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re speaking in hypotheticals here. If we wanted to pursue this further, we\u2019d need some concrete examples. Like a bridge needs girders. The further you go with a hypothesis, the more slippery it gets. Any conclusions you draw from it become more fallacious.\u201d\n\n\u201cExamples?\u201d Midorikawa said. He took a drink of sake and frowned. \u201cBut sometimes when an actual example appears, it all comes down to a question of whether or not you accept it, or if you believe it. There\u2019s no middle ground. You have to make a mental leap. Logic can\u2019t really help you out.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it can\u2019t. Logic isn\u2019t some convenient manual you just consult. Later on, though, you should be able to apply logic to any given situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut by then it might be too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost people like that have to pay a price for their genius. They strike a bargain. Whether that bargain\u2019s with God or the devil, I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cBut that has nothing to do with logic.\u201d\n\nMidorikawa smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. Even if you find out, down the road, that it is too late, that\u2019s different from the logic of it. That\u2019s a sound argument. No room for debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever had that kind of experience, Mr. Midorikawa? Accepting something, believing it, taking a leap beyond logic?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Midorikawa said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in anything. Not in logic, or illogic. Not in God, or the devil. No extension of a hypothesis, nothing like a leap. I just silently accept everything as it is. That\u2019s my basic problem, really. I can\u2019t erect a decent barrier between subject and object.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re so gifted, musically.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour music can move people. I don\u2019t know much about jazz, but that much I can tell.\u201d\n\nMidorikawa grudgingly shook his head. \u201cTalent can be a nice thing to have sometimes. You look good, attract attention, and if you\u2019re lucky, you make some money. Women flock to you. In that sense, having talent\u2019s preferable to having none. But talent only functions when it\u2019s supported by a tough, unyielding physical and mental focus. All it takes is one screw in your brain to come loose and fall off, or some connection in your body to break down, and your concentration vanishes, like the dew at dawn. A simple toothache, or stiff shoulders, and you can\u2019t play the piano well. It\u2019s true. I\u2019ve actually experienced it. A single cavity, one aching shoulder, and the beautiful vision and sound I hoped to convey goes out the window. The human body\u2019s that fragile. It\u2019s a complex system that can be damaged by something very trivial, and in most cases once it\u2019s damaged, it can\u2019t easily be restored. A cavity or stiff shoulder you can get over, but there are a lot of things you can\u2019t get past. If talent\u2019s the foundation you rely on, and yet it\u2019s so unreliable that you have no idea what\u2019s going to happen to it the next minute, what meaning does it have?\u201d\n\n\u201cTalent might be ephemeral,\u201d Haida replied, \u201cand there aren\u2019t many people who can sustain it their whole lives. But talent makes a huge spiritual leap possible. It\u2019s an almost universal, independent phenomenon that transcends the individual.\u201d\n\nMidorikawa pondered that for a while before replying. \u201cMozart and Schubert died young, but their music lives on forever. Is that what you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be one example.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat kind of talent is always the exception. Most people like that have to pay a price for their genius\u2014through accepting foreshortened lives and untimely deaths. They strike a bargain, putting their lives on the line. Whether that bargain\u2019s with God or the devil, I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d Midorikawa sighed and was silent for a while. \u201cChanging the subject a little,\u201d he went on, \u201cbut actually\u2014I\u2019m dying. I have only a month left.\u201d\n\nIt was Haida\u2019s turn now to be silent. No words came to him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not battling a disease or anything,\u201d Midorikawa said. \u201cI\u2019m in good health. And I\u2019m not contemplating suicide. If that\u2019s what you were thinking, you can rest easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how do you know you only have a month left?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone told me that. You have only two months left to live, he said. That was a month ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho would ever say something like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a doctor, or a fortune-teller. Just an ordinary person. Though at that point he was dying, too.\u201d\n\nYoung Haida turned this over in his mind, but a logical foothold eluded him. \u201cThen did you ... come here looking for a place to die?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t totally follow you, but isn\u2019t there some way you can avoid death?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is one way,\u201d Midorikawa said. \u201cYou take that capacity\u2014a death token, if you will\u2014and transfer it to somebody else. What I mean is, you find somebody else to die in your place. You pass them the baton, tell them, \u2018Okay, your turn,\u2019 and then leave. Do that, and you\u2019ll avoid death, for the time being. But I don\u2019t plan to. I\u2019ve been thinking for a long time that I\u2019d like to die as soon as possible. Maybe this is just what I need.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you think it\u2019s okay to die, as you are now?\u201d\n\n\u201cLife has gotten to be too much. I have no problem with dying as I am. I don\u2019t have the energy to go out and find a method to help me take my life. But quietly accepting death, that I can handle.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how, exactly, do you hand over this death token to somebody else?\u201d\n\nMidorikawa shrugged, as if he didn\u2019t really care. \u201cIt\u2019s easy. The other person just has to understand what I\u2019m saying, accept it, give their complete consent, and agree to take on the token. Then the transfer is complete. It can be a verbal agreement. A handshake is fine. No need for a signed, sealed document or contract or anything. It isn\u2019t some kind of bureaucratic thing.\u201d\n\nHaida inclined his head. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be easy to find somebody willing to take it over from you, if taking over means they\u2019re going to die soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a reasonable point,\u201d Midorikawa said. \u201cYou can\u2019t bring up this idea with just anybody. Can\u2019t just sidle up to somebody and whisper, Excuse me, but would you die in my place? You have to be very careful who you pick. Here\u2019s where things get a little tricky.\u201d\n\nMidorikawa slowly gazed around the room, and cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cEvery person has their own color. Did you know that?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cEach individual has their own unique color, which shines faintly around the contours of their body. Like a halo. Or a backlight. I\u2019m able to see those colors clearly.\u201d\n\nMidorikawa poured himself another cup of sake and sipped it, leisurely savoring the taste.\n\n\u201cIs this ability to detect colors something you were born with?\u201d Haida asked, dubiously.\n\nMidorikawa shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not innate; it\u2019s a temporary ability. You get it in exchange for accepting imminent death. And it\u2019s passed along from one person to the next. Right now, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s been entrusted with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEach individual has their own unique color, which shines faintly around the contours of their body. Like a halo. Or a backlight. I\u2019m able to see those colors clearly.\u201d\n\nYoung Haida was silent for a while. No words came to him.\n\n\u201cThere are colors I really like in the world,\u201d Midorikawa said, \u201cand ones I hate. Pleasant colors, sad colors. Some people have a very deep color, while for others it\u2019s fainter. It can get really tiring, because you see all these colors even if you don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t like to be in crowds much because of that. It\u2019s why I wound up in this remote place.\u201d\n\nHaida could barely follow along. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you can see what color I\u2019m giving off?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, of course. Though I\u2019m not about to tell you what color it is,\u201d Midorikawa said. \u201cWhat I need to do is find people who have a certain type of color, with a certain glow. Those are the only ones I can transfer the death token to. I can\u2019t hand it over to just anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there many people in the world with that color and glow?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so many. My guess would be one in a thousand, or maybe two thousand. They\u2019re not so easy to find, but not impossible, either. What\u2019s harder is finding the opportunity to sit down with them and discuss it seriously. As you can imagine, that\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what sort of people would they be? People who would be willing to die in place of somebody they don\u2019t even know?\u201d\n\nMidorikawa smiled. \u201cWhat kind of people? I really can\u2019t say. All I know is, they have a certain color, a certain depth of glow outlining their bodies. Those are only external qualities. If I were to venture a guess\u2014and this is just my personal opinion, mind you\u2014I\u2019d say they\u2019re people who aren\u2019t afraid of taking a leap. I\u2019m sure there are all sorts of reasons why.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, granted they\u2019re unafraid of taking a leap, but why are they leaping?\u201d Midorikawa didn\u2019t say anything for a while. In the silence, the flow of the mountain stream sounded more intense. Finally, he grinned.\n\n\u201cNow comes my sales pitch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis I\u2019d like to hear,\u201d Haida said.\n\n\u201cAt the point when you agree to take on death, you gain an extraordinary capacity. A special power, you could call it. Perceiving the colors that people emit is merely one function of that power, but at the root of it all is an ability to expand your consciousness. You\u2019re able to push open what Aldous Huxley calls \u2018the doors of perception.\u2019 Your perception becomes pure and unadulterated. Everything around you becomes clear, like the fog lifting. You have an omniscient view of the world and see things you\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs your performance the other day a result of that ability?\u201d\n\nMidorikawa gave a short shake of his head. \u201cNo, that was just what I\u2019ve always been capable of. I\u2019ve played like that for years. Perception is complete in and of itself; it doesn\u2019t reveal itself in an outward, concrete manifestation. There are no tangible benefits to it, either. It\u2019s not easy to explain in words. You have to experience it to understand. One thing I can say, though, is that once you see that true sight with your own eyes, the world you\u2019ve lived in up till now will look flat and insipid. There\u2019s no logic or illogic in that scene. No good or evil. Everything is merged into one. And you are one part of that merging. You leave the boundary of your physical body behind to become a metaphysical being. You become intuition. It\u2019s at once a wonderful sensation and a hopeless one, because, almost at the last minute, you realize how shallow and superficial your life has been. And you shudder at the fact that up to that point you\u2019ve been able to stand such a life.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think it\u2019s worth experiencing this sensation, even if it means taking on death? And you only have it for a little while?\u201d\n\nMidorikawa nodded. \u201cAbsolutely. It\u2019s that valuable. I guarantee it.\u201d\n\nHaida was quiet for a while.\n\n\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d Midorikawa said and smiled. \u201cAre you starting to get interested in accepting that token?\u201d\n\n\u201cCould I ask a question?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo right ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you\u2014possibly telling me that I\u2019m one of those few people with that certain color and certain glow? One in a thousand, or two thousand?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are. I knew it the minute I saw you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m one of those people who would want to take a leap?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. I don\u2019t really know. That\u2019s something you need to ask yourself, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you said you don\u2019t want to pass that token on to anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry about that,\u201d the pianist said. \u201cI plan on dying, and I don\u2019t feel like handing over that right. I\u2019m like a salesman who doesn\u2019t want to sell anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you die, though, what happens to the token?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got me. Good question. Maybe it\u2019ll simply vanish along with me. Or maybe it\u2019ll remain, in some form, and be passed along again from one person to the next. Like Wagner\u2019s ring. I have no idea, and frankly, I don\u2019t care. I mean, I\u2019m not responsible for what happens after I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\nHaida tried creating some sort of order in his mind for all these ideas, but they wouldn\u2019t line up neatly.\n\n\u201cSo, what I told you isn\u2019t one bit logical, is it?\u201d Midorikawa said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating story, but hard to believe,\u201d Haida admitted.\n\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s no logical explanation?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way to prove it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only way you know if it\u2019s real or not, the only way to prove it, is by actually making the deal. Isn\u2019t that how it works?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be going back to college in Tokyo before much longer,\u201d Midorikawa quietly stated. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll return to real life.\u201d\nMidorikawa nodded. \u201cExactly. Unless you take the leap, you can\u2019t prove it. And once you actually make the leap, there\u2019s no need to prove it anymore. There\u2019s no middle ground. You either take the leap, or you don\u2019t. One or the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of dying?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really. I\u2019ve watched lots of good-for-nothing, worthless people die, and if people like that can do it, then I should be able to handle it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you ever think about what comes after death?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe afterworld, and the afterlife? Those kinds of things?\u201d\n\nHaida nodded.\n\n\u201cI made up my mind not to think about them,\u201d Midorikawa said as he rubbed his beard. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time to think about things you can\u2019t know, and things you can\u2019t confirm even if you know them. In the final analysis, that\u2019s no different from the slippery slope of hypotheses you were talking about.\u201d\n\nHaida drew a deep breath. \u201cWhy did you tell me all this?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never told anybody until now, and never planned to,\u201d Midorikawa said, and took a drink. \u201cI was just going to quietly vanish by myself. But when I saw you, I thought, Now here\u2019s a man worth telling.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t care whether or not I believe you?\u201d\n\nMidorikawa, his eyes looking sleepy, gave a slight yawn.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if you believe it. Because sooner or later you will. Someday you will die. And when you\u2019re dying\u2014I have no idea when or how that will happen, of course\u2014you will definitely remember what I told you. And you will totally accept what I said, and understand every detail of the logic behind it. The real logic. All I did was sow the seeds.\u201d\n\nIt had started raining again, a soft, quiet rain. The rushing stream drowned out the sound of the rain. Haida could tell it was raining only by the slight variation in the air against his skin.\n\nSitting in that small room across from Midorikawa suddenly felt strange to him, as if they were in the midst of something impossible, something at odds with the principles of nature. Haida grew dizzy. In the still air he\u2019d caught a faint whiff of death, the smell of slowly rotting flesh. But it had to be an illusion. Nobody there was dead yet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be going back to college in Tokyo before much longer,\u201d Midorikawa quietly stated. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll return to real life. You need to live it to the fullest. No matter how shallow and dull things might get, this life is worth living. I guarantee it. And I\u2019m not being either ironic or paradoxical. It\u2019s just that, for me, what\u2019s worthwhile in life has become a burden, something I can\u2019t shoulder anymore. Maybe I\u2019m just not cut out for it. So, like a dying cat, I\u2019ve crawled into a quiet, dark place, silently waiting for my time to come. It\u2019s not so bad. But you\u2019re different. You should be able to handle what life sends your way. You need to use the thread of logic, as best you can, to skillfully sew onto yourself everything that\u2019s worth living for.\u201d\n\n* * *Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

my\u2005part\u2005is\nI hear my\u2005own voice\nI make my own choice\nI\u2005guess, we're fuckin' doing it\nThe horse is out the gates\nIt's\u205ftime\u205fto\u205fstart the race\nShoutout\u205fto Kathy Bates\u205fand also Betty White\nAll the people, if you're the type\nI wanna say that you're equal on the mic\nBut nobody's equal to me\nNobody is coming for my neck\nI am looking for respect\nI'm not looking for a check\nUnless it is for my friends\nThat's why we're doing this\nTo make some pennies\nAnd maybe make amends\nSailors in the sea might get the bends\nThat is my fuckin' dream\nTo go with James Cameron in a submarine\nTo the bottom of the ocean\nRocking forth with the motion\nMe and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion\nSharing our emotion\nDaring you to fuck with us\nAt the sea, at a deep water vent\nBut we don't got the bends, we're not bent\nI think that's what I'm meant to do\nMe and my crew\nGigantic, looking to cross the sea\nFor the Titanic\nOh shit, you mean they found it?\nAlready? They'd abounded with treasure?\nMan, that doesn't give me pleasure\nI don't know how to measure\nHow I feel about that shit\nBut that won't make me quit\nIn my quest, to scour the deep sea\nLike, you and me?\nSearching for an angle, mangled\nThe corpse in the Bermuda Triangle\nMaybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane\nWe're like \"oh, shit, what remains\"\nAnd\nThen we get to the bottom\nAmelia Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil\nAll my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal\nAnd you know, I am not gonna take a foil\nTo my head in a little tin cap shape\nBecause you know I'm great\nI popped the grape\nBut I'm not on some conspiracies\nI'm just trying to see what's up in the seas\nI believe that I will not cease and desist\nYou cannot resist\nWhen I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist\nI am in Manila, in Hong Kong\nIn San Francisco, doing a disco\nPop it hot like it's Crisco\nBut I gotta pace myself\nIf we're gonna raise this wealth\nThat's why I flow at this tempo\nHello, I do kempo\nIn my mind, that's a form of martial arts\nBut I take, partial starts\nAnd I just gave little partial farts\nWhen I'm shitting on the mic\n'Cause you know I got this heart\nAnd you know I got the K-Mart\nState-of-the-art mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never make the wrong call\nAnd you know, chicks dig the long ball!\nI am like (Ah)\nThey are like (Wow)\nWatsky, you cannot stop me\nI got no paparazzi\nI'm a fucking doorstep\nI'm gonna take one more step\nAnd then, take another\nWord, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'\nHere I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada\nJust keep rappin', yada yada yada\nHey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld\nMe and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld\nOr maybe it's more like Larry David\nBecause you know we're not playing\nShoutout to the Jews, the chosen people\nYou know that you cannot fuckin' lose\nBut also, shoutout to the Christians\nShoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions\nYou know you cannot stop it\nAlso, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith\nWho know we're gonna make way\nFor the Jehovah's Witnesses\nThey got their hit list-esses\nWalking up to the different fuckin' doors\nSaying \"Would you like to love God a little more?\"\nBut it kinda sucks, just because of COVID\nThey can't be making no bids\nI heard they're not doing that door-knockin'\nBut, you know, we're not stoppin'\nHowever you appraise 'em\nNo, we are fuckin' raising\nOn the mic I'm fuckin' blazing\nIf the sun is blazing\nI turn into a raisin\nI'm bringing this whole craze\nFor almost two whole days\nI don't think that's possible\nI don't think that's wise\nI don't think that's probable\nThat is what they say when they look in to my eyes\nMy momma was afraid for me\nShe busted in like the ma\u00eetre d\nShe said \"Hello umm\"\nI don't think you wanna sit here\nI don't think you wanna get here\n'Cause you might die\nYou know but then I was like \"I gotta try\"\nI gotta try to do the right thing\nShoutout to Spike Lee\nI'm gonna try to get the ring\nTry to get the bling\nTry to be the king of the long raps\nLike I was the dude with the ass raps\nDoesn't matter\nAs long as the people fuckin' clap\nAs long as we give a little joy\nGive em dat'\nThen I will cut the crap\nI guess I am a believer\nAnd I don't care that I got seizures\nI got my fuckin' pills\nI'm gonna take 'em right around midnight\nSo I can get right\nI think that's what I gotta do\nShout out to the medical commun-\nItty I just get gritty\nI hope my rhymes are not shitty\nUmm, mic check are you with me?\nShout-out Bobby and Whitney\nBut not shout out to the bad things he did\nI don't know if I'm gonna have a kid\nI don't know if I'm gonna raise a child\nBut it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild\nThey would make be fuckin' smile\nThey got fuckin' bile and some guts\nEverybody does\nEverybody got guts\nEverybody got nuts\nOr half the people maybe like 48.7%\nThat's about how it went\nI think that is the percentage-ish\nOf the gender fuckin' separation\nAlthough we know in this nation\nThings are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient\nIf you don't understand\nI got my fuckin' rhymes on demand\nI can run it back\nBut I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness\nIf I'm trying to fuckin' win this\nI will not get winded, I have not rescinded\nAnything that I've fucking said\nBy the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead\nI'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds\nThat is like Right Said Fred\nYou just gotta relax\nIf you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe\nI don't get lyrical cataracts\nSo I can see clearly, so I can be dearly\nReceived, I've got to achieve\nWhatever I've got up my sleeve\nWhatever I've got in my pouch\nShoutout to pouch, ouch\nI pricked my finger, that is not true\nBut on this mic I will linger for you\nAnd for my crew\nThis is what I've got to do\nI've got to drop it hot for you\n'Cause this is why I'm hot\nThis is why I'm not\nShoutout to Mims\nShoutout to Hims\nThat's that brand of underwear\nThat I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway\nI'm drivin' down the one way\nI'm cruisin' up the runway\nSpreading my wings\nLike I am a Cessna\nLike I am a chestnut\nRoastin' on an open fire, bing!\nCrosby, you got me\nMe, hot see?\nMe Watsky\nSee?\nSittin' in the hot seat\nNo, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat\nBut that word, beats droppin' me\nAnd meha coppin'\nShoutout to Frank Macoppin\nPlayground\nIn the fuckin' San Francisco SFC\nBecause you know how this go\nWe are the best in Dolores Park\nWe have a chorus singin' in the dark\nHark, the angel\nShoutout to Chuck Rangel\nRangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but\nIn December maybe I will be dismembered\nBy a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa\nComin' down my chimney\nWavin' fuckin' butcher knives\nThat\u2019d be fucking crazy\nWho is he\nWho is this robotic crazy Santa\nOh my \u2018lanta\nI can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s tryna get me\nInstead of giving me presents\nI can't believe that he got me on the ground\nBut I'm like \"no I'm Watsky\"\nAnd Santa said \"oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude\"\nBut I'm like \"that's rude\nSanta you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'\nPlus I was in the nude\nHe got me tackled on the ground\nMy fuckin' whole brood around me\nAnd I got my whole butt out\nHe's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away\nCut-out\nCut it out like on Full House\nJohn Stamos\nJohn Stains-Most in his pants\nBut that's okay\nWe don't judge people who like to dance away the day\nIf they need a Pepto-Bismol\nMy throat is not abysmal\nThis all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt\nI will not repent\nAnd I\u2019m not demented\nBut I meant it\nWhen I sent it\nFrom my brain\nI'm not plain\nIm not fuckin' around\nI\u2019m not cluckin' the ground\nJust right there it\u2019s only two feet\nThat\u2019s pretty cool man I eat\nFrom that cup right there\nThe one that\u2019s floatin' up in the air\nIt\u2019s got a fuckin' strawber-\n-ry smoothie\nI flow very smoothly\nBut you cannot do me\nDo me, do me like that\nI got that roomie type rap\nIt\u2019s mad philosophical\nI just keep on droppin' all\nOf the marbles in my brain\nThey\u2019re comin' out my nose\nAnd then they just remain\nOn the ground\nEven the cat\u2019s eye\nThat is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by\nDid you know at places\nPeople on the internet watch marble races\nI watched one\nIt was mad fun\nI picked the fuckin' blue marble\nAnd my pick wasn't all garbled\nIt came down the shoot\nIt was going all fuckin' cool\nAnd then it fuckin scooted past the red one\nThat kid from The Shining like Red-Rum\nMeaning murder\nWorder\nWordier\nAll my flows are so dirtier\nThan you could even fuckin' guess\nI'm not even fucking stressed\nI'm so damn relaxy\nShout out to a Maxi-Pad\nFor being so absorbent\nThat's a good fuckin' fuction\nMy girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it\nPut her hands in the air\nMaxi Pads doing what they do down there\nIf you are shaved or if you've got hair\nIt doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare\nDo what you wanna\nWord to your mama\nYour dude can't tell you what you gotta do\nGotta do what you wanna\nMake your own choice\nWith your body or your voice\nIf you are moist\nI know some people don't like that word\nPalabra\nBut you know you gotta like what you like\nThere was this one time this dude named Ike\nRan to be Prez\nAnd he fuckin' won\nEisenhower, that's what I said\nI's a power-rapper\nYes I am\nSo fuckin' dapper\nThe clapper\nDoesn't work on the lights on this green screen\nMan, that would be a dream scene\nIf I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want\nWhat I want, damn\nThat would be no scam\nI don't eat no Spam\nThat's 'cause I am a soft boy\nAnd I only eat Bok-Choy\n'Cause I'm a little veggie human\nAnd that's what I be doin'\nLet me clarify\nLike clarified butter\nAgain, word to your mother\nAnd also not to digress\nBut I gotta get it off of my chest\nWord to Mark Wahlberg\nWord to ballers\nWait, okay, let me make my main point\nAs I rap over this joint\nAnd that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy\nI also eat soy\nI also as a Jewish type dude not a goy\nGet lots of joy out of eatin' carrots\nOut of eatin' broccoli\nOut of eatin' lots of trees\nOut of smokin' lots of trees\nThat is true\nThat is not\nI don't smoke a lot\nBut I do when I party\nBut during COVID, I party hardly\nAnd I guess that's kinda sad\nBut I've had some calls with my dad\nPaul Watsky\nAnd Claire Watsky\nIt's rare, stop me\nIt's not, lots of Sundays\nI call my parentals\nAnd I just steal out my fuckin' mentals\nBut I don't pull out my dentals\nI go sometimes I do in a dream\nWhen I am on the scene\nAnd the ghost come and make me scream\nIt's like you are doing the most\nAnd I gotta fuckin' boast\nShout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast\nThat is some shit if you take a gander\nThat was said by Mr. Ned Flanders\nMr. Homer Simpson\nI'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on\nThey're like \u201cWatsky, I'll do everything for you\nI'll white knight for you and your fucking crew\u201d\nI'm like \u201cDude, don't be a simp\nActually, DO be a simp\nYou could be pimp\nYou could be wimp\nYou could fucking walk with a limp\nYou can have a crimp in your dimp-le\u201d\nI just get the whole tent pole\nUp in the sky cause I meant\nLots of people can come in\nCause I got a big tent\nSo if you are a lame\nFucking get bent\nAnd by lame, what I mean in this game\nIs the type of person who says that you're lame\nIs the type of person who judges\nIs the type of person who never budges\nWhen they get stubborn\nCause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard\n[?] 00:18:04\nWord!\nI think I got this whole thing turn-ed up\nBut that is bound to happen\n34 hours when you keep on rappin'\nSome words are going to collide like trains\nComing head to head, but it remains\nTo be seen that I get back on the track\nWith the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*\nWith my fucking clapping gums\nSo don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb\nSometimes\nCause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes\nBut it happens and I think that is the lesson\nThat you cannot achieve perfection\nAnd it's not even a worthy goal\nYou just gotta try to put that ball in the hole\nMore times than not\nThis is why I'm hot, as I said\nBut, you know Man's Not Hot?\nAlthough the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am\n'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham\nOn the microphone-o oh no\nCan't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno\nIce skatin' all over the beat\nMakin' it repeat\nI do not want to beat my meat, on the camera\nThat would be a bad fuckin' PR move\nWhen I'm all up in the groove with my meat out\nThey would be like \"oh, shout out\nThat will ruin my career\nIs that fuckin' clear?\nShowin' his whole rear?\nHe got fuckin' nakey\nMake me, take me\nYou cannot bake me\nIn my EZ bake oven\nNo Sara Lee\nI just keep on flowing, so merrily\nVerily, forsooth, did he do that shit\nOh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it\nHe's just Frank Coppin it\nAnd there is no halting' it\nI just put some fuckin malt in it\nMake it like some Yoo-hoo\nYoo-hoo!\nDid you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed\n[00:20:00]\n'Cause you could not rhyme\nLike I do, do the crime and you know that I'm\nJust puttin' lime on top of this shit\nAnd that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me\n'Cause you know when I put it on top\nThat I am going to make it drop\nTo the bottom of the urinal\nYou're all in my brain\nAnd I'm hearing y'all\nBut I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments\nI be too scared to see the tools\nBut I got to just remain bold\nAnd I've got to stay in the hold\nMy whole nuts life, oh, my nuts\nRemember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?\nRemember jungle?\n[00:20:41]\n\n[00:30:00]\nThey got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate\nVerbally, vocally, stoking the fire\nOf the couress I retired\nI feel one year\n'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear\nSee how I could sing, that took many years\nBefore I try to do with the din\nAnd now I only rapped\nAnd now I only try to cap, no cap\nI just try to get that back\nThat back, uh, back\nAnd I'm gone\nOver the fence\nNo shout out to my pens\n\nYou know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda\n\n[00:40:00]\nI'm sittin' on the veranda\nJust sippin' on my water\nLookin' at my ink blotter\nFeelin' like the best\nStarin' at my Rorschach test\nAnd it's tellin' me some dark crap\nIt's tellin' some star type of stuff\nLike oh shit, I'm gruff\nI'm like

have much fizz\nAlthough at some point I have to drink the redbull-y\nAnd then you will have to pull me\nUp\nOn my ass from the couch\nAnd I don't know if I doubt\nMyself\nI just drop these lyrical

lay low any other man who may intrude on our love\nThree\nRemember to kiss and caress me\nHonor and obey me, in my every whim and fancy\nSeven days a week and twice on Sundays\nBecause at no time will I ever be tired 0f I-T \"it\"\nFour\nHonor my name, so that every other woman may honor it also\nFive\nThou shall not provoke me to anger\nOr my wrath will descend upon you heavily\nCommandment Six\nThou shall not search my pockets at night\nOr annoy me with your hearsays\nCommandment Seven\nThou shall not shout my name in the streets\nIf I am walking with another woman\nBut wait intelligently until I come home\nThen we can both have it out decently\nFor I am your man, a funny man\nAnd detest a scandal in public places\nCommandment Eight\nThou shall not drink, or smoke\nNor use profane language\nFor those bad habits I will not stand for\nNine\nThou shall not commit adultery\nFor the world will not hold me guilty if I commit murder\nTen\nThou shall not covet thy neighbor's dress\nNor her shoes, nor her bureau, nor her bed, nor her hat\nNor anything that's hers\nNeither shall thou call my attention to anything that may be for sale\nIn any stores, for I will not give thee anything\nBut what you actually need for your purpose\nThese are the ten commandments from man\nGiven to woman\nBy me, Prince BusterYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

last girls was too thick\nHow you expect me to hit?\nYou wanna watch Clueless\nI wanna watch Foolish\nExcuse me, miss, I don't appreciate your rudeness\nBut if you strip, I will appreciate your nudeness\nI heard the best head come from girls that is toothless\nYeah my game ruthless, yeah my car roofless\nSpit that \"Through The Wire\" over Chaka Khan, ruthless\nShe said she had a friend look like Janet Jackson\nThat bitch came over lookin' more like Freddie Jackson\nNah, nah, nah, baby, won't be no time for no action\nI'm just gon' play this \"Slow Jamz,\" holla at your man\n[Verse 2]\nOld school like Melle Mel\nOr we could go to the D where Drelle Drel\nOr DC, PG, or ATL\nBack in Chi, I mean my life like a magazine\nHoney wanna know the details about my ebony\nWell that's XXL\nFather penthouse, yeah that's upscale\nMademoiselle got a hell of a black tail\nI'm feelin' the vibe, her body and soul\nI heard you stay in a metropolitan home\nWell let's kill all the pollyin', I offer you a Cosmopolitan\nLet's jet out the club, get some oxygen\nYour friends say I'm a player, you'd be lucky to keep me\nYou know people gon' be talkin' 'bout us weekly\nMy car be in a robbery\nP-O-R-T but what's more important to me is that\nDon't be comin' 'round my girl tryna act like Mr. Friendly\nAnd steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley\nI spotted her like Spud McKenzie\nAnd for them fake boobies, I paid them Benjis\nGet your own\nI got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get him a clone\nHe said, \"Ye, you know you got extra hoes\nAnd everything you do is extra cold\"\nFrom the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece\nI got family in high places like Jesus niece\nCan I please say my peace?\nIf y'all fresh to death then I'm deceased\nAnd this one here is a heat rock, spit like a beatbox\nThe way the beat rocks, new version of Pete Rock\nBut for that Benz I get CL love\nSo I switched my girls around like 3L dub\nMy favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend\nMy freak girl told me now she's a Christian\nMy white girl wanna move back to Michigan\nI'm pullin' girls off the bench like a 6th man\nI'm in the club pullin' the same old two step\nWhile Omegas doin' the same old Q step\nI had my money on my mind, I was thinkin' green\nShe a pledge, AKA, she was pink and green\nI want a good girl, she want a gentleman\nWe sayin' the same thing like a synonym\nI wasn't really spittin' game, I was scrimmagin'\nMy penmanship is so hard it needs censorship\nI'm a Chicagoan 'til Chicago wins\n'Til we blow like Chicago wind\nI don't know what's better, gettin' laid or gettin' paid\nI just know when I'm gettin' one the other's gettin' away\nI have to say, we goin' to mass today\nWe have to pray, these niggas is wack and aye I have to say\nSince Pac passed away\nMost these niggas don't even deserve a track from me\nFirst of all, let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots\nAnd get your tall ass out that C-Class coupe\nYou see the whiskey, had them

Verdurin had taken under her patronage that year, and of whom she said \"Really, it oughtn't to be allowed, to play Wagner as well as that!\" left both Plant\u00e9 and Rubinstein 'sitting'; while Dr. Cottard was a more brilliant diagnostician than Potain. Each 'new recruit' whom the Verdurins failed to persuade that the evenings spent by other people, in other houses than theirs, were as dull as ditch-water, saw himself banished forthwith. Women being in this respect more rebellious than men, more reluctant to lay aside all worldly curiosity and the desire to find out for themselves whether other drawing-rooms might not sometimes be as entertaining, and the Verdurins feeling, moreover, that this critical spirit and this demon of frivolity might, by their contagion, prove fatal to the orthodoxy of the little church, they had been obliged to expel, one after another, all those of the 'faithful' who were of the female sex\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from the doctor's young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively that season (for all that Mme. Verdurin herself was a thoroughly 'good' woman, and came of a respectable middle-class family, excessively rich and wholly undistinguished, with which she had gradually and of her own accord severed all connection) to a young woman almost of a 'certain class,' a Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy, whom Mme. Verdurin called by her Christian name, Odette, and pronounced a 'love,' and to the pianist's aunt, who looked as though she had, at one period, 'answered the bell': ladies quite ignorant of the world, who in their social simplicity were so easily led to believe that the Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse de Guermantes were obliged to pay large sums of money to other poor wretches, in order to have anyone at their dinner-parties, that if somebody had offered to procure them an invitation to the house of either of those great dames, the old doorkeeper and the woman of 'easy virtue' would have contemptuously declined\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verdurins never invited you to dinner; you had your 'place laid' there. There was never any programme for the evening's entertainment. The young pianist would play, but only if he felt inclined, for no one was forced to do anything, and, as M. Verdurin used to say: \"We're all friends here. Liberty Hall, you know!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the pianist suggested playing the Ride of the Valkyries, or the Prelude to Tristan, Mme. Verdurin would protest, not that the music was displeasing to her, but, on the contrary, that it made too violent an impression. \"Then you want me to have one of my headaches? You know quite well, it's the same every time he plays that. I know what I'm in for. Tomorrow, when I want to get up\u2014nothing doing!\" If he was not going to play they talked, and one of the friends\u2014usually the painter who was in favour there that year\u2014would \"spin,\" as M. Verdurin put it, \"a damned funny yarn that made 'em all split with laughter,\" and especially Mme. Verdurin, for whom\u2014so strong was her habit of taking literally the figurative accounts of her emotions\u2014Dr. Cottard, who was then just starting in general practice, would \"really have to come one day and set her jaw, which she had dislocated with laughing too much.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Evening dress was barred, because you were all 'good pals,' and didn't want to look like the 'boring people' who were to be avoided like the plague, and only asked to the big evenings, which were given as seldom as possible, and then only if it would amuse the painter or make the musician better known. The rest of the time you were quite happy playing charades and having supper in fancy dress, and there was no need to mingle any strange element with the little 'clan.'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But just as the 'good pals' came to take a more and more prominent place in Mme. Verdurin's life, so the 'bores,' the 'nuisances' grew to include everybody and everything that kept her friends away from her, that made them sometimes plead 'previous engagements,' the mother of one, the professional duties of another, the 'little place in the country' of a third. If Dr. Cottard felt bound to say good night as soon as they rose from table, so as to go back to some patient who was seriously ill; \"I don't know,\" Mme. Verdurin would say, \"I'm sure it will do him far more good if you don't go disturbing him again this evening; he will have a good night without you; to-morrow morning you can go round early and you will find him cured.\" From the beginning of December it would make her quite ill to think that the 'faithful' might fail her on Christmas and New Year's Days. The pianist's aunt insisted that he must accompany her, on the latter, to a family dinner at her mother's\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You don't suppose she'll die, your mother,\" exclaimed Mme. Verdurin bitterly, \"if you don't have dinner with her on New Year's Day, like people in the provinces!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her uneasiness was kindled again in Holy Week: \"Now you, Doctor, you're a sensible, broad-minded man; you'll come, of course, on Good Friday, just like any other day?\" she said to Cottard in the first year of the little 'nucleus,' in a loud and confident voice, as though there could be no doubt of his answer. But she trembled as she waited for it, for if he did not come she might find herself condemned to dine alone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I shall come on Good Friday\u2014to say good-bye to you, for we are going to spend the holidays in Auvergne.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In Auvergne? To be eaten by fleas and all sorts of creatures! A fine lot of good that will do you!\" And after a solemn pause: \"If you had only told us, we would have tried to get up a party, and all gone there together, comfortably.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, too, if one of the 'faithful' had a friend, or one of the ladies a young man, who was liable, now and then, to make them miss an evening, the Verdurins, who were not in the least afraid of a woman's having a lover, provided that she had him in their company, loved him in their company and did not prefer him to their company, would say: \"Very well, then, bring your friend along.\" And he would be put to the test, to see whether he was willing to have no secrets from Mme. Verdurin, whether he was susceptible of being enrolled in the 'little clan.' If he failed to pass, the faithful one who had introduced him would be taken on one side, and would be tactfully assisted to quarrel with the friend or mistress. But if the test proved satisfactory, the newcomer would in turn be numbered among the 'faithful.' And so when, in the course of this same year, the courtesan told M. Verdurin that she had made the acquaintance of such a charming gentleman, M. Swann, and hinted that he would very much like to be allowed to come, M. Verdurin carried the request at once to his wife. He never formed an opinion on any subject until she had formed hers, his special duty being to carry out her wishes and those of the 'faithful' generally, which he did with boundless ingenuity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dear, Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy has something to say to you. She would like to bring one of her friends here, a M. Swann. What do you say?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, as if anybody could refuse anything to a little piece of perfection like that. Be quiet; no one asked your opinion. I tell you that you are a piece of perfection.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just as you like,\" replied Odette, in an affected tone, and then went on: \"You know I'm not fishing for compliments.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Very well; bring your friend, if he's nice.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now there was no connection whatsoever between the 'little nucleus' and the society which Swann frequented, and a purely worldly man would have thought it hardly worth his while, when occupying so exceptional a position in the world, to seek an introduction to the Verdurins. But Swann was so ardent a lover that, once he had got to know almost all the women of the aristocracy, once they had taught him all that there was to learn, he had ceased to regard those naturalisation papers, almost a patent of nobility, which the Faubourg Saint-Germain had bestowed upon him, save as a sort of negotiable bond, a letter of credit with no intrinsic value, which allowed him to improvise a status for himself in some little hole in the country, or in some obscure quarter of Paris, where the good-looking daughter of a local squire or solicitor had taken his fancy. For at such times desire, or love itself, would revive in him a feeling of vanity from which he was now quite free in his everyday life, although it was, no doubt, the same feeling which had originally prompted him towards that career as a man of fashion in which he had squandered his intellectual gifts upon frivolous amusements, and had made use of his erudition in matters of art only to advise society ladies what pictures to buy and how to decorate their houses; and this vanity it was which made him eager to shine, in the sight of any fair unknown who had captivated him for the moment, with a brilliance which the name of Swann by itself did not emit. And he was most eager when the fair unknown was in humble circumstances. Just as it is not by other men of intelligence that an intelligent man is afraid of being thought a fool, so it is not by the great gentleman but by boors and 'bounders' that a man of fashion is afraid of finding his social value underrated. Three-fourths of the mental ingenuity displayed, of the social falsehoods scattered broadcast ever since the world began by people whose importance they have served only to diminish, have been aimed at inferiors. And Swann, who behaved quite simply and was at his ease when with a duchess, would tremble^ for fear of being despised, and would instantly begin to pose, were he to meet her grace's maid\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike so many people, who, either from lack of energy or else from a resigned sense of the obligation laid upon them by their social grandeur to remain moored like houseboats to a certain point on the bank of the stream of life, abstain from the pleasures which are offered to them above and below that point, that degree in life in which they will remain fixed until the day of their death, and are content, in the end, to describe as pleasures, for want of any better, those mediocre distractions, that just not intolerable tedium which is enclosed there with them; Swann would endeavour not to find charm and beauty in the women with whom he must pass time, but to pass his time among women whom he had already found to be beautiful and charming. And these were, as often as not, women whose beauty was of a distinctly 'common' type, for the physical qualities which attracted him instinctively, and without reason, were the direct opposite of those that he admired in the women painted or sculptured by his favourite masters. Depth of character, or a melancholy expression on a woman's face would freeze his senses, which would, however, immediately melt at the sight of healthy, abundant, rosy human flesh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If on his travels he met a family whom it would have been more correct for him to make no attempt to know, but among whom a woman caught his eye, adorned with a special charm that was new to him, to remain on his 'high horse' and to cheat the desire that she had kindled in him, to substitute a pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in her company by writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come and join him, would have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication in the face of life, as stupid a renunciation of a new form of happiness as if, instead of visiting the country where he was, he had shut himself up in his own rooms and looked at 'views' of Paris. He did not immure himself in the solid structure of his social relations, but had made of them, so as to be able to set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman might take his fancy, one of those collapsible tents which explorers carry about with them. Any part of it which was not portable or could not be adapted to some fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless, however enviable it might appear to others. How often had his credit with a duchess, built up of the yearly accumulation of her desire to do him some favour for which she had never found an opportunity, been squandered in a moment by his calling upon her, in an indiscreetly worded message, for a recommendation by telegraph which would put him in touch at once with one of her agents whose daughter he had noticed in the country, just as a starving man might barter a diamond for a crust of bread. Indeed, when it was too late, he would laugh at himself for it, for there was in his nature, redeemed by many rare refinements, an element of clownishness. Then he belonged to that class of intelligent men who have led a life of idleness, and who seek consolation and, perhaps, an excuse in the idea, which their idleness offers to their intelligence, of objects as worthy of their interest as any that could be attained by art or learning, the idea that 'Life' contains situations more interesting and more romantic than all the romances ever written. So, at least, he would assure and had no difficulty in persuading the more subtle among his friends in the fashionable world, notably the Baron de Charlus, whom he liked to amuse with stories of the startling adventures that had befallen him, such as when he had met a woman in the train, and had taken her home with him, before discovering that she was the sister of a reigning monarch, in whose hands were gathered, at that moment, all the threads of European politics, of which he found himself kept informed in the most delightful fashion, or when, in the complexity of circumstances, it depended upon the choice which the Conclave was about to make whether he might or might not become the lover of somebody's cook\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals and academicians, to whom he was bound by such close ties, that Swann compelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders. All his friends were accustomed to receive, from time to time, letters which called on them for a word of recommendation or introduction, with a diplomatic adroitness which, persisting throughout all his successive 'affairs' and using different pretexts, revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest indiscretion, a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest. I used often to recall to myself when, many years later, I began to take an interest in his character because of the similarities which, in wholly different respects, it offered to my own, how, when he used to write to my grandfather (though not at the time we are now considering, for it was about the date of my own birth that Swann's great 'affair' began, and made a long interruption in his amatory practices) the latter, recognising his friend's handwriting on the envelope, would exclaim: \"Here is Swann asking for something; on guard!\" And, either from distrust or from the unconscious spirit of devilry which urges us to offer a thing only to those who do not want it, my grandparents would meet with an obstinate refusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers, as when he begged them for an introduction to a girl who dined with us every Sunday, and whom they were obliged, whenever Swann mentioned her, to pretend that they no longer saw, although they would be wondering, all through the week, whom they could invite to meet her, and often failed, in the end, to find anyone, sooner than make a sign to him who would so gladly have accepted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally a couple of my grandparents' acquaintance, who had been complaining for some time that they never saw Swann now, would announce with satisfaction, and perhaps with a slight inclination to make my grandparents envious of them, that he had suddenly become as charming as he could possibly be, and was never out of their house. My grandfather would not care to shatter their pleasant illusion, but would look at my grandmother, as he hummed the air of:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  What is this mystery?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I cannot understand it;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or of:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Vision fugitive...;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  In matters such as this\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'Tis best to close one's eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann's new friend \"What about Swann? Do you still see as much of him as ever?\" the other's face would lengthen: \"Never mention his name to me again!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I thought that you were such friends...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins of my grandmother, dining almost every evening at their house. Suddenly, and without any warning, he ceased to appear. They supposed him to be ill, and the lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him when, in her kitchen, she found a letter in his hand, which her cook had left by accident in the housekeeping book. In this he announced that he was leaving Paris and would not be able to come to the house again. The cook had been his mistress, and at the moment of breaking off relations she was the only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary to inform\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But when his mistress for the time being was a woman in society, or at least one whose birth was not so lowly, nor her position so irregular that he was unable to arrange for her reception in 'society,' then for her sake he would return to it, but only to the particular orbit in which she moved or into which he had drawn her. \"No good depending on Swann for this evening,\" people would say; \"don't you remember, it's his American's night at the Opera?\" He would secure invitations for her to the most exclusive drawing-rooms, to those houses where he himself went regularly, for weekly dinners or for poker; every evening, after a slight 'wave' imparted to his stiffly brushed red locks had tempered with a certain softness the ardour of his bold green eyes, he would select a flower for his buttonhole and set out to meet his mistress at the house of one or other of the women of his circle; and then, thinking of the affection and admiration which the fashionable folk, whom he always treated exactly as he pleased, would, when he met them there, lavish upon him in the presence of the woman whom he loved, he would find a fresh charm in that worldly existence of which he had grown weary, but whose substance, pervaded and warmly coloured by the flickering light which he had slipped into its midst, seemed to him beautiful and rare, now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But while each of these attachments, each of these flirtations had been the realisation, more or less complete, of a dream born of the sight of a face or a form which Swann had spontaneously, and without effort on his part, found charming, it was quite another matter when, one day at the theatre, he was introduced to Odette de Cr\u00e9cy by an old friend of his own, who had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom he might very possibly come to an understanding; but had made her out to be harder of conquest than she actually was, so as to appear to be conferring a special favour by the introduction. She had struck Swann not, certainly, as being devoid of beauty, but as endowed with a style of beauty which left him indifferent, which aroused in him no desire, which gave him, indeed, a sort of physical repulsion; as one of those women of whom every man can name some, and each will name different examples, who are the converse of the type which our senses demand. To give him any pleasure her profile was too sharp, her skin too delicate, her cheek-bones too prominent, her features too tightly drawn. Her eyes were fine, but so large that they seemed to be bending beneath their own weight, strained the rest of her face and always made her appear unwell or in an ill humour. Some time after this introduction at the theatre she had written to ask Swann whether she might see his collections, which would interest her so much, she, \"an ignorant woman with a taste for beautiful things,\" saying that she would know him better when once she had seen him in his 'home,' where she imagined him to be \"so comfortable with his tea and his books\"; although she had not concealed her surprise at his being in that part of the town, which must be so depressing, and was \"not nearly smart enough for such a very smart man.\" And when he allowed her to come she had said to him as she left how sorry she was to have stayed so short a time in a house into which she was so glad to have found her way at last, speaking of him as though he had meant something more to her than the rest of the people she knew, and appearing to unite their two selves with a kind of romantic bond which had made him smile. But at the time of life, tinged already with disenchantment, which Swann was approaching, when a man can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting too much in return, this linking of hearts, if it is no longer, as in early youth, the goal towards which love, of necessity, tends, still is bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it may well become the cause of love if it presents itself first. In his younger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he loves; later, the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be enough to make him fall in love with her. And 50, at an age when it would appear\u2014since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective pleasure\u2014that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part in its procreation, love may come into being, love of the most physical order, without any foundation in desire. At this time of life a man has already been wounded more than once by the darts of love; it no longer evolves by itself, obeying its own incomprehensible and fatal laws, before his passive and astonished heart. We come to its aid; we falsify it by memory and by suggestion; recognising one of its symptoms we recall and recreate the rest. Since we possess its hymn, engraved on our hearts in its entirety, there is no need of any woman to repeat the opening lines, potent with the admiration which her beauty inspires, for us to remember all that follows. And if she begin in the middle, where it sings of our existing, henceforward, for one another only, we are well enough attuned to that music to be able to take it up and follow our partner, without hesitation, at the first pause in her voice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Odette de Cr\u00e9cy came again to see Swann; her visits grew more frequent, and doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he felt at the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in the interval, not remembering it as either so expressive or, in spite of her youth, so faded; he used to regret, while she was talking to him, that her really considerable beauty was not of the kind which he spontaneously admired. It must be remarked that Odette's face appeared thinner and more prominent than it actually was, because her forehead and the upper part of her cheeks, a single and almost plane surface, were covered by the masses of hair which women wore at that period, drawn forward in a fringe, raised in crimped waves and falling in stray locks over her ears; while as for her figure, and she was admirably built, it was impossible to make out its continuity (on account of the fashion then prevailing, and in spite of her being one of the best-dressed women in Paris) for the corset, jetting forwards in an arch, as though over an imaginary stomach, and ending in a sharp point, beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts, gave a woman, that year, the appearance of being composed of different sections badly fitted together; to such an extent did the frills, the flounces, the inner bodice follow, in complete independence, controlled only by the fancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material, the line which led them to the knots of ribbon, falls of lace, fringes of vertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust, but nowhere attached themselves to the living creature, who, according as the architecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her own, found herself either strait-laced to suffocation or else completely buried\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, after Odette had left him, Swann would think with a smile of her telling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again; he remembered the anxious, timid way in which she had once begged him that it might not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at him then, fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her a touching air beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in the front of her round bonnet of white straw, tied with strings of black velvet. \"And won't you,\" she had ventured, \"come just once and take tea with me?\" He had pleaded pressure of work, an essay\u2014which, in reality, he had abandoned years ago\u2014on Vermeer of Delft. \"I know that I am quite useless,\" she had replied, \"a little wild thing like me beside a learned great man like you. I should be like the frog in the fable! And yet I should so much like to learn, to know things, to be initiated. What fun it would be to become a regular bookworm, to bury my nose in a lot of old papers!\" she had gone on, with that self-satisfied air which a smart woman adopts when she insists that her one desire is to give herself up, without fear of soiling her fingers, to some unclean task, such as cooking the dinner, with her \"hands right in the dish itself.\" \"You will only laugh at me, but this painter who stops you from seeing me,\" she meant Vermeer, \"I have never even heard of him; is he alive still? Can I see any of his things in Paris, so as to have some idea of what is going on behind that great brow which works so hard, that head which I feel sure is always puzzling away about things; just to be able to say 'There, that's what he's thinking about!' What a dream it would be to be able to help you with your work.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had sought an excuse in his fear of forming new friendships, which he gallantly described as his fear of a hopeless passion. \"You are afraid of falling in love? How funny that is, when I go about seeking nothing else, and would give my soul just to find a little love somewhere!\" she had said, so naturally and with such an air of conviction that he had been genuinely touched. \"Some woman must have made you suffer. And you think that the rest are all like her. She can't have understood you: you are so utterly different from ordinary men. That's what I liked about you when I first saw you; I felt at once that you weren't like everybody else.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And then, besides, there's yourself\u2014\u2014\" he had continued, \"I know what women are; you must have a whole heap of things to do, and never any time to spare.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I? Why, I have never anything to do. I am always free, and I always will be free if you want me. At whatever hour of the day or night it may suit you to see me, just send for me, and I shall be only too delighted to come. Will you do that? Do you know what I should really like\u2014to introduce you to Mme. Verdurin, where I go every evening. Just fancy my finding you there, and thinking that it was a little for my sake that you had gone.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt, in thus remembering their conversations, in thinking about her thus when he was alone, he did no more than call her image into being among those of countless other women in his romantic dreams; but if, thanks to some accidental circumstance (or even perhaps without that assistance, for the circumstance which presents itself at the moment when a mental state, hitherto latent, makes itself felt, may well have had no influence whatsoever upon that state), the image of Odette de Cr\u00e9cy came to absorb the whole of his dreams, if from those dreams the memory of her could no longer be eliminated, then her bodily imperfections would no longer be of the least importance, nor would the conformity of her body, more or less than any other, to the requirements of Swann's taste; since, having become the body of her whom he loved, it must henceforth be the only one capable of causing him joy or anguish\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It so happened that my grandfather had known\u2014which was more than could be said of any other actual acquaintance\u2014the family of these Verdurins. But he had entirely severed his connection with what he called \"young Verdurin,\" taking a general view of him as one who had fallen\u2014though without losing hold of his millions\u2014among the riff-raff of Bohemia. One day he received a letter from Swann asking whether my grandfather could put him in touch with the Verdurins. \"On guard! on guard!\" he exclaimed as he read it, \"I am not at all surprised; Swann was bound to finish up like this. A nice lot of people! I cannot do what he asks, because, in the first place, I no longer know the gentleman in question. Besides, there must be a woman in it somewhere, and I don't mix myself up in such matters. Ah, well, we shall see some fun if Swann begins running after the little Verdurins.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And on my grandfather's refusal to act as sponsor, it was Odette herself who had taken Swann to the house\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verdurins had had dining with them, on the day when Swann made his first appearance, Dr. and Mme. Cottard, the young pianist and his aunt, and the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course of the evening, by several more of the 'faithful.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to reply to any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or in earnest. And so in any event he would embellish all his facial expressions with the offer of a conditional, a provisional smile whose expectant subtlety would exonerate him from the charge of being a simpleton, if the remark addressed to him should turn out to have been facetious. But as he must also be prepared to face the alternative, he never dared to allow this smile a definite expression on his features, and you would see there a perpetually flickering uncertainty, in which you might decipher the question that he never dared to ask: \"Do you really mean that?\" He was no more confident of the manner in which he ought to conduct himself in the street, or indeed in life generally, than he was in a drawing-room; and he might be seen greeting passers-by, carriages, and anything that occurred with a malicious smile which absolved his subsequent behaviour of all impropriety, since it proved, if it should turn out unsuited to the occasion, that he was well aware of that, and that if he had assumed a smile, the jest was a secret of his own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On all those points, however, where a plain question appeared to him to be permissible, the Doctor was unsparing in his endeavours to cultivate the wilderness of his ignorance and uncertainty and so to complete his education\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So it was that, following the advice given him by a wise mother on his first coming up to the capital from his provincial home, he would never let pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him without an effort to secure the fullest information upon it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards figures of speech, he was insatiable in his thirst for knowledge, for often imagining them to have a more definite meaning than was actually the case, he would want to know what, exactly, was intended by those which he most frequently heard used: 'devilish pretty,' 'blue blood,' 'a cat and dog life,' 'a day of reckoning,' 'a queen of fashion, 'to give a free hand,' 'to be at a deadlock,' and so forth; and in what particular circumstances he himself might make use of them in conversation. Failing these, he would adorn it with puns and other 'plays upon words' which he had learned by rote. As for the names of strangers which were uttered in his hearing, he used merely to repeat them to himself in a questioning tone, which, he thought, would suffice to furnish him with explanations for which he would not ostensibly seek\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the critical faculty, on the universal application of which he prided himself, was, in reality, completely lacking, that refinement of good breeding which consists in assuring some one whom you are obliging in any way, without expecting to be believed, that it is really yourself that is obliged to him, was wasted on Cottard, who took everything that he heard in its literal sense. However blind she may have been to his faults, Mme. Verdurin was genuinely annoyed, though she still continued to regard him as brilliantly clever, when, after she had invited him to see and hear Sarah Bernhardt from a stage box, and had said politely: \"It is very good of you to have come, Doctor, especially as I'm sure you must often have heard Sarah Bernhardt; and besides, I'm afraid we're rather too near the stage,\" the Doctor, who had come into the box with a smile which waited before settling upon or vanishing from his face until some one in authority should enlighten him as to the merits of the spectacle, replied: \"To be sure, we are far too near the stage, and one is getting sick of Sarah Bernhardt. But you expressed a wish that I should come. For me, your wish is a command. I am only too glad to be able to do you this little service. What would one not do to please you, you are so good.\" And he went on, \"Sarah Bernhardt; that's what they call the Voice of God, ain't it? You see, often, too, that she 'sets the boards on fire.' That's an odd expression, ain't it?\" in the hope of an enlightening commentary, which, however, was not forthcoming\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"D'you know,\" Mme. Verdurin had said to her husband, \"I believe we are going the wrong way to work when we depreciate anything we offer the Doctor. He is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday existence; he knows nothing himself of what things are worth, and he accepts everything that we say as gospel.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I never dared to mention it,\" M. Verdurin had answered, \"but I've noticed the same thing myself.\" And on the following New Year's Day, instead of sending Dr. Cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs, and pretending that it was a mere trifle, M. Verdurin bought an artificial stone for three hundred, and let it be understood that it was something almost impossible to match\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Mme. Verdurin had announced that they were to see M. Swann that evening; \"Swann!\" the Doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal by his astonishment, for the smallest piece of news would always take utterly unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in readiness for anything. And seeing that no one answered him, \"Swann! Who on earth is Swann?\" he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided as soon as Mme. Verdurin had explained, \"Why, Odette's friend, whom she told us about.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,\" answered the Doctor, at once mollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of Swann's appearing at the Verdurins', because he supposed him to be in love with Odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings. \"Nothing amuses me more than match-making,\" he confided to Cottard; \"I have been tremendously successful, even with women!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In telling the Verdurins that Swann was extremely 'smart,' Odette had alarmed them with the prospect of another 'bore.' When he arrived, however, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which, though they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best society. He had, indeed, one of those advantages which men who have lived and moved in the world enjoy over others, even men of intelligence and refinement, who have never gone into society, namely that they no longer see it transfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills the imagination, but regard it as quite unimportant. Their good nature, freed from all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming too friendly, grown independent, in fact, has the ease, the grace of movement of a trained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out precisely the movement that is required without any clumsy participation by the rest of his body. The simple and elementary gestures used by a man of the world when he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown youth who is being introduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before the Ambassador to whom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded, without his being conscious of it, the whole of Swann's social deportment, so that in the company of people of a lower grade than his own, such as the Verdurins and their friends, he instinctively shewed an assiduity, and made overtures with which, by their account, any of their 'bores' would have dispensed. He chilled, though for a moment only, on meeting Dr. Cottard; for seeing him close one eye with an ambiguous smile, before they had yet spoken to one another (a grimace which Cottard styled \"letting 'em all come\"), Swann supposed that the Doctor recognised him from having met him already somewhere, probably in some house of 'ill-fame,' though these he himself very rarely visited, never having made a habit of indulging in the mercenary sort of love. Regarding such an allusion as in bad taste, especially before Odette, whose opinion of himself it might easily alter for the worse, Swann assumed his most icy manner. But when he learned that the lady next to the Doctor was Mme. Cottard, he decided that so young a husband would not deliberately, in his wife's hearing, have made any allusion to amusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the Doctor's expression in the sense which he had at first suspected. The painter at once invited Swann to visit his studio with Odette, and Swann found him very pleasant. \"Perhaps you will be more highly favoured than I have been,\" Mme. Verdurin broke in, with mock resentment of the favour, \"perhaps you will be allowed to see Cottard's portrait\" (for which she had given the painter a commission). \"Take care, Master Biche,\" she reminded the painter, whom it was a time-honoured pleasantry to address as 'Master,' \"to catch that nice look in his eyes, that witty little twinkle. You know, what I want to have most of all is his smile; that's what I've asked you to paint\u2014the portrait of his smile.\" And since the phrase struck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to make sure that as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and even made use of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer before she uttered it again. Swann begged to be introduced to everyone, even to an old friend of the Verdurins, called Saniette, whose shyness, simplicity and good-nature had deprived him of all the consideration due to his skill in palaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished family to which he belonged. When he spoke, his words came with a confusion which was delightful to hear because one felt that it indicated not so much a defect in his speech as a quality of his soul, as it were a survival from the age of innocence which he had never wholly outgrown. All the consonants which he did not manage to pronounce seemed like harsh utterances of which his gentle lips were incapable. By asking to be made known to M. Saniette, Swann made M. Verdurin reverse the usual form of introduction (saying, in fact, with emphasis on the distinction: \"M. Swann, pray let me present to you our friend Saniette\") but he aroused in Saniette himself a warmth of gratitude, which, however, the Verdurins never disclosed to Swann, since Saniette rather annoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him with friends. On the other hand the Verdurins were extremely touched by Swann's next request, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the pianist's aunt. She wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for she believed that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing could be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as it always was for some time after a meal. She bowed to Swann with deference, but drew herself up again with great dignity. As she was entirely uneducated, and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and pronunciation, she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling manner, thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in the surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had actually made it or not; with the result that her talk was a sort of continuous, blurred expectoration, out of which would emerge, at rare intervals, those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive. Swann supposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in conversation with M. Verdurin, who, however, was not at all amused\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She is such an excellent woman!\" he rejoined. \"I grant you that she is not exactly brilliant; but I assure you that she can talk most charmingly when you are alone with her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am sure she can,\" Swann hastened to conciliate him. \"All I meant was that she hardly struck me as 'distinguished,'\" he went on, isolating the epithet in the inverted commas of his tone, \"and, after all, that is something of a compliment.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Wait a moment,\" said M. Verdurin, \"now, this will surprise you; she writes quite delightfully. You have never heard her nephew play? It is admirable; eh, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something, M. Swann?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I should count myself most fortunate...\" Swann was beginning, a trifle pompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it said, and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the use of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a solemn word used seriously, as the word 'fortunate' had been used just now by Swann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately pedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in what he called an old 'tag' or 'saw,' however common it might still be in current usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing was a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation, which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at that point, although in reality it had never entered his mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Most fortunate for France!\" he recited wickedly, shooting up both arms with great vigour. M. Verdurin could not help laughing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What are all those good people laughing at over there? There's no sign of brooding melancholy down in your corner,\" shouted Mme. Verdurin. \"You don't suppose I find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on the stool of repentance,\" she went on peevishly, like a spoiled child\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood, which a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in her drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school 'form,' and 'swore,' as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture which she had besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which her 'faithful' were in the habit of making her from time to time, so that the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to the house. She tried to persuade them to confine their tributes to flowers and sweets, which had at least the merit of mortality; but she was never successful, and the house was gradually filled with a collection of foot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens, barometers and vases, a constant repetition and a boundless incongruity of useless but indestructible objects\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation of the 'faithful,' and would revel in all their fun; but, since the accident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in real hilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which signified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that she was 'laughing until she cried.' At the least witticism aimed by any of the circle against a 'bore,' or against a former member of the circle who was now relegated to the limbo of 'bores'\u2014and to the utter despair of M. Verdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his wife, but who, since his laughter was the 'real thing,' was out of breath in a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a feigned but continuous hilarity\u2014she would utter a shrill cry, shut tight her little bird-like eyes, which were beginning to be clouded over by a cataract, and quickly, as though she had only just time to avoid some indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow, burying her face in her hands, which completely engulfed it, and prevented her from seeing anything at all, she would appear to be struggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh which, were she to give way to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate. So, stupefied with the gaiety of the 'faithful,' drunken with comradeship, scandal and asseveration, Mme. Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a cage-bird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft and sob with fellow-feeling\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile M. Verdurin, after first asking Swann's permission to light his pipe (\"No ceremony here, you understand; we're all pals!\"), went and begged the young musician to sit down at the piano\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Leave him alone; don't bother him; he hasn't come here to be tormented,\" cried Mme. Verdurin. \"I won't have him tormented.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But why on earth should it bother him?\" rejoined M. Verdurin. \"I'm sure M. Swann has never heard the sonata in F sharp which we discovered; he is going to play us the pianoforte arrangement.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no, no, not my sonata!\" she screamed, \"I don't want to be made to cry until I get a cold in the head, and neuralgia all down my face, like last time; thanks very much, I don't intend to repeat that performance; you are all very kind and considerate; it is easy to see that none of you will have to stay in bed, for a week.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This little scene, which was re-enacted as often as the young pianist sat down to play, never failed to delight the audience, as though each of them were witnessing it for the first time, as a proof of the seductive originality of the 'Mistress' as she was styled, and of the acute sensitiveness of her musical 'ear.' Those nearest to her would attract the attention of the rest, who were smoking or playing cards at the other end of the room, by their cries of 'Hear, hear!' which, as in Parliamentary debates, shewed that something worth listening to was being said. And next day they would commiserate with those who had been prevented from coming that evening, and would assure them that the 'little scene' had never been so amusingly done\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, all right, then,\" said M. Verdurin, \"he can play just the andante.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just the andante! How you do go on,\" cried his wife. \"As if it weren't 'just the andante' that breaks every bone in my body. The 'Master' is really too priceless! Just as though, 'in the Ninth,' he said 'we need only have the finale,' or 'just the overture' of the Meistersinger.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Doctor, however, urged Mme. Verdurin to let the pianist play, not because he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the distressing effects that music always had upon her, for he recognised the existence of certain neurasthenic states\u2014but from his habit, common to many doctors, of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription as soon as it appeared to jeopardise, what seemed to him far more important, the success of some social gathering at which he was present, and of which the patient whom he had urged for once to forget her dyspepsia or headache formed an essential factor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You won't be ill this time, you'll find,\" he told her, seeking at the same time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze. \"And, if you are ill, we will cure you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Will you, really?\" Mme. Verdurin spoke as though, with so great a favour in store for her, there was nothing for it but to capitulate. Perhaps, too, by dint of saying that she was going to be ill, she had worked herself into a state in which she forgot, occasionally, that it was all only a 'little scene,' and regarded things, quite sincerely, from an invalid's point of view. For it may often be remarked that invalids grow weary of having the frequency of their attacks depend always on their own prudence in avoiding them, and like to let themselves think that they are free to do everything that they most enjoy doing, although they are always ill after doing it, provided only that they place themselves in the hands of a higher authority which, without putting them to the least inconvenience, can and will, by uttering a word or by administering a tabloid, set them once again upon their feet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Odette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered sofa near the piano, saying to Mme. Verdurin, \"I have my own little corner, haven't I?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Mme. Verdurin, seeing Swann by himself upon a chair, made him get up. \"You're not at all comfortable there; go along and sit by Odette; you can make room for M. Swann there, can't you, Odette?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What charming Beauvais!\" said Swann, stopping to admire the sofa before he sat down on it, and wishing to be polite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am glad you appreciate my sofa,\" replied Mme. Verdurin, \"and I warn you that if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well abandon the idea at once. They never made any more like it. And these little chairs, too, are perfect marvels. You can look at them in a moment. The emblems in each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the subject of the tapestry on the chair; you know, you combine amusement with instruction when you look at them;\u2014I can promise you a delightful time, I assure you. Just look at the little border around the edges; here, look, the little vine on a red background in this one, the Bear and the Grapes. Isn't it well drawn? What do you say? I think they knew a thing or two about design! Doesn't it make your mouth water, this vine? My husband makes out that I am not fond of fruit, because I eat less than he does. But not a bit of it, I am greedier than any of you, but I have no need to fill my mouth with them when I can feed on them with my eyes. What are you all laughing at now, pray? Ask the Doctor; he will tell you that those grapes act on me like a regular purge. Some people go to Fontainebleau for cures; I take my own little Beauvais cure here. But, M. Swann, you mustn't run away without feeling the little bronze mouldings on the backs. Isn't it an exquisite surface? No, no, not with your whole hand like that; feel them property!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If Mme. Verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes,\" said the painter, \"we shan't get any music to-night.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Be quiet, you wretch! And yet we poor women,\" she went on, \"are forbidden pleasures far less voluptuous than this. There is no flesh in the world as soft as these. None. When M. Verdurin did me the honour of being madly jealous... come, you might at least be polite. Don't say that you never have been jealous!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, my dear, I have said absolutely nothing. Look here, Doctor, I call you as a witness; did I utter a word?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann had begun, out of politeness, to finger the bronzes, and did not like to stop\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Come along; you can caress them later; now it is you that are going to be caressed, caressed in the ear; you'll like that, I think. Here's the young gentleman who will take charge of that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the pianist had played, Swann felt and shewed more interest in him than in any of the other guests, for the following reason:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The year before, at an evening party, he had heard a piece of music played on the piano and violin. At first he had appreciated only the material quality of the sounds which those instruments secreted. And it had been a source of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the violin-part, delicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole, he had suddenly perceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of sound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent, level, and breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea, silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight. But at a given moment, without being able to distinguish any clear outline, or to give a name to what was pleasing him, suddenly enraptured, he had tried to collect, to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony\u2014he knew not which\u2014that had just been played, and had opened and expanded his soul, just as the fragrance of certain roses, wafted upon the moist air of evening, has the power of dilating our nostrils. Perhaps it was owing to his own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so confused an impression, one of those that are, notwithstanding, our only purely musical impressions, limited in their extent, entirely original, and irreducible into any other kind. An impression of this order, vanishing in an instant, is, so to speak, an impression sine materia. Presumably the notes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out before our eyes, over surfaces greater or smaller according to their pitch and volume; to trace arabesque designs, to give us the sensation of breadth or tenuity, stability or caprice. But the notes themselves have vanished before these sensations have developed sufficiently to escape submersion under those which the following, or even simultaneous notes have already begun to awaken in us. And this indefinite perception would continue to smother in its molten liquidity the motifs which now and then emerge, barely discernible, to plunge again and disappear and drown; recognised only by the particular kind of pleasure which they instil, impossible to describe, to recollect, to name; ineffable;\u2014if our memory, like a labourer who toils at the laying down of firm foundations beneath the tumult of the waves, did not, by fashioning for us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases, enable us to compare and to contrast them with those that follow. And so, hardly had the delicious sensation, which Swann had experienced, died away, before his memory had furnished him with an immediate transcript, summary, it is true, and provisional, but one on which he had kept his eyes fixed while the playing continued, so effectively that, when the same impression suddenly returned, it was no longer uncapturable. He was able to picture to himself its extent, its symmetrical arrangement, its notation, the strength of its expression; he had before him that definite object which was no longer pure music, but rather design, architecture, thought, and which allowed the actual music to be recalled. This time he had distinguished, quite clearly, a phrase which emerged for a few moments from the waves of sound. It had at once held out to him an invitation to partake of intimate pleasures, of whose existence, before hearing it, he had never dreamed, into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could initiate him; and he had been filled with love for it, as with a new and strange desire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here, there, everywhere, towards a state of happiness noble, unintelligible, yet clearly indicated. And then, suddenly having reached a certain point from which he was prepared to follow it, after pausing for a moment, abruptly it changed its direction, and in a fresh movement, more rapid, multiform, melancholy, incessant, sweet, it bore him off with it towards a vista of joys unknown. Then it vanished. He hoped, with a passionate longing, that he might find it again, a third time. And reappear it did, though without speaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a pleasure less profound. But when he was once more at home he needed it, he was like a man into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for a moment passing by, has brought a new form of beauty, which strengthens and enlarges his own power of perception, without his knowing even whether he is ever to see her again whom he loves already, although he knows nothing of her, not even her name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed, in the first few months, to be bringing into Swann's life the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation. He had so long since ceased to direct his course towards any ideal goal, and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral satisfactions, that he had come to believe, though without ever formally stating his belief even to himself, that he would remain all his life in that condition, which death alone could alter. More than this, since his mind no longer entertained any lofty ideals, he had ceased to believe in (although he could not have expressly denied) their reality. He had grown also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations, which allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance. Just as he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have done better by not going into society, knowing very well that if he had accepted an invitation he must put in an appearance, and that afterwards, if he did not actually call, he must at least leave cards upon his hostess; so in his conversation he took care never to express with any warmth a personal opinion about a thing, but instead would supply facts and details which had a value of a sort in themselves, and excused him from shewing how much he really knew. He would be extremely precise about the recipe for a dish, the dates of a painter's birth and death, and the titles of his works. Sometimes, in spite of himself, he would let himself go so far as to utter a criticism of a work of art, or of some one's interpretation of life, but then he would cloak his words in a tone of irony, as though he did not altogether associate himself with what he was saying. But now, like a confirmed invalid whom, all of a sudden, a change of air and surroundings, or a new course of treatment, or, as sometimes happens, an organic change in himself, spontaneous and unaccountable, seems to have so far recovered from his malady that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto beyond all hope, of starting to lead\u2014and better late than never\u2014a wholly different life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase that he had heard, in certain other sonatas which he had made people play over to him, to see whether he might not, perhaps, discover his phrase among them, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe, but to which, as though the music had had upon the moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative influence, he was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of the power to consecrate his life. But, never having managed to find out whose work it was that he had heard played that evening, he had been unable to procure a copy, and finally had forgotten the quest. He had indeed, in the course of the next few days, encountered several of the people who had been at the party with him, and had questioned them; but most of them had either arrived after or left before the piece was played; some had indeed been in the house, but had gone into another room to talk, and those who had stayed to listen had no clearer impression than the rest. As for his hosts, they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians whom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play; but, as these last were now on tour somewhere, Swann could learn nothing further. He had, of course, a number of musical friends, but, vividly as he could recall the exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little phrase had given him, and could see, still, before his eyes the forms that it had traced in outline, he was quite incapable of humming over to them the air. And so, at last, he ceased to think of it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to-night, at Mme. Verdurin's, scarcely had the little pianist begun to play when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole bars, Swann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that resonance, which was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain of sound, to veil the mystery of its birth\u2014and recognised, secret, whispering, articulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved. And it was so peculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which nothing else could have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met, in a friend's drawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once, in the street, and had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the phrase withdrew and vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the wandering currents of its fragrance, leaving upon Swann's features a reflection of its smile. But now, at last, he could ask the name of his fair unknown (and was told that it was the andante movement of Vinteuil's sonata for the piano and violin), he held it safe, could have it again to himself, at home, as often as he would, could study its language and acquire its secret\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, when the pianist had finished, Swann crossed the room and thanked him with a vivacity which delighted Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Isn't he charming?\" she asked Swann, \"doesn't he just understand it, his sonata, the little wretch? You never dreamed, did you, that a piano could be made to express all that? Upon my word, there's everything in it except the piano! I'm caught out every time I hear it; I think I'm listening to an orchestra. Though it's better, really, than an orchestra, more complete.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The young pianist bent over her as he answered, smiling and underlining each of his words as though he were making an epigram: \"You are most generous to me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And while Mme. Verdurin was saying to her husband, \"Run and fetch him a glass of orangeade; it's well earned!\" Swann began to tell Odette how he had fallen in love with that little phrase. When their hostess, who was a little way off, called out, \"Well! It looks to me as though some one was saying nice things to you, Odette!\" she replied, \"Yes, very nice,\" and he found her simplicity delightful. Then he asked for some information about this Vinteuil; what else he had done, and at what period in his life he had composed the sonata;\u2014what meaning the little phrase could have had for him, that was what Swann wanted most to know\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But none of these people who professed to admire this musician (when Swann had said that the sonata was really charming Mme. Verdurin had exclaimed, \"I quite believe it! Charming, indeed! But you don't dare to confess that you don't know Vinteuil's sonata; you have no right not to know it!\"\u2014and the painter had gone on with, \"Ah, yes, it's a very fine bit of work, isn't it? Not, of course, if you want something 'obvious,' something 'popular,' but, I mean to say, it makes a very great impression on us artists.\"), none of them seemed ever to have asked himself these questions, for none of them was able to reply\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even to one or two particular remarks made by Swann on his favourite phrase, \"D'you know, that's a funny thing; I had never noticed it; I may as well tell you that I don't much care about peering at things through a microscope, and pricking myself on pin-points of difference; no; we don't waste time splitting hairs in this house; why not? well, it's not a habit of ours, that's all,\" Mme. Verdurin replied, while Dr. Cottard gazed at her with open-mouthed admiration, and yearned to be able to follow her as she skipped lightly from one stepping-stone to another of her stock of ready-made phrases. Both he, however, and Mme. Cottard, with a kind of common sense which is shared by many people of humble origin, would always take care not to express an opinion, or to pretend to admire a piece of music which they would confess to each other, once they were safely at home, that they no more understood than they could understand the art of 'Master' Biche. Inasmuch as the public cannot recognise the charm, the beauty, even the outlines of nature save in the stereotyped impressions of an art which they have gradually assimilated, while an original artist starts by rejecting those impressions, so M. and Mme. Cottard, typical, in this respect, of the public, were incapable of finding, either in Vinteuil's sonata or in Biche's portraits, what constituted harmony, for them, in music or beauty in painting. It appeared to them, when the pianist played his sonata, as though he were striking haphazard from the piano a medley of notes which bore no relation to the musical forms to which they themselves were accustomed, and that the painter simply flung the colours haphazard upon his canvas. When, on one of these, they were able to distinguish a human form, they always found it coarsened and vulgarised (that is to say lacking all the elegance of the school of painting through whose spectacles they themselves were in the habit of seeing the people\u2014real, living people, who passed them in the streets) and devoid of truth, as though M. Biche had not known how the human shoulder was constructed, or that a woman's hair was not, ordinarily, purple\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, when the 'faithful' were scattered out of earshot, the Doctor felt that the opportunity was too good to be missed, and so (while Mme. Verdurin was adding a final word of commendation of Vinteuil's sonata) like a would-be swimmer who jumps into the water, so as to learn, but chooses a moment when there are not too many people looking on: \"Yes, indeed; he's what they call a musiciandi primo cartello!\" he exclaimed, with a sudden determination\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann discovered no more than that the recent publication of Vinteuil's sonata had caused a great stir among the most advanced school of musicians, but that it was still unknown to the general public\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know some one, quite well, called Vinteuil,\" said Swann, thinking of the old music-master at Combray who had taught my grandmother's sisters\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Perhaps that's the man!\" cried Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, no!\" Swann burst out laughing. \"If you had ever seen him for a moment you wouldn't put the question.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Then to put the question is to solve the problem?\" the Doctor suggested\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But it may well be some relative,\" Swann went on. \"That would be bad enough; but, after all, there is no reason why a genius shouldn't have a cousin who is a silly old fool. And if that should be so, I swear there's no known or unknown form of torture I wouldn't undergo to get the old fool to introduce me to the man who composed the sonata; starting with the torture of the old fool's company, which would be ghastly.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The painter understood that Vinteuil was seriously ill at the moment, and that Dr. Potain despaired of his life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What!\" cried Mme. Verdurin, \"Do people still call in Potain?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah! Mme. Verdurin,\" Cottard simpered, \"you forget that you are speaking of one of my colleagues\u2014I should say, one of my masters.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The painter had heard, somewhere, that Vinteuil was threatened with the loss of his reason. And he insisted that signs of this could be detected in certain passages in the sonata. This remark did not strike Swann as ridiculous; rather, it puzzled him. For, since a purely musical work contains none of those logical sequences, the interruption or confusion of which, in spoken or written language, is a proof of insanity, so insanity diagnosed in a sonata seemed to him as mysterious a thing as the insanity of a dog or a horse, although instances may be observed of these\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't speak to me about 'your masters'; you know ten times as much as he does!\" Mme. Verdurin answered Dr. Cottard, in the tone of a woman who has the courage of her convictions, and is quite ready to stand up to anyone who disagrees with her. \"Anyhow, you don't kill your patients!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, Madame, he is in the Academy.\" The Doctor smiled with bitter irony. \"If a sick person prefers to die at the hands of one of the Princes of Science... It is far more smart to be able to say, 'Yes, I have Potain.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, indeed! More smart, is it?\" said Mme. Verdurin. \"So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there? I didn't know that.... Oh, you do make me laugh!\" she screamed, suddenly, burying her face in her hands. \"And here was I, poor thing, talking quite seriously, and never seeing that you were pulling my leg.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for M. Verdurin, finding it rather a strain to start laughing again over so small a matter, he was content with puffing out a cloud of smoke from his pipe, while he reflected sadly that he could never again hope to keep pace with his wife in her Atalanta-flights across the field of mirth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"D'you know; we like your friend so very much,\" said Mme. Verdurin, later, when Odette was bidding her good night. \"He is so unaffected, quite charming. If they're all like that, the friends you want to bring here, by all means bring them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin remarked that Swann had failed, all the same, to appreciate the pianist's aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I dare say he felt a little strange, poor man,\" suggested Mme. Verdurin. \"You can't expect him to catch the tone of the house the first time he comes; like Cottard, who has been one of our little 'clan' now for years. The first time doesn't count; it's just for looking round and finding out things. Odette, he understands all right, he's to join us to-morrow at the Ch\u00e2telet. Perhaps you might call for him and bring him.\" \"No, he doesn't want that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, very well; just as you like. Provided he doesn't fail us at the last moment.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Greatly to Mme. Verdurin's surprise, he never failed them. He would go to meet them, no matter where, at restaurants outside Paris (not that they went there much at first, for the season had not yet begun), and more frequently at the play, in which Mme. Verdurin delighted. One evening, when they were dining at home, he heard her complain that she had not one of those permits which would save her the trouble of waiting at doors and standing in crowds, and say how useful it would be to them at first-nights, and gala performances at the Opera, and what a nuisance it had been, not having one, on the day of Gambetta's funeral. Swann never spoke of his distinguished friends, but only of such as might be regarded as detrimental, whom, therefore, he thought it snobbish, and in not very good taste to conceal; while he frequented the Faubourg Saint-Germain he had come to include, in the latter class, all his friends in the official world of the Third Republic, and so broke in, without thinking: \"I'll see to that, all right. You shall have it in time for the Danicheff revival. I shall be lunching with the Prefect of Police to-morrow, as it happens, at the Elys\u00e9e.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What's that? The Elys\u00e9e?\" Dr. Cottard roared in a voice of thunder\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, at M. Gr\u00e9vy's,\" replied Swann, feeling a little awkward at the effect which his announcement had produced\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you often taken like that?\" the painter asked Cottard, with mock-seriousness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a rule, once an explanation had been given, Cottard would say: \"Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,\" after which he would shew not the least trace of emotion. But this time Swann's last words, instead of the usual calming effect, had that of heating, instantly, to boiling-point his astonishment at the discovery that a man with whom he himself was actually sitting at table, a man who had no official position, no honours or distinction of any sort, was on visiting terms with the Head of the State\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What's that you say? M. Gr\u00e9vy? Do you know M. Gr\u00e9vy?\" he demanded of Swann, in the stupid and incredulous tone of a constable on duty at the palace, when a stranger has come up and asked to see the President of the Republic; until, guessing from his words and manner what, as the newspapers say, 'it is a case of,' he assures the poor lunatic that he will be admitted at once, and points the way to the reception ward of the police infirmary\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know him slightly; we have some friends in common\" (Swann dared not add that one of these friends was the Prince of Wales). \"Anyhow, he is very free with his invitations, and, I assure you, his luncheon-parties are not the least bit amusing; they're very simple affairs, too, you know; never more than eight at table,\" he went on, trying desperately to cut out everything that seemed to shew off his relations with the President in a light too dazzling for the Doctor's eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereupon Cottard, at once conforming in his mind to the literal interpretation of what Swann was saying, decided that invitations from M. Gr\u00e9vy were very little sought after, were sent out, in fact, into the highways and hedge-rows. And from that moment he never seemed at all surprised to hear that Swann, or anyone else, was 'always at the Elys\u00e9e'; he even felt a little sorry for a man who had to go to luncheon-parties which, he himself admitted, were a bore\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, good, good; that's quite all right then,\" he said, in the tone of a customs official who has been suspicious up to now, but, after hearing your explanations, stamps your passport and lets you proceed on your journey without troubling to examine your luggage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I can well believe you don't find them amusing, those parties; indeed, it's very good of you to go to them!\" said Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the President of the Republic only as a 'bore' to be especially dreaded, since he had at his disposal means of seduction, and even of compulsion, which, if employed to captivate her 'faithful,' might easily make them 'fail.' \"It seems, he's as deaf as a post; and eats with his fingers.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Upon my word! Then it can't be much fun for you, going there.\" A note of pity sounded in the Doctor's voice; and then struck by the number\u2014only eight at table\u2014\"Are these luncheons what you would describe as 'intimate'?\" he inquired briskly, not so much out of idle curiosity as in his linguistic zeal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But so great and glorious a figure was the President of the French Republic in the eyes of Dr. Cottard that neither the modesty of Swann nor the spite of Mme. Verdurin could ever wholly efface that first impression, and he never sat down to dinner with the Verdurins without asking anxiously, \"D'you think we shall see M. Swann here this evening? He is a personal friend of M. Gr\u00e9vy's. I suppose that means he's what you'd call a 'gentleman'?\" He even went to the length of offering Swann a card of invitation to the Dental Exhibition\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This will let you in, and anyone you take with you,\" he explained, \"but dogs are not admitted. I'm just warning you, you understand, because some friends of mine went there once, who hadn't been told, and there was the devil to pay.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for M. Verdurin, he did not fail to observe the distressing effect upon his wife of the discovery that Swann had influential friends of whom he had never spoken\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If no arrangement had been made to 'go anywhere,' it was at the Verdurins' that Swann would find the 'little nucleus' assembled, but he never appeared there except in the evenings, and would hardly ever accept their invitations to dinner, in spite of Odette's entreaties\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I could dine with you alone somewhere, if you'd rather,\" she suggested\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But what about Mme. Verdurin?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, that's quite simple. I need only say that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How charming of you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Swann said to himself that, if he could make Odette feel (by consenting to meet her only after dinner) that there were other pleasures which he preferred to that of her company, then the desire that she felt for his would be all the longer in reaching the point of satiety. Besides, as he infinitely preferred to Odette's style of beauty that of a little working girl, as fresh and plump as a rose, with whom he happened to be simultaneously in love, he preferred to spend the first part of the evening with her, knowing that he was sure to see Odette later on. For the same reason, he would never allow Odette to call for him at his house, to take him on to the Verdurins'. The little girl used to wait, not far from his door, at a street corner; R\u00e9mi, his coachman, knew where to stop; she would jump in beside him, and hold him in her arms until the carriage drew up at the Verdurins'. He would enter the drawing-room; and there, while Mme. Verdurin, pointing to the roses which he had sent her that morning, said: \"I am furious with you!\" and sent him to the place kept for him, by the side of Odette, the pianist would play to them\u2014for their two selves, and for no one else\u2014that little phrase by Vinteuil which was, so to speak, the national anthem of their love. He began, always, with a sustained tremolo from the violin part, which, for several bars, was unaccompanied, and filled all the foreground; until suddenly it seemed to be drawn aside, and\u2014just as in those interiors by Pieter de Hooch, where the subject is set back a long way through the narrow framework of a half-opened door\u2014infinitely remote, in colour quite different, velvety with the radiance of some intervening light, the little phrase appeared, dancing, pastoral, interpolated, episodic, belonging to another world. It passed, with simple and immortal movements, scattering on every side the bounties of its grace, smiling ineffably still; but Swann thought that he could now discern in it some disenchantment. It seemed to be aware how vain, how hollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way. In its airy grace there was, indeed, something definitely achieved, and complete in itself, like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an outburst of vain regret. But little did that matter to him; he looked upon the sonata less in its own light\u2014as what it might express, had, in fact, expressed to a certain musician, ignorant that any Swann or Odette, anywhere in the world, existed, when he composed it, and would express to all those who should hear it played in centuries to come\u2014than as a pledge, a token of his love, which made even the Verdurins and their little pianist think of Odette and, at the same time, of himself\u2014which bound her to him by a lasting tie; and at that point he had (whimsically entreated by Odette) abandoned the idea of getting some 'professional' to play over to him the whole sonata, of which he still knew no more than this one passage. \"Why do you want the rest?\" she had asked him. \"Our little bit; that's all we need.\" He went farther; agonised by the reflection, at the moment when it passed by him, so near and yet so infinitely remote, that, while it was addressed to their ears, it knew them not, he would regret, almost, that it had a meaning of its own, an intrinsic and unalterable beauty, foreign to themselves, just as in the jewels given to us, or even in the letters written to us by a woman with whom we are in love, we find fault with the 'water' of a stone, or with the words of a sentence because they are not fashioned exclusively from the spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of a 'lass unparalleled.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would happen, as often as not, that he had stayed so long outside, with his little girl, before going to the Verdurins' that, as soon as the little phrase had been rendered by the pianist, Swann would discover that it was almost time for Odette to go home. He used to take her back as far as the door of her little house in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse, behind the Arc de Triomphe. And it was perhaps on this account, and so as not to demand the monopoly of her favours, that he sacrificed the pleasure (not so essential to his well-being) of seeing her earlier in the evening, of arriving with her at the Verdurins', to the exercise of this other privilege, for which she was grateful, of their leaving together; a privilege which he valued all the more because, thanks to it, he had the feeling that no one else would see her, no one would thrust himself between them, no one could prevent him from remaining with her in spirit, after he had left her for the night\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, night after night, she would be taken home in Swann's carriage; and one night, after she had got down, and while he stood at the gate and murmured \"Till to-morrow, then!\" she turned impulsively from him, plucked a last lingering chrysanthemum in the tiny garden which flanked the pathway from the street to her house, and as he went back to his carriage thrust it into his hand. He held it pressed to his lips during the drive home, and when, in due course, the flower withered, locked it away, like something very precious, in a secret drawer of his desk\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He would escort her to her gate, but no farther. Twice only had he gone inside to take part in the ceremony\u2014of such vital importance in her life\u2014of 'afternoon tea.' The loneliness and emptiness of those short streets (consisting, almost entirely, of low-roofed houses, self-contained but not detached, their monotony interrupted here and there by the dark intrusion of some sinister little shop, at once an historical document and a sordid survival from the days when the district was still one of ill repute), the snow which had lain on the garden-beds or clung to the branches of the trees, the careless disarray of the season, the assertion, in this man-made city, of a state of nature, had all combined to add an element of mystery to the warmth, the flowers, the luxury which he had found inside\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Passing by (on his left-hand side, and on what, although raised some way above the street, was the ground floor of the house) Odette's bedroom, which looked out to the back over another little street running parallel with her own, he had climbed a staircase that went straight up between dark painted walls, from which hung Oriental draperies, strings of Turkish beads, and a huge Japanese lantern, suspended by a silken cord from the ceiling (which last, however, so that her visitors should not have to complain of the want of any of the latest comforts of Western civilisation, was lighted by a gas-jet inside), to the two drawing-rooms, large and small. These were entered through a narrow lobby, the wall of which, chequered with the lozenges of a wooden trellis such as you see on garden walls, only gilded, was lined from end to end by a long rectangular box in which bloomed, as though in a hothouse, a row of large chrysanthemums, at that time still uncommon, though by no means so large as the mammoth blossoms which horticulturists have since succeeded in making grow. Swann was irritated, as a rule, by the sight of these flowers, which had then been 'the rage' in Paris for about a year, but it had pleased him, on this occasion, to see the gloom of the little lobby shot with rays of pink and gold and white by the fragrant petals of these ephemeral stars, which kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of winter afternoons. Odette had received him in a tea-gown of pink silk, which left her neck and arms bare. She had made him sit down beside her in one of the many mysterious little retreats which had been contrived in the various recesses of the room, sheltered by enormous palmtrees growing out of pots of Chinese porcelain, or by screens upon which were fastened photographs and fans and bows of ribbon. She had said at once, \"You're not comfortable there; wait a minute, I'll arrange things for you,\" and with a titter of laughter, the complacency of which implied that some little invention of her own was being brought into play, she had installed behind his head and beneath his feet great cushions of Japanese silk, which she pummelled and buffeted as though determined to lavish on him all her riches, and regardless of their value. But when her footman began to come into the room, bringing, one after another, the innumerable lamps which (contained, mostly, in porcelain vases) burned singly or in pairs upon the different pieces of furniture as upon so many altars, rekindling in the twilight, already almost nocturnal, of this winter afternoon, the glow of a sunset more lasting, more roseate, more human\u2014filling, perhaps, with romantic wonder the thoughts of some solitary lover, wandering in the street below and brought to a standstill before the mystery of the human presence which those lighted windows at once revealed and screened from sight\u2014she had kept an eye sharply fixed on the servant, to see whether he set each of the lamps down in the place appointed it. She felt that, if he were to put even one of them where it ought not to be, the general effect of her drawing-room would be destroyed, and that her portrait, which rested upon a sloping easel draped with plush, would not catch the light. And so, with feverish impatience, she followed the man's clumsy movements, scolding him severely when he passed too close to a pair of beaupots, which she made a point of always tidying herself, in case the plants should be knocked over\u2014and went across to them now to make sure that he had not broken off any of the flowers. She found something 'quaint' in the shape of each of her Chinese ornaments, and also in her orchids, the cattleyas especially (these being, with chrysanthemums, her favourite flowers), because they had the supreme merit of not looking in the least like other flowers, but of being made, apparently, out of scraps of silk or satin. \"It looks just as though it had been cut out of the lining of my cloak,\" she said to Swann, pointing to an orchid, with a shade of respect in her voice for so 'smart' a flower, for this distinguished, unexpected sister whom nature had suddenly bestowed upon her, so far removed from her in the scale of existence, and yet so delicate, so refined, so much more worthy than many real women of admission to her drawing-room. As she drew his attention, now to the fiery-tongued dragons painted upon a bowl or stitched upon a fire-screen, now to a fleshy cluster of orchids, now to a dromedary of inlaid silver-work with ruby eyes, which kept company, upon her mantelpiece, with a toad carved in jade, she would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the monsters or laughing at their absurdity, now blushing at the indecency of the flowers, now carried away by an irresistible desire to run across and kiss the toad and dromedary, calling them 'darlings.' And these affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of her attitudes, notably her devotion to Our Lady of the Laghetto who had once, when Odette was living at Nice, cured her of a mortal illness, and whose medal, in gold, she always carried on her person, attributing to it unlimited powers. She poured out Swann's tea, inquired \"Lemon or cream?\" and, on his answering \"Cream, please,\" went on, smiling, \"A cloud!\" And as he pronounced it excellent, \"You see, I know just how you like it.\" This tea had indeed seemed to Swann, just as it seemed to her, something precious, and love is so far obliged to find some justification for itself, some guarantee of its duration in pleasures which, on the contrary, would have no existence apart from love and must cease with its passing, that when he left her, at seven o'clock, to go and dress for the evening, all the way home, sitting bolt upright in his brougham, unable to repress the happiness with which the afternoon's adventure had filled him, he kept on repeating to himself: \"What fun it would be to have a little woman like that in a place where one could always be certain of finding, what one never can be certain of finding, a really good cup of tea.\" An hour or so later he received a note from Odette, and at once recognised that florid handwriting, in which an affectation of British stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its shapeless characters, significant, perhaps, to less intimate eyes than his, of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, a want of sincerity and decision. Swann had left his cigarette-case at her house. \"Why,\" she wrote, \"did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More important, perhaps, was a second visit which he paid her, a little later. On his way to the house, as always when he knew that they were to meet, he formed a picture of her in his mind; and the necessity, if he was to find any beauty in her face, of fixing his eyes on the fresh and rosy protuberance of her cheekbones, and of shutting out all the rest of those cheeks which were so often languorous and sallow, except when they were punctuated with little fiery spots, plunged him in acute depression, as proving that one's ideal is always unattainable, and one's actual happiness mediocre. He was taking her an engraving which she had asked to see. She was not very well; she received him, wearing a wrapper of mauve cr\u00eape de Chine, which draped her bosom, like a mantle, with a richly embroidered web. As she stood there beside him, brushing his cheek with the loosened tresses of her hair, bending one knee in what was almost a dancer's pose, so that she could lean without tiring herself over the picture, at which she was gazing, with bended head, out of those great eyes, which seemed so weary and so sullen when there was nothing to animate her, Swann was struck by her resemblance to the figure of Zipporah, Jethro's Daughter, which is to be seen in one of the Sistine frescoes. He had always found a peculiar fascination in tracing in the paintings of the Old Masters, not merely the general characteristics of the people whom he encountered in his daily life, but rather what seems least susceptible of generalisation, the individual features of men and women whom he knew, as, for instance, in a bust of the Doge Loredan by Antonio Rizzo, the prominent cheekbones, the slanting eyebrows, in short, a speaking likeness to his own coachman R\u00e9mi; in the colouring of a Ghirlandaio, the nose of M. de Palancy; in a portrait by Tintoretto, the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an outcrop of whisker, the broken nose, the penetrating stare, the swollen eyelids of Dr. du Boulbon. Perhaps because he had always regretted, in his heart, that he had confined his attention to the social side of life, had talked, always, rather than acted, he felt that he might find a sort of indulgence bestowed upon him by those great artists, in his perception of the fact that they also had regarded with pleasure and had admitted into the canon of their works such types of physiognomy as give those works the strongest possible certificate of reality and trueness to life; a modern, almost a topical savour; perhaps, also, he had so far succumbed to the prevailing frivolity of the world of fashion that he felt the necessity of finding in an old masterpiece some such obvious and refreshing allusion to a person about whom jokes could be made and repeated and enjoyed to-day. Perhaps, on the other hand, he had retained enough of the artistic temperament to be able to find a genuine satisfaction in watching these individual features take on a more general significance when he saw them, uprooted and disembodied, in the abstract idea of similarity between an historic portrait and a modern original, whom it was not intended to represent. However that might be, and perhaps because the abundance of impressions which he, for some time past, had been receiving\u2014though, indeed, they had come to him rather through the channel of his appreciation of music\u2014had enriched his appetite for painting as well, it was with an unusual intensity of pleasure, a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon his character and conduct, that Swann remarked Odette's resemblance to the Zipporah of that Alessandro de Mariano, to whom one shrinks from giving his more popular surname, now that 'Botticelli' suggests not so much the actual work of the Master as that false and banal conception of it which has of late obtained common currency. He no longer based his estimate of the merit of Odette's face on the more or less good quality of her cheeks, and the softness and sweetness\u2014as of carnation-petals\u2014which, he supposed, would greet his lips there, should he ever hazard an embrace, but regarded it rather as a skein of subtle and lovely silken threads, which his gazing eyes collected and wound together, following the curving line from the skein to the ball, where he mingled the cadence of her neck with the spring of her hair and the droop of her eyelids, as though from a portrait of herself, in which her type was made clearly intelligible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stood gazing at her; traces of the old fresco were apparent in her face and limbs, and these he tried incessantly, afterwards, to recapture, both when he was with Odette, and when he was only thinking of her in her absence; and, albeit his admiration for the Florentine masterpiece was probably based upon his discovery that it had been reproduced in her, the similarity enhanced her beauty also, and rendered her more precious in his sight. Swann reproached himself with his failure, hitherto, to estimate at her true worth a creature whom the great Sandro would have adored, and counted himself fortunate that his pleasure in the contemplation of Odette found a justification in his own system of aesthetic. He told himself that, in choosing the thought of Odette as the inspiration of his dreams of ideal happiness, he was not, as he had until then supposed, falling back, merely, upon an expedient of doubtful and certainly inadequate value, since she contained in herself what satisfied the utmost refinement of his taste in art. He failed to observe that this quality would not naturally avail to bring Odette into the category of women whom he found desirable, simply because his desires had always run counter to his aesthetic taste. The words 'Florentine painting' were invaluable to Swann. They enabled him (gave him, as it were, a legal title) to introduce the image of Odette into a world of dreams and fancies which, until then, she had been debarred from entering, and where she assumed a new and nobler form. And whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh, by perpetually reviving his misgivings as to the quality of her face, her figure, the whole of her beauty, used to cool the ardour of his love, those misgivings were swept away and that love confirmed now that he could re-erect his estimate of her on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles; while the kiss, the bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but moderately attractive, had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat withered flesh and sluggish blood, coming, as now they came, to crown his adoration of a masterpiece in a gallery, must, it seemed, prove as exquisite as they would be supernatural\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And when he was tempted to regret that, for months past, he had done nothing but visit Odette, he would assure himself that he was not unreasonable in giving up much of his time to the study of an inestimably precious work of art, cast for once in a new, a different, an especially charming metal, in an unmatched exemplar which he would contemplate at one moment with the humble, spiritual, disinterested mind of an artist, at another with the pride, the selfishness, the sensual thrill of a collector\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On his study table, at which he worked, he had placed, as it were a photograph of Odette, a reproduction of Jethro's Daughter. He would gaze in admiration at the large eyes, the delicate features in which the imperfection of her skin might be surmised, the marvellous locks of hair that fell along her tired cheeks; and, adapting what he had already felt to be beautiful, on aesthetic grounds, to the idea of a living woman, he converted it into a series of physical merits which he congratulated himself on finding assembled in the person of one whom he might, ultimately, possess. The vague feeling of sympathy which attracts a spectator to a work of art, now that he knew the type, in warm flesh and blood, of Jethro's Daughter, became a desire which more than compensated, thenceforward, for that with which Odette's physical charms had at first failed to inspire him. When he had sat for a long time gazing at the Botticelli, he would think of his own living Botticelli, who seemed all the lovelier in contrast, and as he drew towards him the photograph of Zipporah he would imagine that he was holding Odette against his heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not only Odette's indifference, however, that he must take pains to circumvent; it was also, not infrequently, his own; feeling that, since Odette had had every facility for seeing him, she seemed no longer to have very much to say to him when they did meet, he was afraid lest the manner\u2014at once trivial, monotonous, and seemingly unalterable\u2014which she now adopted when they were together should ultimately destroy in him that romantic hope, that a day might come when she would make avowal of her passion, by which hope alone he had become and would remain her lover. And so to alter, to give a fresh moral aspect to that Odette, of whose unchanging mood he was afraid of growing weary, he wrote, suddenly, a letter full of hinted discoveries and feigned indignation, which he sent off so that it should reach her before dinner-time. He knew that she would be frightened, and that she would reply, and he hoped that, when the fear of losing him clutched at her heart, it would force from her words such as he had never yet heard her utter: and he was right\u2014by repeating this device he had won from her the most affectionate letters that she had, so far, written him, one of them (which she had sent to him at midday by a special messenger from the Maison Dor\u00e9e\u2014it was the day of the Paris-Murcie F\u00eate given for the victims of the recent floods in Murcia) beginning \"My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write\u2014\u2014\"; and these letters he had kept in the same drawer as the withered chrysanthemum. Or else, if she had not had time to write, when he arrived at the Verdurins' she would come running up to him with an \"I've something to say to you!\" and he would gaze curiously at the revelation in her face and speech of what she had hitherto kept concealed from him of her heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even as he drew near to the Verdurins' door, and caught sight of the great lamp-lit spaces of the drawing-room windows, whose shutters were never closed, he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming creature whom he would see, as he entered the room, basking in that golden light. Here and there the figures of the guests stood out, sharp and black, between lamp and window, shutting off the light, like those little pictures which one sees sometimes pasted here and there upon a glass screen, whose other panes are mere transparencies. He would try to make out Odette. And then, when he was once inside, without thinking, his eyes sparkled suddenly with such radiant happiness that M. Verdurin said to the painter: \"H'm. Seems to be getting warm.\" Indeed, her presence gave the house what none other of the houses that he visited seemed to possess: a sort of tactual sense, a nervous system which ramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so the simple and regular manifestations of a social organism, namely the 'little clan,' were transformed for Swann into a series of daily encounters with Odette, and enabled him to feign indifference to the prospect of seeing her, or even a desire not to see her; in doing which he incurred no very great risk since, even although he had written to her during the day, he would of necessity see her in the evening and accompany her home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But one evening, when, irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark drive together, he had taken his other 'little girl' all the way to the Bois, so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at the Verdurins', he was so late in reaching them that Odette, supposing that he did not intend to come, had already left. Seeing the room bare of her, Swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish; he shook with the sense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began then for the first time to estimate, having always, hitherto, had that certainty of finding it whenever he would, which (as in the case of all our pleasures) reduced, if it did not altogether blind him to its dimensions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that she wasn't here?\" M. Verdurin asked his wife. \"I think we may say that he's hooked.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The face he pulled?\" exploded Dr. Cottard who, having left the house for a moment to visit a patient, had just returned to fetch his wife and did not know whom they were discussing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"D'you mean to say you didn't meet him on the doorstep\u2014the loveliest of Swanns?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No. M. Swann has been here?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just for a moment. We had a glimpse of a Swann tremendously agitated. In a state of nerves. You see, Odette had left.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You mean to say that she has gone the 'whole hog' with him; that she has 'burned her boats'?\" inquired the Doctor cautiously, testing the meaning of his phrases\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, of course not; there's absolutely nothing in it; in fact, between you and me, I think she's making a great mistake, and behaving like a silly little fool, which she is, incidentally.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Come, come, come!\" said M. Verdurin, \"How on earth do you know that there's 'nothing in it'? We haven't been there to see, have we now?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She would have told me,\" answered Mme. Verdurin with dignity. \"I may say that she tells me everything. As she has no one else at present, I told her that she ought to live with him. She makes out that she can't; she admits, she was immensely attracted by him, at first; but he's always shy with her, and that makes her shy with him. Besides, she doesn't care for him in that way, she says; it's an ideal love, 'Platonic,' you know; she's afraid of rubbing the bloom off\u2014oh, I don't know half the things she says, how should I? And yet he's exactly the sort of man she wants.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I beg to differ from you,\" M. Verdurin courteously interrupted. \"I am only half satisfied with the gentleman. I feel that he 'poses.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin's whole body stiffened, her eyes stared blankly as though she had suddenly been turned into a statue; a device by means of which she might be supposed not to have caught the sound of that unutterable word which seemed to imply that it was possible for people to 'pose' in her house, and, therefore, that there were people in the world who 'mattered more' than herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Anyhow, if there is nothing in it, I don't suppose it's because our friend believes in her virtue. And yet, you never know; he seems to believe in her intelligence. I don't know whether you heard the way he lectured her the other evening about Vinteuil's sonata. I am devoted to Odette, but really\u2014to expound theories of aesthetic to her\u2014the man must be a prize idiot.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Look here, I won't have you saying nasty things about Odette,\" broke in Mme. Verdurin in her 'spoiled child' manner. \"She is charming.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There's no reason why she shouldn't be charming; we are not saying anything nasty about her, only that she is not the embodiment of either virtue or intellect. After all,\" he turned to the painter, \"does it matter so very much whether she is virtuous or not? You can't tell; she might be a great deal less charming if she were.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the landing Swann had run into the Verdurins' butler, who had been somewhere else a moment earlier, when he arrived, and who had been asked by Odette to tell Swann (but that was at least an hour ago) that she would probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at Pr\u00e9vost's on her way home. Swann set off at once for Pr\u00e9vost's, but every few yards his carriage was held up by others, or by people crossing the street, loathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath his wheels, were it not that a policeman fumbling with a note-book would delay him even longer than the actual passage of the pedestrian. He counted the minutes feverishly, adding a few seconds to each so as to be quite certain that he had not given himself short measure, and so, possibly, exaggerated whatever chance there might actually be of his arriving at Pr\u00e9vost's in time, and of finding her still there. And then, in a moment of illumination, like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep and is conscious of the absurdity of the dream-shapes among which his mind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself and them, Swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the thoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard at the Verdurins' that Odette had left, how novel the heartache from which he was suffering, but of which he was only now conscious, as though he had just woken up. What! all this disturbance simply because he would not see Odette, now, till to-morrow, exactly what he had been hoping, not an hour before, as he drove toward Mme. Verdurin's. He was obliged to admit also that now, as he sat in the same carriage and drove to Pr\u00e9vost's, he was no longer the same man, was no longer alone even\u2014but that a new personality was there beside him, adhering to him, amalgamated with him, a creature from whom he might, perhaps, be unable to liberate himself, towards whom he might have to adopt some such stratagem as one uses to outwit a master or a malady. And yet, during this last moment in which he had felt that another, a fresh personality was thus conjoined with his own, life had seemed, somehow, more interesting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at Pr\u00e9vost's (the tension of waiting for which so ravished, stripped so bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea, not one memory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take shelter and repose) would probably, after all, should it take place, be much the same as all their meetings, of no great importance. As on every other evening, once he was in Odette's company, once he had begun to cast furtive glances at her changing countenance, and instantly to withdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of desire and believe no more in his indifference, he would cease to be able even to think of her, so busy would he be in the search for pretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately, and to assure himself, without betraying his concern, that he would find her again, next evening, at the Verdurins'; pretexts, that is to say, which would enable him to prolong for the time being, and to renew for one day more the disappointment, the torturing deception that must always come to him with the vain presence of this woman, whom he might approach, yet never dared embrace\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was not at Prevost's; he must search for her, then, in every restaurant upon the boulevards. To save time, while he went in one direction, he sent in the other his coachman R\u00e9mi (Rizzo's Doge Loredan) for whom he presently\u2014after a fruitless search\u2014found himself waiting at the spot where the carriage was to meet him. It did not appear, and Swann tantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching moment, as one in which R\u00e9mi would say to him: \"Sir, the lady is there,\" or as one in which R\u00e9mi would say to him: \"Sir, the lady was not in any of the caf\u00e9s.\" And so he saw himself faced by the close of his evening\u2014a thing uniform, and yet bifurcated by the intervening accident which would either put an end to his agony by discovering Odette, or would oblige him to abandon any hope of finding her that night, to accept the necessity of returning home without having seen her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The coachman returned; but, as he drew up opposite him, Swann asked, not \"Did you find the lady?\" but \"Remind me, to-morrow, to order in some more firewood. I am sure we must be running short.\" Perhaps he had persuaded himself that, if R\u00e9mi had at last found Odette in some caf\u00e9, where she was waiting for him still, then his night of misery was already obliterated by the realisation, begun already in his mind, of a night of joy, and that there was no need for him to hasten towards the attainment of a happiness already captured and held in a safe place, which would not escape his grasp again. But it was also by the force of inertia; there was in his soul that want of adaptability which can be seen in the bodies of certain people who, when the moment comes to avoid a collision, to snatch their clothes out of reach of a flame, or to perform any other such necessary movement, take their time (as the saying is), begin by remaining for a moment in their original position, as though seeking to find in it a starting-point, a source of strength and motion. And probably, if the coachman had interrupted him with, \"I have found the lady,\" he would have answered, \"Oh, yes, of course; that's what I told you to do. I had quite forgotten,\" and would have continued to discuss his supply of firewood, so as to hide from his servant the emotion that he had felt, and to give himself time to break away from the thraldom of his anxieties and abandon himself to pleasure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The coachman came back, however, with the report that he could not find her anywhere, and added the advice, as an old and privileged servant, \"I think, sir, that all we can do now is to go home.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the air of indifference which Swann could so lightly assume when R\u00e9mi uttered his final, unalterable response, fell from him like a cast-off cloak when he saw R\u00e9mi attempt to make him abandon hope and retire from the quest\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Certainly not!\" he exclaimed. \"We must find the lady. It is most important. She would be extremely put out\u2014it's a business matter\u2014and vexed with me if she didn't see me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I do not see how the lady can be vexed, sir,\" answered R\u00e9mi, \"since it was she that went away without waiting for you, sir, and said she was going to Pr\u00e9vost's, and then wasn't there.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the restaurants were closing, and their lights began to go out. Under the trees of the boulevards there were still a few people strolling to and fro, barely distinguishable in the gathering darkness. Now and then the ghost of a woman glided up to Swann, murmured a few words in his ear, asked him to take her home, and left him shuddering. Anxiously he explored every one of these vaguely seen shapes, as though among the phantoms of the dead, in the realms of darkness, he had been searching for a lost Eurydice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among all the methods by which love is brought into being, among all the agents which disseminate that blessed bane, there are few so efficacious as the great gust of agitation which, now and then, sweeps over the human spirit. For then the creature in whose company we are seeking amusement at the moment, her lot is cast, her fate and ours decided, that is the creature whom we shall henceforward love. It is not necessary that she should have pleased us, up till then, any more, or even as much as others. All that is necessary is that our taste for her should become exclusive. And that condition is fulfilled so soon as\u2014in the moment when she has failed to meet us\u2014for the pleasure which we were on the point of enjoying in her charming company is abruptly substituted an anxious torturing desire, whose object is the creature herself, an irrational, absurd desire, which the laws of civilised society make it impossible to satisfy and difficult to assuage\u2014the insensate, agonising desire to possess her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann made R\u00e9mi drive him to such restaurants as were still open; it was the sole hypothesis, now, of that happiness which he had contemplated so calmly; he no longer concealed his agitation, the price he set upon their meeting, and promised, in case of success, to reward his coachman, as though, by inspiring in him a will to triumph which would reinforce his own, he could bring it to pass, by a miracle, that Odette\u2014assuming that she had long since gone home to bed,\u2014might yet be found seated in some restaurant on the boulevards. He pursued the quest as far as the Maison Dor\u00e9e, burst twice into Tortoni's and, still without catching sight of her, was emerging from the Caf\u00e9 Anglais, striding with haggard gaze towards his carriage, which was waiting for him at the corner of the Boulevard des Italiens, when he collided with a person coming in the opposite direction; it was Odette; she explained, later, that there had been no room at Pr\u00e9vost's, that she had gone, instead, to sup at the Maison Dor\u00e9e, and had been sitting there in an alcove where he must have overlooked her, and that she was now looking for her carriage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had so little expected to see him that she started back in alarm. As for him, he had ransacked the streets of Paris, not that he supposed it possible that he should find her, but because he would have suffered even more cruelly by abandoning the attempt. But now the joy (which, his reason had never ceased to assure him, was not, that evening at least, to be realised) was suddenly apparent, and more real than ever before; for he himself had contributed nothing to it by anticipating probabilities,\u2014it remained integral and external to himself; there was no need for him to draw on his own resources to endow it with truth\u2014'twas from itself that there emanated, 'twas itself that projected towards him that truth whose glorious rays melted and scattered like the cloud of a dream the sense of loneliness which had lowered over him, that truth upon which he had supported, nay founded, albeit unconsciously, his vision of bliss. So will a traveller, who has come down, on a day of glorious weather, to the Mediterranean shore, and is doubtful whether they still exist, those lands which he has left, let his eyes be dazzled, rather than cast a backward glance, by the radiance streaming towards him from the luminous and unfading azure at his feet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting, and ordered his own to follow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had in her hand a bunch of cattleyas, and Swann could see, beneath the film of lace that covered her head, more of the same flowers fastened to a swansdown plume. She was wearing, under her cloak, a flowing gown of black velvet, caught up on one side so as to reveal a large triangular patch of her white silk skirt, with an 'insertion,' also of white silk, in the cleft of her low-necked bodice, in which were fastened a few more cattleyas. She had scarcely recovered from the shock which the sight of Swann had given her, when some obstacle made the horse start to one side. They were thrown forward from their seats; she uttered a cry, and fell back quivering and breathless\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's all right,\" he assured her, \"don't be frightened.\" And he slipped his arm round her shoulder, supporting her body against his own; then went on: \"Whatever you do, don't utter a word; just make a sign, yes or no, or you'll be out of breath again. You won't mind if I put the flowers straight on your bodice; the jolt has loosened them. I'm afraid of their dropping out; I'm just going to fasten them a little more securely.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was not used to being treated with so much formality by men, and smiled as she answered: \"No, not at all; I don't mind in the least.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he, chilled a little by her answer, perhaps, also, to bear out the pretence that he had been sincere in adopting the stratagem, or even because he was already beginning to believe that he had been, exclaimed: \"No, no; you mustn't speak. You will be out of breath again. You can easily answer in signs; I shall understand. Really and truly now, you don't mind my doing this? Look, there is a little\u2014I think it must be pollen, spilt over your dress,\u2014may I brush it off with my hand? That's not too hard; I'm not hurting you, am I? I'm tickling you, perhaps, a little; but I don't want to touch the velvet in case I rub it the wrong way. But, don't you see, I really had to fasten the flowers; they would have fallen out if I hadn't. Like that, now; if I just push them a little farther down.... Seriously, I'm not annoying you, am I? And if I just sniff them to see whether they've really lost all their scent? I don't believe I ever smelt any before; may I? Tell the truth, now.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still smiling, she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly, as who should say, \"You're quite mad; you know very well that I like it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He slipped his other hand upwards along Odette's cheek; she fixed her eyes on him with that languishing and solemn air which marks the women of the old Florentine's paintings, in whose faces he had found the type of hers; swimming at the brink of her fringed lids, her brilliant eyes, large and finely drawn as theirs, seemed on the verge of breaking from her face and rolling down her cheeks like two great tears. She bent her neck, as all their necks may be seen to bend, in the pagan scenes as well as in the scriptural. And although her attitude was, doubtless, habitual and instinctive, one which she knew to be appropriate to such moments, and was careful not to forget to assume, she seemed to need all her strength to hold her face back, as though some invisible force were drawing it down towards Swann's. And Swann it was who, before she allowed her face, as though despite her efforts, to fall upon his lips, held it back for a moment longer, at a little distance between his hands. He had intended to leave time for her mind to overtake her body's movements, to recognise the dream which she had so long cherished and to assist at its realisation, like a mother invited as a spectator when a prize is given to the child whom she has reared and loves. Perhaps, moreover, Swann himself was fixing upon these features of an Odette not yet possessed, not even kissed by him, on whom he was looking now for the last time, that comprehensive gaze with which, on the day of his departure, a traveller strives to bear away with him in memory the view of a country to which he may never return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he was so shy in approaching her that, after this evening which had begun by his arranging her cattleyas and had ended in her complete surrender, whether from fear of chilling her, or from reluctance to appear, even retrospectively, to have lied, or perhaps because he lacked the audacity to formulate a more urgent requirement than this (which could always be repeated, since it had not annoyed her on the first occasion), he resorted to the same pretext on the following days. If she had any cattleyas pinned to her bodice, he would say: \"It is most unfortunate; the cattleyas don't need tucking in this evening; they've not been disturbed as they were the other night; I think, though, that this one isn't quite straight. May I see if they have more scent than the others?\" Or else, if she had none: \"Oh! no cattleyas this evening; then there's nothing for me to arrange.\" So that for some time there was no change from the procedure which he had followed on that first evening, when he had started by touching her throat, with his fingers first and then with his lips, but their caresses began invariably with this modest exploration. And long afterwards, when the arrangement (or, rather, the ritual pretence of an arrangement) of her cattleyas had quite fallen into desuetude, the metaphor \"Do a cattleya,\" transmuted into a simple verb which they would employ without a thought of its original meaning when they wished to refer to the act of physical possession (in which, paradoxically, the possessor possesses nothing), survived to commemorate in their vocabulary the long forgotten custom from which it sprang. And yet possibly this particular manner of saying \"to make love\" had not the precise significance of its synonyms. However disillusioned we may be about women, however we may regard the possession of even the most divergent types as an invariable and monotonous experience, every detail of which is known and can be described in advance, it still becomes a fresh and stimulating pleasure if the women concerned be\u2014or be thought to be\u2014so difficult as to oblige us to base our attack upon some unrehearsed incident in our relations with them, as was originally for Swann the arrangement of the cattleyas. He trembled as he hoped, that evening, (but Odette, he told himself, if she were deceived by his stratagem, could not guess his intention) that it was the possession of this woman that would emerge for him from their large and richly coloured petals; and the pleasure which he already felt, and which Odette tolerated, he thought, perhaps only because she was not yet aware of it herself, seemed to him for that reason\u2014as it might have seemed to the first man when he enjoyed it amid the flowers of the earthly paradise\u2014a pleasure which had never before existed, which he was striving now to create, a pleasure\u2014and the special name which he was to give to it preserved its identity\u2014entirely individual and new\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ice once broken, every evening, when he had taken her home, he must follow her into the house; and often she would come out again in her dressing-gown, and escort him to his carriage, and would kiss him before the eyes of his coachman, saying: \"What on earth does it matter what people see?\" And on evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins' (which happened occasionally, now that he had opportunities of meeting Odette elsewhere), when\u2014more and more rarely\u2014he went into society, she would beg him to come to her on his way home, however late he might be. The season was spring, the nights clear and frosty. He would come away from an evening party, jump into his victoria, spread a rug over his knees, tell the friends who were leaving at the same time, and who insisted on his going home with them, that he could not, that he was not going in their direction; then the coachman would start off at a fast trot without further orders, knowing quite well where he had to go. His friends would be left marvelling, and, as a matter of fact, Swann was no longer the same man. No one ever received a letter from him now demanding an introduction to a woman. He had ceased to pay any attention to women, and kept away from the places in which they were ordinarily to be met. In a restaurant, or in the country, his manner was deliberately and directly the opposite of that by which, only a few days earlier, his friends would have recognised him, that manner which had seemed permanently and unalterably his own. To such an extent does passion manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character, which not only takes the place of our normal character but actually obliterates the signs by which that character has hitherto been discernible. On the other hand, there was one thing that was, now, invariable, namely that wherever Swann might be spending the evening, he never failed to go on afterwards to Odette. The interval of space separating her from him was one which he must as inevitably traverse as he must descend, by an irresistible gravitation, the steep slope of life itself. To be frank, as often as not, when he had stayed late at a party, he would have preferred to return home at once, without going so far out of his way, and to postpone their meeting until the morrow; but the very fact of his putting himself to such inconvenience at an abnormal hour in order to visit her, while he guessed that his friends, as he left them, were saying to one another: \"He is tied hand and foot; there must certainly be a woman somewhere who insists on his going to her at all hours,\" made him feel that he was leading the life of the class of men whose existence is coloured by a love-affair, and in whom the perpetual sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical interests has engendered a spiritual charm. Then, though he may not consciously have taken this into consideration, the certainty that she was waiting for him, that she was not anywhere or with anyone else, that he would see her before he went home, drew the sting from that anguish, forgotten, it is true, but latent and ever ready to be reawakened, which he had felt on the evening when Odette had left the Verdurins' before his arrival, an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable that it might even be called a state of happiness. Perhaps it was to that hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which Odette had since assumed in his life. Other people are, as a rule, so immaterial to us that, when we have entrusted to any one of them the power to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves, that person seems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with poetry, makes of our lives a vast expanse, quick with sensation, on which that person and ourselves are ever more or less in contact. Swann could not without anxiety ask himself what Odette would mean to him in the years that were to come. Sometimes, as he looked up from his victoria on those fine and frosty nights of early spring, and saw the dazzling moonbeams fall between his eyes and the deserted streets, he would think of that other face, gleaming and faintly roseate like the moon's, which had, one day, risen on the horizon of his mind and since then had shed upon the world that mysterious light in which he saw it bathed. If he arrived after the hour at which Odette sent her servants to bed, before ringing the bell at the gate of her little garden, he would go round first into the other street, over which, at the ground-level, among the windows (all exactly alike, but darkened) of the adjoining houses, shone the solitary lighted window of her room. He would rap upon the pane, and she would hear the signal, and answer, before running to meet him at the gate. He would find, lying open on the piano, some of her favourite music, the Valse des Roses, the Pauvre Fou of Tagliafico (which, according to the instructions embodied in her will, was to be played at her funeral); but he would ask her, instead, to give him the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. It was true that Odette played vilely, but often the fairest impression that remains in our minds of a favourite air is one which has arisen out of a jumble of wrong notes struck by unskilful fingers upon a tuneless piano. The little phrase was associated still, in Swann's mind, with his love for Odette. He felt clearly that this love was something to which there were no corresponding external signs, whose meaning could not be proved by any but himself; he realised, too, that Odette's qualities were not such as to justify his setting so high a value on the hours he spent in her company. And often, when the cold government of reason stood unchallenged, he would readily have ceased to sacrifice so many of his intellectual and social interests to this imaginary pleasure. But the little phrase, as soon as it struck his ear, had the power to liberate in him the room that was needed to contain it; the proportions of Swann's soul were altered; a margin was left for a form of enjoyment which corresponded no more than his love for Odette to any external object, and yet was not, like his enjoyment of that love, purely individual, but assumed for him an objective reality superior to that of other concrete things. This thirst for an untasted charm, the little phrase would stimulate it anew in him, but without bringing him any definite gratification to assuage it. With the result that those parts of Swann's soul in which the little phrase had obliterated all care for material interests, those human considerations which affect all men alike, were left bare by it, blank pages on which he was at liberty to inscribe the name of Odette. Moreover, where Odette's affection might seem ever so little abrupt and disappointing, the little phrase would come to supplement it, to amalgamate with it its own mysterious essence. Watching Swann's face while he listened to the phrase, one would have said that he was inhaling an anaesthetic which allowed him to breathe more deeply. And the pleasure which the music gave him, which was shortly to create in him a real longing, was in fact closely akin, at such moments, to the pleasure which he would have derived from experimenting with perfumes, from entering into contract with a world for which we men were not created, which appears to lack form because our eyes cannot perceive it, to lack significance because it escapes our intelligence, to which we may attain by way of one sense only. Deep repose, mysterious refreshment for Swann,\u2014for him whose eyes, although delicate interpreters of painting, whose mind, although an acute observer of manners, must bear for ever the indelible imprint of the barrenness of his life,\u2014to feel himself transformed into a creature foreign to humanity, blinded, deprived of his logical faculty, almost a fantastic unicorn, a chimaera-like creature conscious of the world through his two ears alone. And as, notwithstanding, he sought in the little phrase for a meaning to which his intelligence could not descend, with what a strange frenzy of intoxication must he strip bare his innermost soul of the whole armour of reason, and make it pass, unattended, through the straining vessel, down into the dark filter of sound. He began to reckon up how much that was painful, perhaps even how much secret and unappeased sorrow underlay the sweetness of the phrase; and yet to him it brought no suffering. What matter though the phrase repeated that love is frail and fleeting, when his love was so strong! He played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused, he felt it stealing over him, but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened his sense of his own happiness. He would make Odette play him the phrase again, ten, twenty times on end, insisting that, while she played, she must never cease to kiss him. Every kiss provokes another. Ah, in those earliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life. How closely, in their abundance, are they pressed one against another; until lovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour, as to count the flowers in a meadow in May. Then she would pretend to stop, saying: \"How do you expect me to play when you keep on holding me? I can't do everything at once. Make up your mind what you want; am I to play the phrase or do you want to play with me?\" Then he would become annoyed, and she would burst out with a laugh which, was transformed, as it left her lips, and descended upon him in a shower of kisses. Or else she would look at him sulkily, and he would see once again a face worthy to figure in Botticelli's 'Life of Moses,' he would place it there, giving to Odette's neck the necessary inclination; and when he had finished her portrait in distemper, in the fifteenth century, on the wall of the Sixtine, the idea that she was, none the less, in the room with him still, by the piano, at that very moment, ready to be kissed and won, the idea of her material existence, of her being alive, would sweep over him with so violent an intoxication that, with eyes starting from his head and jaws that parted as though to devour her, he would fling himself upon this Botticelli maiden and kiss and bite her cheeks. And then, as soon as he had left the house, not without returning to kiss her once again, because he had forgotten to take away with him, in memory, some detail of her fragrance or of her features, while he drove home in his victoria, blessing the name of Odette who allowed him to pay her these daily visits, which, although they could not, he felt, bring any great happiness to her, still, by keeping him immune from the fever of jealousy\u2014by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak of the heart-sickness which had manifested itself in him that evening, when he had failed to find her at the Verdurins'\u2014might help him to arrive, without any recurrence of those crises, of which the first had been so distressing that it must also be the last, at the termination of this strange series of hours in his life, hours almost enchanted, in the same manner as these other, following hours, in which he drove through a deserted Paris by the light of the moon: noticing as he drove home that the satellite had now changed its position, relatively to his own, and was almost touching the horizon; feeling that his love, also, was obedient to these immutable laws of nature, he asked himself whether this period, upon which he had entered, was to last much longer, whether presently his mind's eye would cease to behold that dear countenance, save as occupying a distant and diminished position, and on the verge of ceasing to shed on him the radiance of its charm. For Swann was finding in things once more, since he had fallen in love, the charm that he had found when, in his adolescence, he had fancied himself an artist; with this difference, that what charm lay in them now was conferred by Odette alone. He could feel reawakening in himself the inspirations of his boyhood, which had been dissipated among the frivolities of his later life, but they all bore, now, the reflection, the stamp of a particular being; and during the long hours which he now found a subtle pleasure in spending at home, alone with his convalescent spirit, he became gradually himself again, but himself in thraldom to another\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He went to her only in the evenings, and knew nothing of how she spent her time during the day, any more than he knew of her past; so little, indeed, that he had not even the tiny, initial clue which, by allowing us to imagine what we do not know, stimulates a desire foreknowledge. And so he never asked himself what she might be doing, or what her life had been. Only he smiled sometimes at the thought of how, some years earlier, when he still did not know her, some one had spoken to him of a woman who, if he remembered rightly, must certainly have been Odette, as of a 'tart,' a 'kept' woman, one of those women to whom he still attributed (having lived but little in their company) the entire set of characteristics, fundamentally perverse, with which they had been, for many years, endowed by the imagination of certain novelists. He would say to himself that one has, as often as not, only to take the exact counterpart of the reputation created by the world in order to judge a person fairly, when with such a character he contrasted that of Odette, so good, so simple, so enthusiastic in the pursuit of ideals, so nearly incapable of not telling the truth that, when he had once begged her, so that they might dine together alone, to write to Mme. Verdurin, saying that she was unwell, the next day he had seen her, face to face with Mme. Verdurin, who asked whether she had recovered, blushing, stammering, and, in spite of herself, revealing in every feature how painful, what a torture it was to her to act a lie; and, while in her answer she multiplied the fictitious details of an imaginary illness, seeming to ask pardon, by her suppliant look and her stricken accents, for the obvious falsehood of her words\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On certain days, however, though these came seldom, she would call upon him in the afternoon, to interrupt his musings or the essay on Ver-meer to which he had latterly returned. His servant would come in to say that Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy was in the small drawing-room. He would go in search of her, and, when he opened the door, on Odette's blushing countenance, as soon as she caught sight of Swann, would appear\u2014changing the curve of her lips, the look in her eyes, the moulding of her cheeks\u2014an all-absorbing smile. Once he was left alone he would see again that smile, and her smile of the day before, another with which she had greeted him sometime else, the smile which had been her answer, in the carriage that night, when he had asked her whether she objected to his rearranging her cattleyas; and the life of Odette at all other times, since he knew nothing of it, appeared to him upon a neutral and colourless background, like those sheets of sketches by Watteau upon which one sees, here and there, in every corner and in all directions, traced in three colours upon the buff paper, innumerable smiles. But, once in a while, illuminating a chink of that existence which Swann still saw as a complete blank, even if his mind assured him that it was not so, because he was unable to imagine anything that might occupy it, some friend who knew them both, and suspecting that they were in love, had not dared to tell him anything about her that was of the least importance, would describe Odette's figure, as he had seen her, that very morning, going on foot up the Rue Abbattucci, in a cape trimmed with skunks, wearing a Rembrandt hat, and a bunch of violets in her bosom. This simple outline reduced Swann to utter confusion by enabling him suddenly to perceive that Odette had an existence which was not wholly subordinated to his own; he burned to know whom she had been seeking to fascinate by this costume in which he had never seen her; he registered a vow to insist upon her telling him where she had been going at that intercepted moment, as though, in all the colourless life\u2014a life almost nonexistent, since she was then invisible to him\u2014of his mistress, there had been but a single incident apart from all those smiles directed towards himself; namely, her walking abroad beneath a Rembrandt hat, with a bunch of violets in her bosom\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except when he asked her for Vinteuil's little phrase instead of the Valse des Roses, Swann made no effort to induce her to play the things that he himself preferred, nor, in literature any more than in music, to correct the manifold errors of her taste. He fully realised that she was not intelligent. When she said how much she would like him to tell her about the great poets, she had imagined that she would suddenly get to know whole pages of romantic and heroic verse, in the style of the Vicomte de Borelli, only even more moving. As for Vermeer of Delft, she asked whether he had been made to suffer by a woman, if it was a woman that had inspired him, and once Swann had told her that no one knew, she had lost all interest in that painter. She would often say: \"I'm sure, poetry; well, of course, there'd be nothing like it if it was all true, if the poets really believed the things they said. But as often as not you'll find there's no one so mean and calculating as those fellows. I know something about poetry. I had a friend, once, who was in love with a poet of sorts. In his verses he never spoke of anything but love, and heaven, and the stars. Oh! she was properly taken in! He had more than three hundred thousand francs out of her before he'd finished.\" If, then, Swann tried to shew her in what artistic beauty consisted, how one ought to appreciate poetry or painting, after a minute or two she would cease to listen, saying: \"Yes... I never thought it would be like that.\" And he felt that her disappointment was so great that he preferred to lie to her, assuring her that what he had said was nothing, that he had only touched the surface, that he had not time to go into it all properly, that there was more in it than that. Then she would interrupt with a brisk, \"More in it? What?... Do tell me!\", but he did not tell her, for he realised how petty it would appear to her, and how different from what she had expected, less sensational and less touching; he was afraid, too, lest, disillusioned in the matter of art, she might at the same time be disillusioned in the greater matter of love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the result that she found Swann inferior, intellectually, to what she had supposed. \"You're always so reserved; I can't make you out.\" She marvelled increasingly at his indifference to money, at his courtesy to everyone alike, at the delicacy of his mind. And indeed it happens, often enough, to a greater man than Swann ever was, to a scientist or artist, when he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom he lives, that the feeling in them which proves that they have been convinced of the superiority of his intellect is created not by any admiration for his ideas\u2014for those are entirely beyond them\u2014but by their respect for what they term his good qualities. There was also the respect with which Odette was inspired by the thought of Swann's social position, although she had no desire that he should attempt to secure invitations for herself. Perhaps she felt that such attempts would be bound to fail; perhaps, indeed, she feared lest, merely by speaking of her to his friends, he should provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind. The fact remains that she had consistently held him to his promise never to mention her name. Her reason for not wishing to go into society was, she had told him, a quarrel which she had had, long ago, with another girl, who had avenged herself by saying nasty things about her. \"But,\" Swann objected, \"surely, people don't all know your friend.\" \"Yes, don't you see, it's like a spot of oil; people are so horrid.\" Swann was unable, frankly, to appreciate this point; on the other hand, he knew that such generalisations as \"People are so horrid,\" and \"A word of scandal spreads like a spot of oil,\" were generally accepted as true; there must, therefore, be cases to which they were literally applicable. Could Odette's case be one of these? He teased himself with the question, though not for long, for he too was subject to that mental oppression which had so weighed upon his father, whenever he was faced by a difficult problem. In any event, that world of society which concealed such terrors for Odette inspired her, probably, with no very great longing to enter it, since it was too far removed from the world which she already knew for her to be able to form any clear conception of it. At the same time, while in certain respects she had retained a genuine simplicity (she had, for instance, kept up a friendship with a little dressmaker, now retired from business, up whose steep and dark and fetid staircase she clambered almost every day), she still thirsted to be in the fashion, though her idea of it was not altogether that held by fashionable people. For the latter, fashion is a thing that emanates from a comparatively small number of leaders, who project it to a considerable distance\u2014with more or less strength according as one is nearer to or farther from their intimate centre\u2014over the widening circle of their friends and the friends of their friends, whose names form a sort of tabulated index. People 'in society' know this index by heart, they are gifted in such matters with an erudition from which they have extracted a sort of taste, of tact, so automatic in its operation that Swann, for example, without needing to draw upon his knowledge of the world, if he read in a newspaper the names of the people who had been guests at a dinner, could tell at once how fashionable the dinner had been, just as a man of letters, merely by reading a phrase, can estimate exactly the literary merit of its author. But Odette was one of those persons (an extremely numerous class, whatever the fashionable world may think, and to be found in every section of society) who do not share this knowledge, but imagine fashion to be something of quite another kind, which assumes different aspects according to the circle to which they themselves belong, but has the special characteristic\u2014common alike to the fashion of which Odette used to dream and to that before which Mme. Cottard bowed\u2014of being directly accessible to all. The other kind, the fashion of 'fashionable people,' is, it must be admitted, accessible also; but there are inevitable delays. Odette would say of some one: \"He never goes to any place that isn't really smart.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if Swann were to ask her what she meant by that, she would answer, with a touch of contempt, \"Smart places! Why, good heavens, just fancy, at your age, having to be told what the smart places are in Paris! What do you expect me to say? Well, on Sunday mornings there's the Avenue de l'Imp\u00e9ratrice, and round the lake at five o'clock, and on Thursdays the Eden-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, and the Hippodrome on Fridays; then there are the balls...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What balls?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, silly, the balls people give in Paris; the smart ones, I mean. Wait now, Herbinger, you know who I mean, the fellow who's in one of the jobbers' offices; yes, of course, you must know him, he's one of the best-known men in Paris, that great big fair-haired boy who wears such swagger clothes; he always has a flower in his buttonhole and a light-coloured overcoat with a fold down the back; he goes about with that old image, takes her to all the first-nights. Very well! He gave a ball the other night, and all the smart people in Paris were there. I should have loved to go! but you had to shew your invitation at the door, and I couldn't get one anywhere. After all, I'm just as glad, now, that I didn't go; I should have been killed in the crush, and seen nothing. Still, just to be able to say one had been to Herbinger's ball. You know how vain I am! However, you may be quite certain that half the people who tell you they were there are telling stories.... But I am surprised that you weren't there, a regular 'tip-topper' like you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann made no attempt, however, to modify this conception of fashion; feeling that his own came no nearer to the truth, was just as fatuous, devoid of all importance, he saw no advantage to be gained by imparting it to his mistress, with the result that, after a few months, she ceased to take any interest in the people to whose houses he went, except when they were the means of his obtaining tickets for the paddock at race-meetings or first-nights at the theatre. She hoped that he would continue to cultivate such profitable acquaintances, but she had come to regard them as less smart since the day when she had passed the Marquise de Villeparisis in the street, wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet with strings\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But she looks like a pew-opener, like an old charwoman, darling! That a marquise! Goodness knows I'm not a marquise, but you'd have to pay me a lot of money before you'd get me to go about Paris rigged out like that!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor could she understand Swann's continuing to live in his house on the Quai d'Orl\u00e9ans, which, though she dared not tell him so, she considered unworthy of him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was true that she claimed to be fond of 'antiques,' and used to assume a rapturous and knowing air when she confessed how she loved to spend the whole day 'rummaging' in second-hand shops, hunting for 'bric-\u00e0-brac,' and things of the 'right date.' Although it was a point of honour, to which she obstinately clung, as though obeying some old family custom, that she should never answer any questions, never give any account of what she did during the daytime, she spoke to Swann once about a friend to whose house she had been invited, and had found that everything in it was 'of the period.' Swann could not get her to tell him what 'period' it was. Only after thinking the matter over she replied that it was 'mediaeval'; by which she meant that the walls were panelled. Some time later she spoke to him again of her friend, and added, in the hesitating but confident tone in which one refers to a person whom one has met somewhere, at dinner, the night before, of whom one had never heard until then, but whom one's hosts seemed to regard as some one so celebrated and important that one hopes that one's listener will know quite well who is meant, and will be duly impressed: \"Her dining-room... is... eighteenth century!\" Incidentally, she had thought it hideous, all bare, as though the house were still unfinished; women looked frightful in it, and it would never become the fashion. She mentioned it again, a third time, when she shewed Swann a card with the name and address of the man who had designed the dining-room, and whom she wanted to send for, when she had enough money, to see whether he could not do one for her too; not one like that, of course, but one of the sort she used to dream of, one which, unfortunately, her little house would not be large enough to contain, with tall sideboards, Renaissance furniture and fireplaces like the Ch\u00e2teau at Blois. It was on this occasion that she let out to Swann what she really thought of his abode on the Quai d'Orl\u00e9ans; he having ventured the criticism that her friend had indulged, not in the Louis XVI style, for, he went on, although that was not, of course, done, still it might be made charming, but in the 'Sham-Antique.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You wouldn't have her live, like you, among a lot of broken-down chairs and threadbare carpets!\" she exclaimed, the innate respectability of the middle-class housewife rising impulsively to the surface through the acquired dilettantism of the 'light woman.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People who enjoyed 'picking-up' things, who admired poetry, despised sordid calculations of profit and loss, and nourished ideals of honour and love, she placed in a class by themselves, superior to the rest of humanity. There was no need actually to have those tastes, provided one talked enough about them; when a man had told her at dinner that he loved to wander about and get his hands all covered with dust in the old furniture shops, that he would never be really appreciated in this commercial age, since he was not concerned about the things that interested it, and that he belonged to another generation altogether, she would come home saying: \"Why, he's an adorable creature; so sensitive! I had no idea,\" and she would conceive for him a strong and sudden friendship. But, on the other hand, men who, like Swann, had these tastes but did not speak of them, left her cold. She was obliged, of course, to admit that Swann was most generous with his money, but she would add, pouting: \"It's not the same thing, you see, with him,\" and, as a matter of fact, what appealed to her imagination was not the practice of disinterestedness, but its vocabulary\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling that, often, he could not give her in reality the pleasures of which she dreamed, he tried at least to ensure that she should be happy in his company, tried not to contradict those vulgar ideas, that bad taste which she displayed on every possible occasion, which all the same he loved, as he could not help loving everything that came from her, which even fascinated him, for were they not so many more of those characteristic features, by virtue of which the essential qualities of the woman emerged, and were made visible? And so, when she was in a happy mood because she was going to see the Reine Topaze, or when her eyes grew serious, troubled, petulant, if she was afraid of missing the flower-show, or merely of not being in time for tea, with muffins and toast, at the Rue Royale tea-rooms, where she believed that regular attendance was indispensable, and set the seal upon a woman's certificate of 'smartness,' Swann, enraptured, as all of us are, at times, by the natural behaviour of a child, or by the likeness of a portrait, which appears to be on the point of speaking, would feel so distinctly the soul of his mistress rising to fill the outlines of her face that he could not refrain from going across and welcoming it with his lips. \"Oh, then, so little Odette wants us to take her to the flower-show, does she? she wants to be admired, does she? very well, we will take her there, we can but obey her wishes.\" As Swann's sight was beginning to fail, he had to resign himself to a pair of spectacles, which he wore at home, when working, while to face the world he adopted a single eyeglass, as being less disfiguring. The first time that she saw it in his eye, she could not contain herself for joy: \"I really do think\u2014for a man, that is to say\u2014it is tremendously smart! How nice you look with it! Every inch a gentleman. All you want now is a title!\" she concluded, with a tinge of regret in her voice. He liked Odette to say these things, just as, if he had been in love with a Breton girl, he would have enjoyed seeing her in her coif and hearing her say that she believed in ghosts. Always until then, as is common among men whose taste for the fine arts develops independently of their sensuality, a grotesque disparity had existed between the satisfactions which he would accord to either taste simultaneously; yielding to the seduction of works of art which grew more and more subtle as the women in whose company he enjoyed them grew more illiterate and common, he would take a little servant-girl to a screened box in a theatre where there was some decadent piece which he had wished to see performed, or to an exhibition of impressionist painting, with the conviction, moreover, that an educated, 'society' woman would have understood them no better, but would not have managed to keep quiet about them so prettily. But, now that he was in love with Odette, all this was changed; to share her sympathies, to strive to be one with her in spirit was a task so attractive that he tried to find satisfaction in the things that she liked, and did find a pleasure, not only in copying her habits but in adopting her opinions, which was all the deeper because, as those habits and opinions sprang from no roots in her intelligence, they suggested to him nothing except that love, for the sake of which he had preferred them to his own. If he went again to Serge Panine, if he looked out for opportunities of going to watch Olivier M\u00e9tra conducting, it was for the pleasure of being initiated into every one of the ideas in Odette's mind, of feeling that he had an equal share in all her tastes. This charm of drawing him closer to her, which her favourite plays and pictures and places possessed, struck him as being more mysterious than the intrinsic charm of more beautiful things and places, which appealed to him by their beauty, but without recalling her. Besides, having allowed the intellectual beliefs of his youth to grow faint, until his scepticism, as a finished 'man of the world,' had gradually penetrated them unawares, he held (or at least he had held for so long that he had fallen into the habit of saying) that the objects which we admire have no absolute value in themselves, that the whole thing is a matter of dates and castes, and consists in a series of fashions, the most vulgar of which are worth just as much as those which are regarded as the most refined. And as he had decided that the importance which Odette attached to receiving cards tot a private view was not in itself any more ridiculous than the pleasure which he himself had at one time felt in going to luncheon with the Prince of Wales, so he did not think that the admiration which she professed for Monte-Carlo or for the Righi was any more unreasonable than his own liking for Holland (which she imagined as ugly) and for Versailles (which bored her to tears). And so he denied himself the pleasure of visiting those places, consoling himself with the reflection that it was for her sake that he wished to feel, to like nothing that was not equally felt and liked by her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like everything else that formed part of Odette's environment, and was no more, in a sense, than the means whereby he might see and talk to her more often, he enjoyed the society of the Verdurins. With them, since, at the heart of all their entertainments, dinners, musical evenings, games, suppers in fancy dress, excursions to the country, theatre parties, even the infrequent 'big evenings' when they entertained 'bores,' there were the presence of Odette, the sight of Odette, conversation with Odette, an inestimable boon which the Verdurins, by inviting him to their house, bestowed on Swann, he was happier in the little 'nucleus' than anywhere else, and tried to find some genuine merit in each of its members, imagining that his tastes would lead him to frequent their society for the rest of his life. Never daring to whisper to himself, lest he should doubt the truth of the suggestion, that he would always be in love with Odette, at least when he tried to suppose that he would always go to the Verdurins' (a proposition which, a priori, raised fewer fundamental objections on the part of his intelligence), he saw himself for the future continuing to meet Odette every evening; that did not, perhaps, come quite to the same thing as his being permanently in love with her, but for the moment while he was in love with her, to feel that he would not, one day, cease to see her was all that he could ask. \"What a charming atmosphere!\" he said to himself. \"How entirely genuine life is to these people! They are far more intelligent, far more artistic, surely, than the people one knows. Mme. Verdurin, in spite of a few trifling exaggerations which are rather absurd, has a sincere love of painting and music! What a passion for works of art, what anxiety to give pleasure to artists! Her ideas about some of the people one knows are not quite right, but then their ideas about artistic circles are altogether wrong! Possibly I make no great intellectual demands upon conversation, but I am perfectly happy talking to Cottard, although he does trot out those idiotic puns. And as for the painter, if he is rather unpleasantly affected when he tries to be paradoxical, still he has one of the finest brains that I have ever come across. Besides, what is most important, one feels quite free there, one does what one likes without constraint or fuss. What a flow of humour there is every day in that drawing-room! Certainly, with a few rare exceptions, I never want to go anywhere else again. It will become more and more of a habit, and I shall spend the rest of my life among them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And as the qualities which he supposed to be an intrinsic part of the Verdurin character were no more, really, than their superficial reflection of the pleasure which had been enjoyed in their society by his love for Odette, those qualities became more serious, more profound, more vital, as that pleasure increased. Since Mme. Verdurin gave Swann, now and then, what alone could constitute his happiness; since, on an evening when he felt anxious because Odette had talked rather more to one of the party than to another, and, in a spasm of irritation, would not take the initiative by asking her whether she was coming home, Mme. Verdurin brought peace and joy to his troubled spirit by the spontaneous exclamation: \"Odette! You'll see M. Swann home, won't you?\"; since, when the summer holidays came, and after he had asked himself uneasily whether Odette might not leave Paris without him, whether he would still be able to see her every day, Mme. Verdurin was going to invite them both to spend the summer with her in the country; Swann, unconsciously allowing gratitude and self-interest to filter into his intelligence and to influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that Mme. Verdurin was \"a great and noble soul.\" Should any of his old fellow-pupils in the Louvre school of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist, \"I'd a hundred times rather,\" he would reply, \"have the Verdurins.\" And, with a solemnity of diction which was new in him: \"They are magnanimous creatures, and magnanimity is, after all, the one thing that matters, the one thing that gives us distinction here on earth. Look you, there are only two classes of men, the magnanimous, and the rest; and I have reached an age when one has to take sides, to decide once and for all whom one is going to like and dislike, to stick to the people one likes, and, to make up for the time one has wasted with the others, never to leave them again as long as one lives. Very well!\" he went on, with the slight emotion which a man feels when, even without being fully aware of what he is doing, he says something, not because it is true but because he enjoys saying it, and listens to his own voice uttering the words as though they came from some one else, \"The die is now cast; I have elected to love none but magnanimous souls, and to live only in an atmosphere of magnanimity. You ask me whether Mme. Verdurin is really intelligent. I can assure you that she has given me proofs of a nobility of heart, of a loftiness of soul, to which no one could possibly attain\u2014how could they?\u2014without a corresponding loftiness of mind. Without question, she has a profound understanding of art. But it is not, perhaps, in that that she is most admirable; every little action, ingeniously, exquisitely kind, which she has performed for my sake, every friendly attention, simple little things, quite domestic and yet quite sublime, reveal a more profound comprehension of existence than all your textbooks of philosophy.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He might have reminded himself, all the same, that there were various old friends of his family who were just as simple as the Verdurins, companions of his early days who were just as fond of art, that he knew other 'great-hearted creatures,' and that, nevertheless, since he had cast his vote in favour of simplicity, the arts, and magnanimity, he had entirely ceased to see them. But these people did not know Odette, and, if they had known her, would never have thought of introducing her to him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so there was probably not, in the whole of the Verdurin circle, a single one of the 'faithful' who loved them, or believed that he loved them, as dearly as did Swann. And yet, when M. Verdurin said that he was not satisfied with Swann, he had not only expressed his own sentiments, he had unwittingly discovered his wife's. Doubtless Swann had too particular an affection for Odette, as to which he had failed to take Mme. Verdurin daily into his confidence; doubtless the very discretion with which he availed himself of the Verdurins' hospitality, refraining, often, from coming to dine with them for a reason which they never suspected, and in place of which they saw only an anxiety on his part not to have to decline an invitation to the house of some 'bore' or other; doubtless, also, and despite all the precautions which he had taken to keep it from them, the gradual discovery which they were making of his brilliant position in society\u2014doubtless all these things contributed to their general annoyance with Swann. But the real, the fundamental reason was quite different. What had happened was that they had at once discovered in him a locked door, a reserved, impenetrable chamber in which he still professed silently to himself that the Princesse de Sagan was not grotesque, and that Cottard's jokes were not amusing; in a word (and for all that he never once abandoned his friendly attitude towards them all, or revolted from their dogmas), they had discovered an impossibility of imposing those dogmas upon him, of entirely converting him to their faith, the like of which they had never come across in anyone before. They would have forgiven his going to the houses of 'bores' (to whom, as it happened, in his heart of hearts he infinitely preferred the Verdurins and all their little 'nucleus') had he consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those 'bores' in the presence of the 'faithful.' But that was an abjuration which, as they well knew, they were powerless to extort\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What a difference was there in a 'newcomer' whom Odette had asked them to invite, although she herself had met him only a few times, and on whom they were building great hopes\u2014the Comte de Forcheville! (It turned out that he was nothing more nor less than the brother-in-law of Saniette, a discovery which filled all the 'faithful' with amazement: the manners of the old palaeographer were so humble that they had always supposed him to be of a class inferior, socially, to their own, and had never expected to learn that he came of a rich and relatively aristocratic family.) Of course, Forcheville was enormously the 'swell,' which Swann was not or had quite ceased to be; of course, he would never dream of placing, as Swann now placed, the Verdurin circle above any other. But he lacked that natural refinement which prevented Swann from associating himself with the criticisms (too obviously false to be worth his notice) that Mme. Verdurin levelled at people whom he knew. As for the vulgar and affected tirades in which the painter sometimes indulged, the bag-man's pleasantries which Cottard used to hazard,\u2014whereas Swann, who liked both men sincerely, could easily find excuses for these without having either the courage or the hypocrisy to applaud them, Forcheville, on the other hand, was on an intellectual level which permitted him to be stupified, amazed by the invective (without in the least understanding what it all was about), and to be frankly delighted by the wit. And the very first dinner at the Verdurins' at which Forcheville was present threw a glaring light upon all the differences between them, made his qualities start into prominence and precipitated the disgrace of Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was, at this dinner, besides the usual party, a professor from the Sorbonne, one Brichot, who had met M. and Mme. Verdurin at a watering-place somewhere, and, if his duties at the university and his other works of scholarship had not left him with very little time to spare, would gladly have come to them more often. For he had that curiosity, that superstitious outlook on life, which, combined with a certain amount of scepticism with regard to the object of their studies, earn for men of intelligence, whatever their profession, for doctors who do not believe in medicine, for schoolmasters who do not believe in Latin exercises, the reputation of having broad, brilliant, and indeed superior minds. He affected, when at Mme. Verdurin's, to choose his illustrations from among the most topical subjects of the day, when he spoke of philosophy or history, principally because he regarded those sciences as no more, really, than a preparation for life itself, and imagined that he was seeing put into practice by the 'little clan' what hitherto he had known only from books; and also, perhaps, because, having had drilled into him as a boy, and having unconsciously preserved, a feeling of reverence for certain subjects, he thought that he was casting aside the scholar's gown when he ventured to treat those subjects with a conversational licence, which seemed so to him only because the folds of the gown still clung\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Early in the course of the dinner, when M. de Forcheville, seated on the right of Mme. Verdurin, who, in the 'newcomer's' honour, had taken great pains with her toilet, observed to her: \"Quite original, that white dress,\" the Doctor, who had never taken his eyes off him, so curious was he to learn the nature and attributes of what he called a \"de,\" and was on the look-out for an opportunity of attracting his attention, so as to come into closer contact with him, caught in its flight the adjective 'blanche' and, his eyes still glued to his plate, snapped out, \"Blanche? Blanche of Castile?\" then, without moving his head, shot a furtive glance to right and left of him, doubtful, but happy on the whole. While Swann, by the painful and futile effort which he made to smile, testified that he thought the pun absurd, Forcheville had shewn at once that he could appreciate its subtlety, and that he was a man of the world, by keeping within its proper limits a mirth the spontaneity of which had charmed Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What are you to say of a scientist like that?\" she asked Forcheville. \"You can't talk seriously to him for two minutes on end. Is that the sort of thing you tell them at your hospital?\" she went on, turning to the Doctor. \"They must have some pretty lively times there, if that's the case. I can see that I shall have to get taken in as a patient!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think I heard the Doctor speak of that wicked old humbug, Blanche of Castile, if I may so express myself. Am I not right, Madame?\" Brichot appealed to Mme. Verdurin, who, swooning with merriment, her eyes tightly closed, had buried her face in her two hands, from between which, now and then, escaped a muffled scream\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Good gracious, Madame, I would not dream of shocking the reverent-minded, if there are any such around this table, sub rosa... I recognise, moreover, that our ineffable and Athenian\u2014oh, how infinitely Athenian\u2014Republic is capable of honouring, in the person of that obscurantist old she-Capet, the first of our chiefs of police. Yes, indeed, my dear host, yes, indeed!\" he repeated in his ringing voice, which sounded a separate note for each syllable, in reply to a protest by M. Verdurin. \"The Chronicle of Saint Denis, and the authenticity of its information is beyond question, leaves us no room for doubt on that point. No one could be more fitly chosen as Patron by a secularising proletariat than that mother of a Saint, who let him see some pretty fishy saints besides, as Suger says, and other great St. Bernards of the sort; for with her it was a case of taking just what you pleased.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Who is that gentleman?\" Forcheville asked Mme. Verdurin. \"He seems to speak with great authority.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What! Do you mean to say you don't know the famous Brichot? Why, he's celebrated all over Europe.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, that's Br\u00e9chot, is it?\" exclaimed Forcheville, who had not quite caught the name. \"You must tell me all about him\"; he went on, fastening a pair of goggle eyes on the celebrity. \"It's always interesting to meet well-known people at dinner. But, I say, you ask us to very select parties here. No dull evenings in this house, I'm sure.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, you know what it is really,\" said Mme. Verdurin modestly. \"They feel safe here. They can talk about whatever they like, and the conversation goes off like fireworks. Now Brichot, this evening, is nothing. I've seen him, don't you know, when he's been with me, simply dazzling; you'd want to go on your knees to him. Well, with anyone else he's not the same man, he's not in the least witty, you have to drag the words out of him, he's even boring.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That's strange,\" remarked Forcheville with fitting astonishment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A sort of wit like Brichot's would have been regarded as out-and-out stupidity by the people among whom Swann had spent his early life, for all that it is quite compatible with real intelligence. And the intelligence of the Professor's vigorous and well-nourished brain might easily have been envied by many of the people in society who seemed witty enough to Swann. But these last had so thoroughly inculcated into him their likes and dislikes, at least in everything that pertained to their ordinary social existence, including that annex to social existence which belongs, strictly speaking, to the domain of intelligence, namely, conversation, that Swann could not see anything in Brichot's pleasantries; to him they were merely pedantic, vulgar, and disgustingly coarse. He was shocked, too, being accustomed to good manners, by the rude, almost barrack-room tone which this student-in-arms adopted, no matter to whom he was speaking. Finally, perhaps, he had lost all patience that evening as he watched Mme. Verdurin welcoming, with such unnecessary warmth, this Forcheville fellow, whom it had been Odette's unaccountable idea to bring to the house. Feeling a little awkward, with Swann there also, she had asked him on her arrival: \"What do you think of my guest?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he, suddenly realising for the first time that Forcheville, whom he had known for years, could actually attract a woman, and was quite a good specimen of a man, had retorted: \"Beastly!\" He had, certainly, no idea of being jealous of Odette, but did not feel quite so happy as usual, and when Brichot, having begun to tell them the story of Blanche of Castile's mother, who, according to him, \"had been with Henry Plantagenet for years before they were married,\" tried to prompt Swann to beg him to continue the story, by interjecting \"Isn't that so, M. Swann?\" in the martial accents which one uses in order to get down to the level of an unintelligent rustic or to put the 'fear of God' into a trooper, Swann cut his story short, to the intense fury of their hostess, by begging to be excused for taking so little interest in Blanche of Castile, as he had something that he wished to ask the painter. He, it appeared, had been that afternoon to an exhibition of the work of another artist, also a friend of Mme. Verdurin, who had recently died, and Swann wished to find out from him (for he valued his discrimination) whether there had really been anything more in this later work than the virtuosity which had struck people so forcibly in his earlier exhibitions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"From that point of view it was extraordinary, but it did not seem to me to be a form of art which you could call 'elevated,'\" said Swann with a smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Elevated... to the height of an Institute!\" interrupted Cottard, raising his arms with mock solemnity. The whole table burst out laughing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What did I tell you?\" said Mme. Verdurin to Forcheville. \"It's simply impossible to be serious with him. When you least expect it, out he comes with a joke.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she observed that Swann, and Swann alone, had not unbent. For one thing he was none too well pleased with Cottard for having secured a laugh at his expense in front of Forcheville. But the painter, instead of replying in a way that might have interested Swann, as he would probably have done had they been alone together, preferred to win the easy admiration of the rest by exercising his wit upon the talent of their dead friend\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I went up to one of them,\" he began, \"just to see how it was done; I stuck my nose into it. Yes, I don't think! Impossible to say whether it was done with glue, with soap, with sealing-wax, with sunshine, with leaven, with excrem...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And one make twelve!\" shouted the Doctor, wittily, but just too late, for no one saw the point of his interruption\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It looks as though it were done with nothing at all,\" resumed the painter. \"No more chance of discovering the trick than there is in the 'Night Watch,' or the 'Regents,' and it's even bigger work than either Rembrandt or Hals ever did. It's all there,\u2014and yet, no, I'll take my oath it isn't.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, just as singers who have reached the highest note in their compass, proceed to hum the rest of the air in falsetto, he had to be satisfied with murmuring, smiling the while, as if, after all, there had been something irresistibly amusing in the sheer beauty of the painting: \"It smells all right; it makes your head go round; it catches your breath; you feel ticklish all over\u2014and not the faintest clue to how it's done. The man's a sorcerer; the thing's a conjuring-trick, it's a miracle,\" bursting outright into laughter, \"it's dishonest!\" Then stopping, solemnly raising his head, pitching his voice on a double-bass note which he struggled to bring into harmony, he concluded, \"And it's so loyal!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except at the moment when he had called it \"bigger than the 'Night Watch,'\" a blasphemy which had called forth an instant protest from Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the 'Night Watch' as the supreme masterpiece of the universe (conjointly with the 'Ninth' and the 'Samothrace'), and at the word \"excrement,\" which had made Forcheville throw a sweeping glance round the table to see whether it was 'all right,' before he allowed his lips to curve in a prudish and conciliatory smile, all the party (save Swann) had kept their fascinated and adoring eyes fixed upon the painter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I do so love him when he goes up in the air like that!\" cried Mme. Verdurin, the moment that he had finished, enraptured that the table-talk should have proved so entertaining on the very night that Forcheville was dining with them for the first time. \"Hallo, you!\" she turned to her husband, \"what's the matter with you, sitting there gaping like a great animal? You know, though, don't you,\" she apologised for him to the painter, \"that he can talk quite well when he chooses; anybody would think it was the first time he had ever listened to you. If you had only seen him while you were speaking; he was just drinking it all in. And to-morrow he will tell us everything you said, without missing a word.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, really, I'm not joking!\" protested the painter, enchanted by the success of his speech. \"You all look as if you thought I was pulling your legs, that it was just a trick. I'll take you to see the show, and then you can say whether I've been exaggerating; I'll bet you anything you like, you'll come away more 'up in the air' than I am!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But we don't suppose for a moment that you're exaggerating; we only want you to go on with your dinner, and my husband too. Give M. Biche some more sole, can't you see his has got cold? We're not in any hurry; you're dashing round as if the house was on fire. Wait a little; don't serve the salad just yet.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Cottard, who was a shy woman and spoke but seldom, was not lacking, for all that, in self-assurance when a happy inspiration put the right word in her mouth. She felt that it would be well received; the thought gave her confidence, and what she was doing was done with the object not so much of shining herself, as of helping her husband on in his career. And so she did not allow the word 'salad,' which Mme. Verdurin had just uttered, to pass unchallenged\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's not a Japanese salad, is it?\" she whispered, turning towards Odette\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, in her joy and confusion at the combination of neatness and daring which there had been in making so discreet and yet so unmistakable an allusion to the new and brilliantly successful play by Dumas, she broke down in a charming, girlish laugh, not very loud, but so irresistible that it was some time before she could control it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Who is that lady? She seems devilish clever,\" said Forcheville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, it is not. But we will have one for you if you will all come to dinner on Friday.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You will think me dreadfully provincial, sir,\" said Mme. Cottard to Swann, \"but, do you know, I haven't been yet to this famous Francillon that everybody's talking about. The Doctor has been (I remember now, he told me what a very great pleasure it had been to him to spend the evening with you there) and I must confess, I don't see much sense in spending money on seats for him to take me, when he's seen the play already. Of course an evening at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais is never wasted, really; the acting's so good there always; but we have some very nice friends,\" (Mme. Cottard would hardly ever utter a proper name, but restricted herself to \"some friends of ours\" or \"one of my friends,\" as being more 'distinguished,' speaking in an affected tone and with all the importance of a person who need give names only when she chooses) \"who often have a box, and are kind enough to take us to all the new pieces that are worth going to, and so I'm certain to see this Francillon sooner or later, and then I shall know what to think. But I do feel such a fool about it, I must confess, for, whenever I pay a call anywhere, I find everybody talking\u2014it's only natural\u2014about that wretched Japanese salad. Really and truly, one's beginning to get just a little tired of hearing about it,\" she went on, seeing that Swann seemed less interested than she had hoped in so burning a topic. \"I must admit, though, that it's sometimes quite amusing, the way they joke about it: I've got a friend, now, who is most original, though she's really a beautiful woman, most popular in society, goes everywhere, and she tells me that she got her cook to make one of these Japanese salads, putting in everything that young M. Dumas says you're to put in, in the play. Then she asked just a few friends to come and taste it. I was not among the favoured few, I'm sorry to say. But she told us all about it on her next 'day'; it seems it was quite horrible, she made us all laugh till we cried. I don't know; perhaps it was the way she told it,\" Mme. Cottard added doubtfully, seeing that Swann still looked grave\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, imagining that it was, perhaps, because he had not been amused by Francillon: \"Well, I daresay I shall be disappointed with it, after all. I don't suppose it's as good as the piece Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy worships, Serge Panine. There's a play, if you like; so deep, makes you think! But just fancy giving a receipt for a salad on the stage of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais! Now, Serge Panine\u2014! But then, it's like everything that comes from the pen of M. Georges Ohnet, it's so well written. I wonder if you know the Ma\u00eetre des Forges, which I like even better than Serge Panine.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Pardon me,\" said Swann with polite irony, \"but I can assure you that my want of admiration is almost equally divided between those masterpieces.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Really, now; that's very interesting. And what don't you like about them? Won't you ever change your mind? Perhaps you think he's a little too sad. Well, well, what I always say is, one should never argue about plays or novels. Everyone has his own way of looking at things, and what may be horrible to you is, perhaps, just what I like best.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was interrupted by Forcheville's addressing Swann. What had happened was that, while Mme. Cottard was discussing Francillon, Forcheville had been expressing to Mme. Verdurin his admiration for what he called the \"little speech\" of the painter. \"Your friend has such a flow of language, such a memory!\" he had said to her when the painter had come to a standstill, \"I've seldom seen anything like it. He'd make a first-rate preacher. By Jove, I wish I was like that. What with him and M. Br\u00e9chot you've drawn two lucky numbers to-night; though I'm not so sure that, simply as a speaker, this one doesn't knock spots off the Professor. It comes more naturally with him, less like reading from a book. Of course, the way he goes on, he does use some words that are a bit realistic, and all that; but that's quite the thing nowadays; anyhow, it's not often I've seen a man hold the floor as cleverly as that, 'hold the spittoon,' as we used to say in the regiment, where, by the way, we had a man he rather reminds me of. You could take anything you liked\u2014I don't know what\u2014this glass, say; and he'd talk away about it for hours; no, not this glass; that's a silly thing to say, I'm sorry; but something a little bigger, like the battle of Waterloo, or anything of that sort, he'd tell you things you simply wouldn't believe. Why, Swann was in the regiment then; he must have known him.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you see much of M. Swann?\" asked Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh dear, no!\" he answered, and then, thinking that if he made himself pleasant to Swann he might find favour with Odette, he decided to take this opportunity of flattering him by speaking of his fashionable friends, but speaking as a man of the world himself, in a tone of good-natured criticism, and not as though he were congratulating Swann upon some undeserved good fortune: \"Isn't that so, Swann? I never see anything of you, do I?\u2014But then, where on earth is one to see him? The creature spends all his time shut up with the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles, with the Laumes and all that lot!\" The imputation would have been false at any time, and was all the more so, now that for at least a year Swann had given up going to almost any house but the Verdurins'. But the mere names of families whom the Verdurins did not know were received by them in a reproachful silence. M. Verdurin, dreading the painful impression which the mention of these 'bores,' especially when flung at her in this tactless fashion, and in front of all the 'faithful,' was bound to make on his wife, cast a covert glance at her, instinct with anxious solicitude. He saw then that in her fixed resolution to take no notice, to have escaped contact, altogether, with the news which had just been addressed to her, not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf as well, as we pretend to be when a friend who has been in the wrong attempts to slip into his conversation some excuse which we should appear to be accepting, should we appear to have heard it without protesting, or when some one utters the name of an enemy, the very mention of whom in our presence is forbidden; Mme. Verdurin, so that her silence should have the appearance, not of consent but of the unconscious silence which inanimate objects preserve, had suddenly emptied her face of all life, of all mobility; her rounded forehead was nothing, now, but an exquisite study in high relief, which the name of those La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles, with whom Swann was always 'shut up,' had failed to penetrate; her nose, just perceptibly wrinkled in a frown, exposed to view two dark cavities that were, surely, modelled from life. You would have said that her half-opened lips were just about to speak. It was all no more, however, than a wax cast, a mask in plaster, the sculptor's design for a monument, a bust to be exhibited in the Palace of Industry, where the public would most certainly gather in front of it and marvel to see how the sculptor, in expressing the unchallengeable dignity of the Verdurins, as opposed to that of the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles or Laumes, whose equals (if not, indeed, their betters) they were, and the equals and betters of all other 'bores' upon the face of the earth, had managed to invest with a majesty that was almost Papal the whiteness and rigidity of his stone. But the marble at last grew animated and let it be understood that it didn't do to be at all squeamish if one went to that house, since the woman was always tipsy and the husband so uneducated that he called a corridor a 'collidor'!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You'd need to pay me a lot of money before I'd let any of that lot set foot inside my house,\" Mme. Verdurin concluded, gazing imperially down on Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She could scarcely have expected him to capitulate so completely as to echo the holy simplicity of the pianist's aunt, who at once exclaimed: \"To think of that, now! What surprises me is that they can get anybody to go near them; I'm sure I should be afraid; one can't be too careful. How can people be so common as to go running after them?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he might, at least, have replied, like Forcheville: \"Gad, she's a duchess; there are still plenty of people who are impressed by that sort of thing,\" which would at least have permitted Mme. Verdurin the final retort, \"And a lot of good may it do them!\" Instead of which, Swann merely smiled, in a manner which shewed, quite clearly, that he could not, of course, take such an absurd suggestion seriously. M. Verdurin, who was still casting furtive and intermittent glances at his wife, could see with regret, and could understand only too well that she was now inflamed with the passion of a Grand Inquisitor who cannot succeed in stamping out a heresy; and so, in the hope of bringing Swann round to a retractation (for the courage of one's opinions is always a form of calculating cowardice in the eyes of the 'other side'), he broke in:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tell us frankly, now, what you think of them yourself. We shan't repeat it to them, you may be sure.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To which Swann answered: \"Why, I'm not in the least afraid of the Duchess (if it is of the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles that you're speaking). I can assure you that everyone likes going to see her. I don't go so far as to say that she's at all 'deep'\u2014\" he pronounced the word as if it meant something ridiculous, for his speech kept the traces of certain mental habits which the recent change in his life, a rejuvenation illustrated by his passion for music, had inclined him temporarily to discard, so that at times he would actually state his views with considerable warmth\u2014\"but I am quite sincere when I say that she is intelligent, while her husband is positively a bookworm. They are charming people.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His explanation was terribly effective; Mme. Verdurin now realised that this one state of unbelief would prevent her 'little nucleus' from ever attaining to complete unanimity, and was unable to restrain herself, in her fury at the obstinacy of this wretch who could not see what anguish his words were causing her, but cried aloud, from the depths of her tortured heart, \"You may think so if you wish, but at least you need not say so to us.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It all depends upon what you call intelligence.\" Forcheville felt that it was his turn to be brilliant. \"Come now, Swann, tell us what you mean by intelligence.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There,\" cried Odette, \"that's one of the big things I beg him to tell me about, and he never will.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but...\" protested Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but nonsense!\" said Odette\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A water-butt?\" asked the Doctor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To you,\" pursued Forcheville, \"does intelligence mean what they call clever talk; you know, the sort of people who worm their way into society?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Finish your sweet, so that they can take your plate away!\" said Mme. Verdurin sourly to Saniette, who was lost in thought and had stopped eating. And then, perhaps a little ashamed of her rudeness, \"It doesn't matter; take your time about it; there's no hurry; I only reminded you because of the others, you know; it keeps the servants back.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There is,\" began Brichot, with a resonant smack upon every syllable, \"a rather curious definition of intelligence by that pleasing old anarchist F\u00e9nelon...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just listen to this!\" Mme. Verdurin rallied Forcheville and the Doctor. \"He's going to give us F\u00e9nelon's definition of intelligence. That's interesting. It's not often you get a chance of hearing that!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Brichot was keeping F\u00e9nelon's definition until Swann should have given his own. Swann remained silent, and, by this fresh act of recreancy, spoiled the brilliant tournament of dialectic which Mme. Verdurin was rejoicing at being able to offer to Forcheville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You see, it's just the same as with me!\" Odette was peevish. \"I'm not at all sorry to see that I'm not the only one he doesn't find quite up to his level.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"These de La Tr\u00e9mouailles whom Mme. Verdurin has exhibited to us as so little to be desired,\" inquired Brichot, articulating vigorously, \"are they, by any chance, descended from the couple whom that worthy old snob, S\u00e9vign\u00e9, said she was delighted to know, because it was so good for her peasants? True, the Marquise had another reason, which in her case probably came first, for she was a thorough journalist at heart, and always on the look-out for 'copy.' And, in the journal which she used to send regularly to her daughter, it was Mme. de La Tr\u00e9mouaille, kept well-informed through all her grand connections, who supplied the foreign politics.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh dear, no. I'm quite sure they aren't the same family,\" said Mme. Verdurin desperately\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saniette who, ever since he had surrendered his untouched plate to the butler, had been plunged once more in silent meditation, emerged finally to tell them, with a nervous laugh, a story of how he had once dined with the Duc de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, the point of which was that the Duke did not know that George Sand was the pseudonym of a woman. Swann, who really liked Saniette, felt bound to supply him with a few facts illustrative of the Duke's culture, which would prove that such ignorance on his part was literally impossible; but suddenly he stopped short; he had realised, as he was speaking, that Saniette needed no proof, but knew already that the story was untrue for the simple reason that he had at that moment invented it. The worthy man suffered acutely from the Verdurins' always finding him so dull; and as he was conscious of having been more than ordinarily morose this evening, he had made up his mind that he would succeed in being amusing, at least once, before the end of dinner. He surrendered so quickly, looked so wretched at the sight of his castle in ruins, and replied in so craven a tone to Swann, appealing to him not to persist in a refutation which was already superfluous, \"All right; all right; anyhow, even if I have made a mistake that's not a crime, I hope,\" that Swann longed to be able to console him by insisting that the story was indubitably true and exquisitely funny. The Doctor, who had been listening, had an idea that it was the right moment to interject \"Se non \u00e8 vero,\" but he was not quite certain of the words, and was afraid of being caught out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After dinner, Forcheville went up to the Doctor. \"She can't have been at all bad looking, Mme. Verdurin; anyhow, she's a woman you can really talk to; that's all I want. Of course she's getting a bit broad in the beam. But Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy! There's a little woman who knows what's what, all right. Upon my word and soul, you can see at a glance she's got the American eye, that girl has. We are speaking of Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy,\" he explained, as M. Verdurin joined them, his pipe in his mouth. \"I should say that, as a specimen of the female form\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'd rather have it in my bed than a clap of thunder!\" the words came tumbling from Cottard, who had for some time been waiting in vain until Forcheville should pause for breath, so that he might get in his hoary old joke, a chance for which might not, he feared, come again, if the conversation should take a different turn; and he produced it now with that excessive spontaneity and confidence which may often be noticed attempting to cover up the coldness, and the slight flutter of emotion, inseparable from a prepared recitation. Forcheville knew and saw the joke, and was thoroughly amused. As for M. Verdurin, he was unsparing of his merriment, having recently discovered a way of expressing it by a symbol, different from his wife's, but equally simple and obvious. Scarcely had he begun the movement of head and shoulders of a man who was 'shaking with laughter' than he would begin also to cough, as though, in laughing too violently, he had swallowed a mouthful of smoke from his pipe. And by keeping the pipe firmly in his mouth he could prolong indefinitely the dumb-show of suffocation and hilarity. So he and Mme. Verdurin (who, at the other side of the room, where the painter was telling her a story, was shutting her eyes preparatory to flinging her face into her hands) resembled two masks in a theatre, each representing Comedy, but in a different way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin had been wiser than he knew in not taking his pipe out of his mouth, for Cottard, having occasion to leave the room for a moment, murmured a witty euphemism which he had recently acquired and repeated now whenever he had to go to the place in question: \"I must just go and see the Duc d'Aumale for a minute,\" so drolly, that M. Verdurin's cough began all over again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, then, take your pipe out of your mouth; can't you see, you'll choke if you try to bottle up your laughter like that,\" counselled Mme. Verdurin, as she came round with a tray of liqueurs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What a delightful man your husband is; he has the wit of a dozen!\" declared Forcheville to Mme. Cottard. \"Thank you, thank you, an old soldier like me can never say 'No' to a drink.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"M. de Forcheville thinks Odette charming,\" M. Verdurin told his wife\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, do you know, she wants so much to meet you again some day at luncheon. We must arrange it, but don't on any account let Swann hear about it. He spoils everything, don't you know. I don't mean to say that you're not to come to dinner too, of course; we hope to see you very often. Now that the warm weather's coming, we're going to have dinner out of doors whenever we can. That won't bore you, will it, a quiet little dinner, now and then, in the Bois? Splendid, splendid, that will be quite delightful....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aren't you going to do any work this evening, I say?\" she screamed suddenly to the little pianist, seeing an opportunity for displaying, before a 'newcomer' of Forcheville's importance, at once her unfailing wit and her despotic power over the 'faithful.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"M. de Forcheville was just going to say something dreadful about you,\" Mme. Cottard warned her husband as he reappeared in the room. And he, still following up the idea of Forcheville's noble birth, which had obsessed him all through dinner, began again with: \"I am treating a Baroness just now, Baroness Putbus; weren't there some Putbuses in the Crusades? Anyhow they've got a lake in Pomerania that's ten times the size of the Place de la Concorde. I am treating her for dry arthritis; she's a charming woman. Mme. Verdurin knows her too, I believe.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which enabled Forcheville, a moment later, finding himself alone with Mme. Cottard, to complete his favourable verdict on her husband with: \"He's an interesting man, too; you can see that he knows some good people. Gad! but they get to know a lot of things, those doctors.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"D'you want me to play the phrase from the sonata for M. Swann?\" asked the pianist\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What the devil's that? Not the sonata-snake, I hope!\" shouted M. de Forcheville, hoping to create an effect. But Dr. Cottard, who had never heard this pun, missed the point of it, and imagined that M. de Forcheville had made a mistake. He dashed in boldly to correct it: \"No, no. The word isn't serpent-\u00e0-sonates, it's serpent-\u00e0-sonnettes!\" he explained in a tone at once zealous, impatient, and triumphant\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forcheville explained the joke to him. The Doctor blushed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You'll admit it's not bad, eh, Doctor?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! I've known it for ages.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then they were silenced; heralded by the waving tremolo of the violin-part, which formed a bristling bodyguard of sound two octaves above it\u2014and as in a mountainous country, against the seeming immobility of a vertically falling torrent, one may distinguish, two hundred feet below, the tiny form of a woman walking in the valley\u2014the little phrase had just appeared, distant but graceful, protected by the long, gradual unfurling of its transparent, incessant and sonorous curtain. And Swann, in his heart of hearts, turned to it, spoke to it as to a confidant in the secret of his love, as to a friend of Odette who would assure him that he need pay no attention to this Forcheville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah! you've come too late!\" Mme. Verdurin greeted one of the 'faithful,' whose invitation had been only 'to look in after dinner,' \"we've been having a simply incomparable Brichot! You never heard such eloquence! But he's gone. Isn't that so, M. Swann? I believe it's the first time you've met him,\" she went on, to emphasize the fact that it was to her that Swann owed the introduction. \"Isn't that so; wasn't he delicious, our Brichot?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann bowed politely\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No? You weren't interested?\" she asked dryly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but I assure you, I was quite enthralled. He is perhaps a little too peremptory, a little too jovial for my taste. I should like to see him a little less confident at times, a little more tolerant, but one feels that he knows a great deal, and on the whole he seems a very sound fellow.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The party broke up very late. Cottard's first words to his wife were: \"I have rarely seen Mme. Verdurin in such form as she was to-night.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What exactly is your Mme. Verdurin? A bit of a bad hat, eh?\" said Forcheville to the painter, to whom he had offered a 'lift.' Odette watched his departure with regret; she dared not refuse to let Swann take her home, but she was moody and irritable in the carriage, and, when he asked whether he might come in, replied, \"I suppose so,\" with an impatient shrug of her shoulders. When they had all gone, Mme. Verdurin said to her husband: \"Did you notice the way Swann laughed, such an idiotic laugh, when we spoke about Mme. La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had remarked, more than once, how Swann and Forcheville suppressed the particle 'de' before that lady's name. Never doubting that it was done on purpose, to shew that they were not afraid of a title, she had made up her mind to imitate their arrogance, but had not quite grasped what grammatical form it ought to take. Moreover, the natural corruptness of her speech overcoming her implacable republicanism, she still said instinctively \"the de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles,\" or, rather (by an abbreviation sanctified by the usage of music-hall singers and the writers of the 'captions' beneath caricatures, who elide the 'de'), \"the d'La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles,\" but she corrected herself at once to \"Madame La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle.\u2014The Duchess, as Swann calls her,\" she added ironically, with a smile which proved that she was merely quoting, and would not, herself, accept the least responsibility for a classification so puerile and absurd\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don't mind saying that I thought him extremely stupid.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin took it up. \"He's not sincere. He's a crafty customer, always hovering between one side and the other. He's always trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. What a difference between him and Forcheville. There, at least, you have a man who tells you straight out what he thinks. Either you agree with him or you don't. Not like the other fellow, who's never definitely fish or fowl. Did you notice, by the way, that Odette seemed all out for Forcheville, and I don't blame her, either. And then, after all, if Swann tries to come the man of fashion over us, the champion of distressed Duchesses, at any rate the other man has got a title; he's always Comte de Forcheville!\" he let the words slip delicately from his lips, as though, familiar with every page of the history of that dignity, he were making a scrupulously exact estimate of its value, in relation to others of the sort\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't mind saying,\" Mme. Verdurin went on, \"that he saw fit to utter some most venomous, and quite absurd insinuations against Brichot. Naturally, once he saw that Brichot was popular in this house, it was a way of hitting back at us, of spoiling our party. I know his sort, the dear, good friend of the family, who pulls you all to pieces on the stairs as he's going away.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Didn't I say so?\" retorted her husband. \"He's simply a failure; a poor little wretch who goes through life mad with jealousy of anything that's at all big.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had the truth been known, there was not one of the 'faithful' who was not infinitely more malicious than Swann; but the others would all take the precaution of tempering their malice with obvious pleasantries, with little sparks of emotion and cordiality; while the least indication of reserve on Swann's part, undraped in any such conventional formula as \"Of course, I don't want to say anything\u2014\" to which he would have scorned to descend, appeared to them a deliberate act of treachery. There are certain original and distinguished authors in whom the least 'freedom of speech' is thought revolting because they have not begun by flattering the public taste, and serving up to it the commonplace expressions to which it is used; it was by the same process that Swann infuriated M. Verdurin. In his case as in theirs it was the novelty of his language which led his audience to suspect the blackness of his designs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was still unconscious of the disgrace that threatened him at the Verdurins', and continued to regard all their absurdities in the most rosy light, through the admiring eyes of love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a rule he made no appointments with Odette except for the evenings; he was afraid of her growing tired of him if he visited her during the day as well; at the same time he was reluctant to forfeit, even for an hour, the place that he held in her thoughts, and so was constantly looking out for an opportunity of claiming her attention, in any way that would not be displeasing to her. If, in a florist's or a jeweller's window, a plant or an ornament caught his eye, he would at once think of sending them to Odette, imagining that the pleasure which the casual sight of them had given him would instinctively be felt, also, by her, and would increase her affection for himself; and he would order them to be taken at once to the Rue La p\u00e9rouse, so as to accelerate the moment in which, as she received an offering from him, he might feel himself, in a sense, transported into her presence. He was particularly anxious, always, that she should receive these presents before she went out for the evening, so that her sense of gratitude towards him might give additional tenderness to her welcome when he arrived at the Verdurins', might even\u2014for all he knew\u2014if the shopkeeper made haste, bring him a letter from her before dinner, or herself, in person, upon his doorstep, come on a little extraordinary visit of thanks. As in an earlier phase, when he had experimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt upon her character, he sought now by that of gratification to elicit from her fresh particles of her intimate feelings, which she had never yet revealed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often she was embarrassed by lack of money, and under pressure from a creditor would come to him for assistance. He enjoyed this, as he enjoyed everything which could impress Odette with his love for herself, or merely with his influence, with the extent of the use that she might make of him. Probably if anyone had said to him, at the beginning, \"It's your position that attracts her,\" or at this stage, \"It's your money that she's really in love with,\" he would not have believed the suggestion, nor would he have been greatly distressed by the thought that people supposed her to be attached to him, that people felt them, to be united by any ties so binding as those of snobbishness or wealth. But even if he had accepted the possibility, it might not have caused him any suffering to discover that Odette's love for him was based on a foundation more lasting than mere affection, or any attractive qualities which she might have found in him; on a sound, commercial interest; an interest which would postpone for ever the fatal day on which she might be tempted to bring their relations to an end. For the moment, while he lavished presents upon her, and performed all manner of services, he could rely on advantages not contained in his person, or in his intellect, could forego the endless, killing effort to make himself attractive. And this delight in being a lover, in living by love alone, of the reality of which he was inclined to be doubtful, the price which, in the long run, he must pay for it, as a dilettante in immaterial sensations, enhanced its value in his eyes\u2014as one sees people who are doubtful whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are really enjoyable, become convinced that they are, as also of the rare quality and absolute detachment of their own taste, when they have agreed to pay several pounds a day for a room in an hotel, from which that sight and that sound may be enjoyed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day, when reflections of this order had brought him once again to the memory of the time when some one had spoken to him of Odette as of a 'kept' woman, and when, once again, he had amused himself with contrasting that strange personification, the 'kept' woman\u2014an iridescent mixture of unknown and demoniacal qualities, embroidered, as in some fantasy of Gustave Moreau, with poison-dripping flowers, interwoven with precious jewels\u2014with that Odette upon whose face he had watched the passage of the same expressions of pity for a sufferer, resentment of an act of injustice, gratitude for an act of kindness, which he had seen, in earlier days, on his own mother's face, and on the faces of friends; that Odette, whose conversation had so frequently turned on the things that he himself knew better than anyone, his collections, his room, his old servant, his banker, who kept all his title-deeds and bonds;\u2014the thought of the banker reminded him that he must call on him shortly, to draw some money. And indeed, if, during the current month, he were to come less liberally to the aid of Odette in her financial difficulties than in the month before, when he had given her five thousand francs, if he refrained from offering her a diamond necklace for which she longed, he would be allowing her admiration for his generosity to decline, that gratitude which had made him so happy, and would even be running the risk of her imagining that his love for her (as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer) had itself diminished. And then, suddenly, he asked himself whether that was not precisely what was implied by 'keeping' a woman (as if, in fact, that idea of 'keeping' could be derived from elements not at all mysterious nor perverse, but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life, such as that thousand-franc note, a familiar and domestic object, torn in places and mended with gummed paper, which his valet, after paying the household accounts and the rent, had locked up hi a drawer in the old writing-desk whence he had extracted it to send it, with four others, to Odette) and whether it was not possible to apply to Odette, since he had known her (for he never imagined for a moment that she could ever have taken a penny from anyone else, before), that title, which he had believed so wholly inapplicable to her, of 'kept' woman. He could not explore the idea further, for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was, with him, congenital, intermittent and providential, happened, at that moment, to extinguish every particle of light in his brain, as instantaneously as, at a later period, when electric lighting had been everywhere installed, it became possible, merely by fingering a switch, to cut off all the supply of light from a house. His mind fumbled, for a moment, in the darkness, he took off his spectacles, wiped the glasses, passed his hands over his eyes, but saw no light until he found himself face to face with a wholly different idea, the realisation that he must endeavour, in the coming month, to send Odette six or seven thousand-franc notes instead of five, simply as a surprise for her and to give her pleasure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the evening, when he did not stay at home until it was time to meet Odette at the Verdurins', or rather at one of the open-air restaurants which they liked to frequent in the Bois and especially at Saint-Cloud, he would go to dine in one of those fashionable houses in which, at one time, he had been a constant guest. He did not wish to lose touch with people who, for all that he knew, might be of use, some day, to Odette, and thanks to whom he was often, in the meantime, able to procure for her some privilege or pleasure. Besides, he had been used for so long to the refinement and comfort of good society that, side by side with his contempt, there had grown up also a desperate need for it, with the result that, when he had reached the point after which the humblest lodgings appeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely mansions, his senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he could not enter the former without a feeling of acute discomfort. He had the same regard\u2014to a degree of identity which they would never have suspected\u2014for the little families with small incomes who asked him to dances in their flats (\"straight upstairs to the fifth floor, and the door on the left\") as for the Princesse de Parme, who gave the most splendid parties in Paris; but he had not the feeling of being actually 'at the ball' when he found himself herded with the fathers of families in the bedroom of the lady of the house, while the spectacle of wash-hand-stands covered over with towels, and of beds converted into cloak-rooms, with a mass of hats and great-coats sprawling over their counterpanes, gave him the same stifling sensation that, nowadays, people who have been used for half a lifetime to electric light derive from a smoking lamp or a candle that needs to be snuffed. If he were dining out, he would order his carriage for half-past seven; while he changed his clothes, he would be wondering, all the time, about Odette, and in this way was never alone, for the constant thought of Odette gave to the moments in which he was separated from her the same peculiar charm as to those in which she was at his side. He would get into his carriage and drive off, but he knew that this thought had jumped in after him and had settled down upon his knee, like a pet animal which he might take everywhere, and would keep with him at the dinner-table, unobserved by his fellow-guests. He would stroke and fondle it, warm himself with it, and, as a feeling of languor swept over him, would give way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat and nostrils\u2014a new experience, this,\u2014as he fastened the bunch of columbines in his buttonhole. He had for some time been feeling neither well nor happy, especially since Odette had brought Forcheville to the Verdurins', and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in the country. But he could never summon up courage to leave Paris, even for a day, while Odette was there. The weather was warm; it was the finest part of the spring. And for all that he was driving through a city of stone to immure himself in a house without grass or garden, what was incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned, near Combray, where, at four in the afternoon, before coming to the asparagus-bed, thanks to the breeze that was wafted across the fields from M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, he could enjoy the fragrant coolness of the air as well beneath an arbour of hornbeams in the garden as by the bank of the pond, fringed with forget-me-not and iris; and where, when he sat down to dinner, trained and twined by the gardener's skilful hand, there ran all about his table currant-bush and rose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After dinner, if he had an early appointment in the Bois or at Saint-Cloud, he would rise from table and leave the house so abruptly\u2014especially if it threatened to rain, and so to scatter the 'faithful' before their normal time\u2014that on one occasion the Princesse des Laumes (at whose house dinner had been so late that Swann had left before the coffee came in, to join the Verdurins on the Island in the Bois) observed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Really, if Swann were thirty years older, and had diabetes, there might be some excuse for his running away like that. He seems to look upon us all as a joke.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He persuaded himself that the spring-time charm, which he could not go down to Combray to enjoy, he would find at least on the He des Cygnes or at Saint-Cloud. But as he could think only of Odette, he would return home not knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young leaves, or if the moon had been shining. He would be welcomed by the little phrase from the sonata, played in the garden on the restaurant piano. If there was none in the garden, the Verdurins would have taken immense pains to have a piano brought out either from a private room or from the restaurant itself; not because Swann was now restored to favour; far from it. But the idea of arranging an ingenious form of entertainment for some one, even for some one whom they disliked, would stimulate them, during the time spent in its preparation, to a momentary sense of cordiality and affection. Now and then he would remind himself that another fine spring evening was drawing to a close, and would force himself to notice the trees and the sky. But the state of excitement into which Odette's presence never failed to throw him, added to a feverish ailment which, for some time now, had scarcely left him, robbed him of that sense of quiet and comfort which is an indispensable background to the impressions that we derive from nature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One evening, when Swann had consented to dine with the Verdurins, and had mentioned during dinner that he had to attend, next day, the annual banquet of an old comrades' association, Odette had at once exclaimed across the table, in front of everyone, in front of Forcheville, who was now one of the 'faithful,' in front of the painter, in front of Cottard:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I know, you have your banquet to-morrow; I sha'n't see you, then, till I get home; don't be too late.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And although Swann had never yet taken offence, at all seriously, at Odette's demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the 'faithful,' he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow, before them all, with that calm immodesty, the fact that they saw each other regularly every evening, his privileged position in her house, and her own preference for him which it implied. It was true that Swann had often reflected that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman; and in the supremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to himself there was nothing that especially flattered him when he heard it proclaimed to all the 'faithful'; but since he had observed that, to several other men than himself, Odette seemed a fascinating and desirable woman, the attraction which her body held for him had aroused a painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest particles of her heart. And he had begun to attach an incalculable value to those moments passed in her house in the evenings, when he held her upon his knee, made her tell him what she thought about this or that, and counted over that treasure to which, alone of all his earthly possessions, he still clung. And so, after this dinner, drawing her aside, he took care to thank her effusively, seeking to indicate to her by the extent of his gratitude the corresponding intensity of the pleasures which it was in her power to bestow on him, the supreme pleasure being to guarantee him immunity, for as long as his love should last and he remain vulnerable, from the assaults of jealousy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he came away from his banquet, the next evening, it was pouring rain, and he had nothing but his victoria. A friend offered to take him home in a closed carriage, and as Odette, by the fact of her having invited him to come, had given him an assurance that she was expecting no one else, he could, with a quiet mind and an untroubled heart, rather than set off thus in the rain, have gone home and to bed. But perhaps, if she saw that he seemed not to adhere to his resolution to end every evening, without exception, in her company, she might grow careless, and fail to keep free for him just the one evening on which he particularly desired it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was after eleven when he reached her door, and as he made his apology for having been unable to come away earlier, she complained that it was indeed very late; the storm had made her unwell, her head ached, and she warned him that she would not let him stay longer than half an hour, that at midnight she would send him away; a little while later she felt tired and wished to sleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No cattleya, then, to-night?\" he asked, \"and I've been looking forward so to a nice little cattleya.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she was irresponsive; saying nervously: \"No, dear, no cattleya tonight. Can't you see, I'm not well?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It might have done you good, but I won't bother you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She begged him to put out the light before he went; he drew the curtains close round her bed and left her. But, when he was in his own house again, the idea suddenly struck him that, perhaps, Odette was expecting some one else that evening, that she had merely pretended to be tired, that she had asked him to put the light out only so that he should suppose that she was going to sleep, that the moment he had left the house she had lighted it again, and had reopened her door to the stranger who was to be her guest for the night. He looked at his watch. It was about an hour and a half since he had left her; he went out, took a cab, and stopped it close to her house, in a little street running at right angles to that other street, which lay at the back of her house, and along which he used to go, sometimes, to tap upon her bedroom window, for her to let him in. He left his cab; the streets were all deserted and dark; he walked a few yards and came out almost opposite her house. Amid the glimmering blackness of all the row of windows, the lights in which had long since been put out, he saw one, and only one, from which overflowed, between the slats of its shutters, dosed like a wine-press over its mysterious golden juice, the light that filled the room within, a light which on so many evenings, as soon as he saw it, far off, as he turned into the street, had rejoiced his heart with its message: \"She is there\u2014expecting you,\" and now tortured him with: \"She is there with the man she was expecting.\" He must know who; he tiptoed along by the wall until he reached the window, but between the slanting bars of the shutters he could see nothing; he could hear, only, in the silence of the night, the murmur of conversation. What agony he suffered as he watched that light, in whose golden atmosphere were moving, behind the closed sash, the unseen and detested pair, as he listened to that murmur which revealed the presence of the man who had crept in after his own departure, the perfidy of Odette, and the pleasures which she was at that moment tasting with the stranger\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet he was not sorry that he had come; the torment which had forced him to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its uncertainty, now that Odette's other life, of which he had had, at that first moment, a sudden helpless suspicion, was definitely there, almost within his grasp, before his eyes, in the full glare of the lamp-light, caught and kept there, an unwitting prisoner, in that room into which, when he would, he might force his way to surprise and seize it; or rather he would tap upon the shutters, as he had often done when he had come there very late, and by that signal Odette would at least learn that he knew, that he had seen the light and had heard the voices; while he himself, who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him, as sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been tricked, now it was he that saw them, confident and persistent in their error, tricked and trapped by none other than himself, whom they believed to be a mile away, but who was there, in person, there with a plan, there with the knowledge that he was going, in another minute, to tap upon the shutter. And, perhaps, what he felt (almost an agreeable feeling) at that moment was something more than relief at the solution of a doubt, at the soothing of a pain; was an intellectual pleasure. If, since he had fallen in love, things had recovered a little of the delicate attraction that they had had for him long ago\u2014though only when a light was shed upon them by a thought, a memory of Odette\u2014now it was another of the faculties, prominent in the studious days of his youth, that Odette had quickened with new life, the passion for truth, but for a truth which, too, was interposed between himself and his mistress, receiving its light from her alone, a private and personal truth the sole object of which (an infinitely precious object, and one almost impersonal in its absolute beauty) was Odette\u2014Odette in her activities, her environment, her projects, and her past. At every other period in his life, the little everyday words and actions of another person had always seemed wholly valueless to Swann; if gossip about such things were repeated to him, he would dismiss it as insignificant, and while he listened it was only the lowest, the most commonplace part of his mind that was interested; at such moments he felt utterly dull and uninspired. But in this strange phase of love the personality of another person becomes so enlarged, so deepened, that the curiosity which he could now feel aroused in himself, to know the least details of a woman's daily occupation, was the same thirst for knowledge with which he had once studied history. And all manner of actions, from which, until now, he would have recoiled in shame, such as spying, to-night, outside a window, to-morrow, for all he knew, putting adroitly provocative questions to casual witnesses, bribing servants, listening at doors, seemed to him, now, to be precisely on a level with the deciphering of manuscripts, the weighing of evidence, the interpretation of old monuments, that was to say, so many different methods of scientific investigation, each one having a definite intellectual value and being legitimately employable in the search for truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As his hand stole out towards the shutters he felt a pang of shame at the thought that Odette would now know that he had suspected her, that he had returned, that he had posted himself outside her window. She had often told him what a horror she had of jealous men, of lovers who spied. What he was going to do would be extremely awkward, and she would detest him for ever after, whereas now, for the moment, for so long as he refrained from knocking, perhaps even in the act of infidelity, she loved him still. How often is not the prospect of future happiness thus sacrificed to one's impatient insistence upon an immediate gratification. But his desire to know the truth was stronger, and seemed to him nobler than his desire for her. He knew that the true story of certain events, which he would have given his life to be able to reconstruct accurately and in full, was to be read within that window, streaked with bars of light, as within the illuminated, golden boards of one of those precious manuscripts, by whose wealth of artistic treasures the scholar who consults them cannot remain unmoved. He yearned for the satisfaction of knowing the truth which so impassioned him in that brief, fleeting, precious transcript, on that translucent page, so warm, so beautiful. And besides, the advantage which he felt\u2014which he so desperately wanted to feel\u2014that he had over them, lay perhaps not so much in knowing as in being able to shew them that he knew. He drew himself up on tiptoe. He knocked. They had not heard; he knocked again; louder; their conversation ceased. A man's voice\u2014he strained his ears to distinguish whose, among such of Odette's friends as he knew, the voice could be\u2014asked:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Who's that?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could not be certain of the voice. He knocked once again. The window first, then the shutters were thrown open. It was too late, now, to retire, and since she must know all, so as not to seem too contemptible, too jealous and inquisitive, he called out in a careless, hearty, welcoming tone:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Please don't bother; I just happened to be passing, and saw the light. I wanted to know if you were feeling better.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looked up. Two old gentlemen stood facing him, in the window, one of them with a lamp in his hand; and beyond them he could see into the room, a room that he had never seen before. Having fallen into the habit, When he came late to Odette, of identifying her window by the fact that it was the only one still lighted in a row of windows otherwise all alike, he had been misled, this time, by the light, and had knocked at the window beyond hers, in the adjoining house. He made what apology he could and hurried home, overjoyed that the satisfaction of his curiosity had preserved their love intact, and that, having feigned for so long, when in Odette's company, a sort of indifference, he had not now, by a demonstration of jealousy, given her that proof of the excess of his own passion which, in a pair of lovers, fully and finally dispenses the recipient from the obligation to love the other enough. He never spoke to her of this misadventure, he ceased even to think of it himself. But now and then his thoughts in their wandering course would come upon this memory where it lay unobserved, would startle it into life, thrust it more deeply down into his consciousness, and leave him aching with a sharp, far-rooted pain. As though this had been a bodily pain, Swann's mind was powerless to alleviate it; in the case of bodily pain, however, since it is independent of the mind, the mind can dwell upon it, can note that it has diminished, that it has momentarily ceased. But with this mental pain, the mind, merely by recalling it, created it afresh. To determine not to think of it was but to think of it still, to suffer from it still. And when, in conversation with his friends, he forgot his sufferings, suddenly a word casually uttered would make him change countenance as a wounded man does when a clumsy hand has touched his aching limb. When he came away from Odette, he was happy, he felt calm, he recalled the smile with which, in gentle mockery, she had spoken to him of this man or of that, a smile which was all tenderness for himself; he recalled the gravity of her head which she seemed to have lifted from its axis to let it droop and fall, as though against her will, upon his lips, as she had done on that first evening in the carriage; her languishing gaze at him while she lay nestling in his arms, her bended head seeming to recede between her shoulders, as though shrinking from the cold\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But then, at once, his jealousy, as it had been the shadow of his love, presented him with the complement, with the converse of that new smile with which she had greeted him that very evening,\u2014with which, now, perversely, she was mocking Swann while she tendered her love to another\u2014of that lowering of her head, but lowered now to fall on other lips, and (but bestowed upon a stranger) of all the marks of affection that she had shewn to him. And all these voluptuous memories which he bore away from her house were, as one might say, but so many sketches, rough plans, like the schemes of decoration which a designer submits to one in outline, enabling Swann to form an idea of the various attitudes, aflame or faint with passion, which she was capable of adopting for others. With the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he tasted in her company, every new caress that he invented (and had been so imprudent as to point out to her how delightful it was), every fresh charm that he found in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his secret torture-chamber\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A fresh turn was given to the screw when Swann recalled a sudden expression which he had intercepted, a few days earlier, and for the first time, in Odette's eyes. It was after dinner at the Verdurins'. Whether it was because Forcheville, aware that Saniette, his brother-in-law, was not in favour with them, had decided to make a butt of him, and to shine at his expense, or because he had been annoyed by some awkward remark which Saniette had made to him, although it had passed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever tactless allusion it might conceal, or possibly because he had been for some time looking out for an opportunity of securing the expulsion from the house of a fellow-guest who knew rather too much about him, and whom he knew to be so nice-minded that he himself could not help feeling embarrassed at times merely by his presence in the room, Forcheville replied to Saniette's tactless utterance with such a volley of abuse, going out of his way to insult him, emboldened, the louder he shouted, by the fear, the pain, the entreaties of his victim, that the poor creature, after asking Mme. Verdurin whether he should stay and receiving no answer, had left the house in stammering confusion and with tears in his eyes. Odette had looked on, impassive, at this scene; but when the door had closed behind Saniette, she had forced the normal expression of her face down, as the saying is, by several pegs, so as to bring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as Forcheville; her eyes had sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his audacity, of ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim; she had darted at him a look of complicity in the crime, which so clearly implied: \"That's finished him off, or I'm very much mistaken. Did you see what a fool he looked? He was actually crying,\" that Forcheville, when his eyes met hers, sobered in a moment from the anger, or pretended anger with which he was still flushed, smiled as he explained: \"He need only have made himself pleasant and he'd have been here still; a good scolding does a man no harm, at any time.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day when Swann had gone out early in the afternoon to pay a call, and had failed to find the person at home whom he wished to see, it occurred to him to go, instead, to Odette, at an hour when, although he never went to her house then as a rule, he knew that she was always at home, resting or writing letters until tea-time, and would enjoy seeing her for a moment, if it did not disturb her. The porter told him that he believed Odette to be in; Swann rang the bell, thought that he heard a sound, that he heard footsteps, but no one came to the door. Anxious and annoyed, he went round to the other little street, at the back of her house, and stood beneath her bedroom window; the curtains were drawn and he could see nothing; he knocked loudly upon the pane, he shouted; still no one came. He could see that the neighbours were staring at him. He turned away, thinking that, after all, he had perhaps been mistaken in believing that he heard footsteps; but he remained so preoccupied with the suspicion that he could turn his mind to nothing else. After waiting for an hour, he returned. He found her at home; she told him that she had been in the house when he rang, but had been asleep; the bell had awakened her; she had guessed that it must be Swann, and had run out to meet him, but he had already gone. She had, of course, heard him knocking at the window. Swann could at once detect in this story one of those fragments of literal truth which liars, when taken by surprise, console themselves by introducing into the composition of the falsehood which they have to invent, thinking that it can be safely incorporated, and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude. It was true that, when Odette had just done something which she did not wish to disclose, she would take pains to conceal it in a secret place in her heart. But as soon as she found herself face to face with the man to whom she was obliged to lie, she became uneasy, all her ideas melted like wax before a flame, her inventive and her reasoning faculties were paralysed, she might ransack her brain but would find only a void; still, she must say something, and there lay within her reach precisely the fact which she had wished to conceal, which, being the truth, was the one thing that had remained. She broke off from it a tiny fragment, of no importance in itself, assuring herself that, after all, it was the best thing to do, since it was a detail of the truth, and less dangerous, therefore, than a falsehood. \"At any rate, this is true,\" she said to herself; \"that's always something to the good; he may make inquiries; he will see that this is true; it won't be this, anyhow, that will give me away.\" But she was wrong; it was what gave her away; she had not taken into account that this fragmentary detail of the truth had sharp edges which could not: be made to fit in, except to those contiguous fragments of the truth from which she had arbitrarily detached it, edges which, whatever the fictitious details in which she might embed it, would continue to shew, by their overlapping angles and by the gaps which she had forgotten to fill, that its proper place was elsewhere\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She admits that she heard me ring, and then knock, that she knew it was myself, that she wanted to see me,\" Swann thought to himself. \"But that doesn't correspond with the fact that she did not let me in.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He did not, however, draw her attention to this inconsistency, for he thought that, if left to herself, Odette might perhaps produce some falsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth; she spoke; he did not interrupt her, he gathered up, with an eager and sorrowful piety, the words that fell from her lips, feeling (and rightly feeling, since she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke) that, like the veil of a sanctuary, they kept a vague imprint, traced a faint outline of that infinitely precious and, alas, undiscoverable truth;\u2014what she had been doing, that afternoon, at three o'clock, when he had called,\u2014a truth of which he would never possess any more than these falsifications, illegible and divine traces, a truth which would exist henceforward only in the secretive memory of this creature, who would contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value, but would never yield it up to him. It was true that he had, now and then, a strong suspicion that Odette's daily activities were not hi themselves passionately interesting, and that such relations as she might have with other men did not exhale, naturally, in a universal sense, or for every rational being, a spirit of morbid gloom capable of infecting with fever or of inciting to suicide. He realised, at such moments, that that interest, that gloom, existed in him only as a malady might exist, and that, once he was cured of the malady, the actions of Odette, the kisses that she might have bestowed, would become once again as innocuous as those of countless other women. But the consciousness that the painful curiosity with which Swann now studied them had its origin only in himself was not enough to make him decide that it was unreasonable to regard that curiosity as important, and to take every possible step to satisfy it. Swann had, in fact, reached an age the philosophy of which\u2014supported, in his case, by the current philosophy of the day, as well as by that of the circle in which he had spent most of his life, the group that surrounded the Princesse des Laumes, in which one's intelligence was understood to increase with the strength of one's disbelief in everything, and nothing real and incontestable was to be discovered, except the individual tastes of each of its members\u2014is no longer that of youth, but a positive, almost a medical philosophy, the philosophy of men who, instead of fixing their aspirations upon external objects, endeavour to separate from the accumulation of the years already spent a definite residue of habits and passions which they can regard as characteristic and permanent, and with which they will deliberately arrange, before anything else, that the kind of existence which they choose to adopt shall not prove inharmonious. Swann deemed it wise to make allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived from not knowing what Odette had done, just as he made allowance for the impetus which a damp climate always gave to his eczema; to anticipate in his budget the expenditure of a considerable sum on procuring, with regard to the daily occupations of Odette, information the lack of which would make him unhappy, just as he reserved a margin for the gratification of other tastes from which he knew that pleasure was to be expected (at least, before he had fallen in love) such as his taste for collecting things, or for good cooking\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he proposed to take leave of Odette, and to return home, she begged him to stay a little longer, and even detained him forcibly, seizing him by the arm as he was opening the door to go. But he gave no thought to that, for, among the crowd of gestures and speeches and other little incidents which go to make up a conversation, it is inevitable that we should pass (without noticing anything that arouses our interest) by those that hide a truth for which our suspicions are blindly searching, whereas we stop to examine others beneath which nothing lies concealed. She kept on saying: \"What a dreadful pity; you never by any chance come in the afternoon, and the one time you do come then I miss you.\" He knew very well that she was not sufficiently in love with him to be so keenly distressed merely at having missed his visit, but as she was a good-natured woman, anxious to give him pleasure, and often sorry when she had done anything that annoyed him, he found it quite natural that she should be sorry, on this occasion, that she had deprived him of that pleasure of spending an hour in her company, which was so very great a pleasure, if not to herself, at any rate to him. All the same, it was a matter of so little importance that her air of unrelieved sorrow began at length to bewilder him. She reminded him, even more than was usual, of the faces of some of the women created by the painter of the Primavera.' She had, at that moment, their downcast, heartbroken expression, which seems ready to succumb beneath the burden of a grief too heavy to be borne, when they are merely allowing the Infant Jesus to play with a pomegranate, or watching Moses pour water into a trough. He had seen the same sorrow once before on her face, but when, he could no longer say. Then, suddenly, he remembered it; it was when Odette had lied, in apologising to Mme. Verdurin on the evening after the dinner from which she had stayed away on a pretext of illness, but really so that she might be alone with Swann. Surely, even had she been the most scrupulous of women, she could hardly have felt remorse for so innocent a lie. But the lies which Odette ordinarily told were less innocent, and served to prevent discoveries which might have involved her in the most terrible difficulties with one or another of her friends. And so, when she lied, smitten with fear, feeling herself to be but feebly armed for her defence, unconfident of success, she was inclined to weep from sheer exhaustion, as children weep sometimes when they have not slept. She knew, also, that her lie, as a rule, was doing a serious injury to the man to whom she was telling it, and that she might find herself at his mercy if she told it badly. Therefore she felt at once humble and culpable in his presence. And when she had to tell an insignificant, social lie its hazardous associations, and the memories which it recalled, would leave her weak with a sense of exhaustion and penitent with a consciousness of wrongdoing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What depressing lie was she now concocting for Swann's benefit, to give her that pained expression, that plaintive voice, which seemed to falter beneath the effort that she was forcing herself to make, and to plead for pardon? He had an idea that it was not merely the truth about what had occurred that afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him, but something more immediate, something, possibly, which had not yet happened, but might happen now at any time, and, when it did, would throw a light upon that earlier event. At that moment, he heard the front-door bell ring. Odette never stopped speaking, but her words dwindled into an inarticulate moan. Her regret at not having seen Swann that afternoon, at not having opened the door to him, had melted into a universal despair\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could hear the gate being closed, and the sound of a carriage, as though some one were going away\u2014probably the person whom Swann must on no account meet\u2014after being told that Odette was not at home. And then, when he reflected that, merely by coming at an hour when he was not in the habit of coming, he had managed to disturb so many arrangements of which she did not wish him to know, he had a feeling of discouragement that amounted, almost, to distress. But since he was in love with Odette, since he was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards her, the pity with which he might have been inspired for himself he felt for her only, and murmured: \"Poor darling!\" When finally he left her, she took up several letters which were lying on the table, and asked him if he would be so good as to post them for her. He walked along to the post-office, took the letters from his pocket, and, before dropping each of them into the box, scanned its address. They were all to tradesmen, except the last, which was to Forcheville. He kept it in his hand. \"If I saw what was in this,\" he argued, \"I should know what she calls him, what she says to him, whether there really is anything between them. Perhaps, if I don't look inside, I shall be lacking in delicacy towards Odette, since in this way alone I can rid myself of a suspicion which is, perhaps, a calumny on her, which must, in any case, cause her suffering, and which can never possibly be set at rest, once the letter is posted.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He left the post-office and went home, but he had kept the last letter in his pocket. He lighted a candle, and held up close to its flame the envelope which he had not dared to open. At first he could distinguish nothing, but the envelope was thin, and by pressing it down on to the stiff card which it enclosed he was able, through the transparent paper, to read the concluding words. They were a coldly formal signature. If, instead of its being himself who was looking at a letter addressed to Forcheville, it had been Forcheville who had read a letter addressed to Swann, he might have found words in it of another, a far more tender kind! He took a firm hold of the card, which was sliding to and fro, the envelope being too large for it and then, by moving it with his finger and thumb, brought one line after another beneath the part of the envelope where the paper was not doubled, through which alone it was possible to read\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In spite of all these manoeuvres he could not make it out clearly. Not that it mattered, for he had seen enough to assure himself that the letter was about some trifling incident of no importance, and had nothing at all to do with love; it was something to do with Odette's uncle. Swann had read quite plainly at the beginning of the line \"I was right,\" but did not understand what Odette had been right in doing, until suddenly a word which he had not been able, at first, to decipher, came to light and made the whole sentence intelligible: \"I was right to open the door; it was my uncle.\" To open the door! Then Forcheville had been there when Swann rang the bell, and she had sent him away; hence the sound that Swann had heard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After that he read the whole letter; at the end she apologised for having treated Forcheville with so little ceremony, and reminded him that he had left his cigarette-case at her house, precisely what she had written to Swann after one of his first visits. But to Swann she had added: \"Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back.\" To Forcheville nothing of that sort; no allusion that could suggest any intrigue between them. And, really, he was obliged to admit that in all this business Forcheville had been worse treated than himself, since Odette was writing to him to make him believe that her visitor had been an uncle. From which it followed that he, Swann, was the man to whom she attached importance, and for whose sake she had sent the other away. And yet, if there had been nothing between Odette and Forcheville, why not have opened the door at once, why have said, \"I was right to open the door; it was my uncle.\" Right? if she was doing nothing wrong at that moment how could Forcheville possibly have accounted for her not opening the door? For a time Swann stood still there, heartbroken, bewildered, and yet happy; gazing at this envelope which Odette had handed to him without a scruple, so absolute was her trust in his honour; through its transparent window there had been disclosed to him, with the secret history of an incident which he had despaired of ever being able to learn, a fragment of the life of Odette, seen as through a narrow, luminous incision, cut into its surface without her knowledge. Then his jealousy rejoiced at the discovery, as though that jealousy had had an independent existence, fiercely egotistical, gluttonous of every thing that would feed its vitality, even at the expense of Swann himself. Now it had food in store, and Swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening, over the visits that Odette had received about five o'clock, and could seek to discover where Forcheville had been at that hour. For Swann's affection for Odette still preserved the form which had been imposed on it, from the beginning, by his ignorance of the occupations in which she passed her days, as well as by the mental lethargy which prevented him from supplementing that ignorance by imagination. He was not jealous, at first, of the whole of Odette's life, but of those moments only in which an incident, which he had perhaps misinterpreted, had led him to suppose that Odette might have played him false. His jealousy, like an octopus which throws out a first, then a second, and finally a third tentacle, fastened itself irremovably first to that moment, five o'clock in the afternoon, then to another, then to another again. But Swann was incapable of inventing his sufferings. They were only the memory, the perpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from without\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From without, however, everything brought him fresh suffering. He decided to separate Odette from Forcheville, by taking her away for a few days to the south. But he imagined that she was coveted by every male person in the hotel, and that she coveted them in return. And so he, who, in old days, when he travelled, used always to seek out new people and crowded places, might now be seen fleeing savagely from human society as if it had cruelly injured him. And how could he not have turned misanthrope, when in every man he saw a potential lover for Odette? Thus his jealousy did even more than the happy, passionate desire which he had originally felt for Odette had done to alter Swann's character, completely changing, in the eyes of the world, even the outward signs by which that character had been intelligible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read Odette's letter to Forcheville, Swann went to a dinner which the Verdurins were giving in the Bois. As the party was breaking up he noticed a series of whispered discussions between Mme. Verdurin and several of her guests, and thought that he heard the pianist being reminded to come next day to a party at Chatou; now he, Swann, had not been invited to any party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verdurins had spoken only in whispers, and in vague terms, but the painter, perhaps without thinking, shouted out: \"There must be no lights of any sort, and he must play the Moonlight Sonata in the dark, for us to see by.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin, seeing that Swann was within earshot, assumed that expression in which the two-fold desire to make the speaker be quiet and to preserve, oneself, an appearance of guilelessness in the eyes of the listener, is neutralised in an intense vacuity; in which the unflinching signs of intelligent complicity are overlaid by the smiles of innocence, an expression invariably adopted by anyone who has noticed a blunder, the enormity of which is thereby at once revealed if not to those who have made it, at any rate to him in whose hearing it ought not to have been made. Odette seemed suddenly to be in despair, as though she had decided not to struggle any longer against the crushing difficulties of life, and Swann was anxiously counting the minutes that still separated him from the point at which, after leaving the restaurant, while he drove her home, he would be able to ask for an explanation, to make her promise, either that she would not go to Chatou next day, or that she would procure an invitation for him also, and to lull to rest in her arms the anguish that still tormented him. At last the carriages were ordered. Mme. Verdurin said to Swann:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Good-bye, then. We shall see you soon, I hope,\" trying, by the friendliness of her manner and the constraint of her smile, to prevent him from noticing that she Was not saying, as she would always have until then:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To-morrow, then, at Chatou, and at my house the day after.\" M. and Mme. Verdurin made Forcheville get into their carriage; Swann's was drawn up behind it, and he waited for theirs to start before helping Odette into his own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Odette, we'll take you,\" said Mme. Verdurin, \"we've kept a little corner specially for you, beside M. de Forcheville.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, Mme. Verdurin,\" said Odette meekly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What! I thought I was to take you home,\" cried Swann, flinging discretion to the winds, for the carriage-door hung open, time was precious, and he could not, in his present state, go home without her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But Mme. Verdurin has asked me...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That's all right, you can quite well go home alone; we've left you like this dozens of times,\" said Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I had something important to tell Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Very well, you can write it to her instead.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Good-bye,\" said Odette, holding out her hand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He tried hard to smile, but could only succeed in looking utterly dejected\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What do you think of the airs that Swann is pleased to put on with us?\" Mme. Verdurin asked her husband when they had reached home. \"I was afraid he was going to eat me, simply because we offered to take Odette back. It really is too bad, that sort of thing. Why doesn't he say, straight out, that we keep a disorderly house? I can't conceive how Odette can stand such manners. He positively seems to be saying, all the time, 'You belong to me!' I shall tell Odette exactly what I think about it all, and I hope she will have the sense to understand me.\" A moment later she added, inarticulate with rage: \"No, but, don't you see, the filthy creature...\" using unconsciously, and perhaps in satisfaction of the same obscure need to justify herself\u2014like Fran\u00e7oise at Combray when the chicken refused to die\u2014the very words which the last convulsions of an inoffensive animal in its death agony wring from the peasant who is engaged in taking its life. And when Mme. Verdurin's carriage had moved on, and Swann's took its place, his coachman, catching sight of his face, asked whether he was unwell, or had heard bad news\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann sent him away; he preferred to walk, and it was on foot, through the Bois, that he came home. He talked to himself, aloud, and in the same slightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt when describing the charms of the 'little nucleus' and extolling the magnanimity of the Verdurins. But just as the conversation, the smiles, the kisses of Odette became as odious to him as he had once found them charming, if they were diverted to others than himself, so the Verdurins' drawing-room, which, not an hour before, had still seemed to him amusing, inspired with a genuine feeling for art and even with a sort of moral aristocracy, now that it was another than himself whom Odette was going to meet there, to love there without restraint, laid bare to him all its absurdities, its stupidity, its shame\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He drew a fanciful picture, at which he shuddered in disgust, of the party next evening at Chatou. \"Imagine going to Chatou, of all places! Like a lot of drapers after closing time! Upon my word, these people are sublime in their smugness; they can't really exist; they must all have come out of one of Labiche's plays!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Cottards would be there; possibly Brichot. \"Could anything be more grotesque than the lives of these little creatures, hanging on to one another like that. They'd imagine they were utterly lost, upon my soul they would, if they didn't all meet again to-morrow at Chatou!\" Alas! there would be the painter there also, the painter who enjoyed match-making, who would invite Forcheville to come with Odette to his studio. He could see Odette, in a dress far too smart for the country, \"for she is so vulgar in that way, and, poor little thing, she is such a fool!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could hear the jokes that Mme. Verdurin would make after dinner, jokes which, whoever the 'bore' might be at whom they were aimed, had always amused him because he could watch Odette laughing at them, laughing with him, her laughter almost a part of his. Now he felt that it was possibly at him that they would make Odette laugh. \"What a fetid form of humour!\" he exclaimed, twisting his mouth into an expression of disgust so violent that he could feel the muscles of his throat stiffen against his collar. \"How, in God's name, can a creature made in His image find anything to laugh at in those nauseating witticisms? The least sensitive nose must be driven away in horror from such stale exhalations. It is really impossible to believe that any human being is incapable of understanding that, in allowing herself merely to smile at the expense of a fellow-creature who has loyally held out his hand to her, she is casting herself into a mire from which it will be impossible, with the best will in the world, ever to rescue her. I dwell so many miles above the puddles in which these filthy little vermin sprawl and crawl and bawl their cheap obscenities, that I cannot possibly be spattered by the witticisms of a Verdurin!\" he cried, tossing up his head and arrogantly straightening his body. \"God knows that I have honestly attempted to pull Odette out of that sewer, and to teach her to breathe a nobler and a purer air. But human patience has its limits, and mine is at an end,\" he concluded, as though this sacred mission to tear Odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasms dated from longer than a few minutes ago, as though he had not undertaken it only since it had occurred to him that those sarcasms might, perchance, be directed at himself, and might have the effect of detaching Odette from him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could see the pianist sitting down to play the Moonlight Sonata, and the grimaces of Mme. Verdurin, in terrified anticipation of the wrecking of her nerves by Beethoven's music. \"Idiot, liar!\" he shouted, \"and a creature like that imagines that she's fond of Art!\" She would say to Odette, after deftly insinuating a few words of praise for Forcheville, as she had so often done for himself: \"You can make room for M. de Forcheville there, can't you, Odette?\"... '\"In the dark!' Codfish! Pander!\"... 'Pander' was the name he applied also to the music which would invite them to sit in silence, to dream together, to gaze in each other's eyes, to feel for each other's hands. He felt that there was much to be said, after all, for a sternly censorous attitude towards the arts, such as Plato adopted, and Bossuet, and the old school of education in France\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a word, the life which they led at the Verdurins', which he had so often described as 'genuine,' seemed to him now the worst possible form of life, and their 'little nucleus' the most degraded class of society. \"It really is,\" he repeated, \"beneath the lowest rung of the social ladder, the nethermost circle of Dante. Beyond a doubt, the august words of the Florentine refer to the Verdurins! When one comes to think of it, surely people 'in society' (and, though one may find fault with them now and then, still, after all they are a very different matter from that gang of blackmailers) shew a profound sagacity in refusing to know them, or even to dirty the tips of their fingers with them. What a sound intuition there is in that 'Noli me tangere' motto of the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had long since emerged from the paths and avenues of the Bois, he had almost reached his own house, and still, for he had not yet thrown off the intoxication of grief, or his whim of insincerity, but was ever more and more exhilarated by the false intonation, the artificial sonority of his own voice, he continued to perorate aloud in the silence of the night: \"People 'in society' have their failings, as no one knows better than I; but, after all, they are people to whom some things, at least, are impossible. So-and-so\" (a fashionable woman whom he had known) \"was far from being perfect, but, after all, one did find in her a fundamental delicacy, a loyalty in her conduct which made her, whatever happened, incapable of a felony, which fixes a vast gulf between her and an old hag like Verdurin. Verdurin! What a name! Oh, there's something complete about them, something almost fine in their trueness to type; they're the most perfect specimens of their disgusting class! Thank God, it was high time that I stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse with such infamy, such dung.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, just as the virtues which he had still attributed, an hour or so earlier, to the Verdurins, would not have sufficed, even although the Verdurins had actually possessed them, if they had not also favoured and protected his love, to excite Swann to that state of intoxication in which he waxed tender over their magnanimity, an intoxication which, even when disseminated through the medium of other persons, could have come to him from Odette alone;\u2014so the immorality (had it really existed) which he now found in the Verdurins would have been powerless, if they had not invited Odette with Forcheville and without him, to unstop the vials of his wrath and to make him scarify their 'infamy.' Doubtless Swann's voice shewed a finer perspicacity than his own when it refused to utter those words full of disgust at the Verdurins and their circle, and of joy at his having shaken himself free of it, save in an artificial and rhetorical tone, and as though his words had been chosen rather to appease his anger than to express his thoughts. The latter, in fact, while he abandoned himself to invective, were probably, though he did not know it, occupied with a wholly different matter, for once he had reached his house, no sooner had he closed the front-door behind him than he suddenly struck his forehead, and, making his servant open the door again, dashed out into the street shouting, in a voice which, this time, was quite natural; \"I believe I have found a way of getting invited to the dinner at Chatou to-morrow!\" But it must have been a bad way, for M. Swann was not invited; Dr. Cottard, who, having been summoned to attend a serious case in the country, had not seen the Verdurins for some days, and had been prevented from appearing at Chatou, said, on the evening after this dinner, as he sat down to table at their house:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, aren't we going to see M. Swann this evening? He is quite what you might call a personal friend...\" \"I sincerely trust that we sha'n't!\" cried Mme. Verdurin. \"Heaven preserve us from him; he's too deadly for words, a stupid, ill-bred boor.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On hearing these words Cottard exhibited an intense astonishment blended with entire submission, as though in the face of a scientific truth which contradicted everything that he had previously believed, but was supported by an irresistible weight of evidence; with timorous emotion he bowed his head over his plate, and merely replied: \"Oh\u2014oh\u2014oh\u2014oh\u2014oh!\" traversing, in an orderly retirement of his forces, into the depths of his being, along a descending scale, the whole compass of his voice. After which there was no more talk of Swann at the Verdurins'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_______________________________\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so that drawing-room which had brought Swann and Odette together became an obstacle in the way of their meeting. She no longer said to him, as she had said in the early days of their love: \"We shall meet, anyhow, to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the Verdurins',\" but \"We sha'n't be able to meet to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the Verdurins'.\" Or else the Verdurins were taking her to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, to see Une Nuit de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre, and Swann could read in her eyes that terror lest he should ask her not to go, which, but a little time before, he could not have refrained from greeting with a kiss as it flitted across the face of his mistress, but which now exasperated him. \"Yet I'm not really angry,\" he assured himself, \"when I see how she longs to run away and scratch from maggots in that dunghill of cacophony. I'm disappointed; not for myself, but for her; disappointed to find that, after living for more than six months in daily contact with myself, she has not been capable of improving her mind even to the point of spontaneously eradicating from it a taste for Victor Mass\u00e9! More than that, to find that she has not arrived at the stage of understanding that there are evenings on which anyone with the least shade of refinement of feeling should be willing to forego an amusement when she is asked to do so. She ought to have the sense to say: 'I shall not go,' if it were only from policy, since it is by what she answers now that the quality of her soul will be determined once and for all.\" And having persuaded himself that it was solely, after all, in order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate of Odette's spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him that evening instead of going to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, he adopted the same line of reasoning with her, with the same degree of insincerity as he had used with himself, or even with a degree more, for in her case he was yielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self-esteem\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I swear to you,\" he told her, shortly before she was to leave for the theatre, \"that, in asking you not to go, I should hope, were I a selfish man, for nothing so much as that you should refuse, for I have a thousand other things to do this evening, and I shall feel that I have been tricked and trapped myself, and shall be thoroughly annoyed, if, after all, you tell me that you are not going. But my occupations, my pleasures are not everything; I must think of you also. A day may come when, seeing me irrevocably sundered from you, you will be entitled to reproach me with not having warned you at the decisive hour in which I felt that I was going to pass judgment on you, one of those stern judgments which love cannot long resist. You see, your Nuit de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (what a title!) has no bearing on the point. What I must know is whether you are indeed one of those creatures in the lowest grade of mentality and even of charm, one of those contemptible creatures who are incapable of foregoing a pleasure. For if you are such, how could anyone love you, for you are not even a person, a definite, imperfect, but at least perceptible entity. You are a formless water that will trickle down any slope that it may come upon, a fish devoid of memory, incapable of thought, which all its life long in its aquarium will continue to dash itself, a hundred times a day, against a wall of glass, always mistaking it for water. Do you realise that your answer will have the effect\u2014I do not say of making me cease from that moment to love you, that goes without saying, but of making you less attractive to my eyes when I realise that you are not a person, that you are beneath everything in the world and have not the intelligence to raise yourself one inch higher? Obviously, I should have preferred to ask you, as though it had been a matter of little or no importance, to give up your Nuit de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject a name), in the hope that you would go to it none the less. But, since I had resolved to weigh you in the balance, to make so grave an issue depend upon your answer, I considered it more honourable to give you due warning.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, Odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty. Although the meaning of his tirade was beyond her, she grasped that it was to be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication, scenes which her familiarity with the ways of men enabled her, without paying any heed to the words that were uttered, to conclude that men would not make unless they were in love; that, from the moment when they were in love, it was superfluous to obey them, since they would only be more in love later on. And so, she would have heard Swann out with the utmost tranquillity had she not noticed that it was growing late, and that if he went on speaking for any length of time she would \"never\" as she told him with a fond smile, obstinate but slightly abashed, \"get there in time for the Overture.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which, more than anything else, would make him cease to love her, would be her refusal to abandon the habit of lying. \"Even from the point of view of coquetry, pure and simple,\" he had told her, \"can't you see how much of your attraction you throw away when you stoop to lying? By a frank admission\u2014how many faults you might redeem! Really, you are far less intelligent than I supposed!\" In vain, however, did Swann expound to her thus all the reasons that she had for not lying; they might have succeeded in overthrowing any universal system of mendacity, but Odette had no such system; she contented herself, merely, whenever she wished Swann to remain in ignorance of anything that she had done, with not telling him of it. So that a lie was, to her, something to be used only as a special expedient; and the one thing that could make her decide whether she should avail herself of a lie or not was a reason which, too, was of a special and contingent order, namely the risk of Swann's discovering that she had not told him the truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Physically, she was passing through an unfortunate phase; she was growing stouter, and the expressive, sorrowful charm, the surprised, wistful expressions which she had formerly had, seemed to have vanished with her first youth, with the result that she became most precious to Swann at the very moment when he found her distinctly less good-looking. He would gaze at her for hours on end, trying to recapture the charm which he had once seen in her and could not find again. And yet the knowledge that, within this new and strange chrysalis, it was still Odette that lurked, still the same volatile temperament, artful and evasive, was enough to keep Swann seeking, with as much passion as ever, to captivate her. Then he would look at photographs of her, taken two years before, and would remember how exquisite she had been. And that would console him, a little, for all the sufferings that he voluntarily endured on her account\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the Verdurins took her off to Saint-Germain, or to Chatou, or to Meulan, as often as not, if the weather was fine, they would propose to remain there for the night, and not go home until next day. Mme. Verdurin would endeavour to set at rest the scruples of the pianist, whose aunt had remained in Paris: \"She will be only too glad to be rid of you for a day. How on earth could she be anxious, when she knows you're with us? Anyhow, I'll take you all under my wing; she can put the blame on me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If this attempt failed, M. Verdurin would set off across country until he came to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger, after first finding out which of the 'faithful' had anyone whom they must warn. But Odette would thank him, and assure him that she had no message for anyone, for she had told Swann, once and for all, that she could not possibly send messages to him, before all those people, without compromising herself. Sometimes she would be absent for several days on end, when the Verdurins took her to see the tombs at Dreux, or to Compi\u00e8gne, on the painter's advice, to watch the sun setting through the forest\u2014after which they went on to the Ch\u00e2teau of Pierrefonds\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To think that she could visit really historic buildings with me, who have spent ten years in the study of architecture, who am constantly bombarded, by people who really count, to take them over Beauvais or Saint-Loup-de-Naud, and refuse to take anyone but her; and instead of that she trundles off with the lowest, the most brutally degraded of creatures, to go into ecstasies over the petrified excretions of Louis-Philippe and Viollet-le-Duc! One hardly needs much knowledge of art, I should say, to do that; though, surely, even without any particularly refined sense of smell, one would not deliberately choose to spend a holiday in the latrines, so as to be within range of their fragrant exhalations.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But when she had set off for Dreux or Pierrefonds\u2014alas, without allowing him to appear there, as though by accident, at her side, for, as she said, that would \"create a dreadful impression,\"\u2014he would plunge into the most intoxicating romance in the lover's library, the railway timetable, from which he learned the ways of joining her there in the afternoon, in the evening, even in the morning. The ways? More than that, the authority, the right to join her. For, after all, the time-table, and the trains themselves, were not meant for dogs. If the public were carefully informed, by means of printed advertisements, that at eight o'clock in the morning a train started for Pierrefonds which arrived there at ten, that could only be because going to Pierrefonds was a lawful act, for which permission from Odette would be superfluous; an act, moreover, which might be performed from a motive altogether different from the desire to see Odette, since persons who had never even heard of her performed it daily, and in such numbers as justified the labour and expense of stoking the engines\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So it came to this; that she could not prevent him from going to Pierrefonds if he chose to do so. Now that was precisely what he found that he did choose to do, and would at that moment be doing were he, like the travelling public, not acquainted with Odette. For a long time past he had wanted to form a more definite impression of Viollet-le-Duc's work as a restorer. And the weather being what it was, he felt an overwhelming desire to spend the day roaming in the forest of Compi\u00e8gne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was, indeed, a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access to the one spot that tempted him to-day. To-day! Why, if he went down there, in defiance of her prohibition, he would be able to see her that very day! But then, whereas, if she had met, at Pierrefonds, some one who did not matter, she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure: \"What, you here?\" and would have invited him to come and see her at the hotel where she was staying with the Verdurins, if, on the other hand, it was himself, Swann, that she encountered there, she would be annoyed, would complain that she was being followed, would love him less in consequence, might even turn away in anger when she caught sight of him. \"So, then, I am not to be allowed to go away for a day anywhere!\" she would reproach him on her return, whereas in fact it was he himself who was not allowed to go\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had had the sudden idea, so as to contrive to visit Compi\u00e8gne and Pierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet Odette, of securing an invitation from one of his friends, the Marquis de Forestelle, who had a country house in that neighbourhood. This friend, to whom Swann suggested the plan without disclosing its ulterior purpose, was beside himself with joy; he did not conceal his astonishment at Swann's consenting at last, after fifteen years, to come down and visit his property, and since he did not (he told him) wish to stay there, promised to spend some days, at least, in taking him for walks and excursions in the district. Swann imagined himself down there already with M. de Forestelle. Even before he saw Odette, even if he did not succeed in seeing her there, what a joy it would be to set foot on that soil where, not knowing the exact spot in which, at any moment, she was to be found, he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility of her suddenly appearing: in the courtyard of the Ch\u00e2teau, now beautiful in his eyes since it was on her account that he had gone to visit it; in all the streets of the town, which struck him as romantic; down every ride of the forest, roseate with the deep and tender glow of sunset;\u2014innumerable and alternative hiding-places, to which would fly simultaneously for refuge, in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his happy, vagabond and divided heart. \"We mustn't, on any account,\" he would warn M. de Forestelle, \"run across Odette and the Verdurins. I have just heard that they are at Pierrefonds, of all places, to-day. One has plenty of time to see them in Paris; it would hardly be worth while coming down here if one couldn't go a yard without meeting them.\" And his host would fail to understand why, once they had reached the place, Swann would change his plans twenty times in an hour, inspect the dining-rooms of all the hotels in Compi\u00e8gne without being able to make up his mind to settle down in any of them, although he had found no trace anywhere of the Verdurins, seeming to be in search of what he had claimed to be most anxious to avoid, and would in fact avoid, the moment he found it, for if he had come upon the little 'group,' he would have hastened away at once with studied indifference, satisfied that he had seen Odette and she him, especially that she had seen him when he was not, apparently, thinking about her. But no; she would guess at once that it was for her sake that he had come there. And when M. de Forestelle came to fetch him, and it was time to start, he excused himself: \"No, I'm afraid not; I can't go to Pierrefonds to-day. You see, Odette is there.\" And Swann was happy in spite of everything in feeling that if he, alone among mortals, had not the right to go to Pierrefonds that day, it was because he was in fact, for Odette, some one who differed from all other mortals, her lover; and because that restriction which for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel freely where one would, was but one of the many forms of that slavery, that love which was so dear to him. Decidedly, it was better not to risk a quarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for her return. He spent his days in poring over a map of the forest of Compi\u00e8gne, as though it had been that of the 'Pays du Tendre'; he surrounded himself with photographs of the Ch\u00e2teau of Pierrefonds. When the day dawned on which it was possible that she might return, he opened the time-table again, calculated what train she must have taken, and, should she have postponed her departure, what trains were still left for her to take. He did not leave the house, for fear of missing a telegram, he did not go to bed, in case, having come by the last train, she decided to surprise him with a midnight visit. Yes! The front-door bell rang. There seemed some delay in opening the door, he wanted to awaken the porter, he leaned out of the window to shout to Odette, if it was Odette, for in spite of the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to deliver in person, they were quite capable of telling her that he was not at home. It was only a servant coming in. He noticed the incessant rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never before paid any attention. He could hear them, one after another, a long way off, coming nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing away into the distance a message which was not for him. He waited all night, to no purpose, for the Verdurins had returned unexpectedly, and Odette had been in Paris since midday; it had not occurred to her to tell him; not knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone at a theatre, had long since gone home to bed, and was peacefully asleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact, she had never given him a thought. And such moments as these, in which she forgot Swann's very existence, were of more value to Odette, did more to attach him to her, than all her infidelities. For in this way Swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had once before been effective in making his interest blossom into love, on the night when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins' and had hunted for her all evening. And he did not have (as I had, afterwards, at Combray in my childhood) happy days in which to forget the sufferings that would return with the night. For his days, Swann must pass them without Odette; and as he told himself, now and then, to allow so pretty a woman to go out by herself in Paris was just as rash as to leave a case filled with jewels in the middle of the street. In this mood he would scowl furiously at the passers-by, as though they were so many pickpockets. But their faces\u2014a collective and formless mass\u2014escaped the grasp of his imagination, and so failed to feed the flame of his jealousy. The effort exhausted Swann's brain, until, passing his hand over his eyes, he cried out: \"Heaven help me!\" as people, after lashing themselves into an intellectual frenzy in their endeavours to master the problem of the reality of the external world, or that of the immortality of the soul, afford relief to their weary brains by an unreasoning act of faith. But the thought of his absent mistress was incessantly, indissolubly blended with all the simplest actions of Swann's daily life\u2014when he took his meals, opened his letters, went for a walk or to bed\u2014by the fact of his regret at having to perform those actions without her; like those initials of Philibert the Fair which, in the church of Brou, because of her grief, her longing for him, Margaret of Austria intertwined everywhere with her own. On some days, instead of staying at home, he would go for luncheon to a restaurant not far off, to which he had been attracted, some time before, by the excellence of its cookery, but to which he now went only for one of those reasons, at once mystical and absurd, which people call 'romantic'; because this restaurant (which, by the way, still exists) bore the same name as the street in which Odette lived: the Lap\u00e9rouse. Sometimes, when she had been away on a short visit somewhere, several days would elapse before she thought of letting him know that she had returned to Paris. And then she would say quite simply, without taking (as she would once have taken) the precaution of covering herself, at all costs, with a little fragment borrowed from the truth, that she had just, at that very moment, arrived by the morning train. What she said was a falsehood; at least for Odette it was a falsehood, inconsistent, lacking (what it would have had, if true) the support of her memory of her actual arrival at the station; she was even prevented from forming a mental picture of what she was saying, while she said it, by the contradictory picture, in her mind, of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at the moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train. In Swann's mind, however, these words, meeting no opposition, settled and hardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so indubitable that, if some friend happened to tell him that he had come by the same train and had not seen Odette, Swann would have been convinced that it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or hour, since his version did not agree with the words uttered by Odette. These words had never appeared to him false except when, before hearing them, he had suspected that they were going to be. For him to believe that she was lying, an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable. It was also, however, sufficient. Given that, everything that Odette might say appeared to him suspect. Did she mention a name: it was obviously that of one of her lovers; once this supposition had taken shape, he would spend weeks in tormenting himself; on one occasion he even approached a firm of 'inquiry agents' to find out the address and the occupation of the unknown rival who would give him no peace until he could be proved to have gone abroad, and who (he ultimately learned) was an uncle of Odette, and had been dead for twenty years\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although she would not allow him, as a rule, to meet her at public gatherings, saying that people would talk, it happened occasionally that, at an evening party to which he and she had each been invited\u2014at Forcheville's, at the painter's, or at a charity ball given in one of the Ministries\u2014he found himself in the same room with her. He could see her, but dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be spying upon the pleasures which she tasted in other company, pleasures which\u2014while he drove home in utter loneliness, and went to bed, as anxiously as I myself was to go to bed, some years later, on the evenings when he came to dine with us at Combray\u2014seemed illimitable to him since he had not been able to see their end. And, once or twice, he derived from such evenings that kind of happiness which one would be inclined (did it not originate in so violent a reaction from an anxiety abruptly terminated) to call peaceful, since it consists in a pacifying of the mind: he had looked in for a moment at a revel in the painter's studio, and was getting ready to go home; he was leaving behind him Odette, transformed into a brilliant stranger, surrounded by men to whom her glances and her gaiety, which were not for him, seemed to hint at some voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed there or elsewhere (possibly at the Bal des Incoh\u00e9rents, to which he trembled to think that she might be going on afterwards) which made Swann more jealous than the thought of their actual physical union, since it was more difficult to imagine; he was opening the door to go, when he heard himself called back in these words (which, by cutting off from the party that possible ending which had so appalled him, made the party itself seem innocent in retrospect, made Odette's return home a thing no longer inconceivable and terrible, but tender and familiar, a thing that kept close to his side, like a part of his own daily life, in his carriage; a thing that stripped Odette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety in her appearance, shewed that it was only a disguise which she had assumed for a moment, for his sake and not in view of any mysterious pleasures, a disguise of which she had already wearied)\u2014in these words, which Odette flung out after him as he was crossing the threshold: \"Can't you wait a minute for me? I'm just going; we'll drive back together and you can drop me.\" It was true that on one occasion Forcheville had asked to be driven home at the same time, but when, on reaching Odette's gate, he had begged to be allowed to come in too, she had replied, with a finger pointed at Swann: \"Ah! That depends on this gentleman. You must ask him. Very well, you may come in, just for a minute, if you insist, but you mustn't stay long, for, I warn you, he likes to sit and talk quietly with me, and he's not at all pleased if I have visitors when he's here. Oh, if you only knew the creature as I know him; isn't that so, my love, there's no one that really knows you, is there, except me?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Swann was, perhaps, even more touched by the spectacle of her addressing him thus, in front of Forcheville, not only in these tender words of predilection, but also with certain criticisms, such as: \"I feel sure you haven't written yet to your friends, about dining with them on Sunday. You needn't go if you don't want to, but you might at least be polite,\" or \"Now, have you left your essay on Vermeer here, so that you can do a little more to it to-morrow? What a lazy-bones! I'm going to make you work, I can tell you,\" which proved that Odette kept herself in touch with his social engagements and his literary work, that they had indeed a life in common. And as she spoke she bestowed on him a smile which he interpreted as meaning that she was entirely his\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, while she was making them some orangeade, suddenly, just as when the reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting all round an object, on the wall beyond it, huge and fantastic shadows which, in time, contract and are lost in the shadow of the object itself, all the terrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of Odette melted away and vanished in the charming creature who stood there before his eyes. He had the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in Odette's house, in the lamp-light, was, perhaps, after all, not an artificial hour, invented for his special use (with the object of concealing that frightening and delicious thing which was incessantly in his thoughts without his ever being able to form a satisfactory impression of it, an hour of Odette's real life, of her life when he was not there, looking on) with theatrical properties and pasteboard fruits, but was perhaps a genuine hour of Odette's life; that, if he himself had not been there, she would have pulled forward the same armchair for Forcheville, would have poured out for him, not any unknown brew, but precisely that orangeade which she was now offering to them both; that the world inhabited by Odette was not that other world, fearful and supernatural, in which he spent his time in placing her\u2014and which existed, perhaps, only in his imagination, but the real universe, exhaling no special atmosphere of gloom, comprising that table at which he might sit down, presently, and write, and this drink which he was being permitted, now, to taste; all the objects which he contemplated with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude, for if, in absorbing his dreams, they had delivered him from an obsession, they themselves were, in turn, enriched by the absorption; they shewed him the palpable realisation of his fancies, and they interested his mind; they took shape and grew solid before-his eyes, and at the same time they soothed his troubled heart. Ah! had fate but allowed him to share a single dwelling with Odette, so that in her house he should be in his own; if, when asking his servant what there would be for luncheon, it had been Odette's bill of fare that he had learned from the reply; if, when Odette wished to go for a walk, in the morning, along the Avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne, his duty as a good husband had obliged him, though he had no desire to go out, to accompany her, carrying her cloak when she was too warm; and in the evening, after dinner, if she wished to stay at home, and not to dress, if he had been forced to stay beside her, to do what she asked; then how completely would all the trivial details of Swann's life, which seemed to him now so gloomy, simply because they would, at the same time, have formed part of the life of Odette, have taken on\u2014like that lamp, that orangeade, that armchair, which had absorbed so much of his dreams, which materialised so much of his longing,\u2014a sort of superabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much longed was a calm, a peace, which would not have created an atmosphere favourable to his love. When Odette ceased to be for him a creature always absent, regretted, imagined; when the feeling that he had for her was no longer the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by the phrase from the sonata, but constant affection and gratitude, when those normal relations were established between them which would put an end to his melancholy madness; then, no doubt, the actions of Odette's daily life would appear to him as being of but little intrinsic interest\u2014as he had several times, already, felt that they might be, on the day, for instance, when he had read, through its envelope, her letter to Forcheville. Examining his complaint with as much scientific detachment as if he had inoculated himself with it in order to study its effects, he told himself that, when he was cured of it, what Odette might or might not do would be indifferent to him. But in his morbid state, to tell the truth, he feared death itself no more than such a recovery, which would, in fact, amount to the death of all that he then was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After these quiet evenings, Swann's suspicions would be temporarily lulled; he would bless the name of Odette, and next day, in the morning, would order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her, because her kindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude, or the desire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love for her which had need of some such outlet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But at other times, grief would again take hold of him; he would imagine that Odette was Forcheville's mistress, and that, when they had both sat watching him from the depths of the Verdurins' landau, in the Bois, on the evening before the party at Chatou to which he had not been invited, while he implored her in vain, with that look of despair on his face which even his coachman had noticed, to come home with him, and then turned away, solitary, crushed,\u2014she must have employed, to draw Forcheville's attention to him, while she murmured: \"Do look at him, storming!\" the same glance, brilliant, malicious, sidelong, cunning, as on the evening when Forcheville had driven Saniette from the Verdurins'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At such times Swann detested her. \"But I've been a fool, too,\" he would argue. \"I'm paying for other men's pleasures with my money. All the same, she'd better take care, and not pull the string too often, for I might very well stop giving her anything at all. At any rate, we'd better knock off supplementary favours for the time being. To think that, only yesterday, when she said she would like to go to Bayreuth for the season, I was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly little places the King of Bavaria has there, for the two of us. However she didn't seem particularly keen; she hasn't said yes or no yet. Let's hope that she'll refuse. Good God! Think of listening to Wagner for a fortnight on end with her, who takes about as much interest in music as a fish does in little apples; it will be fun!\" And his hatred, like his love, needing to manifest itself in action, he amused himself with urging his evil imaginings further and further, because, thanks to the perfidies with which he charged Odette, he detested her still more, and would be able, if it turned out\u2014as he tried to convince himself\u2014that she was indeed guilty of them, to take the opportunity of punishing her, emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath. In this way, he went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from her, in which she would ask him for money to take the house at Bayreuth, but with the warning that he was not to come there himself, as she had promised Forcheville and the Verdurins to invite them. Oh, how he would have loved it, had it been conceivable that she would have that audacity. What joy he would have in refusing, in drawing up that vindictive reply, the terms of which he amused himself by selecting and declaiming aloud, as though he had actually received her letter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The very next day, her letter came. She wrote that the Verdurins and their friends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances of Wagner, and that, if he would be so good as to send her the money, she would be able at last, after going so often to their house, to have the pleasure of entertaining the Verdurins in hers. Of him she said not a word; it was to be taken for granted that their presence at Bayreuth would be a bar to his\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then that annihilating answer, every word of which he had carefully rehearsed overnight, without venturing to hope that it could ever be used, he had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her. Alas! he felt only too certain that with the money which she had, or could easily procure, she would be able, all the same, to take a house at Bayreuth, since she wished to do so, she who was incapable of distinguishing between Bach and Clapisson. Let her take it, then; she would have to live in it more frugally, that was all. No means (as there would have been if he had replied by sending her several thousand-franc notes) of organising, each evening, in her hired castle, those exquisite little suppers, after which she might perhaps be seized by the whim (which, it was possible, had never yet seized her) of falling into the arms of Forcheville. At any rate, this loathsome expedition, it would not be Swann who had to pay for it. Ah! if he could only manage to prevent it, if she could sprain her ankle before starting, if the driver of the carriage which was to take her to the station would consent (no matter how great the bribe) to smuggle her to some place where she could be kept for a time in seclusion, that perfidious woman, her eyes tinselled with a smile of complicity for Forcheville, which was what Odette had become for Swann in the last forty-eight hours\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she was never that for very long; after a few days the shining, crafty eyes lost their brightness and their duplicity, that picture of an execrable Odette saying to Forcheville: \"Look at him storming!\" began to grow pale and to dissolve. Then gradually reappeared and rose before him, softly radiant, the face of the other Odette, of that Odette who al^o turned with a smile to Forcheville, but with a smile in which there was nothing but affection for Swann, when she said: \"You mustn't stay long, for this gentleman doesn't much like my having visitors when he's here. Oh! if you only knew the creature as I know him!\" that same smile with which she used to thank Swann for some instance of his courtesy which she prized so highly, for some advice for which she had asked him in one of those grave crises in her life, when she could turn to him alone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, to this other Odette, he would ask himself what could have induced him to write that outrageous letter, of which, probably, until then, she had never supposed him capable, a letter which must have lowered him from the high, from the supreme place which, by his generosity, by his loyalty, he had won for himself in her esteem. He would become less dear to her, since it was for those qualities, which she found neither in Forcheville nor in any other, that she loved him. It was for them that Odette so often shewed him a reciprocal kindness, which counted for less than nothing in his moments of jealousy, because it was not a sign of reciprocal desire, was indeed a proof rather of affection than of love, but the importance of which he began once more to feel in proportion as the spontaneous relaxation of his suspicions, often accelerated by the distraction brought to him by reading about art or by the conversation of a friend, rendered his passion less exacting of reciprocities\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now that, after this swing of the pendulum, Odette had naturally returned to the place from which Swann's jealousy had for the moment driven her, in the angle in which he found her charming, he pictured her to himself as full of tenderness, with a look of consent in her eyes, and so beautiful that he could not refrain from moving his lips towards her, as though she had actually been in the room for him to kiss; and he preserved a sense of gratitude to her for that bewitching, kindly glance, as strong as though she had really looked thus at him, and it had not been merely his imagination that had portrayed it in order to satisfy his desire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What distress he must have caused her! Certainly he found adequate reasons for his resentment, but they would not have been sufficient to make him feel that resentment, if he had not so passionately loved her. Had he not nourished grievances, just as serious, against other women, to whom he would, none the less, render willing service to-day, feeling no anger towards them because he no longer loved them? If the day ever came when he would find himself in the same state of indifference with regard to Odette, he would then understand that it was his jealousy alone which had led him to find something atrocious, unpardonable, in this desire (after all, so natural a desire, springing from a childlike ingenuousness and also from a certain delicacy in her nature) to be able, in her turn, when an occasion offered, to repay the Verdurins for their hospitality, and to play the hostess in a house of her own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He returned to the other point of view\u2014opposite to that of his love and of his jealousy, to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental equity, and in order to make allowance for different eventualities\u2014from which he tried to form a fresh judgment of Odette, based on the supposition that he had never been in love with her, that she was to him just a woman like other women, that her life had not been (whenever he himself was not present) different, a texture woven in secret apart from him, and warped against him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with Forcheville or with other men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with him, and which his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements? At Bayreuth, as in Paris, if it should happen that Forcheville thought of him at all, it would only be as of some one who counted for a great deal in the life of Odette, some one for whom he was obliged to make way, when they met in her house. If Forcheville and she scored a triumph by being down there together in spite of him, it was he who had engineered that triumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going there, whereas if he had approved of her plan, which for that matter was quite defensible, she would have had the appearance of being there by his counsel, she would have felt herself sent there, housed there by him, and for the pleasure which she derived from entertaining those people who had so often entertained her, it was to him that she would have had to acknowledge her indebtedness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if\u2014instead of letting her go off thus, at cross-purposes with him, without having seen him again\u2014he were to send her this money, if he were to encourage her to take this journey, and to go out of his way to make it comfortable and pleasant for her, she would come running to him, happy, grateful, and he would have the joy\u2014the sight of her face\u2014which he had not known for nearly a week, a joy which none other could replace. For the moment that Swann was able to form a picture of her without revulsion, that he could see once again the friendliness in her smile, and that the desire to tear her away from every rival was no longer imposed by his jealousy upon his love, that love once again became, more than anything, a taste for the sensations which Odette's person gave him, for the pleasure which he found in admiring, as one might a spectacle, or in questioning, as one might a phenomenon, the birth of one of her glances, the formation of one of her smiles, the utterance of an intonation of her voice. And this pleasure, different from every other, had in the end created in him a need of her, which she alone, by her presence or by her letters, could assuage, almost as disinterested, almost as artistic, as perverse as another need which characterised this new period in Swann's life, when the sereness, the depression of the preceding years had been followed by a sort of spiritual superabundance, without his knowing to what he owed this unlooked-for enrichment of his life, any more than a person in delicate health who from a certain moment grows stronger, puts on flesh, and seems for a time to be on the road to a complete recovery:\u2014this other need, which, too, developed in him independently of the visible, material world, was the need to listen to music and to learn to know it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, by the chemical process of his malady, after he had created jealousy out of his love, he began again to generate tenderness, pity for Odette. She had become once more the old Odette, charming and kind. He was full of remorse for having treated her harshly. He wished her to come to him, and, before she came, he wished to have already procured for her some pleasure, so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her face and moulding her smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So, too, Odette, certain of seeing him come to her in a few days, as tender and submissive as before, and plead with her for a reconciliation, became inured, was no longer afraid of displeasing him, or even of making him angry, and refused him, whenever it suited her, the favours by which he set most store\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during their quarrel, when he had told her that he would not send her any money, but would do what he could to hurt her. Perhaps she did not realise, either, how sincere he still was, if not with her, at any rate with himself, on other occasions when, for the sake of their future relations, to shew Odette that he was capable of doing without her, that a rupture was still possible between them, he decided to wait some time before going to see her again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes several days had elapsed, during which she had caused him no fresh anxiety; and as, from the next few visits which he would pay her, he knew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure, but, more probably, some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in which he found himself, he wrote to her that he was very busy, and would not be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested. Meanwhile, a letter from her, crossing his, asked him to postpone one of those very meetings. He asked himself, why; his suspicions, his grief, again took hold of him. He could no longer abide, in the new state of agitation into which he found himself plunged, by the arrangements which he had made in his preceding state of comparative calm; he would run to find her, and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following days. And even if she had not written first, if she merely acknowledged his letter, it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing her. For, upsetting all Swann's calculations, Odette's acceptance had entirely changed his attitude. Like everyone who possesses something precious, so as to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to possess it, he had detached the precious object from his mind, leaving, as he thought, everything else in the same state as when it was there. But the absence of one part from a whole is not only that, it is not simply a partial omission, it is a disturbance of all the other parts, a new state which it was impossible to foresee from the old\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But at other times\u2014when Odette was on the point of going away for a holiday\u2014it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the pretext, that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until her return, giving the appearance (and expecting the reward) of a serious rupture, which she would perhaps regard as final, to a separation, the greater part of which was inevitable, since she was going away, which, in fact, he was merely allowing to start a little sooner than it must. At once he could imagine Odette, puzzled, anxious, distressed at having received neither visit nor letter from him and this picture of her, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break himself of the habit of seeing her. At odd moments, no doubt, in the furthest recesses of his brain, where his determination had thrust it away, and thanks to the length of the interval, the three weeks' separation to which he had agreed, it was with pleasure that he would consider the idea that he would see Odette again on her return; but it was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself whether he would not readily consent to the doubling of the period of so easy an abstinence. It had lasted, so far, but three days, a much shorter time than he had often, before, passed without seeing Odette, and without having, as on this occasion he had, premeditated a separation. And yet, there and then, some tiny trace of contrariety in his mind, or of weakness in his body,\u2014by inciting him to regard the present as an exceptional moment, one not to be governed by the rules, one in which prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of the soothing effects of a pleasure and to give his will (until the time should come when its efforts might serve any purpose) a holiday\u2014suspended the action of his will, which ceased to exert its inhibitive control; or, without that even, the thought of some information for which he had forgotten to ask Odette, such as if she had decided in what colour she would have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to some investment, whether they were 'ordinary' or 'preference' shares that she wished him to buy (for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without seeing her, but if, after that, the carriage had to be painted over again, if the shares produced no dividend, a fine lot of good he would have done),\u2014and suddenly, like a stretched piece of elastic which is let go, or the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open, the idea of seeing her again, from the remote point in time to which it had been attached, sprang back into the field of the present and of immediate possibilities\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance, so irresistible, in fact, that Swann had been far less unhappy in watching the end gradually approaching, day by day, of the fortnight which he must spend apart from Odette, than he was when kept waiting ten minutes while his coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to her, minutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy, in which he recaptured a thousand times over, to lavish on it all the wealth of his affection, that idea of his meeting with Odette, which, by so abrupt a repercussion, at a moment when he supposed it so remote, was once more present and on the very surface of his consciousness. The fact was that this idea no longer found, as an obstacle in its course, the desire to contrive without further delay to resist its coming, which had ceased to have any place in Swann's mind since, having proved to himself\u2014or so, at least, he believed\u2014that he was so easily capable of resisting it, he no longer saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of separation which he was now certain of being able to put into operation whenever he would. Furthermore, this idea of seeing her again came back to him adorned with a novelty, a seductiveness, armed with a virulence, all of which long habit had enfeebled, but which had acquired new vigour during this privation, not of three days but of a fortnight (for a period of abstinence may be calculated, by anticipation, as having lasted already until the final date assigned to it), and had converted what had been, until then, a pleasure in store, which could easily be sacrificed, into an unlooked-for happiness which he was powerless to resist. Finally, the idea returned to him with its beauty enhanced by his own ignorance of what Odette might have thought, might, perhaps, have done on finding that he shewed no sign of life, with the result that he was going now to meet with the entrancing revelation of an Odette almost unknown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she, just as she had supposed that his refusal to send her money was only a feint, saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came, now, to ask her, about the repainting of her carriage, or the purchase of stock. For she could not reconstruct the several phases of these crises through which he passed, and in the general idea which she formed of them she made no attempt to understand their mechanism, looking only to what she knew beforehand, their necessary, never-failing and always identical termination. An imperfect idea (though possibly all the more profound in consequence), if one were to judge it from the point of view of Swann, who would doubtless have considered that Odette failed to understand him, just as a morphinomaniac or a consumptive, each persuaded that he has been thrown back, one by some outside event, at the moment when he was just going to shake himself free from his inveterate habit, the other by an accidental indisposition at the moment when he was just going to be finally cured, feels himself to be misunderstood by the doctor who does not attach the same importance to these pretended contingencies, mere disguises, according to him, assumed, so as to be perceptible by his patients, by the vice of one and the morbid state of the other, which in reality have never ceased to weigh heavily and incurably upon them while they were nursing their dreams of normality and health. And, as a matter of fact, Swann's love had reached that stage at which the physician and (in the case of certain affections) the boldest of surgeons ask themselves whether to deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is still reasonable, or indeed possible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, of the extent of this love Swann had no direct knowledge. When he sought to measure it, it happened sometimes that he found it diminished, shrunken almost to nothing; for instance, the very moderate liking, amounting almost to dislike, which, in the days before he was in love with Odette, he had felt for her expressive features, her faded complexion, returned on certain days. \"Really, I am making distinct headway,\" he would tell himself on the morrow, \"when I come to think it over carefully, I find out that I got hardly any pleasure, last night, out of being in bed with her; it's an odd thing, but I actually thought her ugly.\" And certainly he was sincere, but his love extended a long way beyond the province of physical desire. Odette's person, indeed, no longer held any great place in it. When his eyes fell upon the photograph of Odette on his table, or when she came to see him, he had difficulty in identifying her face, either in the flesh or on the pasteboard, with the painful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his mind. He would say to himself, almost with astonishment, \"It is she!\" as when suddenly some one shews us in a detached, externalised form one of our own maladies, and we find in it no resemblance to what we are suffering. \"She?\"\u2014he tried to ask himself what that meant; for it is something like love, like death (rather than like those vague conceptions of maladies), a thing which one repeatedly calls in question, in order to make oneself probe further into it, in the fear that the question will find no answer, that the substance will escape our grasp\u2014the mystery of personality. And this malady, which was Swann's love, had so far multiplied, was so closely interwoven with all his habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his sleep, his life, even with what he hoped for after his death, was so entirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it away without almost entirely destroying him; as surgeons say, his case was past operation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests that when by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion, reminding himself that his social relations, like a beautifully wrought setting (although she would not have been able to form any very exact estimate of its worth), might, still, add a little to his own value in Odette's eyes (as indeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his love itself, which for Odette depreciated everything that it touched by seeming to denounce such things as less precious than itself), he would feel there, simultaneously with his distress at being in places and among people that she did not know, the same detached sense of pleasure as he would have derived from a novel or a painting in which were depicted the amusements of a leisured class; just as, at home, he used to enjoy the thought of the smooth efficiency of his household, the smartness of his own wardrobe and of his servants' liveries, the soundness of his investments, with the same relish as when he read in Saint-Simon, who was one of his favourite authors, of the machinery of daily life at Versailles, what Mme. de Maintenon ate and drank, or the shrewd avarice and great pomp of Lulli. And in the small extent to which this detachment was not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure which Swann was tasting was that he could emigrate for a moment into those few and distant parts of himself which had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain. In this respect the personality, with which my great-aunt endowed him, of 'young Swann,' as distinct from the more individual personality of Charles Swann, was that in which he now most delighted. Once when, because it was the birthday of the Princesse de Parme (and because she could often be of use, indirectly, to Odette, by letting her have seats for galas and jubilees and all that sort of thing), he had decided to send her a basket of fruit, and was not quite sure where or how to order it, he had entrusted the task to a cousin of his mother who, delighted to be doing a commission for him, had written to him, laying stress on the fact that she had not chosen all the fruit at the same place, but the grapes from Crapote, whose speciality they were, the straw berries from Jauret, the pears from Chevet, who always had the best, am soon, \"every fruit visited and examined, one by one, by myself.\" And ii the sequel, by the cordiality with which the Princess thanked him, hi had been able to judge of the flavour of the strawberries and of the ripe ness of the pears. But, most of all, that \"every fruit visited and examinee one by one, by myself\" had brought balm to his sufferings by carrying hi mind off to a region which he rarely visited, although it was his by right, as the heir of a rich and respectable middle-class family in which had been handed down from generation to generation the knowledge of the 'right places' and the art of ordering things from shops\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of a truth, he had too long forgotten that he was 'young Swann' not to feel, when he assumed that part again for a moment, a keener pleasure than he was capable of feeling at other times\u2014when, indeed, he was grown sick of pleasure; and if the friendliness of the middle-class people, for whom he had never been anything else than 'young Swann,' was less animated than that of the aristocrats (though more flattering, for all that, since in the middle-class mind friendship is inseparable from respect), no letter from a Royal Personage, offering him some princely entertainment, could ever be so attractive to Swann as the letter which asked him to be a witness, or merely to be present at a wedding in the family of some old friends of his parents; some of whom had 'kept up' with him, like my grandfather, who, the year before these events, had invited him to my mother's wedding, while others barely knew him by sight, but were, they thought, in duty bound to shew civility to the son, to the worthy successor of the late M. Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, by virtue of his intimacy, already time-honoured, with so many of them, the people of fashion, in a certain sense, were also a part of his house, his service, and his family. He felt, when his mind dwelt upon his brilliant connections, the same external support, the same solid comfort as when he looked at the fine estate, the fine silver, the fine table-linen which had come down to him from his forebears. And the thought that, if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the house, the people whom his valet would instinctively run to find would be the Duc de Chartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg and the Baron de Charlus, brought him the same consolation as our old Fran\u00e7oise derived from the knowledge that she would, one day, be buried in her own fine clothes, marked with her name, not darned at all (or so exquisitely darned that it merely enhanced one's idea of the skill and patience of the seamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which in her mind's eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually of wealth and prosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. But most of all,\u2014since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference to Odette, Swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed feeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome to her than anyone, even the most wearisome of the Verdurins' 'faithful,'\u2014when he betook himself to a world in which he was the paramount example of taste, a man whom no pains were spared to attract, whom people were genuinely sorry not to see, he began once again to believe in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite for it, as an invalid may feel who has been in bed for months and on a strict diet, when he picks up a newspaper and reads the account of an official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise round Sicily\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not paying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her that he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He still paid them (asking himself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps exhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her, it would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each visit he found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some information which she required, M. de Charlus, whom he had met actually going to her house, and who had insisted upon Swann's accompanying him. And, failing any excuse, he would beg M. de Charlus to go to her at once, and to tell her, as though spontaneously, in the course of conversation, that he had just remembered something that he had to say to Swann, and would she please send a message to Swann's house asking him to come to her then and there; but as a rule Swann waited at home in vain, and M. de Charlus informed him, later in the evening, that his device had not proved successful. With the result that, if she was now frequently away from Paris, even when she was there he scarcely saw her; that she who, when she was in love with him, used to say, \"I am always free\" and \"What can it matter to me, what other people think?\" now, whenever he wanted to see her, appealed to the proprieties or pleaded some engagement. When he spoke of going to a charity entertainment, or a private view, or a first-night at which she was to be present, she would expostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public, that he was treating her like a woman off the streets. Things came to such a pitch that, in an effort to save himself from being altogether forbidden to meet her anywhere, Swann, remembering that she knew and was deeply attached to my great-uncle Adolphe, whose friend he himself also had been, went one day to see him in his little flat in the Rue de Bellechasse, to ask him to use his influence with Odette. As it happened, she invariably adopted, when she spoke to Swann about my uncle, a poetical tone, saying: \"Ah, he! He is not in the least like you; it is an exquisite thing, a great, a beautiful thing, his friendship for me. He's not the sort of man who would have so little consideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in public.\" This was embarrassing for Swann, who did not know quite to what rhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of Odette to my uncle. He began by alluding to her excellence, a priori, the axiom of her seraphic super-humanity, the revelation of her inexpressible virtues, no conception of which could possibly be formed. \"I should like to speak to you about her,\" he went on, \"you, who know what a woman supreme above all women, what an adorable being, what an angel Odette is. But you know, also, what life is in Paris. Everyone doesn't see Odette in the light in which you and I have been Privileged to see her. And so there are people who think that I am behaving rather foolishly; she won't even allow me to meet her out of doors, at the theatre. Now you, in whom she has such enormous confidence, couldn't you say a few words for me to her, just to assure her that she exaggerate the harm which my bowing to her in the street might do her?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My uncle advised Swann not to see Odette for some days, after which she would love him all the more; he advised Odette to let Swann meet her everywhere, and as often as he pleased. A few days later Odette told Swann that she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that my uncle was the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault. She calmed Swann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my uncle to a duel, but he refused to shake hands with him when they met again. He regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped, if he had met my uncle Adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk things over with him in strict confidence, to be able to get him to throw a light on certain rumours with regard to the life that Odette had led, in the old days, at Nice. For my uncle Adolphe used to spend the winter there, and Swann thought that it might indeed have been there, perhaps, that he had first known Odette. The few words which some one had let fall, in his hearing, about a man who, it appeared, had been Odette's lover, had left Swann dumbfounded. But the very things which he would, before knowing them, have regarded as the most terrible to learn and the most impossible to believe, were, once he knew them, incorporated for all time in the general mass of his sorrow; he admitted them, he could no longer have understood their not existing. Only, each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line, altering the picture that he had formed of his mistress. At one time indeed he felt that he could understand that this moral 'lightness,' of which he would never have suspected Odette, was perfectly well known, and that at Baden or Nice, when she had gone, in the past, to spend several months in one or the other place, she had enjoyed a sort of amorous notoriety. He attempted, in order to question them, to get into touch again with certain men of that stamp; but these were aware that he knew Odette, and, besides, he was afraid of putting the thought of her into their heads, of setting them once more upon her track. But he, to whom, up till then, nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that pertained to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or of Nice, now that he learned that Odette had, perhaps, led a 'gay' life once in those pleasure-cities, although he could never find out whether it had been solely to satisfy a want of money which, thanks to himself, she no longer felt, or from some capricious instinct which might, at any moment, revive in her, he would lean, in impotent anguish, blinded and dizzy, over the bottomless abyss into which had passed, in which had been engulfed those years of his own, early in MacMahon's Septennat, in which one spent the winter on the Promenade des Anglais, the summer beneath the limes of Baden, and would find in those years a sad but splendid profundity, such as a poet might have lent to them; and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant details that made up the daily round on the C\u00f4te d'Azur in those days, if it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled him in the smile or in the eyes of Odette, more enthusiasm than does the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenth-century Florence, so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the Primavera, the fair Vanna or the Venus of Botticelli. He would sit, often, without saying a word to her, only gazing at her and dreaming; and she would comment: \"You do look sad!\" It was not very long since, from the idea that she was an excellent creature, comparable to the best women that he had known, he had passed to that of her being 'kept'; and yet already, by an inverse process, he had returned from the Odette de Cr\u00e9cy, perhaps too well known to the holiday-makers, to the 'ladies' men' of Nice and Baden, to this face, the expression on which was so often gentle, to this nature so eminently human. He would ask himself: \"What does it mean, after all, to say that everyone at Nice knows who Odette de Cr\u00e9cy is? Reputations of that sort, even when they're true, are always based upon other people's ideas\"; he would reflect that this legend\u2014even if it were authentic\u2014was something external to Odette, was not inherent in her like a mischievous and ineradicable personality; that the creature who might have been led astray was a woman with frank eyes, a heart full of pity for the sufferings of others, a docile body which he had pressed tightly in his arms and explored with his fingers, a woman of whom he might one day come into absolute possession if he succeeded in making himself indispensable to her. There she was, often tired, her face left blank for the nonce by that eager, feverish preoccupation with the unknown things which made Swann suffer; she would push back her hair with both hands; her forehead, her whole face would seem to grow larger; then, suddenly, some ordinary human thought, some worthy sentiment such as is to be found in all creatures when, in a moment of rest or meditation, they are free to express themselves, would flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold. And immediately the whole of her face would light up like a grey landscape, swathed in clouds which, suddenly, are swept away and the dull scene transfigured, at the moment of the sun's setting. The life which occupied Odette at such times, even the future which she seemed to be dreamily regarding, Swann could have shared with her. No evil disturbance seemed to have left any effect on them. Rare as they became, those moments did not occur in vain. By the process of memory, Swann joined the fragments together, abolished the intervals between them, cast, as in molten gold, the image of an Odette compact of kindness and tranquillity, for whom he was to make, later on (as we shall see in the second part of this story) sacrifices which the other Odette would never have won from him. But how rare those moments were, and how seldom he now saw her! Even in regard to their evening meetings, she would never tell him until the last minute whether she would be able to see him, for, reckoning on his being always free, she wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come to her. She would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which was of the very greatest importance, and if, even after she had made Swann come to her house, any of her friends asked her, half-way through the evening, to join them at some theatre, or at supper afterwards, she would jump for joy and dress herself with all speed. As her toilet progressed, every movement that she made brought Swann nearer to the moment when he would have to part from her, when she would fly off with irresistible force; and when at length she was ready, and, Plunging into her mirror a last glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look well, smeared a little salve on her lips, fixed a stray loci of hair over her brow, and called for her cloak of sky-blue silk with golden tassels, Swann would be looking so wretched that she would be unable to restrain a gesture of impatience as she flung at him: \"So that is how you thank me for keeping you here till the last minute! And I thought I was being so nice to you. Well, I shall know better another time!\" Sometime... at the risk of annoying her, he made up his mind that he would find out where she had gone, and even dreamed of a defensive alliance with Forcheville, who might perhaps have been able to tell him. But anyhow, when he knew with whom she was spending the evening, it was very seldom that he could not discover, among all his innumerable acquaintance, some one who knew\u2014if only indirectly\u2014the man with whom she had gone out, and could easily obtain this or that piece of information about him. And while he was writing to one of his friends, asking him to try to get a little light thrown upon some point or other, he would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex himself with questions to which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the strain of interrogation. It is true that Swann was little the wiser for such information as he did receive. To know a thing does not enable us, always, to prevent its happening, but after all the things that we know we do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our minds, where we can dispose of them as we choose, which gives us the illusion of a sort of power to control them. He was quite happy whenever M. de Charlus was with Odette. He knew that between M. de Charlus and her nothing untoward could ever happen, that when M. de Charlus went anywhere with her, it was out of friendship for himself, and that he would make no difficulty about telling him everything that she had done. Sometimes she had declared so emphatically to Swann that it was impossible for him to see her on a particular evening, she seemed to be looking forward so keenly to some outing, that Swann attached a very real importance to the fact that M. de Charlus was free to accompany her. Next day, without daring to put many questions to M. de Charlus, he would force him, by appearing not quite to understand his first answers, to give him more, after each of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved, for he very soon learned that Odette had spent her evening in the most innocent of dissipations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But what do you mean, my dear M\u00e9m\u00e9, I don't quite understand.... You didn't go straight from her house to the Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin? Surely you went somewhere else first? No? That is very odd! You don't know how amusing you are, my dear M\u00e9m\u00e9. But what an odd idea of hers to go on to the Chat Noir afterwards; it was her idea, I suppose? No? Yours? That's strange. After all, it wasn't a bad idea; she must have known dozens of people there? No? She never spoke to a soul? How extraordinary! Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves? I can picture you, sitting there! You are a worthy fellow, my dear M\u00e9m\u00e9; I'm exceedingly fond of you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was now quite at ease. To him, who had so often happened, when talking to friends who knew nothing of his love, friends to whom he hardly listened, to hear certain detached sentences (as, for instance, \"I saw Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy yesterday; she was with a man I didn't know.\"), sentences which dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid state, grew hard as stalagmites, and seared and tore him as they lay there irremovable,\u2014how charming, by way of contrast, were the words: \"She didn't know a soul; she never spoke to a soul.\" How freely they coursed through him, how fluid they were, how vaporous, how easy to breathe! And yet, a moment later, he was telling himself that Odette must find him very dull if those were the pleasures that she preferred to his company. And their very insignificance, though it reassured him, pained him as if her enjoyment of them had been an act of treachery\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even when he could not discover where she had gone, it would have sufficed to alleviate the anguish that he then felt, for which Odette's presence, the charm of her company, was the sole specific (a specific which in the long run served, like many other remedies, to aggravate the disease, but at least brought temporary relief to his sufferings), it would have sufficed, had Odette only permitted him to remain in her house while she was out, to wait there until that hour of her return, into whose stillness and peace would flow, to be mingled and lost there, all memory of those intervening hours which some sorcery, some cursed spell had made him imagine as, somehow, different from the rest. But she would not; he must return home; he forced himself, on the way, to form various plans, ceased to think of Odette; he even reached the stage, while he undressed, of turning over all sorts of happy ideas in his mind: it was with a light heart, buoyed with the anticipation of going to see some favourite work of art on the morrow, that he jumped into bed and turned out the light; but no sooner had he made himself ready to sleep, relaxing a self-control of which he was not even conscious, so habitual had it become, than an icy shudder convulsed his body and he burst into sobs. He did not wish to know why, but dried his eyes, saying with a smile: \"This is delightful; I'm becoming neurasthenic.\" After which he could not save himself from utter exhaustion at the thought that, next day, he must begin afresh his attempt to find out what Odette had been doing, must use all his influence to contrive to see her. This compulsion to an activity without respite, without variety, without result, was so cruel a scourge that one day, noticing a swelling over his stomach, he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had, perhaps, a tumour which would prove fatal, that he need not concern himself with anything further, that it was his malady which was going to govern his life, to make a plaything of him, until the not-distant end. If indeed, at this period, it often happened that, though without admitting it even to himself, he longed for death, it was in order to escape not so much from the keenness of his sufferings as from the monotony of his struggle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet he would have wished to live until the time came when he no longer loved her, when she would have no reason for lying to him, when at length he might learn from her whether, on the day when he had gone to see her in the afternoon, she had or had not been in the arms of Forcheville. Often for several days on end the suspicion that she was in love with some one else would distract his mind from the question of Forcheville, making it almost immaterial to him, like those new developments of a continuous state of ill-health which seem for a little time to have delivered us from their predecessors. There were even days when he was not tormented by any suspicion. He fancied that he was cured. But next morning, when he awoke, he felt in the same place the same pain, a sensation which, the day before, he had, as it were, diluted in the torrent of different impressions. But it had not stirred from its place. Indeed, it was the sharpness of this pain that had awakened him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important matters which took up so much of her time every day (albeit he had lived long enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything else than pleasures) he could not sustain for any length of time the effort to imagine them; his brain would become a void; then he would pass a finger over his tired eyelids, in the same way as he might have wiped his eyeglass, and would cease altogether to think. There emerged, however, from this unexplored tract, certain occupations which reappeared from time to time, vaguely connected by Odette with some obligation towards distant relatives or old friends who, inasmuch as they were the only people whom she was in the habit of mentioning as preventing her from seeing him, seemed to Swann to compose the necessary, unalterable setting of her life. Because of the tone in which she referred, from time to time, to \"the day when I go with my friend to the Hippodrome,\" if, when he felt unwell and had thought, \"Perhaps Odette would be kind and come to see me,\" he remembered, suddenly, that it was one of those very days, he would correct himself with an \"Oh, no! It's not worth while asking her to come; I should have thought of it before, this is the day when she goes with her friend to the Hippodrome. We must confine ourselves to what is possible; no use wasting our time in proposing things that can't be accepted and are declined in advance.\" And this duty that was incumbent upon Odette, of going to the Hippodrome, to which Swann thus gave way, seemed to him to be not merely ineluctable in itself; but the mark of necessity which stamped it seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even remotely connected with it. If, when Odette, in the street, had acknowledged the salute of a passer-by, which had aroused Swann's jealousy, she replied to his questions by associating the stranger with any of the two or three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to him; if, for instance, she said: \"That's a gentleman who was in my friend's box the other day; the one I go to the Hippodrome with,\" that explanation would set Swann's suspicions at rest; it was, after all, inevitable that this friend should have other guests than Odette in her box at the Hippodrome, but he had never sought to form or succeeded in forming any coherent impression of them. Oh! how he would have loved to know her, that friend who went to the Hippodrome, how he would have loved her to invite him there with Odette. How readily he would have sacrificed all his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of seeing Odette, were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop. He would have taken more trouble, incurred more expense for them than for queens. Would they not have supplied him, out of what was contained in their knowledge of the life of Odette, with the one potent anodyne for his pain? With what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with one or other of those humble folk with whom Odette kept up friendly relations, either with some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity of nature. How willingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the attics of some sordid but enviable house, where Odette went but never took him, and where, if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker, whose lover he would readily have pretended to be, he would have been visited by Odette almost daily. In those regions, that were almost slums, what a modest existence, abject, if you please, but delightful, nourished by tranquillity and happiness, he would have consented to lead indefinitely\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It sometimes happened, again, that, when, after meeting Swann, she saw some man approaching whom he did not know, he could distinguish upon Odette's face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he had come to her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for, on the days when, in spite of all that she had to do, and of her dread of what people would think, she did actually manage to see Swann, the predominant quality in her attitude, now, was self-assurance; a striking contrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge for, perhaps a natural reaction from the timorous emotion which, in the early days of their friendship, she had felt in his presence, and even in his absence, when she began a letter to him with the words: \"My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write.\" (So, at least, she pretended, and a little of that emotion must have been sincere, or she would not have been anxious to enlarge and emphasise it.) So Swann had been pleasing to her then. Our hands do not tremble except for ourselves, or for those whom we love. When they have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful, how easy, how bold do we become in their presence! In speaking to him, in writing to him now, she no longer employed those words by which she had sought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her, creating opportunities for saying \"my\" and \"mine\" when she referred to him: \"You are all that I have in the world; it is the perfume of our friendship, I shall keep it,\" nor spoke to him of the future, of death itself, as of a single adventure which they would have to share. In those early days, whatever he might say to her, she would answer admiringly: \"You know, you will never be like other people!\"\u2014she would gaze at his long, slightly bald head, of which people who know only of his successes used to think: \"He's not regularly good-looking, if you like, but he is smart; that tuft, that eyeglass, that smile!\" and, with more curiosity perhaps to know him as he really was than desire to become his mistress, she would sigh:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I do wish I could find out what there is in that head of yours!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, now, whatever he might say, she would answer, in a tone sometimes of irritation, sometimes indulgent: \"Ah! so you never will be like other people!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She would gaze at his head, which was hardly aged at all by his recent anxieties (though people now thought of it, by the same mental process which enables one to discover the meaning of a piece of symphonic music of which one has read the programme, or the 'likenesses' in a child whose family one has known: \"He's not positively ugly, if you like, but he is really rather absurd; that eyeglass, that tuft, that smile!\" realising in their imagination, fed by suggestion, the invisible boundary which divides, at a few months' interval, the head of an ardent lover from a cuckold's), and would say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I do wish I could change you; put some sense into that head of yours.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Always ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped, if it was only Odette's way of behaving to him that left room for doubt, he would fling himself greedily upon her words: \"You can if you like,\" he would tell her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he tried to explain to her that to comfort him, to control him, to make him work would be a noble task, to which numbers of other women asked for nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves, though it is only fair to add that in those other women's hands the noble task would have seemed to Swann nothing more than an indiscreet and intolerable usurpation of his freedom of action. \"If she didn't love me, just a little,\" he told himself, \"she would not wish to have me altered. To alter me, she will have to see me more often.\" And so he was able to trace, in these faults which she found in him, a proof at least of her interest, perhaps even of her love; and, in fact, she gave him so little, now, of the last, that he was obliged to regard as proofs of her interest in him the various things which, every now and then, she forbade him to do. One day she announced that she did not care for his coachman, who, she thought, was perhaps setting Swann against her, and, anyhow, did not shew that promptness and deference to Swann's orders which she would have liked to see. She felt that he wanted to hear her say: \"Don't have him again when you come to me,\" just as he might have wanted her to kiss him. So, being in a good temper, she said it; and he was deeply moved. That evening, when talking to M. de Charlus, with whom he had the satisfaction of being able to speak of her openly (for the most trivial remarks that he uttered now, even to people who had never heard of her, had always some sort of reference to Odette), he said to him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I believe, all the same, that she loves me; she is so nice to me now, and she certainly takes an interest in what I do.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if, when he was starting off for her house, getting into his carriage with a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way, his friend said: \"Hullo! that isn't Loredan on the box?\" with what melancholy joy would Swann answer him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! Good heavens, no! I can tell you, I daren't take Loredan when I go to the Rue La P\u00e9rouse; Odette doesn't like me to have Loredan, she thinks he doesn't suit me. What on earth is one to do? Women, you know, women. My dear fellow, she would be furious. Oh, lord, yes; I've only to take R\u00e9mi there; I should never hear the last of it!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These new manners, indifferent, listless, irritable, which Odette now adopted with Swann, undoubtedly made him suffer; but he did not realise how much he suffered; since it had been with a regular progression, day after day, that Odette had chilled towards him, it was only by directly contrasting what she was to-day with what she had been at first that he could have measured the extent of the change that had taken place. Now this change was his deep, his secret wound, which pained him day and night, and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it, he would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made to suffer too keenly. He might say to himself in a vague way: \"There was a time when Odette loved me more,\" but he never formed any definite picture of that time. Just as he had in his study a cupboard at which he contrived never to look, which he turned aside to avoid passing whenever he entered or left the room, because in one of its drawers he had locked away the chrysanthemum which she had given him on one of those first evenings when he had taken her home in his carriage, and the letters in which she said: \"Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back,\" and \"At whatever hour of the day or night you may need me, just send me a word, and dispose of me as you please,\" so there was a place in his heart to which he would never allow his thoughts to trespass too near, forcing them, if need be, to evade it by a long course of reasoning so that they should not have to pass within reach of it; the place in which lingered his memories of happy days\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone out to a party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was at the Marquise de Saint-Euverte's, on the last, for that season, of the evenings on which she invited people to listen to the musicians who would serve, later on, for her charity concerts. Swann, who had intended to go to each of the previous evenings in turn, but had never been able to make up his mind, received, while he was dressing for this party, a visit from the Baron de Charlus, who came with an offer to go with him to the Marquise's, if his company could be of any use in helping Swann not to feel quite so bored when he got there, to be a little less unhappy. But Swann had thanked him with:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You can't conceive how glad I should be of your company. But the greatest pleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead to see Odette. You know what a splendid influence you have over her. I don't suppose she'll be going anywhere this evening, unless she goes to see her old dressmaker, and I'm sure she would be delighted if you went with her there. In any case, you'll find her at home before then. Try to keep her amused, and also to give her a little sound advice. If you could arrange something for to-morrow which would please her, something that we could all three do together. Try to put out a feeler, too, for the summer; see if there's anything she wants to do, a cruise that we might all three take; anything you can think of. I don't count upon seeing her to-night, myself; still if she would like me to come, or if you find a loophole, you've only to send me a line at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's up till midnight; after that I shall be here. Ever so many thanks for all you are doing for me\u2014you know what I feel about you!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His friend promised to go and do as Swann wished as soon as he had deposited him at the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where he arrived soothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to everything that did not involve Odette, and in particular to the details of fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is to be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire, appears to us in its own guise. On alighting from his carriage, in the foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which hostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions, and in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and setting, Swann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of Balzac's 'tigers'\u2014now 'grooms'\u2014. who normally followed their mistress when she walked abroad, but now, hatted and booted, were posted out of doors, in front of the house on the gravelled drive, or outside the stables, as gardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of their several flower-beds. The peculiar tendency which he had always had to look for analogies between living people and the portraits in galleries reasserted itself here, but in a more positive and more general form; it was society as a whole, now that he was detached from it, which presented itself to him in a series of pictures. In the cloak-room, into which, in the old days, when he was still a man of fashion, he would have gone in his overcoat, to emerge from it in evening dress, but without any impression of what had occurred there, his mind having been, during the minute or two that he had spent in it, either still at the party which he had just left, or already at the party into which he was just about to be ushered, he now noticed, for the first time, roused by the unexpected arrival of so belated a guest, the scattered pack of splendid effortless animals, the enormous footmen who were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests, until, pointing their noble greyhound profiles, they towered upon their feet and gathered in a circle round about him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of them, of a particularly ferocious aspect, and not unlike the headsman in certain Renaissance pictures which represent executions, tortures, and the like, advanced upon him with an implacable air to take his 'things.' But the harshness of his steely glare was compensated by the softness of his cotton gloves, so effectively that, as he approached Swann, he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his person and the most tender regard for his hat. He took it with a care to which the precision of his movements imparted something that was almost over-fastidious, and with a delicacy that was rendered almost touching by the evidence of his splendid strength. Then he passed it to one of his satellites, a novice and timid, who was expressing the panic that overpowered him by casting furious glances in every direction, and displayed all the dumb agitation of a wild animal in the first hours of its captivity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few feet away, a strapping great lad in livery stood musing, motionless, statuesque, useless, like that purely decorative warrior whom one sees in the most tumultuous of Mantegna's paintings, lost in dreams, leaning upon his shield, while all around him are fighting and bloodshed and death; detached from the group of his companions who were thronging about Swann, he seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in the scene, which he followed vaguely with his cruel, greenish eyes, as if it had been the Massacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint James. He seemed precisely to have sprung from that vanished race\u2014if, indeed, it ever existed, save in the reredos of San Zeno and the frescoes of the Eremitani, where Swann had come in contact with it, and where it still dreams\u2014fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue by some one of the Master's Paduan models, or of Albert Duerer's Saxons. And the locks of his reddish hair, crinkled by nature, but glued to his head by brilliantine, were treated broadly as they are in that Greek sculpture which the Mantuan painter never ceased to study, and which, if in its creator's purpose it represents but man, manages at least to extract from man's simple outlines such a variety of richness, borrowed, as it were, from the whole of animated nature, that a head of hair, by the glossy undulation and beak-like points of its curls, or in the overlaying of the florid triple diadem of its brushed tresses, can suggest at once a bunch of seaweed, a brood of fledgling doves, a bed of hyacinths and a serpent's writhing back. Others again, no less colossal, were disposed upon the steps of a monumental staircase which, by their decorative presence and marmorean immobility, was made worthy to be named, like that god-crowned ascent in the Palace of the Doges, the 'Staircase of the Giants,' and on which Swann now set foot, saddened by the thought that Odette had never climbed it. Ah, with what joy would he, on the other hand, have raced up the dark, evil-smelling, breakneck flights to the little dressmaker's, in whose attic he would so gladly have paid the price of a weekly stage-box at the Opera for the right to spend the evening there when Odette came, and other days too, for the privilege of talking about her, of living among people whom she was in the habit of seeing when he was not there, and who, on that account, seemed to keep secret among themselves some part of the life of his mistress more real, more inaccessible and more mysterious than anything that he knew. Whereas upon that pestilential, enviable staircase to the old dressmaker's, since there was no other, no service stair in the building, one saw in the evening outside every door an empty, unwashed milk-can set out, in readiness for the morning round, upon the door-mat; on the despicable, enormous staircase which Swann was at that moment climbing, on either side of him, at different levels, before each anfractuosity made in its walls by the window of the porter's lodge or the entrance to a set of rooms, representing the departments of indoor service which they controlled, and doing homage for them to the guests, a gate-keeper, a major-domo, a steward (worthy men who spent the rest of the week in semi-independence in their own domains, dined there by themselves like small shopkeepers, and might to-morrow lapse to the plebeian service of some successful doctor or industrial magnate), scrupulous in carrying out to the letter all the instructions that had been heaped upon them before they were allowed to don the brilliant livery which they wore only at long intervals, and in which they did not feel altogether at their ease, stood each in the arcade of his doorway, their splendid pomp tempered by a democratic good-fellowship, like saints in their niches, and a gigantic usher, dressed Swiss Guard fashion, like the beadle in a church, struck the pavement with his staff as each fresh arrival passed him. Coming to the top of the staircase, up which he had been followed by a servant with a pallid countenance and a small pigtail clubbed at the back of his head, like one of Goya's sacristans or a tabellion in an old play, Swann passed by an office in which the lackeys, seated like notaries before their massive registers, rose solemnly to their feet and inscribed his name. He next crossed a little hall which\u2014just as certain rooms are arranged by their owners to serve as the setting for a single work of art (from which they take their name), and, in their studied bareness, contain nothing else besides\u2014displayed to him as he entered it, like some priceless effigy by Benvenuto Cellini of an armed watchman, a young footman, his body slightly bent forward, rearing above his crimson gorget an even more crimson face, from which seemed to burst forth torrents of fire, timidity and zeal, who, as he pierced the Aubusson tapestries that screened the door of the room in which the music was being given with his impetuous, vigilant, desperate gaze, appeared, with a soldierly impassibility or a supernatural faith\u2014an allegory of alarums, incarnation of alertness, commemoration of a riot\u2014to be looking out, angel or sentinel, from the tower of dungeon or cathedral, for the approach of the enemy or for the hour of Judgment. Swann had now only to enter the concert-room, the doors of which were thrown open to him by an usher loaded with chains, who bowed low before him as though tendering to him the keys of a conquered city. But he thought of the house in which at that very moment he might have been, if Odette had but permitted, and the remembered glimpse of an empty milk-can upon a door-mat wrung his heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male when, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of the servants gave place to that of the guests. But even this ugliness of faces, which of course were mostly familiar to him, seemed something new and uncanny, now that their features,\u2014instead of being to him symbols of practical utility in the identification of this or that man, who until then had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after, boredoms to be avoided, or courtesies to be acknowledged\u2014were at rest, measurable by aesthetic co-ordinates alone, in the autonomy of their curves and angles. And in these men, in the thick of whom Swann now found himself packed, there was nothing (even to the monocle which many of them wore, and which, previously, would, at the most, have enabled Swann to say that so-and-so wore a monocle) which, no longer restricted to the general connotation of a habit, the same in all of them, did not now strike him with a sense of individuality in each. Perhaps because he did not regard General de Froberville and the Marquis de Br\u00e9aute, who were talking together just inside the door, as anything more than two figures in a picture, whereas they were the old and useful friends who had put him up for the Jockey Club and had supported him in duels, the General's monocle, stuck like a shell-splinter in his common, scarred, victorious, overbearing face, in the middle of a forehead which it left half-blinded, like the single-eyed flashing front of the Cyclops, appeared to Swann as a monstrous wound which it might have been glorious to receive but which it was certainly not decent to expose, while that which M. de Br\u00e9aute wore, as a festive badge, with his pearl-grey gloves, his crush hat and white tie, substituting it for the familiar pair of glasses (as Swann himself did) when he went out to places, bore, glued to its other side, like a specimen prepared on a slide for the microscope, an infinitesimal gaze that swarmed with friendly feeling and never ceased to twinkle at the loftiness of ceilings, the delightfulness of parties, the interestingness of programmes and the excellence of refreshments\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hallo! you here! why, it's ages since I've seen you,\" the General greeted Swann and, noticing the look of strain on his face and concluding that it was perhaps a serious illness that had kept him away, went on, \"You're looking well, old man!\" while M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 turned with, \"My dear fellow, what on earth are you doing here?\" to a 'society novelist' who had just fitted into the angle of eyebrow and cheek his own monocle, the sole instrument that he used in his psychological investigations and remorseless analyses of character, and who now replied, with an air of mystery and importance, rolling the 'r':\u2014\"I am observing!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Marquis de Forestelle's monocle was minute and rimless, and, by enforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it was incrusted like a superfluous cartilage, the presence of which there was inexplicable and its substance unimaginable, it gave to his face a melancholy refinement, and led women to suppose him capable of suffering terribly when in love. But that of M. de Saint-Cand\u00e9, girdled, like Saturn, with an enormous ring, was the centre of gravity of a face which composed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass, while his thrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their grimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled in the polished disk, and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing eyes in the world by the smart, depraved young women whom it set dreaming of artificial charms and a refinement of sensual bliss; and then, behind him, M. de Palancy, who with his huge carp's head and goggling eyes moved slowly up and down the stream of festive gatherings, unlocking his great mandibles at every moment as though in search of his orientation, had the air of carrying about upon his person only an accidental and perhaps purely symbolical fragment of the glass wall of his aquarium, a part intended to suggest the whole which recalled to Swann, a fervent admirer of Giotto's Vices and Virtues at Padua, that Injustice by whose side a leafy bough evokes the idea of the forests that enshroud his secret lair\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann had gone forward into the room, under pressure from Mme. de Saint-Euverte and in order to listen to an aria from Orfeo which was being rendered on the flute, and had taken up a position in a corner from which, unfortunately, his horizon was bounded by two ladies of 'uncertain' age, seated side by side, the Marquise de Cambremer and the Vicomtesse de Franquetot, who, because they were cousins, used to spend their time at parties in wandering through the rooms, each clutching her bag and followed by her daughter, hunting for one another like people at a railway station, and could never be at rest until they had reserved, by marking them with their fans or handkerchiefs, two adjacent chairs; Mme. de Cambremer, since she knew scarcely anyone, being all the more glad of a companion, while Mme. de Franquetot, who, on the contrary, was extremely popular, thought it effective and original to shew all her fine friends that she preferred to their company that of an obscure country cousin with whom she had childish memories in common. Filled with ironical melancholy, Swann watched them as they listened to the pianoforte intermezzo (Liszt's 'Saint Francis preaching to the birds') which came after the flute, and followed the virtuoso in his dizzy flight; Mme. de Franquetot anxiously, her eyes starting from her head, as though the keys over which his fingers skipped with such agility were a series of trapezes, from any one of which he might come crashing, a hundred feet, to the ground, stealing now and then a glance of astonishment and unbelief at her companion, as who should say: \"It isn't possible, I would never have believed that a human being could do all that!\"; Mme. de Cambremer, as a woman who had received a sound musical education, beating time with her head\u2014transformed for the nonce into the pendulum of a metronome, the sweep and rapidity of whose movements from one shoulder to the other (performed with that look of wild abandonment in her eye which a sufferer shews who is no longer able to analyse his pain, nor anxious to master it, and says merely \"I can't help it\") so increased that at every moment her diamond earrings caught in the trimming of her bodice, and she was obliged to put straight the bunch of black grapes which she had in her hair, though without any interruption of her constantly accelerated motion. On the other side (and a little way in front) of Mme. de Franquetot, was the Marquise de Gallardon, absorbed in her favourite meditation, namely upon her own kinship with the Guermantes family, from which she derived both publicly and in private a good deal of glory not unmingled with shame, the most brilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her, perhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman, or because she was a scandalous old woman, or because she came of an inferior branch of the family, or very possibly for no reason at all. When she found herself seated next to some one whom she did not know, as she was at this moment next to Mme. de Franquetot, she suffered acutely from the feeling that her own consciousness of her Guermantes connection could not be made externally manifest in visible character like those which, in the mosaics in Byzantine churches, placed one beneath another, inscribe in a vertical column by the side of some Sacred Personage the words which he is supposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact that she had never received an invitation, or even call, from her young cousin the Princesse des Laumes, during the six years that had already elapsed since the latter's marriage. The thought filled her with anger\u2014and with pride; for, by virtue of having told everyone who expressed surprise at never seeing her at Mme. des Laumes's, that it was because of the risk of meeting the Princesse Mathilde there\u2014a degradation which her own family, the truest and bluest of Legitimists, would never have forgiven her, she had come gradually to believe that this actually was the reason for her not visiting her young cousin. She remembered, it is true, that she had several times inquired of Mme. des Laumes how they might contrive to meet, but she remembered it only in a confused way, and besides did more than neutralise this slightly humiliating reminiscence by murmuring, \"After all, it isn't for me to take the first step; I am at least twenty years older than she is.\" And fortified by these unspoken words she flung her shoulders proudly back until they seemed to part company with her bust, while her head, which lay almost horizontally upon them, made one think of the 'stuck-on' head of a pheasant which is brought to the table regally adorned with its feathers. Not that she in the least degree resembled a pheasant, having been endowed by nature with a short and squat and masculine figure; but successive mortifications had given her a backward tilt, such as one may observe in trees which have taken root on the very edge of a precipice and are forced to grow backwards to preserve their balance. Since she was obliged, in order to console herself for not being quite on a level with the rest of the Guermantes, to repeat to herself incessantly that it was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her principles and pride that she saw so little of them, the constant iteration had gradually remoulded her body, and had given her a sort of 'bearing' which was accepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding, and even kindled, at times, a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old gentlemen in clubs. Had anyone subjected Mme. de Gallardon's conversation to that form of analysis which by noting the relative frequency of its several terms would furnish him with the key to a ciphered message, he would at once have remarked that no expression, not even the commonest forms of speech, occurred in it nearly so often as \"at my cousins the Guermantes's,\" \"at my aunt Guermantes's,\" \"Elz\u00e9ar de Guermantes's health,\" \"my cousin Guermantes's box.\" If anyone spoke to her of a distinguished personage, she would reply that, although she was not personally acquainted with him, she had seen him hundreds of times at her aunt Guermantes's, but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone, with such a hollow sound, that it was at once quite clear that if she did not know the celebrity personally that was because of all the obstinate, ineradicable principles against which her arching shoulders were stretched back to rest, as on one of those ladders on which gymnastic instructors make us 'extend' so as to develop the expansion of our chests\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this moment the Princesse des Laumes, who had not been expected to appear at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that evening, did in fact arrive. To shew that she did not wish any special attention, in a house to which she had come by an act of condescension, to be paid to her superior rank, she had entered the room with her arms pressed close to her sides, even when there was no crowd to be squeezed through, no one attempting to get past her; staying purposely at the back, with the air of being in her proper place, like a king who stands in the waiting procession at the doors of a theatre where the management have not been warned of his coming; and strictly limiting her field of vision\u2014so as not to seem to be advertising her presence and claiming the consideration that was her due\u2014to the study of a pattern in the carpet or of her own skirt, she stood there on the spot which had struck her as the most modest (and from which, as she very well knew, a cry of rapture from Mme. de Saint-Euverte would extricate her as soon as her presence there was noticed), next to Mme. de Cambremer, whom, however, she did not know. She observed the dumb-show by which her neighbour was expressing her passion for music, but she refrained from copying it. This was not to say that, for once that she had consented to spend a few minutes in Mme. de Saint-Euverte's house, the Princesse des Laumes would not have wished (so that the act of politeness to her hostess which she had performed by coming might, so to speak, 'count double') to shew herself as friendly and obliging as possible. But she had a natural horror of what she called 'exaggerating,' and always made a point of letting people see that she 'simply must not' indulge in any display of emotion that was not in keeping with the tone of the circle in which she moved, although such displays never failed to make an impression upon her, by virtue of that spirit of imitation, akin to timidity, which is developed in the most self-confident persons, by contact with an unfamiliar environment, even though it be inferior to their own. She began to ask herself whether these gesticulations might not, perhaps, be a necessary concomitant of the piece of music that was being played, a piece which, it might be, was in a different category from all the music that she had ever heard before; and whether to abstain from them was not a sign of her own inability to understand the music, and of discourtesy towards the lady of the house; with the result that, in order to express by a compromise both of her contradictory inclinations in turn, at one moment she would merely straighten her shoulder-straps or feel in her golden hair for the little balls of coral or of pink enamel, frosted with tiny diamonds, which formed its simple but effective ornament, studying, with a cold interest, her impassioned neighbour, while at another she would beat time for a few bars with her fan, but, so as not to forfeit her independence, she would beat a different time from the pianist's. When he had finished the Liszt Intermezzo and had begun a Prelude by Chopin, Mme. de Cambremer turned to Mme. de Franquetot with a tender smile, full of intimate reminiscence, as well as of satisfaction (that of a competent judge) with the performance. She had been taught in her girlhood to fondle and cherish those long-necked, sinuous creatures, the phrases of Chopin, so free, so flexible, so tactile, which begin by seeking their ultimate resting-place somewhere beyond and far wide of the direction in which they started, the point which one might have expected them to reach, phrases which divert themselves in those fantastic bypaths only to return more deliberately\u2014with a more premeditated reaction, with more precision, as on a crystal bowl which, if you strike it, will ring and throb until you cry aloud in anguish\u2014to clutch at one's heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Brought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors, hardly ever invited to a ball, she had fuddled her mind, in the solitude of her old manor-house, over setting the pace, now crawling-slow, now passionate, whirling, breathless, for all those imaginary waltzing couples, gathering them like flowers, leaving the ball-room for a moment to listen, where the wind sighed among the pine-trees, on the shore of the lake, and seeing of a sudden advancing towards her, more different from anything one had ever dreamed of than earthly lovers are, a slender young man, whose voice was resonant and strange and false, in white gloves. But nowadays the old-fashioned beauty of this music seemed to have become a trifle stale. Having forfeited, some years back, the esteem of 'really musical' people, it had lost its distinction and its charm, and even those whose taste was frankly bad had ceased to find in it more than a moderate pleasure to which they hardly liked to confess. Mme. de Cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her. She knew that her young daughter-in-law (full of respect for her new and noble family, except in such matters as related to the intellect, upon which, having 'got as far' as Harmony and the Greek alphabet, she was specially enlightened) despised Chopin, and fell quite ill when she heard him played. But finding herself free from the scrutiny of this Wagnerian, who was sitting, at some distance, in a group of her own contemporaries, Mme. de Cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of exquisite memories and sensations. The Princesse des Laumes was touched also. Though without any natural gift for music, she had received, some fifteen years earlier, the instruction which a music-mistress of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who had been, towards the end of her life, reduced to penury, had started, at seventy, to give to the daughters and granddaughters of her old pupils. This lady was now dead. But her method, an echo of her charming touch, came to life now and then in the fingers of her pupils, even of those who had been in other respects quite mediocre, had given up music, and hardly ever opened a piano. And so Mme. des Laumes could let her head sway to and fro, fully aware of the cause, with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which the pianist was rendering this Prelude, since she knew it by heart. The closing notes of the phrase that he had begun sounded already on her lips. And she murmured \"How charming it is!\" with a stress on the opening consonants of the adjective, a token of her refinement by which she felt her lips so romantically compressed, like the petals of a beautiful, budding flower, that she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony, illuminating them for a moment with a vague and sentimental gaze. Meanwhile Mme. de Gallardon had arrived at the point of saying to herself how annoying it was that she had so few opportunities of meeting the Princesse des Laumes, for she meant to teach her a lesson by not acknowledging her bow. She did not know that her cousin was in the room. A movement of Mme. Franquetot's head disclosed the Princess. At once Mme. de Gallardon dashed towards her, upsetting all her neighbours; although determined to preserve a distant and glacial manner which should remind everyone present that she had no desire to remain on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself, any day, cheek by jowl with the Princesse Mathilde, and to whom it was not her duty to make advances since she was not 'of her generation,' she felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by some non-committal remark which would justify her overture and would force the Princess to engage in conversation; and so, when she reached her cousin, Mme. de Gallardon, with a stern countenance and one hand thrust out as though she were trying to 'force' a card, began with: \"How is your husband?\" in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the Prince had been seriously ill. The Princess, breaking into a laugh which was one of her characteristics, and was intended at once to shew the rest of an assembly that she was making fun of some one and also to enhance her own beauty by concentrating her features around her animated lips and sparkling eyes, answered: \"Why; he's never been better in his life!\" And she went on laughing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Gallardon then drew herself up and, chilling her expression still further, perhaps because she was still uneasy about the Prince's health, said to her cousin:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oriane,\" (at once Mme. des Laumes looked with amused astonishment towards an invisible third, whom she seemed to call to witness that she had never authorised Mme. de Gallardon to use her Christian name) \"I should be so pleased if you would look in, just for a minute, to-morrow evening, to hear a quintet, with the clarinet, by Mozart. I should like to have your opinion of it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She seemed not so much to be issuing an invitation as to be asking favour, and to want the Princess's opinion of the Mozart quintet just though it had been a dish invented by a new cook, whose talent it was most important that an epicure should come to judge\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I know that quintet quite well. I can tell you now\u2014that I adore it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, my husband isn't at all well; it's his liver. He would like so much to see you,\" Mme. de Gallardon resumed, making it now a corporal work of charity for the Princess to appear at her party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Princess never liked to tell people that she would not go to their houses. Every day she would write to express her regret at having been kept away\u2014by the sudden arrival of her husband's mother, by an invitation from his brother, by the Opera, by some excursion to the country\u2014from some party to which she had never for a moment dreamed of going. In this way she gave many people the satisfaction of feeling that she was on intimate terms with them, that she would gladly have come to their houses, and that she had been prevented from doing so only by some princely occurrence which they were flattered to find competing with their own humble entertainment. And then, as she belonged to that witty 'Guermantes set'\u2014in which there survived something of the alert mentality, stripped of all commonplace phrases and conventional sentiments, which dated from M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, and found its final expression in the plays of Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy\u2014she adapted its formula so as to suit even her social engagements, transposed it into the courtesy which was always struggling to be positive and precise, to approximate itself to the plain truth. She would never develop at any length to a hostess the expression of her anxiety to be present at her party; she found it more pleasant to disclose to her all the various little incidents on which it would depend whether it was or was not possible for her to come\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Listen, and I'll explain,\" she began to Mme. de Gallardon. \"To-morrow evening I must go to a friend of mine, who has been pestering me to fix a day for ages. If she takes us to the theatre afterwards, then I can't possibly come to you, much as I should love to; but if we just stay in the house, I know there won't be anyone else there, so I can slip away.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tell me, have you seen your friend M. Swann?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No! my precious Charles! I never knew he was here. Where is he? I must catch his eye.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's a funny thing that he should come to old Saint-Euverte's,\" Mme. de Gallardon went on. \"Oh, I know he's very clever,\" meaning by that 'very cunning,' \"but that makes no difference; fancy a Jew here, and she the sister and sister-in-law of two Archbishops.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am ashamed to confess that I am not in the least shocked,\" said the Princesse des Laumes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know he's a converted Jew, and all that, and his parents and grandparents before him. But they do say that the converted ones are worse about their religion than the practising ones, that it's all just a pretence; is that true, d'you think?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I can throw no light at all on the matter.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The pianist, who was 'down' to play two pieces by Chopin, after finishing the Prelude had at once attacked a Polonaise. But once Mme. de Gallardon had informed her cousin that Swann was in the room, Chopin himself might have risen from the grave and played all his works in turn without Mme. des Laumes's paying him the slightest attention. She belonged to that one of the two divisions of the human race in which the untiring curiosity which the other half feels about the people whom it does not know is replaced by an unfailing interest in the people whom it does. As with many women of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence, in any room in which she might find herself, of another member of her set, even although she had nothing in particular to say to him, would occupy her mind to the exclusion of every other consideration. From that moment, in the hope that Swann would catch sight of her, the Princess could do nothing but (like a tame white mouse when a lump of sugar is put down before its nose and then taken away) turn her face, in which were crowded a thousand signs of intimate connivance, none of them with the least relevance to the sentiment underlying Chopin's music, in the direction where Swann was, and, if he moved, divert accordingly the course of her magnetic smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oriane, don't be angry with me,\" resumed Mme. de Gallardon, who could never restrain herself from sacrificing her highest social ambitions, and the hope that she might one day emerge into a light that would dazzle the world, to the immediate and secret satisfaction of saying something disagreeable, \"people do say about your M. Swann that he's the sort of man one can't have in the house; is that true?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, you, of all people, ought to know that it's true,\" replied the Princesse des Laumes, \"for you must have asked him a hundred times, and he's never been to your house once.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And leaving her cousin mortified afresh, she broke out again into a laugh which scandalised everyone who was trying to listen to the music, but attracted the attention of Mme. de Saint-Euverte, who had stayed, out of politeness, near the piano, and caught sight of the Princess now for the first time. Mme. de Saint-Euverte was all the more delighted to see Mme. des Laumes, as she imagined her to be still at Guermantes, looking after her father-in-law, who was ill\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dear Princess, you here?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I tucked myself away in a corner, and I've been hearing such lovely things.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What, you've been in the room quite a time?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, yes, quite a long time, which seemed very short; it was only long because I couldn't see you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Saint-Euverte offered her own chair to the Princess, who declined it with:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, please, no! Why should you? It doesn't matter in the least where I sit.\" And deliberately picking out, so as the better to display the simplicity of a really great lady, a low seat without a back: \"There now, that hassock, that's all I want. It will make me keep my back straight. Oh! Good heavens, I'm making a noise again; they'll be telling you to have me 'chucked out'.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, the pianist having doubled his speed, the emotion of the music-lovers was reaching its climax, a servant was handing refreshments about on a salver, and was making the spoons rattle, and, as on every other 'party-night', Mme. de Saint-Euverte was making signs to him, which he never saw, to leave the room. A recent bride, who had been told that a young woman ought never to appear bored, was smiling vigorously, trying to catch her hostess's eye so as to flash a token of her gratitude for the other's having 'thought of her' in connection with so delightful an entertainment. And yet, although she remained more calm than Mme. de Franquetot, it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the flying fingers; what alarmed her being not the pianist's fate but the piano's, on which a lighted candle, jumping at each fortissimo, threatened, if not to set its shade on fire, at least to spill wax upon the ebony. At last she could contain herself no longer, and, running up the two steps of the platform on which the piano stood, flung herself on the candle to adjust its sconce. But scarcely had her hand come within reach of it when, on a final chord, the piece finished, and the pianist rose to his feet. Nevertheless the bold initiative shewn by this young woman and the moment of blushing confusion between her and the pianist which resulted from it, produced an impression that was favourable on the whole\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you see what that girl did just now, Princess?\" asked General de Froberville, who had come up to Mme. des Laumes as her hostess left her for a moment. \"Odd, wasn't it? Is she one of the performers?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, she's a little Mme. de Cambremer,\" replied the Princess carelessly, and then, with more animation: \"I am only repeating what I heard just now, myself; I haven't the faintest notion who said it, it was some one behind me who said that they were neighbours of Mme. de Saint-Euverte in the country, but I don't believe anyone knows them, really. They must be 'country cousins'! By the way, I don't know whether you're particularly 'well-up' in the brilliant society which we see before us, because I've no idea who all these astonishing people can be. What do you suppose they do with themselves when they're not at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's parties? She must have ordered them in with the musicians and the chairs and the food. 'Universal providers,' you know. You must admit, they're rather splendid, General. But can she really have the courage to hire the same 'supers' every week? It isn't possible!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but Cambremer is quite a good name; old, too,\" protested the General\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I see no objection to its being old,\" the Princess answered dryly, \"but whatever else it is it's not euphonious,\" she went on, isolating the word euphonious as though between inverted commas, a little affectation to which the Guermantes set were addicted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You think not, eh! She's a regular little peach, though,\" said the General, whose eyes never strayed from Mme. de Cambremer. \"Don't you agree with me, Princess?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She thrusts herself forward too much; I think, in so young a woman, that's not very nice\u2014for I don't suppose she's my generation,\" replied Mme. des Laumes (the last word being common, it appeared, to Gallardon and Guermantes). And then, seeing that M. de Froberville was still gazing at Mme. de Cambremer, she added, half out of malice towards the lady, half wishing to oblige the General: \"Not very nice... for her husband! I am sorry that I do not know her, since she seems to attract you so much; I might have introduced you to her,\" said the Princess, who, if she had known the young woman, would most probably have done nothing of the sort. \"And now I must say good night, because one of my friends is having a birthday party, and I must go and wish her many happy returns,\" she explained, modestly and with truth, reducing the fashionable gathering to which she was going to the simple proportions of a ceremony which would be boring in the extreme, but at which she was obliged to be present, and there would be something touching about her appearance. \"Besides, I must pick up Basin. While I've been here, he's gone to see those friends of his\u2014you know them too, I'm sure,\u2014who are called after a bridge\u2014oh, yes, the I\u00e9nas.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It was a battle before it was a bridge, Princess; it was a victory!\" said the General. \"I mean to say, to an old soldier like me,\" he went on, wiping his monocle and replacing it, as though he were laying a fresh dressing on the raw wound underneath, while the Princess instinctively looked away, \"that Empire nobility, well, of course, it's not the same thing, but, after all, taking it as it is, it's very fine of its kind; they were people who really did fight like heroes.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I have the deepest respect for heroes,\" the Princess assented, though with a faint trace of irony. \"If I don't go with Basin to see this Princesse d'I\u00e9na, it isn't for that, at all; it's simply because I don't know them. Basin knows them; he worships them. Oh, no, it's not what you think; he's not in love with her. I've nothing to set my face against! Besides, what good has it ever done when I have set my face against them?\" she queried sadly, for the whole world knew that, ever since the day upon which the Prince des Laumes had married his fascinating cousin, he had been consistently unfaithful to her. \"Anyhow, it isn't that at all. They're people he has known for ever so long, they do him very well, and that suits me down to the ground. But I must tell you what he's told me about their house; it's quite enough. Can you imagine it, all their furniture is 'Empire'!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, my dear Princess, that's only natural; it belonged to their grandparents.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't quite say it didn't, but that doesn't make it any less ugly. I quite understand that people can't always have nice things, but at least they needn't have things that are merely grotesque. What do you say? I can think of nothing more devastating, more utterly smug than that hideous style\u2014cabinets covered all over with swans' heads, like bath-taps!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I believe, all the same, that they've got some lovely things; why, they must have that famous mosaic table on which the Treaty of...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I don't deny, they may have things that are interesting enough from the historic point of view. But things like that can't, ever, be beautiful ... because they're simply horrible! I've got things like that myself, that came to Basin from the Montesquious. Only, they're up in the attics at Guermantes, where nobody ever sees them. But, after all, that's not the point, I would fly to see them, with Basin; I would even go to see them among all their sphinxes and brasses, if I knew them, but\u2014I don't know them! D'you know, I was always taught, when I was a little girl, that it was not polite to call on people one didn't know.\" She assumed a tone of childish gravity. \"And so I am just doing what I was taught to do. Can't you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house? Why, I might get a most hostile reception.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she coquettishly enhanced the charm of the smile which the idea had brought to her lips, by giving to her blue eyes, which were fixed on the General, a gentle, dreamy expression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dear Princess, you know that they'd be simply wild with joy.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, why?\" she inquired, with the utmost vivacity, either so as to seem unaware that it would be because she was one of the first ladies in France, or so as to have the pleasure of hearing the General tell her so. \"Why? How can you tell? Perhaps they would think it the most unpleasant thing that could possibly happen. I know nothing about them, but if they're anything like me, I find it quite boring enough to see the people I do know; I'm sure if I had to see people I didn't know as well, even if they had 'fought like heroes,' I should go stark mad. Besides, except when it's an old friend like you, whom one knows quite apart from that, I'm not sure that 'heroism' takes one very far in society. It's often quite boring enough to have to give a dinner-party, but if one had to offer one's arm to Spartacus, to let him take one down...! Really, no; it would never be Vercingetorix I should send for, to make a fourteenth. I feel sure, I should keep him for really big 'crushes.' And as I never give any...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah! Princess, it's easy to see you're not a Guermantes for nothing. You have your share of it, all right, the 'wit of the Guermantes'!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But people always talk about the wit of the Guermantes; I never could make out why. Do you really know any others who have it?\" she rallied him, with a rippling flow of laughter, her features concentrated, yoked to the service of her animation, her eyes sparkling, blazing with a radiant sunshine of gaiety which could be kindled only by such speeches\u2014even if the Princess had to make them herself\u2014as were in praise of h wit or of her beauty. \"Look, there's Swann talking to your Cambremer woman; over there, beside old Saint-Euverte, don't you see him? Ask him to introduce you. But hurry up, he seems to be just going!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you notice how dreadfully ill he's looking?\" asked the General\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My precious Charles? Ah, he's coming at last; I was beginning to think he didn't want to see me!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was extremely fond of the Princesse des Laumes, and the sight of her recalled to him Guermantes, a property close to Combray, and all that country which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit, so as not to be separated from Odette. Slipping into the manner, half-artistic, half-amorous\u2014with which he could always manage to amuse the Princess\u2014a manner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment into the old social atmosphere, and wishing also to express in words, for his own satisfaction, the longing that he felt for the country:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, or rather intoned, in such a way as to be audible at once to Mme. de Saint-Euverte, to whom he spoke, and to Mme. des Laumes, for whom he was speaking, \"Behold our charming Princess! See, she has come up on purpose from Guermantes to hear Saint Francis preach to the birds, and has only just had time, like a dear little tit-mouse, to go and pick a few little hips and haws and put them in her hair; there are even some drops of dew upon them still, a little of the hoar-frost which must be making the Duchess, down there, shiver. It is very pretty indeed, my dear Princess.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What! The Princess came up on purpose from Guermantes? But that's too wonderful! I never knew; I'm quite bewildered,\" Mme. de Saint-Euverte protested with quaint simplicity, being but little accustomed to Swann's way of speaking. And then, examining the Princess's headdress, \"Why, you're quite right; it is copied from... what shall I say, not chestnuts, no,\u2014oh, it's a delightful idea, but how can the Princess have known what was going to be on my programme? The musicians didn't tell me, even.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann, who was accustomed, when he was with a woman whom he had kept up the habit of addressing in terms of gallantry, to pay her delicate compliments which most other people would not and need not understand, did not condescend to explain to Mme. de Saint-Euverte that he had been speaking metaphorically. As for the Princess, she was in fits of laughter, both because Swann's wit was highly appreciated by her set, and because she could never hear a compliment addressed to herself without finding it exquisitely subtle and irresistibly amusing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Indeed! I'm delighted, Charles, if my little hips and haws meet with your approval. But tell me, why did you bow to that Cambremer person, are you also her neighbour in the country?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Saint-Euverte, seeing that the Princess seemed quite happy talking to Swann, had drifted away\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But you are, yourself, Princess!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I! Why, they must have 'countries' everywhere, those creatures! Don't I wish I had!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, not the Cambremers; her own people. She was a Legrandin, and used to come to Combray. I don't know whether you are aware that you are Comtesse de Combray, and that the Chapter owes you a due.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't know what the Chapter owes me, but I do know that I'm 'touched' for a hundred francs, every year, by the Cur\u00e9, which is a due that I could very well do without. But surely these Cambremers have rather a startling name. It ends just in time, but it ends badly!\" she said with a laugh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It begins no better.\" Swann took the point\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes; that double abbreviation!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Some one very angry and very proper who didn't dare to finish the first word.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But since he couldn't stop himself beginning the second, he'd have done better to finish the first and be done with it. We are indulging in the most refined form of humour, my dear Charles, in the very best of taste\u2014but how tiresome it is that I never see you now,\" she went on in a coaxing tone, \"I do so love talking to you. Just imagine, I could not make that idiot Froberville see that there was anything funny about the name Cambremer. Do agree that life is a dreadful business. It's only when I see you that I stop feeling bored.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which was probably not true. But Swann and the Princess had the same way of looking at the little things of life\u2014the effect, if not the cause of which was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of pronunciation. This similarity was not striking because no two things could have been more unlike than their voices. But if one took the trouble to imagine Swann's utterances divested of the sonority that enwrapped them, of the moustache from under which they emerged, one found that they were the same phrases, the same inflexions, that they had the 'tone' of the Guermantes set. On important matters, Swann and the Princess had not an idea in common. But since Swann had become so melancholy, and was always in that trembling condition which precedes a flood of tears, he had the same need to speak about his grief that a murderer has to tell some one about his crime. And when he heard the Princess say that life was a dreadful business, he felt as much comforted as if she had spoken to him of Odette\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, life is a dreadful business! We must meet more often, my dear friend. What is so nice about you is that you are not cheerful. We could spend a most pleasant evening together.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sure we could; why not come down to Guermantes? My mother-in-law would be wild with joy. It's supposed to be very ugly down there, but I must say, I find the neighborhood not at all unattractive; I have a horror of 'picturesque spots'.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know it well, it's delightful!\" replied Swann. \"It's almost too beautiful, too much alive for me just at present; it's a country to be happy in. It's perhaps because I have lived there, but things there speak to me so. As soon as a breath of wind gets up, and the cornfields begin to stir, I feel that some one is going to appear suddenly, that I am going to hear some news; and those little houses by the water's edge... I should be quite wretched!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! my dearest Charles, do take care; there's that appalling Rampillon woman; she's seen me; hide me somewhere, do tell me again, quickly, what it was that happened to her; I get so mixed up; she's just married off her daughter, or her lover (I never can remember),\u2014perhaps both\u2014to each other! Oh, no, I remember now, she's been dropped by her Prince... Pretend to be talking, so that the poor old Berenice sha'n't come and invite me to dinner. Anyhow, I'm going. Listen, my dearest Charles, now that I have seen you, once in a blue moon, won't you let me carry you off and take you to the Princesse de Parme's, who would be so pleased to see you (you know), and Basin too, for that matter; he's meeting me there. If one didn't get news of you, sometimes, from M\u00e9m\u00e9... Remember, I never see you at all now!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann declined. Having told M. de Charlus that, on leaving Mme. de Saint-Euverte's, he would go straight home, he did not care to run the risk, by going on now to the Princesse de Parme's, of missing a message which he had, all the time, been hoping to see brought in to him by one of the footmen, during the party, and which he was perhaps going to find left with his own porter, at home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Poor Swann,\" said Mme. des Laumes that night to her husband; \"he is always charming, but he does look so dreadfully unhappy. You will see for yourself, for he has promised to dine with us one of these days. I do feel that it's really absurd that a man of his intelligence should let himself be made to suffer by a creature of that kind, who isn't even interesting, for they tell me, she's an absolute idiot!\" she concluded with the wisdom invariably shewn by people who, not being in love themselves, feel that a clever man ought to be unhappy only about such persons as are worth his while; which is rather like being astonished that anyone should condescend to die of cholera at the bidding of so insignificant a creature as the common bacillus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann now wished to go home, but, just as he was making his escape, General de Froberville caught him and asked for an introduction to Mme. de Cambremer, and he was obliged to go back into the room to look for her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I say, Swann, I'd rather be married to that little woman than killed by savages, what do you say?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The words 'killed by savages' pierced Swann's aching heart; and at once he felt the need of continuing the conversation. \"Ah!\" he began, \"some fine lives have been lost in that way... There was, you remember, that explorer whose remains Dumont d'Urville brought back, La P\u00e9rouse...\" (and he was at once happy again, as though he had named Odette). \"He was a fine character, and interests me very much, does La P\u00e9rouse,\" he ended sadly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, yes, of course, La P\u00e9rouse,\" said the General. \"It's quite a well-known name. There's a street called that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you know anyone in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse?\" asked Swann excitedly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Only Mme. de Chanlivault, the sister of that good fellow Chaussepierre. She gave a most amusing theatre-party the other evening. That's a house that will be really smart some day, you'll see!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, so she lives in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse. It's attractive; I like that street; it's so sombre.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Indeed it isn't. You can't have been in it for a long time; it's not at all sombre now; they're beginning to build all round there.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Swann did finally introduce M. de Froberville to the young Mme. de Cambremer, since it was the first time that she had heard the General's name, she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise with which she would have greeted him if she had never, in the whole of her life, heard anything else; for, as she did not yet know all the friends of her new family, whenever anyone was presented to her, she assumed that he must be one of them, and thinking that she would shew her tact by appearing to have heard 'such a lot about him' since her marriage, she would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which was meant as a proof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to overcome and of the spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame it. And so her parents-in-law, whom she still regarded as the most eminent pair in France, declared that she was an angel; all the more that they preferred to appear, in marrying her to their son, to have yielded to the attraction rather of her natural charm than of her considerable fortune\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's easy to see that you're a musician heart and soul, Madame,\" said the General, alluding to the incident of the candle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the concert had begun again, and Swann saw that he could not now go before the end of the new number. He suffered greatly from being shut up among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded him all the more cruelly since, being ignorant of his love, incapable, had they known of it, of taking any interest, or of doing more than smile at it as at some childish joke, or deplore it as an act of insanity, they made it appear to him in the aspect of a subjective state which existed for himself alone, whose reality there was nothing external to confirm; he suffered overwhelmingly, to the point at which even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry, from having to prolong his exile in this place to which Odette would never come, in which no one, nothing was aware of her existence, from which she was entirely absent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition tore him with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart. What had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes, on which it rested as though expecting something, an expectancy which it prolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes, in the exaltation with which it already saw the expected object approaching, and with a desperate effort to continue until its arrival, to welcome it before itself expired, to keep the way open for a moment longer, with all its remaining strength, that the stranger might enter in, as one holds a door open that would otherwise automatically close. And before Swann had had time to understand what was happening, to think: \"It is the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. I mustn't listen!\", all his memories of the days when Odette had been in love with him, which he had succeeded, up till that evening, in keeping invisible in the depths of his being, deceived by this sudden reflection of a season of love, whose sun, they supposed, had dawned again, had awakened from their slumber, had taken wing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears, without pity for his present desolation, the forgotten strains of happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In place of the abstract expressions \"the time when I was happy,\" \"the time when I was loved,\" which he had often used until then, and without much suffering, for his intelligence had not embodied in them anything of the past save fictitious extracts which preserved none of the reality, he now recovered everything that had fixed unalterably the peculiar, volatile essence of that lost happiness; he could see it all; the snowy, curled petals of the chrysanthemum which she had tossed after him into his carriage, which he had kept pressed to his lips, the address 'Maison Dor\u00e9e,' embossed on the note-paper on which he had read \"My hand trembles so as I write to you,\" the frowning contraction of her eyebrows when she said pleadingly: \"You won't let it be very long before you send for me?\"; he could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he used to have in to singe his hair while Loredan went to fetch the little working girl; could feel the torrents of rain which fell so often that spring, the ice-cold homeward drive in his victoria, by moonlight; all the network of mental habits, of seasonable impressions, of sensory reactions, which had extended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes, by which his body now found itself inextricably held. At that time he had been satisfying a sensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures of those people who lived for love alone. He had supposed that he could stop there, that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows also; how small a thing the actual charm of Odette was now in comparison with that formidable terror which extended it like a cloudy halo all around her, that enormous anguish of not knowing at every hour of the day and night what she had been doing, of not possessing her wholly, at all times and in all places! Alas, he recalled the accents in which she had exclaimed: \"But I can see you at any time; I am always free!\"\u2014she, who was never free now; the interest, the curiosity that she had shewn in his life, her passionate desire that he should do her the favour\u2014of which it was he who, then, had felt suspicious, as of a possibly tedious waste of his time and disturbance of his arrangements\u2014of granting her access to his study; how she had been obliged to beg that he would let her take him to the Verdurins'; and, when he did allow her to come to him once a month, how she had first, before he would let himself be swayed, had to repeat what a joy it would be to her, that custom of their seeing each other daily, for which she had longed at a time when to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction, for which, since that time, she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken herself of it, while it had become for him so insatiable, so dolorous a need. Little had he suspected how truly he spoke when, on their third meeting, as she repeated: \"But why don't you let me come to you oftener?\" he had told her, laughing, and in a vein of gallantry, that it was for fear of forming a hopeless passion. Now, alas, it still happened at times that she wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel, on paper which bore a printed address, but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart. \"Written from the H\u00f4tel Vouillemont. What on earth can she have gone there for? With whom? What happened there?\" He remembered the gas-jets that were being extinguished along the Boulevard des Italiens when he had met her, when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that night which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now (that night of a period when he had not even to ask himself whether he would be annoying her by looking for her and by finding her, so certain was he that she knew no greater happiness than to see him and to let him take her home) belonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may return again once its doors are closed. And Swann could distinguish, standing, motionless, before that scene of happiness in which it lived again, a wretched figure which filled him with such pity, because he did not at first recognise who it was, that he must lower his head, lest anyone should observe that his eyes were filled with tears. It was himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he had realised this, his pity ceased; he was jealous, now, of that other self whom she had loved, he was jealous of those men of whom he had so often said, without much suffering: \"Perhaps she's in love with them,\" now that he had exchanged the vague idea of loving, in which there is no love, for the petals of the chrysanthemum and the 'letter-heading' of the Maison d'Or; for they were full of love. And then, his anguish becoming too keen, he passed his hand over his forehead, let the monocle drop from his eye, and wiped its glass. And doubtless, if he had caught sight of himself at that moment, he would have added to the collection of the monocles which he had already identified, this one which he removed, like an importunate, worrying thought, from his head, while from its misty surface, with his handkerchief, he sought to obliterate his cares\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are in the music of the violin\u2014if one does not see the instrument itself, and so cannot relate what one hears to its form, which modifies the fullness of the sound\u2014accents which are so closely akin to those of certain contralto voices, that one has the illusion that a singer has taken her place amid the orchestra. One raises one's eyes; one sees only the wooden case, magical as a Chinese box; but, at moments, one is still tricked by the deceiving appeal of the Siren; at times, too, one believes that one is listening to a captive spirit, struggling in the darkness of its masterful box, a box quivering with enchantment, like a devil immersed in a stoup of holy water; sometimes, again, it is in the air, at large, like a pure and supernatural creature that reveals to the ear, as it passes, its invisible message\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As though the musicians were not nearly so much playing the little phrase as performing the rites on which it insisted before it would consent to appear, as proceeding to utter the incantations necessary to procure, and to prolong for a few moments, the miracle of its apparition, Swann, who was no more able now to see it than if it had belonged to a world of ultra-violet light, who experienced something like the refreshing sense of a metamorphosis in the momentary blindness with which he had been struck as he approached it, Swann felt that it was present, like a protective goddess, a confidant of his love, who, so as to be able to come to him through the crowd, and to draw him aside to speak to him, had disguised herself in this sweeping cloak of sound. And as she passed him, light, soothing, as softly murmured as the perfume of a flower, telling him what she had to say, every word of which he closely scanned, sorry to see them fly away so fast, he made involuntarily with his lips the motion of kissing, as it went by him, the harmonious, fleeting form\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she, who addressed herself to him, spoke to him in a whisper of Odette. For he had no longer, as of old, the impression that Odette and he were not known to the little phrase. Had it not often been the witness of their joys? True that, as often, it had warned him of their frailty. And indeed, whereas, in that distant time, he had divined an element of suffering in its smile, in its limpid and disillusioned intonation, to-night he found there rather the charm of a resignation that was almost gay. Of those sorrows, of which the little phrase had spoken to him then, which he had seen it\u2014without his being touched by them himself\u2014carry past him, smiling, on its sinuous and rapid course, of those sorrows which were now become his own, without his having any hope of being, ever, delivered from them, it seemed to say to him, as once it had said of his happiness: \"What does all that matter; it is all nothing.\" And Swann's thoughts were borne for the first time on a wave of pity and tenderness towards that Vinteuil, towards that unknown, exalted brother who also must have suffered so greatly; what could his life have been? From the depths of what well of sorrow could he have drawn that god-like strength, that unlimited power of creation?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When it was the little phrase that spoke to him of the vanity of his sufferings, Swann found a sweetness in that very wisdom which, but a little while back, had seemed to him intolerable when he thought that he could read it on the faces of indifferent strangers, who would regard his love as a digression that was without importance. 'Twas because the little phrase, unlike them, whatever opinion it might hold on the short duration of these states of the soul, saw in them something not, as everyone else saw, less serious than the events of everyday life, but, on the contrary, so far superior to everyday life as to be alone worthy of the trouble of expressing it. Those graces of an intimate sorrow, 'twas them that the phrase endeavoured to imitate, to create anew; and even their essence, for all that it consists in being incommunicable and in appearing trivial to everyone save him who has experience of them, the little phrase had captured, had rendered visible. So much so that it made their value be confessed, their divine sweetness be tasted by all those same onlookers\u2014provided only that they were in any sense musical\u2014who, the next moment, would ignore, would disown them in real life, in every individual love that came into being beneath their eyes. Doubtless the form in which it had codified those graces could not be analysed into any logical elements. But ever since, more than a year before, discovering to him many of the riches of his own soul, the love of music had been born, and for a time at least had dwelt in him, Swann had regarded musical motifs as actual ideas, of another world, of another order, ideas veiled in shadows, unknown, impenetrable by the human mind, which none the less were perfectly distinct one from another, unequal among themselves in value and in significance. When, after that first evening at the Verdurins', he had had the little phrase played over to him again, and had sought to disentangle from his confused impressions how it was that, like a perfume or a caress, it swept over and enveloped him, he had observed that it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes which composed it and to the constant repetition of two of them that was due that impression of a frigid, a contracted sweetness; but in reality he knew that he was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but merely upon certain equivalents, substituted (for his mind's convenience) for the mysterious entity of which he had become aware, before ever he knew the Verdurins, at that earlier party, when for the first time he had heard the sonata played. He knew that his memory of the piano falsified still further the perspective in which he saw the music, that the field open to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes, but an immeasurable keyboard (still, almost all of it, unknown), on which, here and there only, separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored tracts, some few among the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of passion, of courage, of serenity, which compose it, each one differing from all the rest as one universe differs from another, have been discovered by certain great artists who do us the service, when they awaken in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which they have found, of shewing us what richness, what variety lies hidden, unknown to us, in that great black impenetrable night, discouraging exploration, of our soul, which we have been content to regard as valueless and waste and void. Vinteuil had been one of those musicians. In his little phrase, albeit it presented to the mind's eye a clouded surface, there was contained, one felt, a matter so consistent, so explicit, to which the phrase gave so new, so original a force, that those who had once heard it preserved the memory of it in the treasure-chamber of their minds. Swann would repair to it as to a conception of love and happiness, of which at once he knew as well in what respects it was peculiar as he would know of the Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves, or of Ren\u00e9, should either of those titles occur to him. Even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it existed, latent, in his mind, in the same way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent, such as our notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of bodily desire, the rich possessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified and adorned. Perhaps we shall lose them, perhaps they will be obliterated, if we return to nothing in the dust. But so long as we are alive, we can no more bring ourselves to a state in which we shall not have known them than we can with regard to any material object, than we can, for example, doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted, in view of the changed aspect of everything in the room, from which has vanished even the memory of the darkness. In that way Vinteuil's phrase, like some theme, say, in Tristan, which represents to us also a certain acquisition of sentiment, has espoused our mortal state, had endued a vesture of humanity that was affecting enough. Its destiny was linked, for the future, with that of the human soul, of which it was one of the special, the most distinctive ornaments. Perhaps it is not-being that is the true state, and all our dream of life is without existence; but, if so, we feel that it must be that these phrases of music, these conceptions which exist in relation to our dream, are nothing either. We shall perish, but we have for our hostages these divine captives who shall follow and share our fate. And death in their company is something less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps even less certain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So Swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata did, really, exist. Human as it was from this point of view, it belonged, none the less, to an order of supernatural creatures whom we have never seen, but whom, in spite of that, we recognise and acclaim with rapture when some explorer of the unseen contrives to coax one forth, to bring it down from that divine world to which he has access to shine for a brief moment in the firmament of ours. This was what Vinteuil had done for the little phrase. Swann felt that the composer had been content (with the musical instruments at his disposal) to draw aside its veil, to make it visible, following and respecting its outlines with a hand so loving, so prudent, so delicate and so sure, that the sound altered at every moment, blunting itself to indicate a shadow, springing back into life when it must follow the curve of some more bold projection. And one proof that Swann was not mistaken when he believed in the real existence of this phrase, was that anyone with an ear at all delicate for music would at once have detected the imposture had Vinteuil, endowed with less power to see and to render its forms, sought to dissemble (by adding a line, here and there, of his own invention) the dimness of his vision or the feebleness of his hand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The phrase had disappeared. Swann knew that it would come again at the end of the last movement, after a long passage which Mme. Verdurin's pianist always 'skipped.' There were in this passage some admirable ideas which Swann had not distinguished on first hearing the sonata, and which he now perceived, as if they had, in the cloakroom of his memory, divested themselves of their uniform disguise of novelty. Swann listened to all the scattered themes which entered into the composition of the phrase, as its premises enter into the inevitable conclusion of a syllogism; he was assisting at the mystery of its birth. \"Audacity,\" he exclaimed to himself, \"as inspired, perhaps, as a Lavoisier's or an Ampere's, the audacity of a Vinteuil making experiment, discovering the secret laws that govern an unknown force, driving across a region unexplored towards the one possible goal the invisible team in which he has placed his trust and which he never may discern!\" How charming the dialogue which Swann now heard between piano and violin, at the beginning of the last passage. The suppression of human speech, so far from letting fancy reign there uncontrolled (as one might have thought), had eliminated it altogether. Never was spoken language of such inflexible necessity, never had it known questions so pertinent, such obvious replies. At first the piano complained alone, like a bird deserted by its mate; the violin heard and answered it, as from a neighbouring tree. It was as at the first beginning of the world, as if there were not yet but these twain upon the earth, or rather in this world closed against all the rest, so fashioned by the logic of its creator that in it there should never be any but themselves; the world of this sonata. Was it a bird, was it the soul, not yet made perfect, of the little phrase, was it a fairy, invisibly somewhere lamenting, whose plaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated? Its cries were so sudden that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch them as they came. Marvellous bird! The violinist seemed to wish to charm, to tame, to woo, to win it. Already it had passed into his soul, already the little phrase which it evoked shook like a medium's the body of the violinist, 'possessed' indeed. Swann knew that the phrase was going to speak to him once again. And his personality was now so divided that the strain of waiting for the imminent moment when he would find himself face to face, once more, with the phrase, convulsed him in one of those sobs which a fine line of poetry or a piece of alarming news will wring from us, not when we are alone, but when we repeat one or the other to a friend, in whom we see ourselves reflected, like a third person, whose probable emotion softens him. It reappeared, but this time to remain poised in the air, and to sport there for a moment only, as though immobile, and shortly to expire. And so Swann lost nothing of the precious time for which it lingered. It was still there, like an iridescent bubble that floats for a while unbroken. As a rainbow, when its brightness fades, seems to subside, then soars again and, before it is extinguished, is glorified with greater splendour than it has ever shewn; so to the two colours which the phrase had hitherto allowed to appear it added others now, chords shot with every hue in the prism, and made them sing. Swann dared not move, and would have liked to compel all the other people in the room to remain still also, as if the slightest movement might embarrass the magic presence, supernatural, delicious, frail, that would so easily vanish. But no one, as it happened, dreamed of speaking. The ineffable utterance of one solitary man, absent, perhaps dead (Swann did not know whether Vinteuil were still alive), breathed out above the rites of those two hierophants, sufficed to arrest the attention of three hundred minds, and made of that stage on which a soul was thus called into being one of the noblest altars on which a supernatural ceremony could be performed. It followed that, when the phrase at last was finished, and only its fragmentary echoes floated among the subsequent themes which had already taken its place, if Swann at first was annoyed to see the Comtesse de Monteriender, famed for her imbecilities, lean over towards him to confide in him her impressions, before even the sonata had come to an end; he could not refrain from smiling, and perhaps also found an underlying sense, which she was incapable of perceiving, in the words that she used. Dazzled by the virtuosity of the performers, the Comtesse exclaimed to Swann: \"It's astonishing! I have never seen anything to beat it...\" But a scrupulous regard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion, she added the reservation: \"anything to beat it... since the table-turning!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From that evening, Swann understood that the feeling which Odette had once had for him would never revive, that his hopes of happiness would not be realised now. And the days on which, by a lucky chance, she had once more shewn herself kind and loving to him, or if she had paid him any attention, he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of a slight movement on her part towards him with the same tender and sceptical solicitude, the desperate joy that people reveal who, when they are nursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady, relate, as significant facts of infinite value: \"Yesterday he went through his accounts himself, and actually corrected a mistake that we had made in adding them up; he ate an egg to-day and seemed quite to enjoy it, if he digests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet to-morrow,\"\u2014although they themselves know that these things are meaningless on the eve of an inevitable death. No doubt Swann was assured that if he had now been living at a distance from Odette he would gradually have lost all interest in her, so that he would have been glad to learn that she was leaving Paris for ever; he would have had the courage to remain there; but he had not the courage to go\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had often thought of going. Now that he was once again at work upon his essay on Vermeer, he wanted to return, for a few days at least, to The Hague, to Dresden, to Brunswick. He was certain that a 'Toilet of Diana' which had been acquired by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt sale as a Nicholas Maes was in reality a Vermeer. And he would have liked to be able to examine the picture on the spot, so as to strengthen his conviction. But to leave Paris while Odette was there, and even when she was not there\u2014for in strange places where our sensations have not been numbed by habit, we refresh, we revive an old pain\u2014was for him so cruel a project that he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it incessantly in his mind only because he knew himself to be resolute in his determination never to put it into effect. But it would happen that, while he was asleep, the intention to travel would reawaken in him (without his remembering that this particular tour was impossible) and would be realised. One night he dreamed that he was going away for a year; leaning from the window of the train towards a young man on the platform who wept as he bade him farewell, he was seeking to persuade this young man to come away also. The train began to move; he awoke in alarm, and remembered that he was not going away, that he would see Odette that evening, and next day and almost every day. And then, being still deeply moved by his dream, he would thank heaven for those special circumstances which made him independent, thanks to which he could remain in Odette's vicinity, and could even succeed in making her allow him to see her sometimes; and, counting over the list of his advantages: his social position\u2014his fortune, from which she stood too often in need of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture (having even, so people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her)\u2014his friendship with M. de Charlus, which, it must be confessed, had never won him any very great favour from Odette, but which gave him the pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things said about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an esteem\u2014and even his own intelligence, the whole of which he employed in weaving, every day, a fresh plot which would make his presence, if not agreeable, at any rate necessary to Odette\u2014he thought of what might have happened to him if all these advantages had been lacking, he thought that, if he had been, like so many other men, poor and humble, without resources, forced to undertake any task that might be offered to him, or tied down by parents or by a wife, he might have been obliged to part from Odette, that that dream, the terror of which was still so recent, might well have been true; and he said to himself: \"People don't know when they are happy. They're never so unhappy as they think they are.\" But he reflected that this existence had lasted already for several years, that all that he could now hope for was that it should last for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his friends, in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a meeting which, when it occurred, would bring him no happiness; and he asked himself whether he was not mistaken, whether the circumstances that had favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had not done a disservice to his career, whether the outcome to be desired was not that as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in dreams\u2014his own departure; and he said to himself that people did not know when they were unhappy, that they were never so happy as they supposed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes he hoped that she would die, painlessly, in some accident, she who was out of doors in the streets, crossing busy thoroughfares, from morning to night. And as she always returned safe and sound, he marvelled at the strength, at the suppleness of the human body, which was able continually to hold in check, to outwit all the perils that environed it (which to Swann seemed innumerable, since his own secret desire had strewn them in her path), and so allowed its occupant, the soul, to abandon itself, day after day, and almost with impunity, to its career of mendacity, to the pursuit of pleasure. And Swann felt a very cordial sympathy with that Mahomet II whose portrait by Bellini he admired, who, on finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives, stabbed her, in order, as his Venetian biographer artlessly relates, to recover his spiritual freedom. Then he would be ashamed of thinking thus only of himself, and his own sufferings would seem to deserve no pity now that he himself was disposing so cheaply of Odette's very life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent return, if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations his grief would ultimately have been assuaged, and his love would, perhaps, have died. And from the moment when she did not wish to leave Paris for ever he had hoped that she would never go. As he knew that her one prolonged absence, every year, was in August and September, he had abundant opportunity, several months in advance, to dissociate from it the grim picture of her absence throughout Eternity which was lodged in him by anticipation, and which, consisting of days closely akin to the days through which he was then passing, floated in a cold transparency in his mind, which it saddened and depressed, though without causing him any intolerable pain. But that conception of the future, that flowing stream, colourless and unconfined, a single word from Odette sufficed to penetrate through all Swann's defences, and like a block of ice immobilised it, congealed its fluidity, made it freeze altogether; and Swann felt himself suddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass which pressed on the inner walls of his consciousness until he was fain to burst asunder; for Odette had said casually, watching him with a malicious smile: \"Forcheville is going for a fine trip at Whitsuntide. He's going to Egypt!\" and Swann had at once understood that this meant: \"I am going to Egypt at Whitsuntide with Forcheville.\" And, in fact, if, a few days later, Swann began: \"About that trip that you told me you were going to take with Forcheville,\" she would answer carelessly: \"Yes, my dear boy, we're starting on the 19th; we'll send you a 'view' of the Pyramids.\" Then he was determined to know whether she was Forcheville's mistress, to ask her point-blank, to insist upon her telling him. He knew that there were some perjuries which, being so superstitious, she would not commit, and besides, the fear, which had hitherto restrained his curiosity, of making Odette angry if he questioned her, of making himself odious, had ceased to exist now that he had lost all hope of ever being loved by her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day he received an anonymous letter which told him that Odette had been the mistress of countless men (several of whom it named, among them Forcheville, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 and the painter) and women, and that she frequented houses of ill-fame. He was tormented by the discovery that there was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of sending him such a letter (for certain details betrayed in the writer a familiarity with his private life). He wondered who it could be. But he had never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other people, those which had no visible connection with what they said. And when he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent character of M. de Charlus, or of M. des Laumes, or of M. d'Orsan that he must place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might have had its birth; as none of these men had ever, in conversation with Swann, suggested that he approved of anonymous letters, and as everything that they had ever said to him implied that they strongly disapproved, he saw no further reason for associating this infamy with the character of any one of them more than with the rest. M. de Charlus was somewhat inclined to eccentricity, but he was fundamentally good and kind; M. des Laumes was a trifle dry, but wholesome and straight. As for M. d'Orsan, Swann had never met anyone who, even in the most depressing circumstances, would come to him with a more heartfelt utterance, would act more properly or with more discretion. So much so that he was unable to understand the rather indelicate part commonly attributed to M. d'Orsan in his relations with a certain wealthy woman, and that whenever he thought of him he was obliged to set that evil reputation on one side, as irreconcilable with so many unmistakable proofs of his genuine sincerity and refinement. For a moment Swann felt that his mind was becoming clouded, and he thought of something else so as to recover a little light; until he had the courage to return to those other reflections. But then, after not having been able to suspect anyone, he was forced to suspect everyone that he knew. After all, M. de Charlus might be most fond of him, might be most good-natured; but he was a neuropath; to-morrow, perhaps, he would burst into tears on hearing that Swann was ill; and to-day, from jealousy, or in anger, or carried away by some sudden idea, he might have wished to do him a deliberate injury. Really, that kind of man was the worst of all. The Prince des Laumes was, certainly, far less devoted to Swann than was M. de Charlus. But for that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with regard to him; and besides, his was a nature which, though, no doubt, it was cold, was as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action. Swann regretted that he had formed no attachments in his life except to such people. Then he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their neighbours is fellow-feeling, that he could not, in the last resort, answer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own, as was, so far as the heart went, that of M. de Charlus. The mere thought of causing Swann so much distress would have been revolting to him. But with a man who was insensible, of another order of humanity, as was the Prince des Laumes, how was one to foresee the actions to which he might be led by the promptings of a different nature? To have a good heart was everything, and M. de Charlus had one. But M. d'Orsan was not lacking in that either, and his relations with Swann\u2014cordial, but scarcely intimate, arising from the pleasure which, as they held the same views about everything, they found in talking together\u2014were more quiescent than the enthusiastic affection of M. de Charlus, who was apt to be led into passionate activity, good or evil. If there was anyone by whom Swann felt that he had always been understood, and (with delicacy) loved, it was M. d'Orsan. Yes, but the life he led; it could hardly be called honourable. Swann regretted that he had never taken any notice of those rumours, that he himself had admitted, jestingly, that he had never felt so keen a sense of sympathy, or of respect, as when he was in thoroughly 'detrimental' society. \"It is not for nothing,\" he now assured himself, \"that when people pass judgment upon their neighbour, their finding is based upon his actions. It is those alone that are significant, and not at all what we say or what we think. Charlus and des Laumes may have this or that fault, but they are men of honour. Orsan, perhaps, has not the same faults, but he is not a man of honour. He may have acted dishonourably once again.\" Then he suspected R\u00e9mi, who, it was true, could only have inspired the letter, but he now felt himself, for a moment, to be on the right track. To begin with, Loredan had his own reasons for wishing harm to Odette. And then, how were we not to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to our own, adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and vices for which they at once envied and despised us, should not find themselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own class? He also suspected my grandfather. On every occasion when Swann had asked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined? Besides, with his ideas of middle-class respectability, he might have thought that he was acting for Swann's good. He suspected, in turn, Bergotte, the painter, the Verdurins; paused for a moment to admire once again the wisdom of people in society, who refused to mix in the artistic circles in which such things were possible, were, perhaps, even openly avowed, as excellent jokes; but then he recalled the marks of honesty that were to be observed in those Bohemians, and contrasted them with the life of expedients, often bordering on fraudulence, to which the want of money, the craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of their pleasures often drove members of the aristocracy. In a word, this anonymous letter proved that he himself knew a human being capable of the most infamous conduct, but he could see no reason why that infamy should lurk in the depths\u2014which no strange eye might explore\u2014of the warm heart rather than the cold, the artist's rather than the business-man's, the noble's rather than the flunkey's. What criterion ought one to adopt, in order to judge one's fellows? After all, there was not a single one of the people whom he knew who might not, in certain circumstances, prove capable of a shameful action. Must he then cease to see them all? His mind grew clouded; he passed his hands two or three times across his brow, wiped his glasses with his handkerchief, and remembering that, after all, men who were as good as himself frequented the society of M. de Charlus, the Prince des Laumes and the rest, he persuaded himself that this meant, if not that they were incapable of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity in human life, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of people who were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. And he continued to shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely formal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to drive him to despair. As for the actual contents of the letter, they did not disturb him; for in not one of the charges which it formulated against Odette could he see the least vestige of fact. Like many other men, Swann had a naturally lazy mind, and was slow in invention. He knew quite well as a general truth, that human life is full of contrasts, but in the case of any one human being he imagined all that part of his or her life with which he was not familiar as being identical with the part with which he was. He imagined what was kept secret from him in the light of what was revealed. At such times as he spent with Odette, if their conversation turned upon an indelicate act committed, or an indelicate sentiment expressed by some third person, she would ruthlessly condemn the culprit by virtue of the same moral principles which Swann had always heard expressed by his own parents, and to which he himself had remained loyal; and then, she would arrange her flowers, would sip her tea, would shew an interest in his work. So Swann extended those habits to fill the rest of her life, he reconstructed those actions when he wished to form a picture of the moments in which he and she were apart. If anyone had portrayed her to him as she was, or rather as she had been for so long with himself, but had substituted some other man, he would have been distressed, for such a portrait would have struck him as lifelike. But to suppose that she went to bad houses, that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women, that she led the crapulous existence of the most abject, the most contemptible of mortals\u2014would be an insane wandering of the mind, for the realisation of which, thank heaven, the chrysanthemums that he could imagine, the daily cups of tea, the virtuous indignation left neither time nor place. Only, now and again, he gave Odette to understand that people maliciously kept him informed of everything that she did; and making opportune use of some detail\u2014insignificant but true\u2014which he had accidentally learned, as though it were the sole fragment which he would allow, in spite of himself, to pass his lips, out of the numberless other fragments of that complete reconstruction of her daily life which he carried secretly in his mind, he led her to suppose that he was perfectly informed upon matters, which, in reality, he neither knew nor suspected, for if he often adjured Odette never to swerve from or make alteration of the truth, that was only, whether he realised it or no, in order that Odette should tell him everything that she did. No doubt, as he used to assure Odette, he loved sincerity, but only as he might love a pander who could keep him in touch with the daily life of his mistress. Moreover, his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had not improved his character. The truth which he cherished was that which Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order to extract that truth from her, was not afraid to have recourse to falsehood, that very falsehood which he never ceased to depict to Odette as leading every human creature down to utter degradation. In a word, he lied as much as did Odette, because, while more unhappy than she, he was no less egotistical. And she, when she heard him repeating thus to her the things that she had done, would stare at him with a look of distrust and, at all hazards, of indignation, so as not to appear to be humiliated, and to be blushing for her actions. One day, after the longest period of calm through which he had yet been able to exist without being overtaken by an attack of jealousy, he had accepted an invitation to spend the evening at the theatre with the Princesse des Laumes. Having opened his newspaper to find out what was being played, the sight of the title\u2014Les Filles de Marbre, by Th\u00e9odore Barri\u00e8re,\u2014struck him so cruel a blow that he recoiled instinctively from it and turned his head away. Illuminated, as though by a row of footlights, in the new surroundings in which it now appeared, that word 'marble,' which he had lost the power to distinguish, so often had it passed, in print, beneath his eyes, had suddenly become visible once again, and had at once brought back to his mind the story which Odette had told him, long ago, of a visit which she had paid to the Salon at the Palais d'Industrie with Mme. Verdurin, who had said to her, \"Take care, now! I know how to melt you, all right. You're not made of marble.\" Odette had assured him that it was only a joke, and he had not attached any importance to it at the time. But he had had more confidence in her then than he had now. And the anonymous letter referred explicitly to relations of that sort. Without daring to lift his eyes to the newspaper, he opened it, turned the page so as not to see again the words, Filles de Marbre, and began to read mechanically the news from the provinces. There had been a storm in the Channel, and damage was reported from Dieppe, Cabourg, Beuzeval.... Suddenly he recoiled again in horror\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The name of Beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the same district, Beuzeville, which carried also, bound to it by a hyphen, a second name, to wit Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, which he had often seen on maps, but without ever previously remarking that it was the same name as that borne by his friend M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, whom the anonymous letter accused of having been Odette's lover. After all, when it came to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, there was nothing improbable in the charge; but so far as Mme. Verdurin was concerned, it was a sheer impossibility. From the fact that Odette did occasionally tell a lie, it was not fair to conclude that she never, by any chance, told the truth, and in these bantering conversations with Mme. Verdurin which she herself had repeated to Swann, he could recognize those meaningless and dangerous pleasantries which, in their inexperience of life and ignorance of vice, women often utter (thereby certifying their own innocence), who\u2014as, for instance, Odette,\u2014would be the last people in the world to feel any undue affection for one another. Whereas, on the other hand, the indignation with which she had scattered the suspicions which she had unintentionally brought into being, for a moment, in his mind by her story, fitted in with everything that he knew of the tastes, the temperament of his mistress. But at that moment, by an inspiration of jealousy, analogous to the inspiration which reveals to a poet or a philosopher, who has nothing, so far, but an odd pair of rhymes or a detached observation, the idea or the natural law which will give power, mastery to his work, Swann recalled for the first time a remark which Odette had made to him, at least two years before: \"Oh, Mme. Verdurin, she won't hear of anything just now but me. I'm a 'love,' if you please, and she kisses me, and wants me to go with her everywhere, and call her by her Christian name.\" So far from seeing in these expressions any connection with the absurd insinuations, intended to create an atmosphere of vice, which Odette had since repeated to him, he had welcomed them as a proof of Mme. Verdurin's warm-hearted and generous friendship. But now this old memory of her affection for Odette had coalesced suddenly with his more recent memory of her unseemly conversation. He could no longer separate them in his mind, and he saw them blended in reality, the affection imparting a certain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which, in return, spoiled the affection of its innocence. He went to see Odette. He sat down, keeping at a distance from her. He did not dare to embrace her, not knowing whether in her, in himself, it would be affection or anger that a kiss would provoke. He sat there silent, watching their love expire. Suddenly he made up his mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Odette, my darling,\" he began, \"I know, I am being simply odious, but I must ask you a few questions. You remember what I once thought about you and Mme. Verdurin? Tell me, was it true? Have you, with her or anyone else, ever?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She shook her head, pursing her lips together; a sign which people commonly employ to signify that they are not going, because it would bore them to go, when some one has asked, \"Are you coming to watch the procession go by?\", or \"Will you be at the review?\". But this shake of the head, which is thus commonly used to decline participation in an event that has yet to come, imparts for that reason an element of uncertainty to the denial of participation in an event that is past. Furthermore, it suggests reasons of personal convenience, rather than any definite repudiation, any moral impossibility. When he saw Odette thus make him a sign that the insinuation was false, he realised that it was quite possibly true\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I have told you, I never did; you know quite well,\" she added, seeming angry and uncomfortable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I know all that; but are you quite sure? Don't say to me, 'You know quite well'; say, 'I have never done anything of that sort with any woman.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote, and as though she hoped, thereby, to be rid of him: \"I have never done anything of that sort with any woman.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Can you swear it to me on your Laghetto medal?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann knew that Odette would never perjure herself on that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, you do make me so miserable,\" she cried, with a jerk of her body as though to shake herself free of the constraint of his question. \"Have you nearly done? What is the matter with you to-day? You seem to have made up your mind that I am to be forced to hate you, to curse you! Look, I was anxious to be friends with you again, for us to have a nice time together, like the old days; and this is all the thanks I get!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, he would not let her go, but sat there like a surgeon who waits for a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but need not make him abandon it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You are quite wrong in supposing that I bear you the least ill-will in the world, Odette,\" he began with a persuasive and deceitful gentleness. \"I never speak to you except of what I already know, and I always know a great deal more than I say. But you alone can mollify by your confession what makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by other people. My anger with you is never due to your actions\u2014I can and do forgive you everything because I love you\u2014but to your untruthfulness, the ridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in denying things which I know to be true. How can you expect that I shall continue to love you, when I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know to be false? Odette, do not prolong this moment which is torturing us both. If you are willing to end it at once, you shall be free of it for ever. Tell me, upon your medal, yes or no, whether you have ever done those things.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How on earth can I tell?\" she was furious. \"Perhaps I have, ever so long ago, when I didn't know what I was doing, perhaps two or three times.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann had prepared himself for all possibilities. Reality must, therefore, be something which bears no relation to possibilities, any more than the stab of a knife in one's body bears to the gradual movement of the clouds overhead, since those words \"two or three times\" carved, as it were, a cross upon the living tissues of his heart. A strange thing, indeed, that those words, \"two or three times,\" nothing more than a few words, words uttered in the air, at a distance, could so lacerate a man's heart, as if they had actually pierced it, could sicken a man, like a poison that he had drunk. Instinctively Swann thought of the remark that he had heard at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's: \"I have never seen anything to beat it since the table-turning.\" The agony that he now suffered in no way resembled what he had supposed. Not only because, in the hours when he most entirely mistrusted her, he had rarely imagined such a culmination of evil, but because, even when he did imagine that offence, it remained vague, uncertain, was not clothed in the particular horror which had escaped with the words \"perhaps two or three times,\" was not armed with that specific cruelty, as different from anything that he had known as a new malady by which one is attacked for the first time. And yet this Odette, from whom all this evil sprang, was no less dear to him, was, on the contrary, more precious, as if, in proportion as his sufferings increased, there increased at the same time the price of the sedative, of the antidote which this woman alone possessed. He wished to pay her more attention, as one attends to a disease which one discovers, suddenly, to have grown more serious. He wished that the horrible thing which, she had told him, she had done \"two or three times\" might be prevented from occurring again. To ensure that, he must watch over Odette. People often say that, by pointing out to a man the faults of his mistress, you succeed only in strengthening his attachment to her, because he does not believe you; yet how much more so if he does! But, Swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect her? He might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any one woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how insane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins') to desire the possession\u2014as if that were ever possible\u2014of another person. Happily for Swann, beneath the mass of suffering which had invaded his soul like a conquering horde of barbarians, there lay a natural foundation, older, more placid, and silently laborious, like the cells of an injured organ which at once set to work to repair the damaged tissues, or the muscles of a paralysed limb which tend to recover their former movements. These older, these autochthonous in-dwellers in his soul absorbed all Swann's strength, for a while, in that obscure task of reparation which gives one an illusory sense of repose during convalescence, or after an operation. This time it was not so much\u2014as it ordinarily was\u2014in Swann's brain that the slackening of tension due to exhaustion took effect, it was rather in his heart. But all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur, and, like a dying animal that is once more stirred by the throes of a convulsion which was, apparently, ended, upon Swann's heart, spared for a moment only, the same agony returned of its own accord to trace the same cross again. He remembered those moonlit evenings, when, leaning back in the victoria that was taking him to the Rue La P\u00e9rouse, he would cultivate with voluptuous enjoyment the emotions of a man in love, ignorant of the poisoned fruit that such emotions must inevitably bear. But all those thoughts lasted for no more than a second, the time that it took him to raise his hand to his heart, to draw breath again and to contrive to smile, so as to dissemble his torment. Already he had begun to put further questions. For his jealousy, which had taken an amount of trouble, such as no enemy would have incurred, to strike him this mortal blow, to make him forcibly acquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known, his jealousy was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough, and sought to expose his bosom to an even deeper wound. Like an evil deity, his jealousy was inspiring Swann, was thrusting him on towards destruction. It was not his fault, but Odette's alone, if at first his punishment was not more severe\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My darling,\" he began again, \"it's all over now; was it with anyone I know?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, I swear it wasn't; besides, I think I exaggerated, I never really went as far as that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He smiled, and resumed with: \"Just as you like. It doesn't really matter, but it's unfortunate that you can't give me any name. If I were able to form an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking of her again. I say it for your own sake, because then I shouldn't bother you any more about it. It's so soothing to be able to form a clear picture of things in one's mind. What is really terrible is what one cannot imagine. But you've been so sweet to me; I don't want to tire you. I do thank you, with all my heart, for all the good that you have done me. I've quite finished now. Only one word more: how many times?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, Charles! can't you see, you're killing me? It's all ever so long ago. I've never given it a thought. Anyone would say that you were positively trying to put those ideas into my head again. And then you'd be a lot better off!\" she concluded, with unconscious stupidity but with intentional malice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I only wished to know whether it had been since I knew you. It's only natural. Did it happen here, ever? You can't give me any particular evening, so that I can remind myself what I was doing at the time? You understand, surely, that it's not possible that you don't remember with whom, Odette, my love.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I don't know; really, I don't. I think it was in the Bois, one evening when you came to meet us on the Island. You had been dining with the Princesse des Laumes,\" she added, happy to be able to furnish him with an exact detail, which testified to her veracity. \"At the next table there was a woman whom I hadn't seen for ever so long. She said to me, 'Come along round behind the rock, there, and look at the moonlight on the water!' At first I just yawned, and said, 'No, I'm too tired, and I'm quite happy where I am, thank you.' She swore there'd never been anything like it in the way of moonlight. 'I've heard that tale before,' I said to her; you see, I knew quite well what she was after.\" Odette narrated this episode almost as if it were a joke, either because it appeared to her to be quite natural, or because she thought that she was thereby minimising its importance, or else so as not to appear ashamed. But, catching sight of Swann's face, she changed her tone, and:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You are a fiend!\" she flung at him, \"you enjoy tormenting me, making me tell you lies, just so that you'll leave me in peace.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This second blow struck at Swann was even more excruciating than the first. Never had he supposed it to have been so recent an affair, hidden from his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it, not in a past which he had never known, but in evenings which he so well remembered, which he had lived through with Odette, of which he had supposed himself to have such an intimate, such an exhaustive knowledge, and which now assumed, retrospectively, an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty. In the midst of them parted, suddenly, a gaping chasm, that moment on the Island in the Bois de Boulogne. Without being intelligent, Odette had the charm of being natural. She had recounted, she had acted the little scene with so much simplicity that Swann, as he gasped for breath, could vividly see it: Odette yawning, the \"rock there,\"... He could hear her answer\u2014alas, how lightheartedly\u2014\"I've heard that tale before!\" He felt that she would tell him nothing more that evening, that no further revelation was to be expected for the present. He was silent for a time, then said to her:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My poor darling, you must forgive me; I know, I am hurting you dreadfully, but it's all over now; I shall never think of it again.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she saw that his eyes remained fixed upon the things that he did not know, and on that past era of their love, monotonous and soothing in his memory because it was vague, and now rent, as with a sword-wound, by the news of that minute on the Island in the Bois, by moonlight, while he was dining with the Princesse des Laumes. But he had so far acquired the habit of finding life interesting\u2014of marvelling at the strange discoveries that there were to be made in it\u2014that even while he was suffering so acutely that he did not believe it possible to endure such agony for any length of time, he was saying to himself: \"Life is indeed astonishing, and holds some fine surprises; it appears that vice is far more common than one has been led to believe. Here is a woman in whom I had absolute confidence, who looks so simple, so honest, who, in any case, even allowing that her morals are not strict, seemed quite normal and healthy in her tastes and inclinations. I receive a most improbable accusation, I question her, and the little that she admits reveals far more than I could ever have suspected.\" But he could not confine himself to these detached observations. He sought to form an exact estimate of the importance of what she had just told him, so as to know whether he might conclude that she had done these things often, and was likely to do them again. He repeated her words to himself: \"I knew quite well what she was after.\" \"Two or three times.\" \"I've heard that tale before.\" But they did not reappear in his memory unarmed; each of them held a knife with which it stabbed him afresh. For a long time, like a sick man who cannot restrain himself from attempting, every minute, to make the movement that, he knows, will hurt him, he kept on murmuring to himself: \"I'm quite happy where I am, thank you,\" \"I've heard that tale before,\" but the pain was so intense that he was obliged to stop. He was amazed to find that actions which he had always, hitherto, judged so lightly, had dismissed, indeed, with a laugh, should have become as serious to him as a disease which might easily prove fatal. He knew any number of women whom he could ask to keep an eye on Odette, but how was he to expect them to adjust themselves to his new point of view, and not to remain at that which for so long had been his own, which had always guided him in his voluptuous existence; not to say to him with a smile: \"You jealous monster, wanting to rob other people of their pleasure!\" By what trap-door, suddenly lowered, had he (who had never found, in the old days, in his love for Odette, any but the most refined of pleasures) been precipitated into this new circle of hell from which he could not see how he was ever to escape. Poor Odette! He wished her no harm. She was but half to blame. Had he not been told that it was her own mother who had sold her, when she was still little more than a child, at Nice, to a wealthy Englishman? But what an agonising truth was now contained for him in those lines of Alfred de Vigny's Journal d'un Po\u00e8te which he had previously read without emotion: \"When one feels oneself smitten by love for a woman, one ought to say to oneself, 'What are 'her surroundings? What has been her life?' All one's future happiness lies in the answer.\" Swann was astonished that such simple phrases, spelt over in his mind as, \"I've heard that tale before,\" or \"I knew quite well what she was after,\" could cause him so much pain. But he realised that what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed parts of the panoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that he had felt while Odette was telling her story. For it was the same anguish that he now was feeling afresh. It was no good, his knowing now,\u2014indeed, it was no good, as time went on, his having partly forgotten and altogether forgiven the offence\u2014whenever he repeated her words his old anguish refashioned him as he had been before Odette began to speak: ignorant, trustful; his merciless jealousy placed him once again, so that he might be effectively wounded by Odette's admission, in the position of a man who does not yet know the truth; and after several months this old story would still dumbfounder him, like a sudden revelation. He marvelled at the terrible recreative power of his memory. It was only by the weakening of that generative force, whose fecundity diminishes as age creeps over one, that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments. But, as soon as the power that any one of Odette's sentences had to make Swann suffer seemed to be nearly exhausted, lo and behold another, one of those to which he had hitherto paid least attention, almost a new sentence, came to relieve the first, and to strike at him with undiminished force. The memory of the evening on which he had dined with the Princesse des Laumes was painful to him, but it was no more than the centre, the core of his pain. That radiated vaguely round about it, overflowing into all the preceding and following days. And on whatever point in it he might intend his memory to rest, it was the whole of that season, during which the Verdurins had so often gone to dine upon the Island in the Bois, that sprang back to hurt him. So violently, that by slow degrees the curiosity which his jealousy was ever exciting in him was neutralised by his fear of the fresh tortures which he would be inflicting upon himself were he to satisfy it. He recognised that all the period of Odette's life which had elapsed before she first met him, a period of which he had never sought to form any picture in his mind, was not the featureless abstraction which he could vaguely see, but had consisted of so many definite, dated years, each crowded with concrete incidents. But were he to learn more of them, he feared lest her past, now colourless, fluid and supportable, might assume a tangible, an obscene form, with individual and diabolical features. And he continued to refrain from seeking a conception of it, not any longer now from laziness of mind, but from fear of suffering. He hoped that, some day, he might be able to hear the Island in the Bois, or the Princesse des Laumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old rending pain; meanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke Odette into furnishing him with fresh sentences, with the names of more places and people and of different events, which, when his malady was still scarcely healed, would make it break out again in another form\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, often enough, the things that he did not know, that he dreaded, now, to learn, it was Odette herself who, spontaneously and without thought of what she did, revealed them to him; for the gap which her vices made between her actual life and the comparatively innocent life which Swann had believed, and often still believed his mistress to lead, was far wider than she knew. A vicious person, always affecting the same air of virtue before people whom he is anxious to keep from having any suspicion of his vices, has no register, no gauge at hand from which he may ascertain how far those vices (their continuous growth being imperceptible by himself) have gradually segregated him from the normal ways of life. In the course of their cohabitation, in Odette's mind, with the memory of those of her actions which she concealed from Swann, her other, her innocuous actions were gradually coloured, infected by these, without her being able to detect anything strange in them, without their causing any explosion in the particular region of herself in which she made them live, but when she related them to Swann, he was overwhelmed by the revelation of the duplicity to which they pointed. One day, he was trying\u2014without hurting Odette\u2014to discover from her whether she had ever had any dealings with procuresses. He was, as a matter of fact, convinced that she had not; the anonymous letter had put the idea into his mind, but in a purely mechanical way; it had been received there with no credulity, but it had, for all that, remained there, and Swann, wishing to be rid of the burden\u2014a dead weight, but none the less disturbing\u2014of this suspicion, hoped that Odette would now extirpate it for ever\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh dear, no! Not that they don't simply persecute me to go to them,\" her smile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it was impossible should appear legitimate to Swann. \"There was one of them waited more than two hours for me yesterday, said she would give me any money I asked. It seems, there's an Ambassador who said to her, 'I'll kill myself if you don't bring her to me'\u2014meaning me! They told her I'd gone out, but she waited and waited, and in the end I had to go myself and speak to her, before she'd go away. I do wish you could have seen the way I tackled her; my maid was in the next room, listening, and told me I shouted fit to bring the house down:\u2014'But when you hear me say that I don't want to! The idea of such a thing, I don't like it at all! I should hope I'm still free to do as I please and when I please and where I please! If I needed the money, I could understand...' The porter has orders not to let her in again; he will tell her that I am out of town. Oh, I do wish I could have had you hidden somewhere in the room while I was talking to her. I know, you'd have been pleased, my dear. There's some good in your little Odette, you see, after all, though people do say such dreadful things about her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides, her very admissions\u2014when she made any\u2014of faults which she supposed him to have discovered, rather served Swann as a starting-point for fresh doubts than they put an end to the old. For her admissions never exactly coincided with his doubts. In vain might Odette expurgate her confession of all its essential part, there would remain in the accessories something which Swann had never yet imagined, which crushed him anew, and was to enable him to alter the terms of the problem of his jealousy. And these admissions he could never forget. His spirit carried them along, cast them aside, then cradled them again in its bosom, like corpses in a river. And they poisoned it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She spoke to him once of a visit that Forcheville had paid her on the day of the Paris-Murcie F\u00eate. \"What! you knew him as long ago as that? Oh, yes, of course you did,\" he corrected himself, so as not to shew that he had been ignorant of the fact. And suddenly he began to tremble at the thought that, on the day of the Paris-Murcie F\u00eate, when he had received that letter which he had so carefully preserved, she had been having luncheon, perhaps, with Forcheville at the Maison d'Or. She swore that she had not. \"Still, the Maison d'Or reminds me of something or other which, I knew at the time, wasn't true,\" he pursued, hoping to frighten her. \"Yes that I hadn't been there at all that evening when I told you I had just come from there, and you had been looking for me at Pr\u00e9vost's,\" she replied (judging by his manner that he knew) with a firmness that was based not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity, a fear of crossing Swann, which her own self-respect made her anxious to conceal, and a desire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if she chose. And so she struck him with all the sharpness and force of a headsman wielding his axe, and yet could not be charged with cruelty, since she was quite unconscious of hurting him; she even began to laugh, though this may perhaps, it is true, have been chiefly to keep him from thinking that she was ashamed, at all, or confused. \"It's quite true, I hadn't been to the Maison Dor\u00e9e. I was coming away from Forcheville's. I had, really, been to Pr\u00e9vost's\u2014that wasn't a story\u2014and he met me there and asked me to come in and look at his prints. But some one else came to see him. I told you that I was coming from the Maison d'Or because I was afraid you might be angry with me. It was rather nice of me, really, don't you see? I admit, I did wrong, but at least I'm telling you all about it now, a'n't I? What have I to gain by not telling you, straight, that I lunched with him on the day of the Paris-Murcie F\u00eate, if it were true? Especially as at that time we didn't know one another quite so well as we do now, did we, dear?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He smiled back at her with the sudden, craven weakness of the utterly spiritless creature which these crushing words had made of him. And so, even in the months of which he had never dared to think again, because they had been too happy, in those months when she had loved him, she was already lying to him! Besides that moment (that first evening on which they had \"done a cattleya\") when she had told him that she was coming from the Maison Dor\u00e9e, how many others must there have been, each of them covering a falsehood of which Swann had had no suspicion. He recalled how she had said to him once: \"I need only tell Mme. Verdurin that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.\" From himself too, probably, many times when she had glibly uttered such words as explain a delay or justify an alteration of the hour fixed for a meeting, those moments must have hidden, without his having the least inkling of it at the time, an engagement that she had had with some other man, some man to whom she had said: \"I need only tell Swann that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.\" And beneath all his most pleasant memories, beneath the simplest words that Odette had ever spoken to him in those old days, words which he had believed as though they were the words of a Gospel, beneath her daily actions which she had recounted to him, beneath the most ordinary places, her dressmaker's flat, the Avenue du Bois, the Hippodrome, he could feel (dissembled there, by virtue of that temporal superfluity which, after the most detailed account of how a day has been spent, always leaves something over, that may serve as a hiding place for certain unconfessed actions), he could feel the insinuation of a possible undercurrent of falsehood which debased for him all that had remained most precious, his happiest evenings, the Rue La P\u00e9rouse itself, which Odette must constantly have been leaving at other hours than those of which she told him; extending the power of the dark horror that had gripped him when he had heard her admission with regard to the Maison Dor\u00e9e, and, like the obscene creatures in the 'Desolation of Nineveh,' shattering, stone by stone, the whole edifice of his past.... If, now, he turned aside whenever his memory repeated the cruel name of the Maison Dor\u00e9e it was because that name recalled to him, no longer, as, such a little time since, at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's party, the good fortune which he long had lost, but a misfortune of which he was now first aware. Then it befell the Maison Dor\u00e9e, as it had befallen the Island in the Bois, that gradually its name ceased to trouble him. For what we suppose to be our love, our jealousy are, neither of them, single, continuous and individual passions. They are composed of an infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, each of which is ephemeral, although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the impression of continuity, the illusion of unity. The life of Swann's love, the fidelity of his jealousy, were formed out of death, of infidelity, of innumerable desires, innumerable doubts, all of which had Odette for their object. If he had remained for any length of time without seeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by others. But the presence of Odette continued to sow in Swann's heart alternate seeds of love and suspicion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of which she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage, under penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come; he must instantly accompany her home, to \"do a cattleya,\" and the desire which she pretended to have for him was so sudden, so inexplicable, so imperious, the kisses which she lavished on him were so demonstrative and so unfamiliar, that this brutal and unnatural fondness made Swann just as unhappy as any lie or unkind action. One evening when he had thus, in obedience to her command, gone home with her, and while she was interspersing her kisses with passionate words, in strange contrast to her habitual coldness, he thought suddenly that he heard a sound; he rose, searched everywhere and found nobody, but he had not the courage to return to his place by her side; whereupon she, in a towering rage, broke a vase, with \"I never can do anything right with you, you impossible person!\" And he was left uncertain whether she had not actually had some man concealed in the room, whose jealousy she had wished to wound, or else to inflame his senses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes he repaired to 'gay' houses, hoping to learn something about Odette, although he dared not mention her name. \"I have a little thing here, you're sure to like,\" the 'manageress' would greet him, and he would stay for an hour or so, talking dolefully to some poor girl who sat there astonished that he went no further. One of them, who was still quite young and attractive, said to him once, \"Of course, what I should like would be to find a real friend, then he might be quite certain, I should never go with any other men again.\" \"Indeed, do you think it possible for a woman really to be touched by a man's being in love with her, and never to be unfaithful to him?\" asked Swann anxiously. \"Why, surely! It all depends on their characters!\" Swann could not help making the same remarks to these girls as would have delighted the Princesse des Laumes. To the one who was in search of a friend he said, with a smile: \"But how nice of you, you've put on blue eyes, to go with your sash.\" \"And you too, you've got blue cuffs on.\" \"What a charming conversation we are having, for a place of this sort! I'm not boring you, am I; or keeping you?\" \"No, I've nothing to do, thank you. If you bored me I should say so. But I love hearing you talk.\" \"I am highly flattered.... Aren't we behaving prettily?\" he asked the 'manageress,' who had just looked in. \"Why, yes, that's just what I was saying to myself, how sensibly they're behaving! But that's how it is! People come to my house now, just to talk. The Prince was telling me, only the other day, that he's far more comfortable here than with his wife. It seems that, nowadays, all the society ladies are like that; a perfect scandal, I call it. But I'll leave you in peace now, I know when I'm not wanted,\" she ended discreetly, and left Swann with the girl who had the blue eyes. But presently he rose and said good-bye to her. She had ceased to interest him. She did not know Odette\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The painter having been ill, Dr. Cottard recommended a sea-voyage; several of the 'faithful' spoke of accompanying him; the Verdurins could not face the prospect of being left alone in Paris, so first of all hired, and finally purchased a yacht; thus Odette was constantly going on a cruise. Whenever she had been away for any length of time, Swann would feel that he was beginning to detach himself from her, but, as though this moral distance were proportionate to the physical distance between them, whenever he heard that Odette had returned to Paris, he could not rest without seeing her. Once, when they had gone away, as everyone thought, for a month only, either they succumbed to a series of temptations, or else M. Verdurin had cunningly arranged everything beforehand, to please his wife, and disclosed his plans to the 'faithful' only as time went on; anyhow, from Algiers they flitted to Tunis; then to Italy, Greece, Constantinople, Asia Minor. They had been absent for nearly a year, and Swann felt perfectly at ease and almost happy. Albeit M. Verdurin had endeavoured to persuade the pianist and Dr. Cottard that their respective aunt and patients had no need of them, and that, in any event, it was most rash to allow Mme. Cottard to return to Paris, where, Mme. Verdurin assured him, a revolution had just broken out, he was obliged to grant them their liberty at Constantinople. And the painter came home with them. One day, shortly after the return of these four travellers, Swann, seeing an omnibus approach him, labelled 'Luxembourg,' and having some business there, had jumped on to it and had found himself sitting opposite Mme. Cottard, who was paying a round of visits to people whose 'day' it was, in full review order, with a plume in her hat, a silk dress, a muff, an umbrella (which do for a parasol if the rain kept off), a card-case, and a pair of white gloves fresh from the cleaners. Wearing these badges of rank, she would, in fine weather, go on foot from one house to another in the same neighbourhood, but when she had to proceed to another district, would make use of a transfer-ticket on the omnibus. For the first minute or two, until the natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched surface of the doctor's-wife, not being certain, either, whether she ought to mention the Verdurins before Swann, she produced, quite naturally, in her slow and awkward, but not unattractive voice, which, every now and then, was completely drowned by the rattling of the omnibus, topics selected from those which she had picked up and would repeat in each of the score of houses up the stairs of which she clambered in the course of an afternoon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I needn't ask you, M. Swann, whether a man so much in the movement as yourself has been to the Mirlitons, to see the portrait by Machard that the whole of Paris is running after. Well, and what do you think of it? Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse? It's the same in every house in Paris now, no one will speak of anything else but Machard's portrait; you aren't smart, you aren't really cultured, you aren't up-to-date unless you give an opinion on Machard's portrait.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann having replied that he had not seen this portrait, Mme. Cottard was afraid that she might have hurt his feelings by obliging him to confess the omission\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, that's quite all right! At least you have the courage to be quite frank about it. You don't consider yourself disgraced because you haven't seen Machard's portrait. I do think that so nice of you. Well now, I have seen it; opinion is divided, you know, there are some people who find it rather laboured, like whipped cream, they say; but I think it's just ideal. Of course, she's not a bit like the blue and yellow ladies that our friend Biche paints. That's quite clear. But I must tell you, perfectly frankly (you'll think me dreadfully old-fashioned, but I always say just what I think), that I don't understand his work. I can quite see the good points there are in his portrait of my husband; oh, dear me, yes; and it's certainly less odd than most of what he does, but even then he had to give the poor man a blue moustache! But Machard! Just listen to this now, the husband of my friend, I am on my way to see at this very moment (which has given me the very great pleasure of your company), has promised her that, if he is elected to the Academy (he is one of the Doctor's colleagues), he will get Machard to paint her portrait. So she's got something to look forward to! I have another friend who insists that she'd rather have Leloir. I'm only a wretched Philistine, and I've no doubt Leloir has perhaps more knowledge of painting even than Machard. But I do think that the most important thing about a portrait, especially when it's going to cost ten thousand francs, is that it should be like, and a pleasant likeness, if you know what I mean.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having exhausted this topic, to which she had been inspired by the loftiness of her plume, the monogram on her card-case, the little number inked inside each of her gloves by the cleaner, and the difficulty of speaking to Swann about the Verdurins, Mme. Cottard, seeing that they had still a long way to go before they would reach the corner of the Rue Bonaparte, where the conductor was to set her down, listened to the promptings of her heart, which counselled other words than these\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Your ears must have been burning,\" she ventured, \"while we were on the yacht with Mme. Verdurin. We were talking about you all the time.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was genuinely astonished, for he supposed that his name was never uttered in the Verdurins' presence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You see,\" Mme. Cottard went on, \"Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy was there; need I say more? When Odette is anywhere it's never long before she begins talking about you. And you know quite well, it isn't nasty things she says. What! you don't believe me!\" she went on, noticing that Svrann looked sceptical. And, carried away by the sincerity of her conviction, without putting any evil meaning into the word, which she used purely in the sense in which one employs it to speak of the affection that unites a pair of friends: \"Why, she adores you! No, indeed; I'm sure it would never do to say anything against you when she was about; one would soon be taught one's place! Whatever we might be doing, if we were looking at a picture, for instance, she would say, 'If only we had him here, he's the man who could tell us whether it's genuine or not. There's no one like him for that.' And all day long she would be saying, 'What can he be doing just now? I do hope, he's doing a little work! It's too dreadful that a fellow with such gifts as he has should be so lazy.' (Forgive me, won't you.) 'I can see him this very moment; he's thinking of us, he's wondering where we are.' Indeed, she used an expression which I thought very pretty at the time. M. Verdurin asked her, 'How in the world can you see what he's doing, when he's a thousand miles away?' And Odette answered, 'Nothing is impossible to the eye of a friend.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, I assure you, I'm not saying it just to flatter you; you have a true friend in her, such as one doesn't often find. I can tell you, besides, in case you don't know it, that you're the only one. Mme. Verdurin told me as much herself on our last day with them (one talks more freely, don't you know, before a parting), 'I don't say that Odette isn't fond of us, but anything that we may say to her counts for very little beside what Swann might say.' Oh, mercy, there's the conductor stopping for me; here have I been chatting away to you, and would have gone right past the Rue Bonaparte, and never noticed... Will you be so very kind as to tell me whether my plume is straight?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Mme. Cottard withdrew from her muff, to offer it to Swann, a white-gloved hand from which there floated, with a transier-ticket, an atmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus, blended with the harsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid. And Swann felt himself overflowing with gratitude to her, as well as to Mme. Verdurin (and almost to Odette, for the feeling that he now entertained for her was no longer tinged with pain, was scarcely even to be described, now, as love), while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with loving eyes, as she gallantly threaded her way along the Rue Bonaparte, her plume erect, her skirt held up in one hand, while in the other she clasped her umbrella and her card-case, so that its monogram could be seen, her muff dancing in the air before her as she went\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To compete with and so to stimulate the moribund feelings that Swann had for Odette, Mme. Cottard, a wiser physician, in this case, than ever her husband would have been, had grafted among them others more normal, feelings of gratitude, of friendship, which in Swann's mind were to make Odette seem again more human (more like other women, since other women could inspire the same feelings in him), were to hasten her final transformation back into that Odette, loved with an undisturbed affection, who had taken him home one evening after a revel at the painter's, to drink orangeade with Forcheville, that Odette with whom Swann had calculated that he might live in happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In former times, having often thought with terror that a day must come when he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had determined to keep a sharp look-out, and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to escape him, to cling tightly to it and to hold it back. But now, to the faintness of his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in his desire to remain her lover. For a man cannot change, that is to say become another person, while he continues to obey the dictates of the self which he has ceased to be. Occasionally the name, if it caught his eye in a newspaper, of one of the men whom he supposed to have been Odette's lovers, reawakened his jealousy. But it was very slight, and, inasmuch as it proved to him that he had not completely emerged from that period in which he had so keenly suffered\u2014though in it he had also known a way of feeling so intensely happy\u2014and that the accidents of his course might still enable him to catch an occasional glimpse, stealthily and at a distance, of its beauties, this jealousy gave him, if anything, an agreeable thrill, as to the sad Parisian, when he has left Venice behind him and must return to France, a last mosquito proves that Italy and summer are still not too remote. But, as a rule, with this particular period of his life from which he was emerging, when he made an effort, if not to remain in it, at least to obtain, while still he might, an uninterrupted view of it, he discovered that already it was too late; he would have looked back to distinguish, as it might be a landscape that was about to disappear, that love from which he had departed, but it is so difficult to enter into a state of complete duality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle of a feeling which one has ceased to possess, that very soon, the clouds gathering in his brain, he could see nothing, he would abandon the attempt, would take the glasses from his nose and wipe them; and he told himself that he would do better to rest for a little, that there would be time enough later on, and settled back into his corner with as little curiosity, with as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap down over his eyes so as to get some sleep in the railway-carriage that is drawing him, he feels, faster and faster, out of the country in which he has lived for so long, and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip away from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell. Indeed, like the same traveller, if he does not awake until he has crossed the frontier and is again in France, when Swann happened to alight, close at hand, upon something which proved that Forcheville had been Odette's lover, he discovered that it caused him no pain, that love was now utterly remote, and he regretted that he had had no warning of the moment in which he had emerged from it for ever. And just as, before kissing Odette for the first time, he had sought to imprint upon his memory the face that for so long had been familiar, before it was altered by the additional memory of their kiss, so he could have wished\u2014in thought at least\u2014to have been in a position to bid farewell, while she still existed, to that Odette who had inspired love in him and jealousy, to that Odette who had caused him so to suffer, and whom now he would never see again. He was mistaken. He was destined to see her once again, a few weeks later. It was while he was asleep, in the twilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme. Verdurin, Dr. Cottard, a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify, the painter, Odette, Napoleon III and my grandfather, along a path which followed the line of the coast, and overhung the sea, now at a great height, now by a few feet only, so that they were continually going up and down; those of the party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to those who were still climbing; what little daylight yet remained was failing, and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on them. Now and then the waves dashed against the cliff, and Swann could feel on his cheek a shower of freezing spray. Odette told him to wipe this off, but he could not, and felt confused and helpless in her company, as well as because he was in his nightshirt. He hoped that, in the darkness, this might pass unnoticed; Mme. Verdurin, however, fixed her astonished gaze upon him for an endless moment, in which he saw her face change its shape, her nose grow longer, while beneath it there sprouted a heavy moustache. He turned away to examine Odette; her cheeks were pale, with little fiery spots, her features drawn and ringed with shadows; but she looked back at him with eyes welling with affection, ready to detach themselves like tears and to fall upon his face, and he felt that he loved her so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him at once. Suddenly Odette turned her wrist, glanced at a tiny watch, and said: \"I must go.\" She took leave of everyone, in the same formal manner, without taking Swann aside, without telling him where they were to meet that evening, or next day. He dared not ask, he would have liked to follow her, he was obliged, without turning back in her direction, to answer with a smile some question by Mme. Verdurin; but his heart was frantically beating, he felt that he now hated Odette, he would gladly have crushed those eyes which, a moment ago, he had loved so dearly, have torn the blood into those lifeless cheeks. He continued to climb with Mme. Verdurin, that is to say that each step took him farther from Odette, who was going downhill, and in the other direction. A second passed and it was many hours since she had left him. The painter remarked to Swann that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. \"They had obviously arranged it between them,\" he added; \"they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn't say good-bye together; it might have looked odd. She is his mistress.\" The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavoured to console him. \"After all, she is quite right,\" he said to the young man, drying his eyes for him and taking off the fez to make him feel more at ease. \"I've advised her to do that, myself, a dozen times. Why be so distressed? He was obviously the man to understand her.\" So Swann reasoned with himself, for the young man whom he had failed, at first, to identify, was himself also; like certain novelists, he had distributed his own personality between two characters, him who was the 'first person' in the dream, and another whom he saw before him, capped with a fez\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association of ideas, then a certain modification of the Baron's usual physiognomy, and lastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honour across his breast, had made Swann give that name; but actually, and in everything that the person who appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him, it was indeed Forcheville. For, from an incomplete and changing set of images, Swann in his sleep drew false deductions, enjoying, at the same time, such creative power that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple act of division, like certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he felt in his own palm he modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought that he was clasping, and out of feelings and impressions of which he was not yet conscious, he brought about sudden vicissitudes which, by a chain of logical sequences, would produce, at definite points in his dream, the person required to receive his love or to startle him awake. In an instant night grew black about him; an alarum rang, the inhabitants ran past him, escaping from their blazing houses; he could hear the thunder of the surging waves, and also of his own heart, which, with equal violence, was anxiously beating in his breast. Suddenly the speed of these palpitations redoubled, he felt a pain, a nausea that were inexplicable; a peasant, dreadfully burned, flung at him as he passed: \"Come and ask Charlus where Odette spent the night with her friend. He used to go about with her, and she tells him everything. It was they that started the fire.\" It was his valet, come to awaken him, and saying:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sir, it is eight o'clock, and the barber is here. I have told him to call again in an hour.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But these words, as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which Swann was submerged, did not reach his consciousness without undergoing that refraction which turns a ray of light, at the bottom of a bowl of water, into another sun; just as, a moment earlier, the sound of the door-bell, swelling in the depths of his abyss of sleep into the clangour of an alarum, had engendered the episode of the fire. Meanwhile the scenery of his dream-stage scattered in dust, he opened his eyes, heard for the last time the boom of a wave in the sea, grown very distant. He touched his cheek. It was dry. And yet he could feel the sting of the cold spray, and the taste of salt on his lips. He rose, and dressed himself. He had made the barber come early because he had written, the day before, to my grandfather, to say that he was going, that afternoon, to Combray, having learned that Mme. de Cambremer\u2014Mlle. Legrandin that had been\u2014was spending a few days there. The association in his memory of her young and charming face with a place in the country which he had not visited for so long, offered him a combined attraction which had made him decide at last to leave Paris for a while. As the different changes and chances that bring us into the company of certain other people in this life do not coincide with the periods in which we are in love with those people, but, overlapping them, may occur before love has begun, and may be repeated after love is ended, the earliest appearances, in our life, of a creature who is destined to afford us pleasure later on, assume retrospectively in our eyes a certain value as an indication, a warning, a presage. It was in this fashion that Swann had often carried back his mind to the image of Odette, encountered in the theatre, on that first evening when he had no thought of ever seeing her again\u2014and that he now recalled the party at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's, at which he had introduced General de Frober-ville to Mme. de Cambremer. So manifold are our interests in life that it is not uncommon that, on a single occasion, the foundations of a happiness which does not yet exist are laid down simultaneously with aggravations of a grief from which we are still suffering. And, no doubt, that might have occurred to Swann elsewhere than at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's. Who, indeed, can say whether, in the event of his having gone, that evening, somewhere else, other happinesses, other griefs would not have come to him, which, later, would have appeared to have been inevitable? But what did seem to him to have been inevitable was what had indeed taken place, and he was not far short of seeing something providential in the fact that he had at last decided to go to Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that evening, because his mind, anxious to admire the richness of invention that life shews, and incapable of facing a difficult problem for any length of time, such as to discover what, actually, had been most to be wished for, came to the conclusion that the sufferings through which he had passed that evening, and the pleasures, at that time unsuspected, which were already being brought to birth,\u2014the exact balance between which was too difficult to establish\u2014were linked by a sort of concatenation of necessity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But while, an hour after his awakening, he was giving instructions to the barber, so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become disarranged on the journey, he thought once again of his dream; he saw once again, as he had felt them close beside him, Odette's pallid complexion, her too thin cheeks, her drawn features, her tired eyes, all the things which\u2014in the course of those successive bursts of affection which had made of his enduring love for Odette a long oblivion of the first impression that he had formed of her\u2014he had ceased to observe after the first few days of their intimacy, days to which, doubtless, while he slept, his memory had returned to seek the exact sensation of those things. And with that old, intermittent fatuity, which reappeared in him now that he was no longer unhappy, and lowered, at the same time, the average level of his morality, he cried out in his heart: \"To think that I have wasted years of my life, that I have longed for death, that the greatest love that I have ever known has been for a woman who did not please me, who was not in my style!\"1Embed"},

Hell's frozen over.\n\nChristmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.\nBeneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks\nuncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting.  Peace has\nbeen miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.  Salvation\nArmy Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.  And now, as\nnight falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:\n\"JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till\nChristmas.\"\n\nThe streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir\nstore, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-\nyear old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is\noverflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key\nchains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a\nBatman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously\nwants more.\n\nMom drags him off past another store window, this one full of\nSCRAP METAL, with a sign reading \"AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE\nBATWING -- $19.95 and up.\"  A PANHANDLER is perched at the\nentrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt\nwith the familiar yellow-and-black logo.  In Gotham this\nwinter, Batmania is everywhere...\nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\nTwo hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged\nblizzard.  The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are\nall but empty of cars.  A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a\nPanzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...\n\n...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all\nbundled up in mufflers and parkas.  Unbothered by the weather,\nthey walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to\nthe few passersby.\n\nThey've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of \"Silent\nNight\" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow\nchains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.  Its sides\nare decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice\ncream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time\nof year.\n\nA streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck\nas it rounds a corner.  The CAROLERS carol.  Then --\n\n-- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the\nsound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.\n\nEXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nAround the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.  The windows\nhave blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot\nSECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as\nROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through\nthe shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.\n\nCAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a\nspray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR\nBAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...\n\nThe REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the\ntruck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later\nSLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.\n\nSIRENS HOWL.  A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a\ntrifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing\ninto a drift.\n\nINT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the\nsnow -- no traction.  They're about to climb out and give\nchase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the\nSalvation Army SANTA...\n\n...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.  The\nwindshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA\nraces off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already\nburdened with LOOT.\n\nEXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nMORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's\ndifficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a\nfoot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.  The COP CARS skid\nto a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.  By now, of\ncourse, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of\nthe plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.\n\nEXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\n\nSNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy\nsouls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.  A couple\nof DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to\navoid getting run over.  Every time they poke their heads out,\nanother SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.\n\nThe ROBBERS fan out in various directions.  These guys are\nobviously going to get away clean -- unless...\n\nThe DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is\nblazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...\n\nINT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nMORE SIRENS.  A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the\nlong wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few\nstreets which is relatively clear.  The COP at the wheel goes\nwide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.\n\nBefore their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross\nstreets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.\nBringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.\n\nCOP\nWhat the hell -- ?\n\nEXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nBRAKES SQUEAL.  Several squad cars are now massed at the\nentrance to the park -- but there's one problem.  The city's\nsnow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance\nis blocked off with SAWHORSES reading \"CLOSED TO TRAFFIC.\"  A\nhuge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all\nthey can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the\nsnowmobiles vanish into the trees.\n\nThe COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct\na plan.  A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls\nof the park.  Another is at his car, barking into a radio\nmike:\n\nCOP WITH MIKE\nYeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles!\n(pause)\nSo what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot??\n\nALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.  The COPS peer down the\nlong corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK\nVEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of\nstopping...\n\nTHE BATMOBILE!!  COPS dive left and right.  A split-second\nlater...\n\n...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the\nfront of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING\nthe drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the\nice and snow on the paths before it into water!\n\nThe BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.  The COPS\nget to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating.  One of\nthem mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:\n\nCOP I\n...That was Batman.\n\nCOP II\nNO SHIT!!\n\nCOP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others\nfollow suit.  ENGINES REV.  As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared\na path, they might as well join in the chase...\n\nEXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT\n\nTWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS\nwith BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are\ntrudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of\nspeeding SKIDOOS.  Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the\nhorizon...\n\n...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,\nBURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH.  Thrilled beyond words, they\nWHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT\n\nHis face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting\nfrom the front of the car.  Cool as ever -- approaching the\nchase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar\ndisplay on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.\n\nEXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe cops follow along in BATMAN's path.  The lead car LOSES\nCONTROL and plows headlong into a drift.  The DRIVER jams the\npedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the\nice.  He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other\nCOPS race past him on foot.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN\n\nThe various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING\nover the hilly terrain of the park.  He spots two of them up\nahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the\nleft and right...\n\nANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING\n\nPODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate\ninto place.  The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING\nTORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and\ndisappear.\n\nANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING\n\nThe DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears\nto be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,\nGAINING FAST.  He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN\nalways seems to follow.  Just as he approaches the crest of a\nhill...\n\n...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE.  The\nforce of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off.  His LOOT lands\nin the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --\nsailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks\nbeyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.\n\nANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING\n\nThis ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy.  When he sees\nthe shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a\nGROVE OF TREES.  The trees are too closely spaced for the\ntorpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and\nexplodes harmlessly.\n\nThe ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the\nBatmobile can't follow either.  But BATMAN has a Plan B.  As\nhe drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,\npassing the snowmobile on its left.  A STEEL SPIKE attached to\na cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES\nITSELF into a distant TREE.\n\nThe cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the\npath of the second SNOWMOBILE.  The vehicle crashes into the\ntrunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-\nheels into a drift.\n\nIn the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,\nready for mop-up duty.  BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits\nthe brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.\nHe's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,\nwhizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.\n\nEXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT\n\nWe're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS\nPEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm.  They\nlook on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and\ndisappear over a crest of a hill...\n\nEXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4\n\nThey bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge\nof a frozen-over LAKE.  With the roar of the Batmobile behind\nthem, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.\nSmiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface\nof the lake.\n\nNow the Batmobile crests the ridge.  The car's weight tips\nsuddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.\nBATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just\nin time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope.  The\nprow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --\n\n-- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack.  The left\nfront tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is\nsliding forward.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN\n\nHe shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock\nthe car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no\npurchase.  He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.\nGrimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --\n\nEXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE\n\n-- and the trunk pops open.  An industrial-strength GRAPPLING\nHOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of\nthe hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,\nhauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN\n\nSuspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE\nvanishing into the distance.  He opens (yet another) panel on\nthe dashboard...\n\nEXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4\n\nThe ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up.  They're almost\nhalfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.\nAll at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...\n\nFireworks?  No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,\nhitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.\nJAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water\n-- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they\nknow what's hit them.\n\nANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING\n\nThe last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled\nnot with toys, but precious stones.  He approaches the edge of\nthe park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky\noutcroppings.  He squirts out from behind a boulder into a\nclearing...\n\n...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts\nbehind him.  The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of\nthe boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying\nto build up speed.\n\nAs it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the\nflamethrower.  But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of\nthe Batmobile rises half a foot --\n\n-- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air.  A heavy NET is\nstrung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA\nCLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his\ntracks.\n\nImmobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the\nBatmobile barrels down.  When the great black machine is\nalmost atop him --\n\n-- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded\nframe.\n\nEXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT\n\nThe COPS are spread out near the entrance.  They've rounded up\nthe other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot.  They hear a\ndull ROAR in the distance...\n\n...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,\ndragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his\nsnowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.\n\nAt the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the\nBatmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.\nWithout stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and\nvanishes whence it came.  A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his\ncolleague and SHRUGS:\n\nCOP I\n...Merry Christmas.\n\nThe second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.\n\nCOP II\nGift-wrapped and everything.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. CITY HALL - DAY\n\nTV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,\nwith a sizable crowd watching from the street.  COMMISSIONER\nGORDON is reading from a prepared statement.\n\nGORDON\nAfter a high-speed chase -- over $750,000\nin precious jewels were recovered intact\nby the police force -- working in concert\nwith Batman.\n\nAt the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the\ncrowd:\n\nVOICES IN CROWD\nTAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE\nSTREETS!  TAKE BACK THE --\n\nGORDON winces and lets out a sigh.  The CHANTERS are a group\nof pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early\ntwenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman\nSWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.  They're\nobviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we\nsaw in the park.\n\nGORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs\nthe mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard\nover the din.\n\nGORDON\nI would like to stress -- that while this\ncity enjoys a special relationship with\nBatman --\n(louder)\n-- we do not condone vigilantism --\n(practically screaming)\n-- IN ANY FORM.\n\nIt's no use.  He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who\ncontinue to shout and shake their fists.  Giving up, he\nreturns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a\nhuff.  The RED BERETS CHEER.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN\n\nThe evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham\nSquare.  A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a\nRED BERET as \"MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE\nBAT.\"\n\nSEKOWSKY\nAnd hey!  Where does this --\n(BLEEP; expletive deleted)\n-- Gordon get off calling us ?\nWe're not breakin' any laws.  We're a\ngroup of concerned citizens, that's all --\njust like Batman.\n\nWOMAN IN CROWD\nYou people are nothing but hoodlums!\n\nSEKOWSKY\nHey, lady -- we're out here on patrol\nriskin' our necks to protect old biddies\nlike you.\n(into mike)\nIf this lame-o Gordon could do his job --\n\nMORE CATCALLS from the crowd.  The picture jumps suddenly as a\nminicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be\nbreaking out.  Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV\nscreen, placing us in:\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nwhere ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview\nwith extreme dismay.  As he trims the crusts from a pair of\nhearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.\n\nALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.\nOnscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered\nthe mike...\n\nSEKOWSKY (on TV)\nWe're provin' that the spirit of Batman is\nalive in this city.  We're gonna take back\nthe streets!\n\nSEKOWSKY raises a fist.  Behind him, his CRONIES begin to\nchant: \"TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!\"\nIncensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and\nflicks it off.\n\nHe turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.\n\"Good King Wenceslas\" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED\nsets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a\nSterling silver tea service.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped\nover one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big\nmahogany desk.  He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a\nside drawer.\n\nThe drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER\nCLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads \"THOMAS WAYNE\nMURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.\nUnidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed.\"  ALFRED digs\naround beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at\nthe rear of the drawer.\n\nGears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the\nwall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE\nSTAIRWAY which descends into darkness...\n\nINT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\n\nDescending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.\n\"Good King Wenceslas\" is on the speakers down here as well.\nAcross a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,\nwrapped in a tarp.\n\nALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea\nservice down.  He glances up at the bank of video monitors and\nsees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels\nsimultaneously.  He scans the cave, but there's no trace of\nBRUCE.\n\nALFRED\nSir?  -- MASTER BRUCE??\n\nAs if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant\nrecesses of the cavern.  ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE\nbehind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF\nA BOTTOMLESS ABYSS.\n\nBRUCE\nI'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you.\n\nHe's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --\nbut he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,\nbuckled about his waist.  Clutching a bundle, he hangs in\nmidair for a moment, dangling over the void.  ALFRED slowly\nregains his composure:\n\nALFRED\nI took the liberty of preparing tea.\n(indicating tbe monitors)\nI take it you've been watching the news?\n\nBRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview\nand nods.\n\nBRUCE\nYeah...lot of crazy people in this world.\n\nBRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.  He kicks off\non the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the\nBatcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.  Preoccupied, he drops\nhis mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black\nfabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,\nconnected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.\n\nALFRED\nI should inform you...Christmas is\napproaching, and we've received our annual\nsolicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.\n(eyeing the equipment)\nIf I may inquire...?\n\nBRUCE\nOh, yeah.  Watch this.\n\nBRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the\ntubing.  The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --\nstiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably\nlike the skeleton of an umbrella.\n\nALFRED\nMost ingenious, sir.  What exactly  it?\n\nBRUCE\nWhat does it look like?\n\nALFRED\nTo the untrained eye, sir, it looks\nremarkably like...the skeleton of an\numbrella.\n\nSounds good.  BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over,\nsmiles slyly.\n\nBRUCE\nGood guess, Alfred.  That's exactly right.\n\nBRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss.  He\nsits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap,\npours a cup of tea.\n\nALFRED\nSplendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad\nyou're putting your time to such\nproductive use.\n(beat)\nNow -- the Toy Fund.  Our contribution\nlast year was a half-million dollars...\n\nBRUCE\nWe can do better than that.\n\nALFRED\nThen there's the foster-parents program...\nthe Gotham homeless crusade...\n\nBRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich.  He seems\noddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts\nare obviously a million miles away.  ALFRED looks on,\nconcerned:\n\nALFRED (cont.)\nIs something troubling you, sir?\n\nBRUCE\nYeah...the holidays, I guess.  Always gets\nme thinking about...\n(he changes the subject)\nAnd to tell you the truth, I'm a little --\nconcerned about Vicki.\n\nALFRED\n(anxiously)\nMiss Vale, sir...?\n\nBRUCE\nYeah.  I've been thinking about it lately.\nThinking about it a lot...\n(gravely; shaking his head)\n...and I still can't figure out what to\nget her for Christmas.\n\nBRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED\nheaves an audible sigh of relief as we\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PRISON CELL - DAY\n\nTIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare\nconcrete wall.  Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen\nof them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons,\ncardinals, titwillows...\n\nCAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY\nODD FIGURE in prison greys.  A CANARY, perched on his\nshoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy,\ncracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS\nwith quick, birdlike strokes.\n\nMR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems\nhis skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is\n\"obscene.\"  Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports\nhimself with overblown, theatrical dignity.  Fastidious and\npreening, he does not suffer insults lightly.\n\nCAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars --\nand we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged.  A PRISON\nGUARD arrives to slide back his cell door...\n\nGUARD\nUp and at 'em, Pengy.  -- Pengy?\n\nMR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to\nacknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname.\n\nGUARD (cont.)\nBoniface...\n\nMR. BONIFACE finally turns.  With an expression of extreme\ndistaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the\ncanary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out.\n\nINT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nMR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from\nthe WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD.\n\nPAROLE OFFICER\nYou want to return the money you stole.\n\nBONIFACE\nIntact.  The map will show you where it's\nburied.\n\nThe PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP.\n\nPAROLE OFFICER\nAll of it.  Forty-two million dollars.\n\nMR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds\nthe mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to\nbear.\n\nPAROLE OFFICER II\nWhy this sudden change of heart?\n\nMR. BONIFACE\nGentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in\nfull.  I want to be a part of civilized\nsociety!\n(oozing sincerity)\nPrison life is not for me.  The guilt, the\nfear, the constant shame...one meets a\ndisturbingly low class of people.\n\nPAROLE OFFICER II\nSure, but -- forty-two million dollars??\n\nMR. BONIFACE nods plaintively.  It's quite a perfomlance.  He\ndabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and\nhe's the delicate type...\n\nWARDEN\nHis record's clean.  Thirteen years\nwithout an incident.\n\nATTORNEY\nI'd like to point out, my client's put his\ntime to good use.  A student of\nornithology...articles published in\nseveral respected journals...\n\nThe PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird\nWorld, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg.\n\nMR. BONIFACE\nBirds, yes.  My only source of solace.\n\nPAROLE OFFICER\nIn light of this rather extraordinary\ngesture, I see no reason not to endorse\nyour application for parole.\n\nBONIFACE\nThank you, sir.  You won't regret it.\n\nMR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE\nBOARD.  As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD\nSQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office:\n\nMYNAH\nCRIME DOES NOT PAY.  AAWWK!!  CRIME DOES\nNOT PAY.\n\nCHUCKLES all around.  On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures\ntoward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board:\n\nATTORNEY\nPersonally trained by my client.\n\nINT. PRISON CELL - DAY\n\nFree time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are\nmilling around in the common area.  T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb,\nhulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate,\nMR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES.  BONIFACE\nwhirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH\nRAGE:\n\nMR. BONIFACE\n-- Where are my birds?!?\n\nT-BONE\nShit, Pengy.  I let 'em go.\n\nMR. BONIFACE\nHermione.  My canary.  It's the dead of\nwinter!\n\nT-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR.\nBONIFACE's profound distress.\n\nT-BONE\nThey were all cooped up.  With you leaving\nand all -- seemed like the humane thing to\ndo.\n\nBONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell.  He spots a\nscattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD.  With\na supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile...\n\nMR. BONIFACE\nI see.  -- You might as well have this.  I\nwon't be needing it...\n\nHe tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on.  The dim\nstrains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the\nearphones...\n\nT-BONE\nWell, thanks, Pengy.  No hard feelings.\n(chuckling to himself)\nY'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little\nass of yours.\n\nT-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset\non, grins from his bunk.  TWO GUARDS arrive.  As they escort\nhim out, MR. BONIFACE mutters:\n\nMR. BONIFACE\nYou won't miss it long.\n\nEXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY\n\nIt's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE\nPENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally\nattired in cutaway and pin-stripes.  He pauses to inhale a\ndeep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of\nexhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading\nhis wings, REVELING in the cold.\n\nA STRETCH LIMO pulls up.  Two identically gaunt and vulture-\nlike DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and\numbrellas, step out to meet him.  These two gentlemen -- FRICK\nand FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and\n\"business managers.\"\n\nFRICK\nWelcome back, Mr. Boniface.\n\nPENGUIN\nMr. Frick.  Mr. Frack.  Our years of\nplanning are about to pay off.\n\nINT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY\n\nNow that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning\nto show.  His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his\nown ingenuity.\n\nPENGUIN\nI take it they found the money all right?\n\nFRACK\nWe buried it exactly as you specified.\n$42,271,009...\n\nPENGUIN\nHow much have we got left?\n\nFRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET.\n\nFRICK\nLet's see -- an initial capitalization of\n42 million and change, compounded over\nthirteen years, at an annual return of\njust under sixteen percent --\n\nPENGUIN\nFine, fine.  How much?\n\nFRICK\nSeventy-nine million.  -- Excluding the\nsum we buried.\n\nTHE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a\nnormal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK.  He checks his watch and\nreaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE.\n\nPENGUIN\nSpeaking of burials...\n\nEXT. PRISON YARD - DAY\n\nT-BONE on work detail.  He's got the Walkman on and he's\nshoveling snow to the beat.  He winces, and removes the\nheadphones...\n\nThe MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie,\nhigh-pitched WHINE.  He's twisting the knob, trying to find\nthe station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT\nAT HIS HEAD.\n\nT-BONE\nHEY -- !\n\nHe drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his\nhead.  Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped\ndown at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy.\n\nHe lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a\nfrenzy.  DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls,\nSHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him.  He falls to the\nground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like\nrabbits, terrified...\n\nBy the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard,\nT-BONE's no longer even visible.  There's just a swarming,\nman-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings\ninsanely.  Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS\nblow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs.\n\nAll at once, the PIGEONS take off en masse -- leaving T-BONE's\nmutilated corpse sprawled in the yard.  A GUARD notices the\nWalkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing\nbut ROCK MUSIC -- \"Surfin' Bird\" by the Trashmen.  Bird bird\nbird, bird is the word...\n\nEXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING\n\nAn AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted\nroad leading away from the prison.  It disappears from view --\nand all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great\nsqualling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as\nhe makes his way back to Gotham City.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT\n\nALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out\non the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy.  She pulls\nhim forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek.\n\nVICKI\nGuess what, Alfred.  I think I found a\npresent for Bruce.\n\nShe's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the\nexterior wall.  At first it doesn't want to fit through the\ndoor -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help\nshe gets it inside.  The faithful butler stares curiously at\nthis odd-shaped gift...\n\nVICKI (cont.)\nSkis.  -- Don't let on, okay?\n\nALFRED\nHe won't hear a word of it from me.\n\nVICKI\nHe's such a nightmare to shop for.  --\nWhat do you get him year after year,\nAlfred?\n\nALFRED\n(conspiratorially)\nI find you can't go wrong with\nsurveillance equipment.  Let me put this\nunder the tree...\n\nVICKI\nNot so fast.\n\nShe reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another\nsmall gift.  ALFRED stares at the tag -- \"TO ALFRED, LOVE\nVICKI\" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN.\n\nALFRED\nWhy, Miss Vale -- !\n\nVOICE FROM BEHIND\nWhat's all this?\n\nALFRED and VICKI turn.  It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner,\nmarching down the long stairway in the entry hall.  VICKI\nwaves frantically.\n\nVICKI\nDon't look.  It's your present.\n\nVICKI rushes over to embrace him.  He gapes at the long skinny\nbox --\n\nBRUCE\nWhat'd you get me?  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?\n\nVICKI frowns and gives him a kiss.  She nestles up against\nhim.  WHISPERS in his ear:\n\nVICKI\nI'm going to give you the happiest\nChristmas you've ever had.\n\nStill in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED.  Taking\nthe hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one\nend of the ski box.  He backs out of the entry hall, dragging\nthe box before him...\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT\n\nFIRES burn in garbage cans.  TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy\nlandscape.  Men, women, and children wander aimlessly,\nhuddling against the cold.\n\nAn army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park.  On\nthe nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens,\nhalf down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a\ncandlelight VIGIL.  Hand-lettered placards read: \"SAVE THE\nPARK.\"  \"PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE.\"  \"THIS PARK IS OUR HOME.\"\n\nThe source of the protest?  A towering SIGN posted in a corner\nof the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new\nluxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw\nConstruction, Inc.\n\nA LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby...\n\nINT. LAMBORGHINI - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nBRUCE and VICKI, dressed for dinner, stare out at the\ndemonstration.\n\nVICKI\nHomeless.\n(beat)\nI was just down here Tuesday.  Seems like\nthere's more every day.\n\nBRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to\nsay.\n\nVICKI (cont.)\nChristmas time.  And they say there's over\na thousand people living in the park\nalready.\n\nBRUCE\n-- Yeah.\n\nThe light changes.  BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at\nthe next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park.\n\nEXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT\n\nDespite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to\nGotham's elite.  A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has\nbeen hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of\nPARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as\nBRUCE'S CAR pulls up.\n\nA VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in\nconcern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush.  The liveried\nDOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience\n-- as they enter.\n\nINT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT\n\nPost-dinner.  VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the\ntable in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being\nforcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their\nSHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park.\n\nVICKI\nThey're already razing the tenements and\nSRO's downtown.  These people don't have\nanyplace else to go.\n(beat)\nIf the city starts selling off the park...\n\nBRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings.\nHUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the\npark; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance...\n\nBRUCE\n-- Yeah.  I guess I'll pass on dessert.\n\nVICKI\n(taking his hand)\nBruce, you do a lot more than most people\neven dream of.\n\nBRUCE\nSure.  Comes off the top of my taxes --\n\nVICKI\nThat's not what I meant.\n\nThey exchange a long silent look.  Of course she's referring\nto Batman.  Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with\nBRUCE.\n\nBRUCE\n-- What I \"do\" doesn't come close to the\nroot of the problem, Vicki.\n(long pause)\nI'm just a Band-Aid.\n\nVOICE FROM BEHIND\nBruce!  It's been ages!\n\nVICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder.\nMillionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the\nrestaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE.\n\nBRUCE\nRandall.  You remember Vicki.  -- How's\nthe construction business?\n\nSHAW\nThe park tower?  All systems go.  If we\ncan get the junkies and winos cleared\nout...\n(a big grin)\nNot too late to get in on the deal.\n\nBRUCE\nI'll think about it.\n\nSHAW\nSay, Walter Barrett's due back from\nEurope.  We should all get together at the\nclub.\n(clapping him on the shoulder)\nNice to see you again,  Miss Veal.\n\n\"Miss Veal\" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to\nthe next table.  She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth:\n\nVICKI\nWhat a pig.\n\nBRUCE\nI've known him since he was seven years\nold.  He was a pig then too.\n\nVICKI\nNow he wants to gobble up the park...\n(shivering)\nBruce -- isn't there something you can do\nabout people like that?\n\nBRUCE\nWhat, tie him up with a bat-rope?\n\nVICKI\nNo, you idiot.  I meant you.  Bruce.\n\nBRUCE nods -- oh, yeah.  Subtle distinction.\n\nINT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT\n\nBRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant.  He hands his\nparking stub to a VALET.  A crowd's beginning to form in the\nlot outside...\n\nThe red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short\ndistance off, near the entrance to the park.  TWO RED BERETS,\nin full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged\nWOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS.\n\nBRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a\nlittle closer -- within eavesdropping range:\n\nRED BERET I\nWe were on patrol.  Saw the whole thing.\n\nJOGGER\nI was attacked.  Three men in ski masks --\n\nCOP I\n(indicating the RED BERETS)\nAnd these two broke it up?\n\nJOGGER\nThese two??  They ran like rabbits.  I\nnever saw anybody take off so --\n\nRED BERET II\nHey!  Somebody had to go for the cops.\n\nCOP II\nYou.  SHUT UP, all right??\n(to the JOGGER)\nLady, who was it that bailed you out??\n\nJOGGER\nA kid.  Thirteen or fourteen tops.  He\njust came out of nowhere and -- tore into\n'em.\n(shaking her head)\nIt was so quick I didn't even see his\nface.\n\nNearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who\nresponds with a mystified shrug.  Her professional curiosity\npiqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER.\n\nAn exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime\nsite:\n\nRED BERET I\nDumb shit.  Shouldn'ta been jogging in the\npark at night anyway.\n(sullenly)\nLook around you.  It's fulla bums.\n\nBRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he\npasses.\n\nBRUCE\nNice outfit.\n\nRED BERET I\nPiss off, geek.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT\n\nSnow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor.\nFOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS --\ntotally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the\nsidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank\nleads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar:\nthe WHARF RAT.\n\nINT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT\n\nA roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack.\nThe clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving\nup for their next tattoo.  A TV over the bar is tuned to the\nlate news:\n\nANCHORWOMAN\n...and tomorrow, the city's power elite\nwill be turning out in force to greet\nmillionaire industrialist Walter Barrett,\nwho returns to Gotham after a five-year\nstay in Europe...\n\nThe BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the\nrowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett.  None,\nthat is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who\ngets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner.\n\nMoments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens\nher black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic,\nvaguely Eurasian features.  She's dark and elegant, fine-\nboned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know\nit yet, is SELINA KYLE.\n\nShe's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf\nRat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir.  A LONGSHOREMAN\nat the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the\nfelt.  Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she\nfinds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene\nindifference.\n\nThe regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops.  The\nonly guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY,\nwho's still on the phone:\n\nRICKY\nYo.  Ricky here.  What's the haps?\n\nIn mid-conversation he notices SELINA.  She smiles invitingly\n-- right at him.  Mildly startled, he smiles back.\n\nRICKY (cont.)\nMidnight.  No sweat.  See you then.\n\nHe hangs up eagerly.  Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up\nhis pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar.\n\nSELINA\nWell.  \"Ricky,\" is it?\n\nRICKY\nHow'd you know that?\n\nSELINA\nI heard you on the phone.  Talking to your\ngirlfriend.\n\nRICKY\nGirlfriend?  No, no.  That was business.\n\nSELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves.\n\nSELINA\nIf you've got time for a little pleasure\n...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink.\n\nShe clasps his hand.  His EYES BUG OUT.  Three enormous rings,\na diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks\non her left hand alone.  RICKY gapes at the sparklers,\nbedazzled.\n\nRICKY\nJeez -- they look almost real.\n\nSELINA\nWhy wouldn't they be?\n\nRICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought\nis all too evident.  He swallows hard and tries not to stare.\n\nRICKY\nYou'd have to be crazy.  Nobody'd wear the\nreal thing to a dive like this.\n\nSELINA\nOh, they're real, all right.  So are\nthese.\n\nShe waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp\n-- in front of his eyes.  With lightning speed, before he can\nreact, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick\nstroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand.\n\nSELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock.  He tries to jerk\nhis hand away, but he can't break her grip.  Then -- her\ndominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a\ncoy, Cheshire-cat smile.\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nWeren't we going to have a drink?\n\nHe blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily.  She takes his\nwounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at\nthe blood.  RICKY is hypnotized.\n\nShe's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow\n-- intriguing.  He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals\nto the BARTENDER.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT\n\nJust after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are\nicy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost.  A small STEAMBOAT\nis docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS --\nmean, ugly, and heavily armed.\n\nA similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet\nthem on the dock below.  The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT\nRIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank.  Something major\nis about to happen...\n\nThe CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a\nblack MEDICAL BAG.  Hands raised, the two of them start up the\ngangplank.\n\nThroughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on\nthe BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies.  One of them turns to\na colleague:\n\nDOCK GOON I\nWhere's that goddam Ricky?\n\nDOCK GOON II\nProbably out gettin' laid.  And here we\nare freezin' our balls off...\n\nEXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's\nbag.  The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING\nCRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck.\n\nBOAT THUG I\nYou pick.\n\nThe CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random.  Two BOAT THUGS tip\nit on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM --\nrevealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER.\n\nPOV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT\n\nWe're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a\nramshackle boathouse at water's edge.  Down on the deck of the\nsteamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the\nmerchandise.\n\nLIEUTENANT\nIt's pure.\n\nREVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT\n\nA BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof.\nThe mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only\ndetails that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY\nEARS...\n\nCHIEF GOON (O.S.)\nLet's do it.\n\nHe gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH\nassembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT\nTHUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to\nthe big hook.\n\nBOAT THUG I\nHold it.  Let's see the money.\n\nDown on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase\nand opens it.  Lots of long green inside.  The BOAT THUG\nsignals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the\ngoon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank.\n\nLOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe goon with the suitcase marches up.  Beyond him, in the\ndistance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof\nand makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the\nCRANE.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone\nholding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck\nand crane swings over the pier.\n\nANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT\n\nRazor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the\nair.\n\nON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down\nonto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath.  The crates\nexplode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and\nrandom ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic.\n\nON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT\n\nNobody knows quite what's going on.  Panicking, the GOON with\nthe suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the\ngangplank.  BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick\nshot.  Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the\ndrink, suitcase and all.\n\nPandemonium.  All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE.  Thinking\nhe's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON\nand SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range.\n\nBOAT THUG I\nYOU SON OF A BITCH!\n(to another BOAT THUG)\nGo after it.  Get the money.  GO!!\n\nHe raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys --\ndiving off the deck into a hail of gunfire.  Everyone's\nducking for cover.  BOAT THUG I barks orders at the\npilothouse:\n\nBOAT THUG I\nSoltar las amarras!  -- CAST OFF!!\n\nANOTHER BOAT THUG\nLOOK!\n\nBOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE\nlanding cat-like on the deck mere yards away.  Clad in inky\nblack leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is\nconcealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK.  Studded, with\nopenings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous\ntouch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS.\n\nShe bares her teeth and HISSES.\n\nIt's a woman.\n\nBOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized.  In the time it takes\nhim to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS.  She\nSNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke,\nRAKES her steel talons across his face and throat.  He slumps\nto the deck, lifeless.\n\nThe other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw\nwith a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him\ntoppling into the water.\n\nThe gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the\npier.  She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the\nDOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the\nboat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier.\n\nMost of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky\nspecimens remain behind.  She somersaults forward; takes one\ngoon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off\nthe dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more\nreeling with swift talon-slashes.  The whole frenzied mop-up\naction takes just under ten seconds.  Alone at last, she\nstands back to survey the scene.\n\nCounting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in\nthe harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead.  The snow\nis speckled with red.  A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in\ntheir own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down\nand softly MOANING.\n\nRetracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the\nwreckage of the smashed shipping crates.  BINDLES OF WHITE\nPOWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all\nabout the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested.\nInstead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the\nsides of the crates.\n\nShe finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents\nuntil she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel.  She opens\nit carefully and holds it up for inspection.  The statuette of\na RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the\nmoonlight.\n\nThe WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the\nMOANING PUNK's back pocket.  Then, cradling the raven under\none arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet.\n\nA LANTERN approaches.  It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of\nhapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the\nsight of the carnage on the docks.  He kneels beside the\nmoaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the\nPUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS.\n\nPUNK\nMurcielago.  MURCIELAGO!!\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - NIGHT\n\nThe unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with\nthe flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them,\nall chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on\nspecial perches mounted in the walls.\n\nAt the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL.\nARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a\nwheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water.\nCarefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the\nGotham Zoological Gardens.\n\nA MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface.  It's\nnot a whale; it's too pink.  It is, instead, the PENGUIN --\nand as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK\nstanding in the open doorway.\n\nFRICK\nMr. Boniface?  Your...visitor has arrived.\n\nPENGUIN\nThank you, Mr. Frick.  Show her in.\n\nThe PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool.  Two of his\nLACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a\nlong chain, into place over his head.  He grasps it with both\nhands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk\nout of the water.\n\nINT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT\n\nFRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either\nside with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued\nplumage.  CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we\ncan't see her face, there must be something distinctively\nfeline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and\nfluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she\nstrolls past.\n\nFRICK opens a door and ushers her into...\n\nINT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\n\nOur visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room.\nHer teeth begin to chatter.  The big bay windows have been\nthrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's\nfreezing in here.\n\nShe sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an\nAPRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on\nthe window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the\ncold.  He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the\nback of SELINA's hand.\n\nPENGUIN\nAh, Miss Kyle!  At last we meet.\n\nSELINA\nAt last we meet.  -- Pigeons?\n\nPENGUIN\nYes, they're common birds -- dirty,\nstupid, unattractive -- but they're very\nobedient, and they do crap on people's\nheads.  May I?\n\nShe extends a SHOPPING BAG.  The PENGUIN removes a parcel and\nunwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE.  He sets it on a\nnearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA.\n\nPENGUIN (cont.)\nI see your reputation was not exaggerated.\n\nSELINA\nI've located the others.  All but one.\n(shivering)\nI'm surprised you don't catch\npneumonia -- !\n\nWith an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut.\n\nPENGUIN\nMy normal body temperature is ninety-two\ndegrees.  Germs find me inhospitable.\n\nSELINA\nI see why they call you the Penguin.\n\nPENGUIN\nThey may call me that...but rarely more\nthan once.  Champagne?\n\nShe nods.  He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a\ntoast.\n\nPENGUIN (cont.)\nMy dear.  Here's to the second biggest\ncrime in the history of Gotham City.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT\n\nCOMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in\ndarkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room.\n\nBULLOCK\nIt wasn't about the drugs.  Whoever it was\nleft thirty kilos sitting on the docks.\n\nThey're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a\nterrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story.\nIt's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his\nvoice is audible over a concealed intercom:\n\nJULIO (filter)\nUn silueta negra -- con colmillos, y\ngarras -- el demonio.  El murcielago.\nMURCIELAGO!\n\nGORDON\nWhat's that he keeps saying?\n\nBULLOCK\n\"Murcielago.\"  -- Bat.\n\nGORDON\nNonsense.  That dock looked like a\nslaughter-house.  Batman's never committed\nmurder.\n\nBULLOCK\nWe did find this in his back pocket.\n\nBULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD.  It reads: \"THOSE WHO FEED ON THE\nSOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH\" -- and in lieu of a\nsignature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom\ncorner.\n\nWhile GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in:\n\nPOLICEMAN\nCommissioner?  We've got Barrett.\n\nINT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\n\nA cubicle down the hall.  The splenetic WALTER BARRETT,\nmillionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON\nenters.\n\nBARRETT\nFine welcome.  These storm troopers of\nyours dragged me away from my coming-home\nparty!\n(beat)\nI'd like to know the meaning of this --\n\nGORDON\nI'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure\ncocaine wound up concealed in your\npersonal effects.\n\nBARRETT\nGordon -- I come from one of the oldest\nand most influential familles in Gotham.\nIf you plan to accuse me of smuggling\ndrugs, be my guest.\n(long, menacing pause)\nI'll have your badge before you leave this\nroom.\n\nGORDON weighs the threat.  He nods to the COPS in\nattendance...\n\nGORDON\nBook the son of a bitch.\n\nGORDON storms out.  BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the\nCOPS restrain him.  Outraged, he bats their hands away...\n\nBARRETT\nI believe I'm still entitled to a phone\ncall.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY\n\nVICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps.  She's standing\nbehind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown\nDEMOLITION SITE.  SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a\nVACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn\nwith rubble.  The only structure still standing is a lone,\ndecrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above\nit, ready to strike.\n\nA SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE\nCOMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION,\nINC.  Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and\nhardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE:\n\nSHAW\nCome on!  Let's move it!  We're an hour\nbehind as it is!!\n\nA few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the\ntenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION\nGOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the\ncondenmed building.  VICKI watches angrily...\n\nHER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS\n\nA quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling,\nclinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave.  Their few\nbelongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which\nthe cops heave rudely out onto the street.  Finally, the\nhandcuffs and nightsticks come out...\n\nANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY\n\nA SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman\ntaking photos in the crowd.  SHAW recognizes her instantly.\nHis face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been\npersonally betrayed.\n\nSHAW\nJesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo!\n\nHe makes eye contact with her.  VICKI stares back defiantly.\nHe's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT\nsignals to him:\n\nHARDHAT\nPhone call, Mr. Shaw.  Guy said it's\nurgent.\n\nSHAW\n(to tbe SURVEYOR)\nHold the ball.  I wanna hear it crash.\n\nHe climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a\nCELLULAR PHONE.\n\nINTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW\n\nBARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his\none phone call to contact the construction magnate.\n\nBARRETT\nIt's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett.  I\nwant you to call my attorney.  That was my\nshipment they busted up last night.\n\nSHAW\nJesus, Walter, I --\n(suddenly puzzled)\nWhy are you calling me??\n\nBARRETT\nIt's worse than that.  Somebody took my\nraven.\n\nSHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief.\n\nANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT\n\nSHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a\ndaze.  He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE\nblows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the\nfacade of the tenement.\n\nSHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it.  He scurries off\nto his car at the end of the block.  VICKI, highly intrigued,\ngets it all on film...\n\nINT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY\n\nVICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing\nhim her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the\nSQUATTER FAMILY.\n\nSCHULTZ\nGreat stuff, but we're looking at a\nshitfight with our beloved publisher.  He\nand Shaw...\n(crossing his fingers)\nOld money sticks together.\n\nVICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his\ncar.\n\nVICKI\nI'd sure like to know what shook him up\nso.  He was out of there like a scared\nrabbit...\n\nJust then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to\nSCHULTZ's desk.\n\nWILK\nGot a blind tip from downtown.  You know\nthat massacre on the docks?  Batman.\n\nVICKI reacts in astonishment.  SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is\nhot.\n\nEDITOR\nWhoa!  Is this on the level?\n\nWILK\nCops even got a note.  \"Those who feed on\nthe soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!\"\n(grinning; to VICKI)\nSounds like your pal's cranked it up a\nnotch.\n\nVICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - EVENING\n\nALFRED opens the door.  A BANNER HEADLINE stares him in the\nface:\n\nBATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE\nIndustrialist Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring\n\nVICKI, who's holding up the afternoon paper for ALFRED's\ninspection, peeks out glumly from behind the masthead.\n\nVICKI\nSeen the late edition?\n\nALFRED\nI'm afraid so, Miss Vale.  Master Bruce is\nsequestered in the cave.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING\n\nOn their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the\nlibrary.  They pause in front of the television -- which is\ntuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot\nissue of the day.\n\nENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV)\nWalter Barrett's no saint.  His factories\nhave been dumping poison into the air and\nwater for years.  If he is mixed up with\ndrugs...\n\nPUNDIT (on TV)\nThat's not the issue.  The issue is, do we\nentrust our public safety to some...masked\nvigilante.  Does Batman have a license to\nkill?\n\nALFRED\n(shaking his head)\nAh, the public.  Dishearteningly fickle.\n\nVICKI follows ALFRED out.  We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA\nPANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding\nair time.  He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT:\n\nMIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV)\nYo, here's the tip, man.  Drug dealers are\nscum.  If Batman did wax these punks...SO\nWHAT?  They deserved it!  End of\ndiscussion.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING\n\nALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep\nquiet.  He's hunched over a TAPE RECORDER -- and COMMISSIONER\nGORDON'S VOICE is blaring from a nearby speaker...\n\nGORDON (O.S.; filter)\nAnyone could've written that note.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT\n\nGORDON's in conference with a number of CITY OFFICIALS --\nblissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping.\n\nCITY OFFICIAL I\nAnd I suppose anyone could've taken out a\nboatload of armed thugs.  A dozen men, Jim\n-- murdered in cold blood --\n\nGORDON\nBefore we forget, Batman's saved hundreds\nof lives!\n\nCITY OFFICIAL II\nHe's still a vigilante.  We don't know who\nhe is, where he comes from, why he does\nit...\n\nCITY OFFICIAL I\nStreet punks are one thing, Jim.  This is\nWalter Barrett -- a personal friend of\nmine!\n\nAs the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a\nCOMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.  We see the tiny TRADEMARK\nembossed on the CPU -- \"WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES.\"\n\nINT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE\n\nas he LISTENS through his concealed bug.\n\nCITY OFFCIAL II\nYou've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least\nfor questioning.  It would sure help if we\ncould get that mask off...\n\nBRUCE shuts the recorder off.  He turns to face ALFRED and\nVICKI --\n\nBRUCE\nLadies and gentlemen...I've been framed.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT\n\nThe BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky.  After a beat, the\nCAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point\nand holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past.\n\nINT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT\n\nTWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE\nwhizzes past on the street.  The DRIVER pulls out behind it as\nthe second COP grabs his radio mike...\n\nCOP\nOne-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview\nnorth-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat\n10-78.\n\nVOICE ON RADIO (filter)\n10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37,\nrepeat 10-37.

A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash...\n\nThe BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES.\n\nOVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS\n\nAs the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO\nMORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the\npursuit.  All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back\nof the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE\nDRIVERS...\n\nEXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nTWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift\nroadblock.  ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them.\nThey move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing\nsmoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them...\n\nANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself\nfrom the body of the car.  It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS\nflip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER.\n\nEXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK\n\nA SHRIEKING HORN BLARES.  The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING\nUP and dive for the sidewalk.  The COW-CATCHER slams into the\nSOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises\nthrough the gap.\n\nAs the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow\nthe Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby\nbuilding --\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT\n\n-- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot,\nbecause BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the\naction with some dismay.\n\nHis relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky\nground.  He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL\nUNIT:\n\nBATMAN\nEvasive.\n\nSIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in\nthought.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nAt this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone.  We're\nin the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction\nmagnate.  There's obviously money to be made in real-estate\ndevelopment -- because the walls are lined with art, and the\nfloor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in\nGotham.\n\nAt the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new\nBrancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows.  An\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back\nto the camera...\n\nWOMAN\nIt's a fake.\n\nSHAW\nHmm.  It cost me a half a million dollars.\nYou're sure?\n\nWOMAN\nAbsolutely.  You see, I...happen to know\nwhere the real one is stashed.\n\nThe WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed.  He\nseems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the\nmoment, art is not the first thing on his mind.  CAMERA STAYS\nON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on\nhis mysterious guest.\n\nSHAW\nI guess you'd know.  I have some \"friends\"\nin the art world.  They say that -- for\ncertain hard-to-get items -- you're the\none to call.\n\nWOMAN (O.S.)\nHow flattering.\n\nSHAW\nThey say for the right price...you could\nsteal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel\nWall.\n\nWOMAN (O.S.)\nMr. Shaw.  Do you believe everything you\nhear?\n\nSHAW\nOh, I'm not one to judge.  I admire people\nwho take what they want.  I'm just curious\nhow you do it.\n\nSHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her\nface.  It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of\nthe sofa...\n\nSELINA\nI find that the old methods work best.\n\nSetting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat\nsmile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep,\npassionate kiss.  Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW\ndrops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine\nacross the polished parquet floor.\n\nINT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe action's gone horizontal.  SELINA, peeled down to a sheer\nlace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat\nwith quick, lapping kisses.  She rolls off suddenly; when he\ntries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single\nfinger.\n\nSitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS,\ntwisting them around into tight cords.  With a coy smile she\nruns her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and\nthen, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and\nties it off on the bedpost.\n\nSHAW\nHey, what are you doing -- ?\n\nHe tries to break her grip.  She BACKHANDS him sharply across\nthe face.\n\nSELINA\nYou're very inquisitive.  You'll just have\nto be disciplined.\n\nAn EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other\nhand to the bedpost.  None too quick, he's just caught on that\nall this is part of SELINA's kinky scene.  She crosses quickly\nto the bathroom --\n\nSHAW\nYou know, I've...I've never really done\nthis kind of thing before.\n\n-- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems\nperfectly appropriate in this context.\n\nSELINA\nI think people should indulge their\nfantasies.  Don't you?\n\nNow that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches\ninto an oversized bag.  She withdraws an odd-looking chromium\nBRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger.  SIX-\nINCH STEEL TALONS snick into place.  SHAW's dopey smile\nfades...\n\nSHAW\nHey, what are those -- what are you --\n\nHe lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS\naway from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby.  A\nSPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically\npleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT\n\nA SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the\nentrance of the building.  Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show\nvarious empty hallways throughout the building.  He reaches\nfor his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel\nnearby.\n\nINT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a\nBURGLAR ALARM.  SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE --\nconcealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on\nhinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of\ncomplete exasperation: oh, shit.  The GUARD'S VOICE crackles\nover a nearby intercom:\n\nGUARD (O.S.; filter)\nMr. Shaw?  What's going on up there?  --\nMr. Shaw?\n\nFurious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts\na BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on\nthe docks.  She slams the door shut and swings the picture\nback into place.\n\nEXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nSIRENS echo in the streets.  SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and\nstreak off toward SHAW's building.\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT\n\nWatching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an\nANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his\nhead.  An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the\npolice frequency:\n\nDISPATCHER (O.S.; filter)\n-- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at\nGotham Park West.  Move out.  It's Randall\nShaw.  Repeat, all units --\n\nBATMAN's eyes widen.  He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY\nMETAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as\npart of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo.\n\nBut it's no umbrella.  When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his\nBLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding\n-- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS.\n\nHe steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS\nTHE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise\npast far below.\n\nINT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nThere's an awful BANGING at the front door.  SHAW lies under\nthe bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the\nceiling.  SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings\na lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders.  She picks up the\nnearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and\nclambers out onto the ledge outside.\n\nTen seconds later the COPS burst in.  They rush to the bedroom\n-- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the\nbed --\n\n-- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall.\nPainted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT.\n\nCOP\nJESUS!\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nForty stories up.  The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she\nscurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one\nlithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF.  She scampers across the\nrooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle,\nlike a mountain climber --\n\n-- until she reaches the building at the end of the block.\nHere she pauses to dig in her knapsack.  She pulls out a\nretractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around,\nHEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street...\n\nEXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT\n\nPOLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally\noblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the\nsmall, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in\nblack leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the\nintersection.\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT\n\nThe CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides\nshe's out of danger.  Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops\nto her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches,\nemits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure.  She's just\nmade a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped\nfor a moment of Quality Time.\n\nShe hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over.  Her whole\nbody tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes\ndart left.\n\nA CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line.\nThe gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest\nof seconds before he steps back into the shadows.  She acts\nlike she hasn't noticed...\n\n...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same.\n\nTIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT\n\nHis eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her.  If it's\npossible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're\nseeing it now.\n\nHIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT\n\nShe still doesn't let on that she's seen him.  Instead, she\ngoes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a\ngymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little\nprivate show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE\nROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit.\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT\n\nHis jaw is down around his knees.  Whoa.  He edges forward\nslightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her...\n\nShe hears a noise.  Stops.  Makes a big show of looking left\nand right.  Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN\njumps back into the shadows.  She gathers her things; a small\nWHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and\nshe VANISHES over the edge.\n\nSnapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in\ntime to see --\n\nEXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nShe's rapidly working her way down the side of the building,\nflipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master\ngymnast.  Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS\n-- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect\nlanding on the roof of a passing BUS.\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nBATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD.  He\nkneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled\nupon it...\n\nLOOKING FOR LOVE?\n\nHe goes goggle-eyed with astonishment.  He rushes back to the\nedge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the\nentrance to Gotham Park.  He's reaching for his grappling-gun,\nfiguring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the\nface.\n\nEXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nDown below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the\nrooftops.  Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as\nhe ducks back behind the cornice, out of view.\n\nCOP\nHey.  You see what I saw...?\n\nThis sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios.  Right\non cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up.  LT. BULLOCK,\nwho's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out.\n\nBULLOCK\nIt's Randall Shaw.  Torn to ribbons.  --\nWe just made Batman up on the roof.\n\nGORDON\nOh God.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park.  A BLACK\nSILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing\namong the branches...\n\nWe TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving\nfinally at:\n\nEXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT\n\nThe little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks\nand lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park\nTowers.  MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest\nnearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift\nsoup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches.\n\nVICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand.  She's\ntrying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken.\n\nVICKI\nPlease, just one.  It's important for\npeople to see what's happening.\n\nHOMELESS MAN\nThey don't want to see us, lady.  They\njust want us gone -- out of sight, and out\nof mind.\n(mumbling as he wanders off)\nGet worse before it gets better.  It\nalways does.\n\nVICKI TURNS.  In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and\nwailing.  A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and\na dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd.\nAll at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE\nIRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables,\nRIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos.\n\nSome of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run.  Those who resist meet with\nswift and sudden violence.  A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and\ngets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble.\n\nVICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come.  She\nbacks off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS\nFRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film.\n\nA HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron --\nsending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the\nsnow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture.\nHe points her out to a colleague...\n\n...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with\npure cold malice in their eyes.  VICKI turns to run, but it's\nslow going in the snow.  She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers\nare almost upon her...\n\n...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES\none of the HARDHATS.  The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to\nthe fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold.\n\nThe second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON.  But the\nFIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the\nway.  As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his\nhead and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow\nfrom the second guy's tire iron.\n\nIn the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's\nbelly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the\ntire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets\nto his feet.  He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING\nthe iron --\n\n-- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH-\nKICKS HIM in the face.  HOP; KICK.  HOP; KICK.  The FIGURE has\nnailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit\nthe ground.\n\nThe FIGURE turns toward VICKI.  Her eyes go wide with\nastonishment.\n\nIt's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed,\ngrimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT.  She stares at\nhim for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the\naid of his fellow homeless...\n\nShe can't believe what she's seeing.  The KID wades smack into\nthe midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass --\nspinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display\nof pure athleticism.  It seems like he's everywhere at once.\nThere's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle\nhimself like this...\n\nRallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch\nbats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide\nturns.  The invasion is being repelled.  Faced with renewed\nresistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and\nrace off to their VAN.\n\nTriumph in shantytown.  The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster\ntogether to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that\neverything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the\ntrees.\n\nBut one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead.  As the KID\nruns past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path --\nTRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow.  The KID\nthrows up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at\nhim...\n\nCLANG.  The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over,\nBOARDLIKE.  The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there\nwith a baseball bat.\n\nHe gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his\nfeet -- thanks for returning the favor.  He's about to light\nout again when --\n\nVICKI\nWAIT!  Don't be afraid.  I wanted to thank\nyou.  I --\n\nKID\n(cautiously)\nTwenty.\n\nVICKI\nWhat?\n\nKID\nTwenty bucks.\n\nVICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just\nthe same.  She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID\nsnatches the bill out of her hands.  They stare at each other\nfor a long moment --\n\nVICKI\n...Who are you?\n\nKID\nDick.\n\n-- and then he's bounding off like a shot.  VAULTING up into a\ntree and vanishing amid the snowy branches.  VICKI starts to\nfollow, but there's no way she can keep up.  Instead she digs\ninto her CAMERA BAG...\n\nHER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS\n\nUsing the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the\ntreetops.  She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks\nof SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from\nlimb to limb...\n\nFor a moment it seems like she's lost him.  As she sweeps the\nlens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of\nan EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance.  She ups the\nmagnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal.  The\nstone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE\n-- BRUCE's great-grandfather.\n\nAs luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet\nfrom the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again.  He\nlooks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then\nraces toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small\nhillocks, over a frozen creek.\n\nThere's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter,\nmounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate\nand clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place\nbehind him.  Home sweet home.\n\nEXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT\n\nas she lowers the lens.  Her face is full of conflicting\nemotions.  She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find\nout what his story is.  But on the other hand -- even the\nhomeless are entitled to their privacy...\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PENGUIN'S AVIARY - NIGHT\n\nA CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed\nfrom a nearby chair.  The cat arches its back -- waits -- and\nSPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair.  The canary\nSHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor,\ncradles it in her arms...\n\nWOMAN'S VOICE\nNow Hecate.  You don't want that scrawny\nlittle bird --\n\nIt's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black\nensemble.  At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his\ncustomary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN.  He\nbares his teeth:\n\nPENGUIN\nDo you want me to wring that creature's\nneck?\n\nSELINA\nYou try it, I'll do the same to you.\n(as he grumbles; bemused)\nI saw him, you know.\n\nPENGUIN\nSaw who?\n\nSELINA\nBatman.  He was dreamy.\n\nShe strokes the cat, in a reverie.  The PENGUIN drops his\npolishing cloth, startled.\n\nPENGUIN\nDreamy?!?  Are you insane!?  My God --\n(sputtering wildly)\nAre you sure it was him?  What did he do?\n\nSELINA\nHe stood on a roof and watched me.  He\ndidn't realize I'd seen him.  I don't\nthink he knew quite what to make of me.\n(smiling)\nBut he was definitely interested.\n\nThis sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing.  (Or\nwaddling.)\n\nPENGUIN\nThis scheme of yours is backfiring.  We\ndon't need him on our tails.  Do you know\nhow much money is at stake here?\n\nSELINA\nMoney isn't everything.\n(casually)\nWhat's the point if we can't enjoy\nourselves?\n\nShe chuckles to herself.  He stares at her in disbelief -- and\nSQUAWKS.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - MORNING\n\nThe big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9\nshopping days left until Christmas.  Down below, BRUCE is\nwalking VICKI to work.\n\nVICKI\nSix-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then\nvanished into a drainage pipe -- right\nnext to the statue of General Wayne.\n\nBRUCE\nMy illustrious great-grandfather.  Think\nit's the same kid we heard about?\n\nVICKI\nMust be.  He reminded me of you.\n\nBRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the Globe\nbuilding, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM:\n\nNEW BAT-MURDER?\nBatman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer\nCommissioner Gordon Refuses Comment\n\nThe accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY\nRED BAT painted on SHAW's wall.  BRUCE scowls at VICKI:\n\nBRUCE\n-- You work for this rag?\n(snatching up a paper)\nYour boss is calling for Gordon's\nresignation -- unless he brings Batman in\nfor questioning...\n\nVICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the\nstreet.\n\nTHEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP\n\nThe owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his\nBatman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to\nTEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS.  A MOTHER drags\nher squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells\nheavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't\napprove...\n\nBACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI\n\nlooking on in dismay.  BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage:\n\nBRUCE\nI need a good PR man.\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nHey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'?\n\nWith a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack.\nVICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the Globe.\n\nVICKI\nThat's what happens when you go after the\nrich and powerful.\n\nBRUCE\nHey, it wasn't me, remember?  I am rich\nand powerful --\n\nAs he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand.  He sees\nan AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- \"LOOKING FOR LOVE?  Find\nit in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS.\"\n\nLooking for Love.  Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a\nquarter and races back to the newsstand.  VICKI keeps\nwalking...\n\nVICKI\nMaybe it's almost...good.  In a weird way.\nI mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people\nlike that were really scared, maybe\nthey'd --\n\nShe suddenly realizes she's talking to herself.  She turns\naround and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly\nunfolding a copy of the Globe.  She marches back and tugs at\nhis sleeve.\n\nVICKI (cont.)\nHey, I'm late for work.  You can read that\nlater.\n\nBRUCE\nQuiet.  I'm looking for a personal ad.\n\nHer face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the\npage.\n\nBRUCE (cont.)\n\"Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on\nthe roof 12/16.  I was in black; you were\ntoo.\"\n\nVICKI\nIs this some kind of bad joke?\n\nBRUCE\nIt's her.  That cat woman, or whatever she\nis.\n(reading aloud)\n\"I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping\nyou'd follow, but you were too shy...\"\n\nVICKI\nWhat does she want -- a date?\n\nBRUCE\nShe's trying to contact me.  Says she's\ngonna leave me another ad...\n\nThe two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity.  BRUCE's\nmind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that\nmakes VICKI just a trifle nervous...\n\nINT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY\n\nVICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down.  She\nspots a message in the \"in\" file.  She takes one look at it,\nand her eyes go wide with RAGE.  She storms out in a fury...\n\nINT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY\n\nBarging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the\ninner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe.\nHe's just opening his mail.  He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI\nBARKS at him:\n\nVICKI\nWHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY?\n\nPROVOST\nClose the door.\n(waiting for her to calm down)\nYour story isn't news.  With Shaw dead --\n\nVICKI\nBut the project's still going ahead!  If\nattacking homeless people in the park\nisn't news, I'd like to know what is --\n\nPROVOST\nThere's a psycho out there in a mask and\ncape -- killing off Gotham's most\nprominent citizens!  That's news.\n(beat)\nI've known Randall Shaw all my life.  His\nfamily is in mourning.  And it just so\nhappens I don't believe in slandering the\ndead.\n\nVICKI FUMES.  She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the\neye.\n\nVICKI\nMr. Provost -- how much money do you have\ntied up in the Park Tower project?\n\nPROVOST\nVicki...I'm going to forget you made that\nremark.  For the sake of your job, I\nsuggest you do the same.\n\nVICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail.  He\nfinds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with\nthe word \"CONFIDENTIAL\" underlined three times in ink.  He\ntears it open --\n\n-- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents:\na small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM...\n\nTHOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM\nWILL SUFFER MY WRATH\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY\n\nWALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of\nthe courthouse.  BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS.\n\nREPORTER I\nMr. Barrett!  Any comment on the\narraignment?\n\nREPORTER II\nIs it true bail was set at two million\ndollars?\n\nATTORNEY\nStand back!  My client has nothing to say\nat this time!\n\nThe ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a\nwaiting CAR, shielding his face.  REPORTERS cluster around\nit...\n\nAs the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS\ntaking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall\nof Justice.\n\nOVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR\n\nPIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is\nidling at a traffic light far below.\n\nINT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the\nlight to change.  BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his\ncellular phone.\n\nBARRETT\nIt's time we called an emergency meeting\nof the Raven Society.  Get back to me...\n\nLooking troubled, he hangs up.  A fat white glob of PIGEON\nSHIT splatters across the windshield.  Seconds later --\nanother SPLAT.\n\nBARRETT (cont.)\nDamn pigeons.\n\nDRIVER\nJust washed it, too.\n\nThe DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch.  They hear a tiny\nDINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield.\n\nBARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look.  A small,\nblinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade\nassembly...\n\nOVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR\n\nJust as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million\nfragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the\nintersection.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BATCAVE - DAY\n\nTIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the\nintersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of\nBARRETT's car.  BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears\nbehind him.\n\nALFRED\nThe Fluegelheim called again, sir.  They\nwant to know if you'll be attending the\nopening of the new Egyptian exhibit.\n\nBRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED\noff.\n\nBRUCE\nCancel.\n\nANCHORWOMAN (on TV)\n-- and, citing new evidence in the so-\ncalled string of \"millionaire murders,\"\nPolice Commissioner J.T. Gordon today\nswore out a warrant for the arrest of\nBatman.\n(beat)\nWe go now live to Mike Sekowsky,\nspokesperson, Order of the Bat.\n\nSEKOWSKY\nJeez!  Talk about gratitude -- !!\n\nAt the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in\ndisgust.  ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of\nthe Batcave.\n\nBRUCE\nWell, Alfred, it's official.  I'm a wanted\nman.\n(beat)\n\"New evidence\"...I've gotta find that\nwoman.  Did you check the personals?\n\nAs ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds.  They've got a\nvisitor.  BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees\nCOMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron\ngates of Wayne Manor.\n\nHe throws a nervous look at ALFRED.  ALFRED speaks into a\nmicrophone:\n\nALFRED\nWho's there?\n\nGORDON\nJim Gordon, Alfred.  I've got to see\nBruce.\n\nA spooky development.  Does GORDON suspect?  After a moment's\nhesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in.\n\nALFRED\nMr. Wayne will see you, sir.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER\n\nA curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures\ntoward the liquor cabinet.  The Commissioner nods his head no.\nHe's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be\nhere.\n\nGORDON\nSorry to bother you.  Bruce -- I'll get\nright down to it.  You knew Shaw and\nBarrett --\n\nBRUCE\nI saw them occasionally.  We all sat on\nthe board of the Fluegelheim...\n\nGORDON\nDid you have any...dealings with them,\nor --\n\nBRUCE\nNo.  I never liked the way they did\nbusiness.\n\nGORDON\nThe thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped\ntogether in the public mind -- the Five\nFamilies of Gotham, that sort of thing --\nand, uh...\n(taking a card from his pocket)\nHarrison Provost got this in the mail.\n\nBRUCE examines the card, -- \"THOSE WHO FEED,\" etc.  He stares\nat GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest...\n\nBRUCE\nThen Batman is behind all this.\n\nGORDON\nBatman or a damned good imitation.\n\nBRUCE\nWell.  He's changed tactics, hasn't he.\n\nGORDON\n(shrugging; at a loss)\nShaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a\ndruglord, major polluter -- they weren't\nexactly model citizens.  Who knows, it\ncould be some crazy social-conscience kind\nof thing.\n\nBRUCE\nYou mean he's going after...the root of\nthe problem.\n\nGORDON shakes his head and gets up to go.  BRUCE hands him the\ncard.\n\nGORDON\nLet me know if you get one of these.\nWe'll put all our resources at your\ndisposal.\n\nBRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the\nCommissioner out.  A moment later, the butler reappears.\n\nBRUCE\nChanged my mind, Alfred.  I'll be dropping\nin on the Fluegelheim after all.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\nIt's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian\nexhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping.  BOARD MEMBERS,\nMUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets\nand evening gowns, making small talk.  AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has\nbeen set up as a wet bar.\n\nOn a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall,\nrimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE.\nThe TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and\nreconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains,\nstatuary and all.\n\nGuarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the\ngoddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of\na pointy-eared CAT.  She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four\ntiny KITTENS romp at her feet.  BRUCE, who's just arrived, is\ntaking an intense interest in the cat-goddess...\n\nVICKI\nWhat is it?\n\nBRUCE\nI just had a weird sense of deja vu.\n\nHe glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the\npublisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate --\nthe remaining member of Gotham's \"Five Families.\"  The two of\nthem are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't\nquite make out...\n\nTIPTREE\nHarrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce.\nWe owe him that much.\n\nBRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them.\nPROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of\nnonchalance.\n\nPROVOST (cont.)\nThe man's a space cadet.  Let him look out\nfor himself.\n(as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully)\nWhy, Bruce!  What a delightful surprise.\n\nBRUCE\nGood to see you two.  Looks like the Five\nFamilies are suddenly down to three.\n(looking around)\nIn fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on\nthis room right now --\n\nTIPTREE chuckles nervously.  PROVOST is even less amused.\n\nPROVOST\nIs that your idea of a joke, Bruce?\n\nBRUCE\nNot at all.  Commissioner Gordon seems to\nthink we should all be hiring bodyguards.\n\nTIPTREE                           PROVOST\nOh, that's absurd.                I already have.\n\nThe two of them glower at each other.  It's like an outtake\nfrom The Newlywed Game.  BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a\nvacuous face:\n\nBRUCE\nThing is, I can't imagine why Batman would\nbe after us.  Can you?\n\nPROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of\nhemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party.  It's\nSELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing\ndress slit up to the armpits.  She's holding two glasses of\nCHAMPAGNE...\n\nSELINA\nYou two look like you need a drink.  --\nAnd is this who I think it is?\n\nShe flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery\nSMILE.  He BLINKS, temporarily speechless.\n\nPROVOST\nSelina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne.\n\nSELINA\nOur absentee board member!  I've been\nwanting to meet you forever.\n\nTIPTREE\nSelina's the new Curator of Antiquities.\nShe brought the Temple over block by\nblock --\n\nSELINA\nYou two won't be terribly upset if I\nborrow Bruce for a moment, will you?\n\nBefore he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and\ndragged him off.  A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his\neyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY.  His tongue is practically\nhanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check.  SELINA\nSIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE:\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nMajor contributor.  -- I always seem to\nwind up in charge of fund-raising...\n\nBRUCE\nI can't imagine why.\n\nSELINA\nTax year's almost over, you know.  I hope\nwe can count on your usual generous\ndonation.\n(indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE)\nSomeone's got to set an example for those\ntwo tightwads.\n\nBRUCE\nThey're proccupied.  This string of\nmurders --\n\nSELINA\nI asked them if they'd consider including\nus in their wills.\n(chuckling to herself)\nThey didn't seem a bit amused...\n\nANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT\n\nShe's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and\ntheir overdressed WIVES.  She glances across the room at the\nstatue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE.  A frown\ncrosses her face...\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT\n\nShe's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the\nstatue.\n\nSELINA\n-- and this is my good friend Bastet, the\nEgyptian Cat Goddess.\n\nBRUCE\nI think we've already met.  -- This is\nquite an expedition you've put together.\n\nSELINA\nI'm glad you think so.  I have to say,\nBruce -- you're not at all what I\nexpected.\n\nBRUCE\nSorry to disappoint you.\n\nSELINA\nOh, it's not that.  Not at all.  It's just\nthat I'd always heard you were...\n\nBRUCE\nWhat?\n\nSELINA\n(coyly)\nOh...sort of a...\n\nBRUCE\n(smiling; fascinated)\nNo.  Come on.  What?\n\nBRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered\nwhen VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially --\ntakes his other arm.  The women exchange big, toothy, plastic\nsmiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting\nfor him to introduce them.\n\nBRUCE\nOh.  Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale.\n\nSELINA\nThe photographer.  I've seen your pictures\nin the Gazette.\n\nVICKI\nThe Globe.\n\nSELINA\nOh, that's right.  The tabloid one.  --\nWhat an original dress!\n\nVICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE.  He senses\ntrouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass.\n\nBRUCE\nSelina supervised the reconstruction of\nthe temple.  Brought it back from Egypt...\nstone by stone.\n\nVICKI\nReally.  She must be awfully tired.\n(to SELINA)\nHow'd you get to be in charge of a huge\nproject like this?\n\nSELINA\nIt was easy.  I slept with the Pharoah.\n\nShe laughs at her own joke.  VICKI responds with a dry little\nchuckle of her own.  SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the\nsleeve.\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nExcuse us, won't you, sweetheart?  We have\nsome boring museum business to talk about.\n\nVICKI fumes.  BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him\noff out of earshot.\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nI.  Short leash.\n\nBRUCE\nPull in the claws, okay?  She's really\nterrific.\n\nSELINA\nI'm sorry, Bruce.  Sometimes I get a\nlittle...aggressive, you know?\n(handing him a card)\nLook, I need to talk to you.  Come by\nsometime.  I'll give you the private tour.\n\nBRUCE\nWait.  Let me explain about Vicki --\n\nSELINA\n(shushing him)\nI understand.  Anyone who's that\nprotective must have a pretty good reason\nfor it.\n\nShe shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial,\nunmistakably juicy.  Then she's off in pursuit of another\nmajor funder.  BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in\nhis hands when VICKI rejoins him.\n\nVICKI\nHow's \"business\"?\n\nBRUCE\nRelax, okay?  I like you better.\n\nHe scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE.  No\nluck.\n\nVICKI\nIf you're looking for your fellow\nmillionaires, they left some time back.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT\n\nThe roof of the Gotham Globe.  A STARLING circles overhead for\na moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT.\n\nINT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT\n\nTWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office.\nBrass letters on the door read \"J. HARRISON PROVOST,\nPUBLISHER.\"\n\nINT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT\n\nPROVOST, agitated, working late.  He speaks, sotto voce, into\nthe phone:\n\nPROVOST\nDon't worry about that.  I've had the\noffice swept for bugs.  No one's\nlistening...\n\nINT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nTIPTREE in his paneled study at home.  There's an open bottle\non the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard.  His\nVOICE QUAVERS:\n\nTIPTREE\nIt's just so -- unfair.  I mean...it was\nover a century ago.  It's not like we're\nresponsible.\n(hollow-eyed)\nHow could he know?  How could Batman know\nabout the Raven Society??\n\nINT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT\n\nPROVOST\nWho knows and who cares.  The point is,\nit's happened...\n\nHe hears a CHIRP and looks up.  It seems to be coming from a\nHEATING VENT on the wall.  But then it stops, so he resumes\nhis conversation --\n\nPROVOST (cont.)\nI'm clearing out of the country, and I'm\ntaking the raven with me.  I suggest you\ndo the same.\n\nINT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT\n\nIn the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny\nBIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft.  Now\nthat we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY\nPACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE\ntaped to its leg.\n\nPROVOST (O.S.)\nI'll tell you how to reach me.  And don't\nrepeat this to anyone.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY\n\nThe PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool.  He's wearing\nrubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his\narctic birds.  The vents in the windows are open, and the\nclimate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in\nfur, stroking her pet cat:\n\nSELINA\nHe's just another rich idiot.\n(chuckling to herself)\nThe odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit\nconcerned.\n\nPENGUIN\nThen he is an idiot.\n\nSELINA\nHe lives in some big sprawling manor.\nI'll have to get inside, scope it out...\nsee where he's got the raven stashed.\n\nPENGUIN\nHow do you plan to do that?\n\nSELINA\nHow do you think!\n\nA feline smile from SELINA.  The PENGUIN chuckles to himself,\nlobs a FISH out over the pool.  A swooping GULL snatches it\nout of the air before it hits the water.  FRICK arrives in the\ndoorway.\n\nFRICK\nIt's Mr. Provost, sir.  He's planning to\nembark on an unscheduled Christmas\nvacation.\n\nPENGUIN\nGood!  That should save us a trip to the\nbank.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY\n\nA huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk:\narchaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a\nhealthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over.  This\nis SELINA's private domain.  CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case\nfull of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens...\n\nBRUCE\nWhat have we got here?\n\nSELINA\nMummified cats.  Bastet's sacred animal.\nThey were buried by the thousands at\nBubastis.  -- Oh, careful!\n\nBRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen\nJARS.  Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape,\njackal, man, falcon.\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nCanopic jars.  In the process of\nmummification, the internal organs were\nburied separately.\n(pointing to each jar in turn)\nLungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine --\n\nBRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder.\n\nBRUCE\nYou're in a gruesome line of work.\n\nSELINA\nKeeps me interested.  And that's not easy\nto do...\n\nBRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd\nbeast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON.\n\nBRUCE\nThis one I know.  It's a gryphon, right?\n\nSELINA\nVery good.  A mythical demon, half-bird,\nhalf-lion...sweeping down from the sky to\ndeliver retribution and justice.\n\nBRUCE nods.  He can dig it.  He regards the gryphon for a long\nmoment and CHUCKLES.\n\nBRUCE\nPoor guy.  Birds and cats -- you wouldn't\nthink the two halves would cooperate.\n\nSELINA\nOnly under certain circumstances.\n(beat)\nI'm really glad you came, Bruce.  I was\nafraid I'd given you the wrong impression.\nOr maybe it was the right impression.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat was it you wanted to talk to me\nabout?\n\nSELINA\nYour collection.  I'd love to see it.  I\nmean, everyone says you've got a\nfabulous --\n\nShe breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself.  She toys\ndemurely with her equipment.  She looks up at BRUCE and\nswitches tactics -- going for the direct approach.  BRUCE\nbraces himself...\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nMainly I just wanted an excuse to see you\nagain.  Does she know you're here --\nVicki?\n\nBRUCE\n(shrugging)\nNo.\n\nSELINA\nIt must be strange.  Having all that\npower, and money -- never really knowing\nif that's what people are attracted to.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat are you attracted to?\n\nSELINA\nI think you're a little bit nuts.\n(beat)\nI think you're a little -- bored with your\nlife.  Having everything you want.  No\nvariety, no...danger.  And every once in a\nwhile you need to take a risk.  Shake it\nall up.\n\nBRUCE\nHow?\n\nSELINA\nMaybe by...coming here today.\n\nShe leans back against a crate, moistens her lips.  She's\nletting him have it with both barrels.\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nThat's one thing I can give you, Bruce --\ndanger -- a little something you can't get\nat home.\n\nBRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible.  He moves\nforward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly\ncloser...\n\n...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE.  She backs off in shock as he\ncovers his face.  His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING.\nShe rushes over --\n\nSELINA\nAre you okay?\n\nBRUCE\nIs there a cat in here?\n\nRight on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW\n-- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg.  He brushes the\nanimal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms.  BRUCE sniffles\nuncontrollably.\n\nBRUCE (cont.)\nGet it away!\n\nShe drops the cat, which scampers off.  BRUCE rubs his eyes.\n\nSELINA\nPoor thing.  You're allergic!\n\nBRUCE\nYeah, cats...ever since I was a kid...\n(snorting and weeping)\nLook, I'd better get some fresh air.\nMaybe another time, okay...\n\nHe heads for the door before SELINA can stop him.  He's gone,\nbut she knows she's left a dent in his armor.  She smiles in\nbemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS.\n\nEXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\n\nBRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated.\nHe marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he\nstops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE.\n\nHe opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been\nwaiting for:\n\nTALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming.\nWhy don't we trim the tree together?\n\nThis puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street.\nIn the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN\nare stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost\nfifty feet tall.\n\nThe LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham.  BRUCE\nsmiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to\nhis car.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT\n\nSNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree.  The\ntree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the\nONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric\nsheets.\n\nA BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in\nfront of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition\nof \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.\"  The Square is rocking with\ngood will toward men.  When they get to the part about saving\nus all from Satan's power --\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\n-- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from\nhis usual gargoyle's perch.  He's scanning the streets and the\nrooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move --\nwhatever it is.\n\nHe glances at the building directly across the square from\nhim.  On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in\nornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL\nSCULPTURE of the world turning.  His eyes rove downward along\nthe facade of the building...\n\nEXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT\n\nAt street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the\nGlobe offices.  THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of\nthe ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX\nhandcuffed to his wrist.  Of course, we can't see what's\ninside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just\nabout the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE.\n\nThe GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without\nincident.  As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the\nframe; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which\nreads:\n\nBATMAN: HERO OR MENACE?\nRead All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE!\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN\n\nHe watches with some curiosity.  An armored car: is this some\npart of the CATWOMAN's scheme?  But no...the GUARDS are safely\ninside the building, and the CAR is leaving.  He settles back\nto wait.\n\nINT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe\nbuilding.  FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and\nthe PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the\nwindshield.\n\nThey turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of\nsimilar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS.  Just part of the\nfleet...\n\nINT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER\n\nThe quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office.\nThe publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy\ngetaway.  The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX --\nsets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at\narm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents.\n\nSatisfied, he slams it shut.  He reaches into his top drawer\nfor an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY.\n\nPROVOST\nOpen this in an hour.  Phone my wife and\ntell her where to meet me.\n(to the GUARDS; edgily)\nNo trouble on the way, I take it?\n\nLEAD GUARD\nNo sir, Mr. Provost.  We came straight\nfrom the bank vault.\n\nGUARD II\n'Copter should be just touching down.\nWe'll have you safely out of here in no\ntime.\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN\n\n\"Here Comes Santa Claus\" echoes up from the streets.  BATMAN\nwatches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of\nthe Globe...\n\nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER\n\nPROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an\nelevator bank.  The other GUARDS head for a stairwell.\n\nGUARD II\nWe'll check the stairs.  See you on the\nroof.\n\nThe LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST\npulls a key from his pocket instead:\n\nPROVOST\nNo -- my private elevator.  It's safer.\n\nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT\n\nshooting DOWN on the car as it rises.  The shaft above it is\nfilled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like,\nswooping and gliding among the gears and cables...\n\nEXT. ROOF OF GLOBE BUILDING - THAT MOMENT\n\nIn BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors\nstill spinning.  In FG, the small dormer-like structure that\nhouses the STAIRWAY.  The metal access door opens, and the\nfirst of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready.  He\nsmiles back at his pal.\n\nGUARD\nNo way.  They don't pay us enough to\ntangle with Batm--\n\nA black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of\nthe dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT...\n\nINT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT\n\nSWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up\nbutton and the car begins to rise.  Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO\nOUT.  The car stops with a lurch.\n\nPROVOST\nWhat is it??  What's happening??\n\nSuddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud\nPOPPING SOUNDS...which could be gunfire...\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - ON CROWD\n\nsinging \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" at the top of their lungs.\nHappy faces beam.  No one hears anything unusual over the\nmusic...\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP - ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN\n\nBATMAN straining to listen.  We get another faint series of\nPOPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the\nloud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades.\n\nHe can't really be sure he's heard anything at all.  He scans\nthe roof of the Globe building, but he can't see what's\nhappening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon\nsign...\n\nEXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire\nfrom the dead GUARD's rifle.  The helicopter is still idling,\nbut no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with\nstiffs...\n\nINT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT\n\nPITCH BLACK.  Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue\nfrom the darkness.  An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the\nemergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a\ncorner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed\nspastic.  The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points\nup at the LIGHT:\n\nGUARD\nThere.  Mr. Provost.  See?  The\ngenerator's kicked in.  It's just an\nelectrical problem.\n\nPROVOST is only marginally consoled.  They hear a strange\nTWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them...\n\nPROVOST starts babbling again.  The GUARD slaps him across the\nface.  But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well.  He\nstares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on\nthe panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move.\n\nGUARD\nThere.  See?  It's moving.  We're fine.\n\nPROVOST\nIt's going down.  We're going DOWN!!!\n\nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR.\nThey're patiently riding it down as it descends...\n\nINT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe car stops again.  PROVOST is totally losing it.  The\nexasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM.\n\nGUARD\nOkay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look\nthrough the trap door.  But I need you to\nhelp me.  Okay?  You have to help.\n\nPROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself.  The GUARD\nlooks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car.  He can't\nreach it...\n\nHe uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist\n-- and STANDS on it.  Still short.  Unholstering his gun and\nusing it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door.  He\nJUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the\npanel slightly.\n\nMore TWITTERING.  PROVOST and the guard look up through the\ntiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness.\n\nGUARD\nProbably just some bird that's gotten in\nthe shaft.  Now calm down.  You'll have to\ngive me a boost.\n\nThe GUARD climbs back atop the raven box.  PROVOST gives him a\nboost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap\ndoor.\n\nGUARD (cont.)\nOkay, help me out...steady...\n\nPROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and\ntries to hoist him upward.\n\nINT. SHAFT - ON ROOF OF CAR - THAT MOMENT\n\nFrom a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the\nGUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door.  Now\nhis HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls\nhimself upward.\n\nHe peers around.  His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight\n-- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front\nof him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face...\n\nINT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling.\nPROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees.\nAll at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and\nhis legs KICK WILDLY.  Still PROVOST struggles to hang on --\neven as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome...\n\nFinally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much.  PROVOST\ntrips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his\nass in a corner of the car.  The GUARD tumbles in a heap to\nthe elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond\nrecognition, his eyes gone altogether.\n\nPROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS.  He peers at the open\ntrap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and\nSHRIEKS AGAIN.\n\nThe EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings.  He stares at it.  It rings\nagain.  Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage,\nPROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver.\n\nPENGUIN (V.O.; filter)\nSixteenth floor.  Linens, housewares,\nladies' lingerie!\n\nPROVOST\nW-who is this??\n\nINT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT\n\nNEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all\ndriverless.  FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical\nequipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been\nLOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's\nprivate elevator, the doors to which are still closed.  The\nPENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE.\n\nPENGUIN\nMr. Provost?  If you want to get out of\nthat car alive, I suggest you follow my\ninstructions to the letter.\n\nAs he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on\nthe concrete nearby, DEAD.  A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been\nlowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper\nproduction staff from the VAN POOL.  They're trapped on the\nother side.  BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door...\n\nPENGUIN (cont.)\nSHUT UP IN THERE.\n(calmly; into phone)\nYou should see a cord hanging just behind\nyou.\n\nINT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT\n\nPROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned\nCORD descending through the trap door.\n\nPROVOST\nYes -- yes, I see it --\n\nPENGUIN (V.O; filter)\nTie the cord to the handle of your box.\n\nPROVOST lets the phone drop.  He grits his teeth, but hastens\nto obey.  As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the\nbox, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him\ninto a panic.  Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone.\n\nPENGUIN (V.O.; filter)\nWhen you're done, I want you to give two\nsharp yanks on the cord.\n\nCowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it\ntwice.\n\nPROVOST\nWho are you??  Why are you doing this??\n\nINT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN\n\nBehind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and\nBATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear.  FRICK climbs\ninto a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine.\n\nPENGUIN\nWell, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call\nme an irate reader.  And to be perfectly\nfrank -- I'm doing this because I hate\nGarfield.\n\nChuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the\nmouthpiece of the phone.\n\nINT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT\n\nA SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver.  All at once, the\nelevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging\nthemselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined\nspace.\n\nPROVOST is screaming like a madman.  The birds are in his\nhair, his face -- everywhere.  He fights his way over to the\npanel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy...\n\nAll at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD.  It's as if the floor\nhas DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL.\n\nINT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN\n\nPENGUIN\nGoing down!\n\nHe hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from\nthe ELEVATOR DOORS.\n\nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets\nuncontrollably downward.  A steady stream ot BIRDS are making\na quick exit from the trap door in the roof...\n\nINT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the\ndormer that leads to the roof.  She pries open a pair of\nELEVATOR DOORS...\n\n...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making\nfor the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above.  She reaches\ninside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it\nin.\n\nShe rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at\nher trophy.  It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like\nthe first two.  An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down,\nRATTLES THE SHAFT...\n\nShe makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the\nroof.\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN\n\nHe watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight\nfrom the Globe roof across the square.  Something weird is\ndefinitely going on.  He's about to abandon his post --\n\n-- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING.  The\nbig tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the\nseconds:\n\nCROWD\nTen!  Nine!...\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND\n\nA ramshackle kiosk at street level.  The NEWS VENDOR has\nstepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities.\nA GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the \"BATMAN -- HERO OR\nMENACE?\" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of\npapers on the curb.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE\n\nEXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off:\n\nCROWD\n...Three!  Two!  One!\n\nThe CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into\nCHEERS.  The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of\n\"JINGLE BELLS.\"\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND\n\nThe NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone\nelse when a second newspaper van rumbles past...\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nHey!  No!  I aleady got a --\n\nHe spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing\nRED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS.  They shove a BODY out the door --\n\nThe mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk\nwith a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read\n\"BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE.\"\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING\n\nThe NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded\na corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square.\nThe CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence --\n\n-- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID,\nCHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!!\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE\n\nThe CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop\ndown from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders.\nORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the\nBAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant\nChristmas tree.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS\n\nCHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES.\nThey drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as\nthe bats attack.  WOMEN SCREAM.  CHILDREN SCREAM.  MEN SCREAM\nTOO.\n\nA MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands\non his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA\nCLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a\nprerecorded voice: \"HO HO HO.\"  The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as\nthe BATS converge on him.\n\nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT\n\nHORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour\nin through the broken window.  WOMEN lined up for a FREE\nMAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their\nhairdos.\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN\n\nHe stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below.  He\nglances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a\nWOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at\nthe chaos, TAUNTING him.\n\nEXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT\n\nA few blocks away from Gotham Square.  SIRENS HOWL.  There's a\nsteady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the\ndisturbance.  One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction,\nagainst traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN.\n\nEXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER\n\nBATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the\nCORPSES strewn across the helipad.  A dying GUARD raises a\nshaky hand...\n\nBATMAN crouches beside him.  A GURGLE comes up from his throat\nand a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips.  All at once he\nhears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE\nSCULPTURE...\n\nCATWOMAN (O.S.)\nSome people just can't take discipline.\n(beat)\nGo ahead.  Finish 'em off...\n\nHis head jerks up.  He can't see anything.  A sudden WHOOSHING\nnoise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the\nroof.\n\nCATWOMAN (O.S.)\nYou might as well.  You're going to get\nblamed for it anyway.\n\nHe stands.  He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW\nspringing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof,\nclinging to exposed pipes and fixtures.  He reaches for a\nBatarang.\n\nCATWOMAN (O.S.)\nOh, come on, angel.  You know you want to.\n(purring loudly)\nBesides -- I want to see how you do it!\n\nBATMAN\nWho are you?\n\nHe's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind,\nfeet first, knocking him to the rooftop.  He tries to get up,\nbut she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS,\nknocking him back into a cornice.  He ducks right just as a\nSHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three\ninches from his throat.\n\nHe catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and\nlands on her feet.  Cats always do...\n\nCATWOMAN\nMy, aren't we frisky tonight.\n\nHe flings the BATARANG.  It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as\nshe SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach.  GLASS TUBING\nshatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows --\n\nCATWOMAN\nI should tell you -- I've got nine lives\nto play with -- and you've only got one...\n\nHe turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a\ndeath grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly\ntoward the HELICOPTER.  The huge ROTOR BLADES are still\nturning...\n\nBATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free --\nFALLING BACKWARD onto the roof.  It's a strategic move: when\nhe rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and\nKICKS UPWARD with startling force.\n\nThis time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his\nfeet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER.\nHe slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on\nhim.\n\nShe grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around\nhis CROTCH.  He tries to break her grip, but she's just as\nstrong as he is.  And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward,\ntoward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the\nhelicopter!\n\nThe rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises\nperilously closer.  At the last possible instant, he grabs a\nhandful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can --\n\nWith a YOWL, she releases him.  They tumble to the roof and\nshe DIVES ATOP HIM.  Her TALONS click into place -- he sees\nthem poised directly above his EYES --\n\n-- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can\nstrike.  Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and\ncircle each other...\n\nSOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the\nroof, trying to break it down.  BATMAN turns for an instant --\na sudden CRACK --\n\n-- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT-\nO'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER.  She\nsends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he\ncollapses to the roof in a jittering heap.  The BANGING on the\ndoor is louder...\n\nCATWOMAN\nDid I tell you I invited company?  -- Keep\n'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat.\n\nShe kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching\nface.  Then she scurries to the edge of the roof,\nDISAPPEARING --\n\n-- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes\ncrashing out onto the roof!\n\nJust coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but\nthe COPS are swarming the place.  They spot the BODIES on the\ntar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the\nobvious conclusion.  Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE.  BULLETS\nRICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE.\n\nBATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a\nGRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which\nis a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS\nHIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall.  The SWAT COPS score a\ncouple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum,\nbut his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough\nto reach the roof.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nFRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in\nthe front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door.\nSomeone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all\nthe ruckus --\n\n-- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining\nfast.  Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his\nUMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS\nA TRIGGER.\n\nANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT\n\nA SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges\nitself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR.\n\nINT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin\nHURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS.  A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS\nbounce off in rapid succession.  CRACKS begin to spread across\nthe glass.\n\nThe COPS can't see where they're driving.  The car SWERVES\nWILDLY.  And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE\nWINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW...\n\nEXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a\nLAMPPOST and SKIDS.  The second car CRASHES INTO IT.  And the\npigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto\nthe immobilized squad cars.\n\nINT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off\nunmolested.\n\nPENGUIN\nLook at that, boys -- they do flock\ntogether!!\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nAMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK\ncontinues.  COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies\nas they try to evacuate the citizenry.  PARAMEDICS drop the\nstretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their\nheads...\n\nEXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT\n\nBATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof\nover, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow.  The\nroofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for\nstep, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the\nnext, leading him on.  Finally she reaches the edge of a\nbuilding on the corner of the block; there's no place to go\nbut down.  She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to\nhim --\n\nCATWOMAN\nOoh.  Where have you been all my life?\n\nHe edges closer.  Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY\nOFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.\n\nBATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING.  He hesitates a second -- moves\ncloser to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE.\n\nBATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT\n\nStaring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade\nof the building some ten or twelve feet below.  The window of\na corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping\nin the chill wind.\n\nEXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\n\nShe's obviously making her getaway through the apartment.\nBATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop\nto the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way\ndown.  A sudden CRACK --\n\nThe CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment.  Instead, she's\nfollowed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently\ndoubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN.  He TURNS just as\nher WHIP wraps itself around his left leg.  She gives it a\nsharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER\nTHE EDGE OF THE ROOF.\n\nEXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN\n\nHe plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS\nUP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING.  The WHIP\nhas coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding\ntight.  He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away\nfrom the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip\nUNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so.\n\nHe manages to brace his left foot against the wall.  It's a\nmassive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from\nmoving.  The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down\nto the pavement...\n\nEXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT\n\nShe's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed\npipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place.  With a cheshire-\ncat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it\non the edge of the cornice.\n\nEXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT\n\nBATMAN hanging immobile.  Craning his neck, he can just see\nthe\n\nRAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly,\nand apparently talking to him...\n\nCATWOMAN (O.S.)\nNevermore.  Nevermore!\n\nNow the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice,\nchin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a\nfern bar.\n\nCATWOMAN\nCute, huh!  I think it'll look nice over\nthe fireplace.  Maybe you can drop by and\nsee it sometime.\n(demurely)\nI hope you won't think I'm too...\naggressive or anything, but I find you\nvery attractive.\n\nShe toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat\nwith a piece of yarn.  BATMAN grimaces.  She speaks in a low,\nsoothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr.  Behind the bondage\nmask she bats her eyelashes.\n\nCATWOMAN (cont.)\nIt's just so hard to meet interesting men\nthese days.  Don't you think so?\n(sighing)\nI have trouble with relationships.  Men\nfind me intimidating...kind of predatory,\nyou know?  Really I'm not.  Really I'm\njust playful...\n\nBATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can\ngrab hold of the whip.  She frowns and YANKS on it.  His foot\nflies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils\nbefore he can stabilize himself.\n\nCATWOMAN (cont.)\nDon't laugh!  I'm trying to open up to\nyou!\n\nAngrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut\nhim loose.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nHe's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt.\nHolding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around\ninto firing position.  He'll shoot it right through her if he\nhas to...\n\nCATWOMAN (cont.)\nI always seem to fall for the wrong guys.\nYou know...most men are rats.\n\nANGLE ON CATWOMAN\n\nShe withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her\nphilosphical mode.\n\nCATWOMAN\nMice, really.  It's disgusting -- they beg\nyou to walk all over them and then they\nwhine when you do it.  Once you've had\nyour fun there's not much you can do but\nkill them.\n(beat)\nBut you seem different.  I mean, you\nobviously understand about dressing up...\nthat saves a lot of explaining.  I think\npeople should indulge their fantasies,\ndon't you?\n\nBATMAN is sweating profusely.  He can't hold his position much\nlonger.  And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation\nout endlessly...\n\nCATWOMAN\nSo I think I'll let you live.  Cute boys\nlike you are hard to find...\n(standing up)\n'Bye, angel.  I'll be thinking about you.\n\nAnd just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with\nher raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle.  He hangs there a moment,\ntries to twist himself around without moving his foot.  He\nbraces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his\ngrappling gun and FIRES.\n\nThe HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof.  BATMAN yanks the line\ntaut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when --\n\n-- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice!\n\nCATWOMAN\nGee...I'm so fickle.\n\nA QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly\nSEVERED.  BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's\nstill got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN.  He DROPS eight or ten\nfeet...\n\nEXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN\n\nwatching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to\nDISLODGE.  It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof\nand CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the\nCORNICE --\n\n-- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY.  Fascinated, the\nCATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down...\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS\n\nHe flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up\ntoward him.  He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS\nCYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch.  The rods in his\ncape begin to INFLATE...\n\nSix stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge.\nFive stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS.\nFour stories up, he rights himself.  Three stories up, he goes\ninto a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide\narcs over the street...\n\n...and a moment later there are no stories left.  With an ugly\ncrunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES.\nFace down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the\nmiddle of a BUSY INTERSECTION.\n\nEXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nA DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two\nfeet away from BATMAN'S HEAD.  He doesn't move.  PEDESTRIANS\nare already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and\npeers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the\nstreet:\n\nDRIVER\nWhat the hell is this?\n\nCARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few\nblocks over.  HORNS are honking.  A TRAFFIC COP marches\nover --\n\nTRAFFIC COP\nAwright, what's the problem here?\n(spotting BATMAN)\nJesus.\n\nHe tries to clear the crowd away.  A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is\nforming around the prostrate BATMAN.  The COP blows his\nwhistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN\nrush up to join him.\n\nThey manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back.\nThe assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body\narmor.  Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters...\n\nPATROLMAN\nGood God.  Cowan -- get to the car --\nradio the commissioner!!\n\nBy now there must be two hundred people in the intersection,\nall surging forward to get a look.  More COPS are arriving to\nbeat them back.\n\nTRAFFIC COP\nIs he dead?  What do we do?\n\nPATROLMAN\nThe mask.  Get the mask off.\n\nThey hunker down over BATMAN.  One of them tugs at his mask --\nbut the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way.  He feels\naround --\n\nTRAFFIC COP\nSome kinda seam here on the neck...\n\nThe PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like\nfastening under BATMAN's chin.  The instant it comes open --\n\n-- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS\nin the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward,\nshrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes.\nBooby-trap -- they've just been Maced.\n\nOne of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion.\nOn impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN.  The\nbody JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF --\n\nTRAFFIC COP\nDON'T SHOOT, you idiot.  The crowd --\n\nBefore he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the\nONLOOKING COP's hand.  BATMAN is back among the living.\nSIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing\nout with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back --\n\nFuck the crowd.  TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire\nin absolute panic.  BATMAN slams backward into the delivery\ntruck and crumples to the ground.  As he falls, he grabs a\ncouple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the\npavement.\n\nSeconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading\nthrough the intersection.  BATMAN emerges into the midst of\nthe crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles --\n\nEXT. INTERSECTION - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT\n\nA MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam,\ndrawn by all the confusion.  He rears the horse back, turns it\nin a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute\nthe incoming cars...\n\nSuddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms.  He\nlooks down.  He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden\nJERK pulls him cleanly off his mount.\n\nBATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over\nto the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of\nthe MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE.  He digs in his heels,\nmaneuvering through traffic...\n\nEXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\n\nLT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks\noff trying to get through the jam.  Their siren is on, but the\ncars blocking their path have no room to pull over.  BULLOCK\ngrabs the radio mike:\n\nBULLOCK\nHell of a mess up here, Commissioner.\nWe'll have to go in on foot...\n\nAs they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in\nthe opposite direction.  On the back of the horse...is BATMAN.\n\nGaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car\nimmediately into REVERSE.  As they watch, BATMAN kicks the\nhorse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park.\n\nINT. GOTHAM PARK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\n\nTwo RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night\npatrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to\nthe park.\n\nRED BERET I\nThis is wack, man.  Nothing ever happens\naround here anymore.\n\nThe other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his\npartner out of the way.  They tumble into a snowdrift as\nBATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and\ngallops past, nearly trampling them in the process.  By now,\nSQUAD CARS are roaring into the park...\n\nINT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER\n\nSIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP\nCARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the\npark.  BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white\nwhips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than\ntwenty yards away.\n\nHe turns the horse in a circle.  MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the\ndistance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered\nfrom the opposite side of the park.  It's going to be tough\ngetting out of here...\n\nThen: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather,\nGENERAL WAYNE -- two Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet\napart.  He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI\nand gets an inspiration.\n\nHe rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans\nthe little frozen creek.  There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL\nVICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate.  This must\nbe where the boy vigilante holes up...\n\nHe dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's\nsaddle and sends it off with a slap.  He pries the grate loose\nand crawls inside.\n\nINT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT\n\nA dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in\nthe floor.\n\nRUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN\npasses directly underneath.  A little farther back there's an\nACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train\ntracks below.\n\nPoking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy\nvigilante's stash.  The first contains tins of food, plus\nvarious odds and ends.  The second's more in line with what he\nneeds -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING.\n\nA TRAIN rumbles past underneath.  BRUCE removes his COWL and\nsets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get\nhim out of the park.  A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten\ntopcoat: perfect.  As he's pulling them out of the box, he\nspies something extremely odd --\n\nIt's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT\nwith a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine\ncondition.  He removes it carefully from the box and holds it\nup in front of him.  Stitched on the vest is a single initial,\n\"R,\" in a black circle.  He stares at the whole mystifying\nensemble in complete befuddlement...\n\nThe roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING\nNOISE.  Someone's in the tunnel with him.  He lowers the\ncostume abruptly --\n\n-- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front\nof him not three feet away.  The kid's just crawled up through\nthe ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder\nmessing with his stuff:\n\nDICK\nIt's MINE!\n\nHe lunges furiously at BRUCE.  The two of them tumble back\ninto the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE --\n\nEXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nA POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds\nbefore BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling.\nBRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment.  DICK lands\nhard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked\nsmile comes to his face...\n\nOut here in the moonlight he can see his opponent.  The body\narmor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and\nabove it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view...\n\nAs a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the\nbridge.  Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange\nlittle boy's hands.\n\nThe kid sizes up the situation immediately.  He nods his head\nup and down.  Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws\nit to BRUCE.\n\nBRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth.  He\npulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and\nstarts to move off.\n\nDICK\nNO.  WAIT!\n\nBRUCE turns, uncertainly.  DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP.\n\nThe KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably.  Then he sprints off\ninto the woods, dancing, leaping.  As he disappears from view,\nhe lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK --\n\n-- which is obviously intended to divert the cops.  BRUCE\nmakes haste in the opposite direction.\n\nEXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER\n\nBRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape\nstill attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it.\n\nINT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nTWO COPS scanning the park.  The CAPED HORSE charges past in\nfront of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the\nheadlights.  From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in\nthe saddle.\n\nThe COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn.  A moment later, he\nSLAMS ON THE BRAKES.\n\nA MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the\nsquad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen\nski cap, obviously one of the homeless.  A COP leans on the\nhorn and shouts out the window:\n\nCOP\nDumb son of a bitch!!\n\nThe MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path.\nThe COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN\n\nA DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table.  ALFRED, in robe\nand slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE\nBANDAGE.\n\nALFRED\nCommissioner Gordon called.  He wants to\ninstall a full contingent of police guards\nhere at the manor -- in round-the-clock\nshifts -- to protect you from Batman.\n\nBRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair.  His shirt\nis open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a\nfull roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS.\n\nBRUCE\nGreat.  What'd you tell him?\n\nALFRED\nI told him that since you were Batman,\nyou'd require no protection from Batman.\n\nBRUCE makes a face: how droll.  ALFRED tears off the tape with\na brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF\nPAIN.\n\nBRUCE\nJesus, Alfred -- !!\n\nALFRED\nIn future, sir...I strongly advise against\ntrying to fly off twenty-story buildings.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's just a few bruises.\n\nALFRED\nOne bruise, sir.  Which covers your entire\nbody.\n\nBRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly\nfashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's\nbag.\n\nBRUCE\nI'm getting too old for this line of work.\n(beat)\nCops placed me at the scene of the crime\n-- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my\nface --\n\nALFRED\nI shouldn't worry overmuch.  I doubt the\ntwo of you move in the same circles.\n\nBRUCE\n-- and I got the living shit knocked out\nof me by a woman.\n\nALFRED\nSir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are\nquite unbecoming.\n\nINT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY\n\nIn a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side\n(or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS\nsettled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across\nantique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS\nlittering the carpet.  HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one\nwall.\n\nThey peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE\nacross the street...\n\nHIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT\n\nA UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping\nwatch on the roof of the brownstone.  He signals \"all clear\"\nto his counterpart watching from the house opposite.\n\nINT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT\n\nTWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block,\nmunching on donuts and watching the same brownstone.  They\nspot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on\nhis way to the brownstone.  One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks\nup his RADIO MIKE:\n\nPLAINCLOTHESMAN\nMailman's coming.\n\nEXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER\n\nThe POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone,\nsorting through letters and packages.  He hasn't even rung the\nbell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches\nthe mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS\nFACE.\n\nINT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT\n\nMORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside --\nunshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up.  They're in\nfor the long haul.\n\nThe first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of\nCOLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown\npaper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS.  They carry it\ngingerly into the kitchen.  Into the midst of all this\nbustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON:\n\nGORDON\nAnything suspicious!\n\nIn the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are\nexamining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light\nbulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open.\n\nCOP\nNothing yet.  Christmas cards and bills.\n\nHe anxiously watches their progress.  A VOICE calls from the\nkitchen.\n\nBOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.)\nCommissioner -- ?\n\nINT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER\n\nGORDON enters.  The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment\nscattered all over the kitchen table.  They've slit the brown-\npaper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE\nTIN.\n\nBOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT\nIt's a fruitcake.\n\nHe lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look.\n\nGORDON\n...Have it analyzed.\n\nINT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT\n\nA bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying\na pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES.  His WIFE and TWO KIDS are\nbehind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an\nextended vacation.\n\nPOLICEMAN\nMrs. Tiptree?  The car's here.\n\nTIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long\nwordless moment.  Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's\nsleeve.\n\nLITTLE GIRL\nI don't wanna go to Grandma's.  I wanna\nstay here with Daddy.\n\nMRS. TIPTREE\nShe's got a nice tree just like ours,\nhoney.  Daddy'll be up as soon as he can.\n\nLITTLE GIRL\nShe's old.  She doesn't even have cable.\n\nLITTLE BOY\nWhat about our presents?\n\nHe gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the\nparlor.\n\nTIPTREE\nDon't worry.  I'll bring 'em up with me.\nWe'll open 'em when I get there.\n\nTIPTREE forces a smile for the kids.  He CLUTCHES his wife's\nhand.\n\nGORDON\nSorry, folks, but we'd better move along.\n\nMRS. TIPTREE\nKids?  Tell your Daddy goodbye...\n\nTearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort\nMRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door.  TIPTREE pulls GORDON\naside.\n\nTIPTREE\nThey'll be safe, won't they?\n\nGORDON\nAs safe as we can make 'em.\n(beat; sternly)\nIt would help if you could give us some\nsmall hint what this is all about.\n\nTIPTREE\nI told you.  I...\n\nTIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes.  GORDON is\nconvinced he's holding something back.\n\nGORDON\nYou have no idea what was in that box that\nProvost had delivered from the bank.\n\nTIPTREE shakes his head wearily.  GORDON glowers as he turns\nto go.\n\nGORDON (cont.)\nAll right, Mr. Tiptree.  Merry Christmas.\n\nGORDON exits.  TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living\nroom, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids\nride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS.  One of the COPS tries to\npull him away from the window, but he refuses to move...\n\n...until a PHONE RINGS.  Everyone jumps at once.  A TECHNICIAN\nhits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly,\nthen gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver...\n\nTIPTREE\nHello...?\n\nVOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER\nMr. Tiptree?  Andy here.  Listen -- we've\ngot a chance to grab a good-sized block of\nAtlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an\neighth --\n\nThe COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment.\n\nTIPTREE\nNot today, Andy.  Let's talk after New\nYear's.\n\nTIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle\nof the room.  The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment\nas he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff\njolt.\n\nINT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\nWallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary\ncomposing a LETTER.  He takes a long pull on a glass of\nScotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an\nenvelope.  He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a\n.38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes\nit to the envelope.  He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE.\n\nA moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK.\nHe peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the\nledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in.\n\nHe raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside,\nonto the sill.  The bird, well-trained, struggles only\nslightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes\na FOLDED NOTE.  Scrawled across it is a handwritten message:\n\nIF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD\n\nHe opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY\n\nBRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions.  A BANNER\nHEAD-LINE shrieks:\n\nBATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER\nBat Attack Panics Gotham Square\nJ. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy\n\nHe hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall.  He gets up...\n\nINT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY\n\nBRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing\nher patetented thing on ALFRED.\n\nSELINA\nEnglish accents are so stimulating.\n(beat)\nYou have the most beautiful silver hair!\n\nALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR.  He's\nabout to break into a sweat.  He's eminently relieved when she\nturns and sees --\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nBruce!\n\nBRUCE\nSelina.  What are you doing here?\n\nALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA\nslinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm.  She's on him like a\nbarnacle.\n\nSELINA\nI wanted to see your things, remember?\nAnd I got tired of waiting for you to call\nme back.\n(gesturing toward ALFRED)\nHe's adorable.  How long have you had him?\n\nINT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\n\nBRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory.  He glances\nback over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around\nthe corner.\n\nBRUCE\nYou heard about Harry Provost.\n\nSELINA\nIt's incredibly awful.  It got me a little\nworried.\n(sidling up closer)\nI hate to think of something happening to\nyou.\n\nBRUCE\nSame here.\n\nSELINA\nIt's odd, though.  Danger, the thought of\nsuddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets\nyou sort of...aroused.  Don't you think?\n\nBRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her.  Everything gets her sort of\naroused.\n\nINT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER\n\nSELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and\nexotic weapons.  She's like a kid in a toy shop.\n\nSELINA\nBruce, this is incredible.\n(indicating a suit of armor)\nMalaysian -- ?\n\nBRUCE\nNot bad.  Sarawak warrior caste.\n\nSELINA\nIt's like -- everything in here is another\nlittle piece of your mind.  I was right\nabout you.\n(turning to face him)\nPromise, okay?  Promise you'll show me\nevery inch of this place.\n\n\n\nPAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY\n\n\n\nINT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER\n\nALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer\nprintout.  He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at\na nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the\nkeyboard.\n\nALFRED\nThe police have no files whatsoever on\nSelina Kyle.\n\nBRUCE\n(abstractedly)\nLondon...Cairo...Belgium...\n\nALFRED\nWhat exactly are you --\n\nBRUCE\nHer credit card records.\n(looking up)\nEvery major art theft in the last five\nyears -- she's been on the scene or close\nto it.\n\nALFRED\nYou mean she's some sort of -- collector?\nA...cat burglar, or --\n\nBRUCE\nCould be.  Museum curator, authenticator\n-- she's got the perfect cover for it.\n(beat)\nWhat would she want with that stupid\nraven?\n\nALFRED\nRaven, sir?\n\nBRUCE\nThat's what the Catwoman took from\nProvost.  A little raven statuette, about\nso big...\n(shaking his head)\nBut it couldn't have been that valuable.\n\nHe continues to scan the screen.  ALFRED is suddenly lost in\nthought.\n\nALFRED\nHow very odd.\n(long pause)\nI'm sure it's nothing, but --\n\nBRUCE\nWhat, Alfred?\n\nALFRED\nYour father had a raven, sir.  A small\nstatue of the very sort you describe.  It\nused to sit on his desk.\n\nThis piques BRUCE's interest.  He swivels around in his chair\nand stares directly up at ALFRED.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat happened to it?\n\nALFRED\nAfter your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree\ncame to the house and asked if he could\nhave it.  As a keepsake.  I saw no harm...\n(shrugging)\nThat was thirty years ago.\n\nBRUCE\nWait a minute.  Mr. Tiptree?\n\nALFRED\nGeorge Tiptree.  Your friend Elliott's\nfather.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON\n\nTIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed.  It's empty\n-- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's\nstuffing inside it.  His head turns suddenly at the sound of\nthe doorbell...\n\nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER\n\nTIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister\ninto the ENTRYWAY below.  Standing there is an unexpected\nvisitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a\nbattery of COPS pat him down.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat are you looking for -- Batarangs?\n\nTIPTREE\nBruce!  Come on up.\n(to the COPS)\nI want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone.\n\nThe COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs.\n\nINT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER\n\nTIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him.\nBRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX.\n\nBRUCE\nI brought you a Christmas present.  Sorry\nabout the wrapping -- the police made me\nopen it.\n\nTIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE\nCLASP.  He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of\nbewilderment and gratitude.  BRUCE nods for him to try it on,\nand he obliges...\n\nTIPTREE\n...I'm afraid I don't have anything for\nyou.\n\nBRUCE\nI think you may have something that\nbelonged to my father.\n\nTIPTREE\n-- You know?\n\nHe stares at BRUCE, astonished.  His head sinks into his\nhands.\n\nTIPTREE (cont.)\nIt'll all be over tomorrow.  One way or\nanother, it'll all be over.\n(looking up; despondent)\nI've decided, Bruce.  I'm gonna give him\nthe last two ravens.  He's already got the\nothers.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat are you talking about?  Who?\n\nTIPTREE\nBatman.  I don't know how he found out,\nbut --\n\nTIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a\ndrink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's time you told me what's going on\nhere.\n\nTIPTREE\nDidn't you ever wonder where it came from,\nBruce?  All the privilege, all the power\n...all the money?\n(beat)\nThe ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce.\nThe key to an incredibly vast fortune.\n\nBRUCE\nWhose fortune?\n\nTIPTREE\nGotham City's.\n\nFLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)\n\nThe cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham.  A massive\nEXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and\ntotal CHAOS erupts: fires starting, BYSTANDERS screaming,\nPOLICE rushing to the scene...\n\nTIPTREE\nIn 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was\nlooted.  It was a fantastic operation --\nperfect military precision.  The robbers\nmade off with milllons in gold and silver\nbullion...\n\nA HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens\naround a corner.  Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a\nGATLING GUN into the crowd.  POLICE and ONLOOKERS tumble to\nthe pavement, shot dead, as ANOTHER CART emerges from the\nwreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite\ndirection.\n\nFLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)\n\nCITY OFFICIALS in a boardroom trading papers back and forth,\narguing furiously with five calm, distinguished-looking GENTS\n-- one of whom is the bushy-bearded Civil War hero GEN. OLIVER\nWAYNE.\n\nTIPTREE (V.O.)\nThe city was going under.  Bankrupt...\nuntil five rich men stepped in to bail it\nout.  In exchange they took the land\nrights, the mineral rights, the service\ncontracts --\n\nBACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE\n\nBRUCE\nThe Five Families.\n\nTIPTREE\nOur ancestors.  They bought Gotham City --\ncarved it up and ran it into the ground.\nIn five years they were rich beyond\nimagining.\n(pause)\nWe've just been following in their\nfootsteps.  And in all this time no one's\never suspected --\n\nBRUCE\n-- that they were the ones behind the\nrobbery?\n\nFLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)\n\nThe FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne\nManor, raising a celebratory toast.  CAMERA PANS OVER to a\nnearby table; on it rest FIVE RAVEN STATUETTES.\n\nTIPTREE (O.S.)\nThey had five ravens made.  Five ravens\nwhich -- combined -- would reveal the\nlocation of the treasure they'd stolen.\n(beat)\nBut they never touched it.  They never\nneeded to.  It's still there to this day.\n\nBACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE\n\nTIPTREE\nThe ravens, and the secret -- have been\npassed down through generations.  Father\nto son...\n(shaking his head)\nYour father -- died before he could tell\nyou.\n\nBRUCE\nSo they stole his piece of the puzzle.\n\nTIPTREE\nYeah.  I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going\nto hand it over.  He's right, you know.\nWe've all been feeding -- feeding on the\nsoul of Gotham...\n\nBRUCE stares at him, stony-faced.  There's one part of the\nstory that doesn't quite add up.\n\nBRUCE (cont.)\nI don't believe you, Elliott.  My father\nwas a decent man -- an honorable man.  He\nwould never have taken part in a scheme\nlike this.\n\nTIPTREE\nIt wasn't his doing, Bruce.  It was --\n\nBRUCE\nThat doesn't matter.  If he knew that his\nfortune was based on a crime -- a crime\nagainst the city...\n(violently)\nReputation or not, he would've tried to --\n\nTIPTREE\nChrist, Bruce!  Do you want me to spell it\nout for you?!?\n\nBRUCE backs off.  An awful shiver of anticipation runs down\nhis spine.\n\nTIPTREE (cont.)\nHe was a decent man.  He was an honorable\nman.  That's why they had him killed.\n\nCAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a\n\nSERIES OF SHOTS\n\nQuick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a\nMUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace.  THOMAS WAYNE\nlunging at him.  The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS.\nPEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk.  A second\nbullet felling his MOTHER --\n\n-- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN\nand GRIEF --\n\nBACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE\n\n-- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the\nadult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years\nlater.  Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as\nTIPTREE finishes his tale.\n\nTIPTREE\nThey killed him...to protect their secret\n...and now the bill's come due.  Now the\nbill's come due.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - TOWARD DUSK\n\nThe wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and\nbeyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against\nthe setting sun.  A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past...\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT\n\nBRUCE lies motionless on his bed.  Scattered about him are\nSCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS\nwhich describe the murder of his parents.  Disoriented, he\ngazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no\nlonger seem quite so familiar...\n\nHe folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at\nthe ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is\ncrushing him down.  Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS.  He makes no\nmove to answer it.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK\n\nVICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee.  ALFRED, who's\nin his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone.\n\nALFRED\nThank you, yes, everything's fine.  I'll\nexpect your next call in an hour.\n(hanging up; to VICKI)\nThe police are becoming an awful nuisance.\n\nVICKI\nI feel so awful for him, Alfred.  There\nmust be something we can do.\n\nALFRED\nI realized long ago -- that there are\nplaces in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one\nwill ever penetrate --  or share.\n(pause)\nHe loves you, Miss Vale.  But in certain\nways he will always be alone.\n\nBRUCE (O.S.)\n...Thanks for the testimonial.\n\nALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring\nat him.  He starts to say something, but thinks better of it.\nHe returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down\nacross from VICKI.  She extends a hand and he takes it --\nmaking a visible effort to hold himself together.\n\nBRUCE\nTiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous\nwith 'Batman.'  I think Batman ought to be\nthere when it happens.\n\nALFRED\nI see, sir.  When shall we expect you\nback?\n\nBRUCE\nGet your cap.  You're driving.\n\nINT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT\n\nIt's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently\ndownstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE.  The lights are on\nin the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching\nTV.\n\nINT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\n\nCHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness.  TIPTREE kneels\nbeside the tree and digs around among the packages.  He pulls\nout an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed \"TO DADDY -- FROM\nSANTA.\"\n\nWith a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the\npackage -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN\nSTATUETTES.  He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then\nslinks into the hallway...\n\nINT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown\nChristmas special on a portable TV.  One of them glances out\nthe window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the\nbrownstone, SUITCASE in hand...\n\nSTAKEOUT COP I\nShit -- that's Tiptree!!\n\nThe COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE.\n\nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nTIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of\nthe brownstone.\n\nCOP\nMr. Tiptree!  What the hell are you --\n\nHEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine.\nTIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone\nfollow suit.  At the end of the block he vanishes down a\nSUBWAY ENTRANCE.\n\nINT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT\n\nA VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS\ncome racing down the stairs.  The COPS trip over his open\nviolin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor.\nThey flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE\nTURNSTILE --\n\n-- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling\ndown a stairway which leads to the train platform below.\n\nINT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER\n\nTIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN.  The doors slide shut\nbehind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as\nhe rolls off.\n\nCOP\nWe've gotta get back to the radio.\n\nINT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING\n\nTIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively.\nBeing fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice\nin his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the\nsparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing.  Derelicts,\nprostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well-\nheeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his\nsuitcase and stares anxiously at the floor...\n\nAn ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car.  It's a\nDEAFMUTE.  He shambles down the aisle passing out little white\nCARDS.  One side is a guide to International Sign Language.\nThe other reads:\n\nDEAF AND DUMB\nPLEASE HELP -- $1.00\n\nTWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling,\nshining the DEAFMUTE on.  A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type,\nstuffs a buck in his tin cup.  He reaches TIPTREE and extends\na card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact --\n\n-- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face.\nNow TIPTREE looks up.  THIS CARD bears a personalized message:\n\nGOTHAM CENTRAL STATION\nB-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW\n\nTIPTREE's eyes widen.  The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK --\nglowers down and holds out his cup.  TIPTREE digs in his\npocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands\nit over anyway.\n\nSmiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next\ncar.  TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card.  He fidgets\nwith his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier...\n\nINT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT\n\nTIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE.  A small BLIP\nmoves across a shifting GRID not unlike a radar screen.\n\nBRUCE is in the back of the limo, eyeing the tracer intently.\nALFRED's up front, at the wheel.\n\nBRUCE\nAccording to this, he's directly below us.\n\nALFRED\nThe subway, sir?\n\nBRUCE\nYeah.  Take a right.\n\nINT. GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION - THAT MOMENT\n\nIt's slightly more crowded here in the hub of Gotham.  TIPTREE\nemerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS\nthirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as\nthey scan the crowd.\n\nSticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the\nnearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold\nthe SUITCASE out of view.\n\nINT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER\n\nTIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to\nclose.  He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the\ndoors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT.  He stands\nthere on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the\ntrain lurches forward...\n\nFalse alarm.  The train stops, and the doors hiss open again.\n\nINT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER\n\nTIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations.\nAs the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful\nSTREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious\nsuitcase.  He sits there panting...\n\nMoments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car.  TIPTREE does a\ntake: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line!\nOf course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin --\nFRACK...\n\nWIPE TO:\n\nINT. LOCAL STOP - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT\n\nHaving changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE\ndebarks at a deserted local stop.  The station is EMPTY except\nfor one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a\nWOMAN in a long fur coat.\n\nTIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell,\nSTILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor.  There's something\nfamiliar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed\nhat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face.\nIt is, of course, SELINA...\n\nTIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting\nfurther instructions.  They aren't long in coming.  A BLACK\nMYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform,\nand STRUTS in front of him.\n\nMYNAH\nFOLLOW ME.  AWWWKK!  FOLLOW ME.\n\nThe bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE\nTUNNEL.  TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief.  Then the bird\nCAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of\nthe tunnel:\n\nMYNAH (O.S.)\nFOLLOW ME.  AWWWKK!\n\nTIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping\nawkwardly to the tracks below.  Suitcase in hand, he begins to\nwalk...\n\nINT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT\n\nALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer.\n\nBRUCE\nHe's slowed down.  Looks like he's under\nthe park.\n\nALFRED\nHow do you propose to get down there, sir?\nWe can't have Batman strolling up to buy a\ntoken.\n\nBRUCE\nI know another way in.\n(beat)\nStep on it.  They're down there waiting\nfor him.\n\nALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past\nthe statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse...\n\nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT\n\nA LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen.  When it passes,\nwe see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express\ntracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with\neach step.  It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the\nonly illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot\nintervals.\n\nHe sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly\nswitches to the local tracks.  The train rumbles past with a\ndeafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his\nsurroundings.  TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the\ntunnel...\n\n...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a\nsmall gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE.  They've set up camp down\nhere in the tunnels, away from the elements.  Surrounded by\nbags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap\nwine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with\nthe suitcase who's invaded their domain.\n\nTIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening\ndown the tunnel.  The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with\none exception.  A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty\ntopcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively\nas TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows.\n\nHis face is familiar.  It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the\npark.\n\nINT. TUNNEL - FARTHER DOWN TRACKS - A MOMENT LATER\n\nIn this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be\nworking -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible.  When he\ncomes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of\nthe bird's shrill voice to guide him:\n\nMYNAH\nAWWRRK!  FOLLOW ME.\n\nTIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness.  He trips on\nthe tracks and drops the suitcase.  As he's getting to his\nfeet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE...\n\nVOICE\nSTOP THERE.\n\nThe MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches\non the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE.  TIPTREE COWERS and\nSQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands\nbefore him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA.\n\nTIPTREE\nI've cooperated.  I've done everything you\nsaid.\n\nPENGUIN\nOpen the case.\n\nTIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase.\nA CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness.\n\nPENGUIN (cont.)\n...Two ravens?\n\nTIPTREE\nThe other one is Bruce Wayne's.\n(trembling)\nHe doesn't know anything about this.\nYou've got what you want.  There's no need\nto --\n\nPENGUIN\nThank you, Mr. Tiptree.  You may go.\n\nTIPTREE stands.  He backs away from the suitcase warily.\n\nTIPTREE\nMy family.  You won't --\n\nPENGUIN\nWe'll certainly take your unexpected\ngenerosity into consideration.\n\nTIPTREE\nWe -- ?!?\n(shielding his eyes)\nYou're not Batman.\n\nPENGUIN\nNo.  I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman.\nNow move out.\n\nINT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT\n\nTIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA,\nsilhouetted in the flashlight beam.  The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY\nas the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light\ndown --\n\n-- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel\ncross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING\nas she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath.\n\nINT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE\n\nlooking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross-\ngirder.  He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat,\nWHIRLS SUDDENLY --\n\n-- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS\nat the PENGUIN.  The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella --\nwhich happens to be a bulletproof job.  The PENGUIN lifts his\nbrolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft --\n\n-- and TIPTREE staggers backward.  SHOT IN THE CHEST.  He\nspins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the\nELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of\nsparks.\n\nThe smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the\ntracks.  The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for\nsigns of life.\n\nCATWOMAN\nThat idiot.  Another six feet --\n\nPENGUIN\nSo sorry to spoil your fun.  -- He brought\ntwo ravens.  We've got a complete set!\n\nCATWOMAN\nWhat??\n\nPENGUIN\nYeah!  They're in the suitcase --\n\nAn AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel.  They see the lights of a\nTRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're\nstanding on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across.  The\nPENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track,\nwhere the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag\nTIPTREE out of the train's path...\n\nCATWOMAN\nGIVE ME A HAND!\n\nThey pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the\ntrain arrives.  They stand against the outer wall, waiting for\nthe train to pass...\n\n...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante --\nstanding on the inner track directly across from them.\nHOLDING THE SUITCASE.  The kid takes off like a shot.  The\nCATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter\ndisbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK.\n\nINT. TUNNEL - ON DICK\n\nThe bulky suitcase is slowing his progress.  He looks back\nover his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has\nfallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast.\n\n\n\nPAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY\n\n\n\nINT. TUNNEL - ON DICK\n\nwatching in the light from the train as the two costumed\nfigures grapple in the distance.  He races back toward the\nscene of the melee...\n\nINT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT\n\n...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for\nblow.  He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook,\nand she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding.  She lifts a\nhand: no mas...\n\nHe looks back toward the suitcase on the center track.  Before\nhe can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN\napproaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the\nlast one.  He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out\nof its path...\n\n...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN\ncomes barrelling down the center track from the opposite\ndirection!  Now he's got trains approaching on either side,\nand there's no place to go --\n\nThe CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet.  He LUNGES at\nher -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer\ntunnel wall.\n\nINT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and\nthe CATWOMAN from view.  The CENTER train is bearing down\nfast.  A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches\nthe suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on\nthe innermost LOCAL TRACK.\n\nHe stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite\ndirections.  He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead...\n\nINT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT\n\nBATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove --\nthere's not two inches of breathing space between them and the\npassing TRAIN.  She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and\nCLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT.\n\nHER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT.  As they struggle,\nshe hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER...\n\nIt's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved\nhim when he fell off the roof.  But this time the results are\naltogether different.  He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS\nCAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF\nTHE TUNNEL.\n\nHis OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against\nthe passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the\nrearmost car --\n\n-- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED\nOFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train!\n\nINT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK\n\nHe's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively\nto see what's become of BATMAN.  Finally the center train\npasses --\n\n-- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE --\nsmiling at him -- advancing menacingly.  DICK TURNS TO RUN...\n\nA GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps\nto the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of\nthe PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA.\n\nThe PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat.  The CATWOMAN\nsnatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him.  She\npeers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated...\n\nCATWOMAN\nGod.  Did you see him? Isn't he hot?\n\nPENGUIN\nHaven't you got anything else to think\nabout?\n(mopping sweat from his brow)\nI'm hot.  That was exhausting.\n\nCATWOMAN\nNo pain, no gain!  -- Suck it up.  We're\nnot out of here yet.\n\nShe sprints off down the tracks.  SQUAWKING, he waddles along\nbehind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him...\n\nAs they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back --\npast DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding\nheavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF\nTUNNELS --\n\n-- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he\nstaggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody.  He scans\nthe tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his\ngaze falls on DICK.\n\nHe limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his\nhead protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all\naround him...\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT\n\nThe stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT.  CAMERA\nZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL...\n\nINT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nA PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome.  We TILT\nDOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie\nsprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT.\n\nThe PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the\natrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a\npoint directly under the dome.  There, encased in a plexiglass\ncase, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City\nHall was erected.  He shouts up:\n\nPENGUIN\nLETS DO IT!\n\nINT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony.\nLining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical\ninterest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the\npentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a\nbronze bust.  The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families...\n\nThe CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly.  She removes the FIVE\nRAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way\naround the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed\nbases.  She follows along behind them, replacing each bust\nwith a RAVEN.\n\nWhen they're done, the PENGUIN yells up:\n\nPENGUIN\nNow.  Give each raven a quarter-turn.\n\nHis pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its\nrecessed socket, in quick succession...\n\nINT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN\n\nThe moment of maximum tension.  He stands there frothing at\nthe mouth with anticipation.  SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing\nhappens.\n\nCATWOMAN\nWhat happens now?\n\nPENGUIN\nI don't know.  That's all...!\n\nHe looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him\nfrom above.  He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen\nnext.  Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the\nfloor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING,\nflapping his arms like wings.\n\nPENGUIN (cont.)\nWe've been TRICKED!  It's a HOAX!  It's\na --\n\nHe SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK.  Somewhere\nbehind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind.  He spins\nand stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass\ncase...\n\nThe city model is TREMBLING slightly.  As he watches, the DOME\nof the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model\ncity -- POPS OFF on a hinge.  A METAL STRONGBOX rises into\nview...\n\nINT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal\nbox.  The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass\ncase of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to\nget at the box.\n\nFRICK\nThat's the treasure?\n\nCATWOMAN\nNo.  It's a map...\n\nShe affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER.\n\nINT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN\n\nThe plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls\nthrough, landing atop Gotham City.  He snatches at the\nstrongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a\ncolossus.  He's climbing down off the tabletop when the\nCATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him.\n\nHe hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off\nthe box.  He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a\nMAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS.  The CATWOMAN creeps\nover to his side:\n\nPENGUIN\nBruce Wayne.  So he doesn't know a thing\nabout the treasure, eh...?\n(handing her the map)\nLook at this.  It's right under Wayne\nManor.  It's been there all along!\n\nNow the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS.  They show\nprogressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES --\nan odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION...\n\nPENGUIN (cont.)\nLooks like some kind of cave.\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY\n\nTIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK.  He lies unconscious in a big soft\nfrilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp\ncloth; he moans slightly...\n\nHis eyes snap open suddenly.  He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a\nyelp.\n\nVICKI\nNo, no -- don't try to get up -- you're\nhurt.\n\nHe pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway.  His\nshoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling.  The pajamas he's\nwearing are three sizes too large.  He paces about, staring at\nhis unfamiliar surroundings.\n\nVICKI (cont.)\nIt's all right.  You're safe.  You can\nstay here as long as you need to.\n\nDICK\nI don't belong here.  You can't keep me\nhere.\n\nVaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades,\nlooks out at the grounds.\n\nVICKI\nIt's \"Dick\", isn't it?  Or do you prefer\n\"Richard\"?\n\nHe stares at her as if she's nuts.  VICKI opens a closet door:\nall of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including\nthe red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the \"R\" insigne on the\nbreast.\n\nVICKI\n\"R\" -- for Richard, right?  See, all your\nthings are here...\n(staring at the costume)\nWhat is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit?\n\nDICK\nIt's none of your business.  What is this,\nsome kind of home?\n\nVICKI\nNo, not that kind.  There's a swimming\npool -- tennis court -- you can have\nanything you want.\n\nDICK\nTennis court?!  -- Lady, you're rich.  How\nthe hell would you know what I want?\n\nVICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder.  He bats it\naway, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in\nagitation --\n\nDICK\nI'm not staying.  You can't make me --\n\n-- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him.\n\nBRUCE\nI can make you.\n\nDICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized\nhim.  The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh.  I'm\nin Batman's house.\n\nBRUCE (cont.)\nCome on.  Wanna go at it?\n(no response)\nLook, kid -- like it or not, you're my\nguest -- and long as you're here you might\nas well enjoy it.\n\nALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a\nbedside table.  DICK edges toward it and sits down.  He waits\nfor ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE\nall the while.\n\nBRUCE (cont.)\nWill you two be okay in here?\n\nVICKI nods yes.  BRUCE backs out of the room.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY\n\nBRUCE pulls the door shut.  ALFRED follows him down the hall.\n\nALFRED\nWhat do you propose to do with him, sir?\nKeep him in the room for the rest of his\nlife?\n\nBRUCE\nI don't know, Alfred.  I've got other\nstuff to worry about.\n\nALFRED\nThe child is hurt, sir.  At the very least\nwe should attempt to locate his parents.\n\nBRUCE\nHe hasn't got any parents.\n\nALFRED\nHow do you know that, sir?\n\nBRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze.\n\nBRUCE\n...I know.\n\nThe PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway.\nALFRED picks up a hallway extension.  He covers the\nmouthpiece:\n\nALFRED\nSir -- it's Miss Kyle.\n\nBRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call.\n\nINT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY\n\nARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room.  A\nSNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a\nphone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over\nher.\n\nSELINA\nWell!  Tall, dark and handsome.  Are we\nstill on for tonight?\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE\n\nHe covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED.  On his\nlook we\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT\n\nChristmas carols playing.  VICKI's got DICK helping her trim\nthe tree.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nBRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA.\n\nALFRED\nIs this necessary, sir?  After all...it is\nChristmas eve.\n\nBRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT.  He empties the contents\nof one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE\nCAPSULES.  He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits\nthem in his jacket pocket.\n\nBRUCE\nStuff'll knock out a moose, much less a\ncat.\n\nALFRED\nI don't like to see you going out on a\ndate...unprotected, sir.\n\nBRUCE\nShe'll be ready for Batman -- but not for\nme.\n(turning to go)\nIt's the only way, Alfred.  I've got to\ntake her out tonight.\n\nINT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV)\n\nDICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the\nbottom of the stairs.  The two of them exchange a few brief\nwords; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly\nsets his jaw and moves off toward the front door.\n\nVICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of\ncheer as DICK turns discreetly away.  This is one weird\nhousehold he's landed in...\n\nINT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT\n\nSOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front\nof a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in\nher own reflection.  She's looking especially sultry tonight\nin a glittering low-cut gown.  She lowers one shoulder strap\nand strikes a pose in the mirror: better.  She runs a hand\nthrough her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look.\n\nThe DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to\nanswer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which\nmeans she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand.\nBRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in.  She pulls\nup both straps as she greets him nonchalantly:\n\nSELINA\nYou're early.  I'm afraid I'm not quite\ndressed.\n\nBRUCE enters and takes a long look around.  It's a big open\nloft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts.\nThe walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS.  The\nfinished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised\nplatform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it,\nyowling at BRUCE.  SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out.\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nIf you're looking for my bondage gear,\nit's at the cleaners.\n\nBRUCE\nChristmas eve.  No tree?\n\nSELINA\nNo presents.  I've been a bad girl this\nyear.\n\nBRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby\nwet bar.\n\nBRUCE\nI'm surprised you kept this date.  I\nthought you would've lost interest by now.\n\nSELINA\nWhat makes you say that?\n\nBRUCE\nYou've got what you want, don't you?\n\nSELINA\nI do now.\n(smiling)\nWe've had this date for a long, long time.\n\nWith that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in\nto KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss.  But BRUCE seems\nstrangely unresponsive.  She breaks free and gives him a funny\nlook.\n\nBRUCE\nHow much is it going to cost me?\n\nSELINA\nWhat?\n\nBRUCE\n...To get the ravens back.\n\nHe watches her closely for a reaction.  SELINA's shocked, but\nshe conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion.\n\nSELINA\nYou're the oddest man I've ever met.\n(moving in on him)\nLet's talk later, Bruce.  I've got kind of\na short fuse...\n\nBRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a\ncrimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek.  She works her way\ndownward, kissing him around his neck and throat...\n\nHIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket.  He withdraws a tiny\nGLASSINE CAPSULE.  But before he can use it --\n\nHe JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away.  His free hand goes\nto his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from\nbetween two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS.  She's bitten him...\n\nNow she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and\nmassages it gently with one hand.\n\nSELINA\nDid I hurt you?  Just relax -- you'll\nstart to enjoy it.\n\nBRUCE pulls away again.  His eyes are strangely glazed.  He\ntries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen.\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nBruce, you look faint.  It must be the\ncats.\n\nBRUCE stands suddenly.  It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo\nnightmare.  His legs give way beneath him and he topples to\nthe floor, INERT.  His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls\nout; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem\nto work.\n\nSELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form --\npurring and stretching...\n\nBRUCE'S POV\n\nA worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory\nsmile on her face, shifting in and out of focus.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat di-- what did you d--\n\nShe runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright\nred.\n\nSELINA\nI guess I've...gotten under your skin.\n\nBACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE\n\nHis hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes\nSELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG.\nHe writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually\ngoing slack.\n\nThe PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and\nstand over him -- ALL LAUGHING...\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nA COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on\nschedule.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - PARLOR - NIGHT\n\nALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's\nboys.\n\nALFRED\nEverything's fine, thank you.  We'll talk\nin an hour.\n\nBehind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE.  She's curled up on\nthe sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious\nglance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven\no'clock.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nDICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall.  He's got\nall his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a\nwindow and throws the bundle outside.\n\nThere's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from\nthe window -- just close enough that he should be able to make\nit.  He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS.\n\nINT. CAR - OUTSIDE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nA car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her\nCatwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and\nFRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious\nand stone limp.  The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates\nof Wayne Manor.\n\nPENGUIN\nTry his mag card.\n\nFRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED\nCAPSULES.\n\nFRICK\nLook at this.  He's a pillhead.\n\nNow FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an\nelectronic device at the edge of the drive.  The gates\nmagically part.  There's a large VAN just behind the car --\ndriven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS.  Both vehicles\npull in before the gates slide shut.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER\n\nVICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen\nannouncing what should be BRUCE's arrival.  She heaves a huge\nsigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open.\n\nShe sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up.\n\nVICKI\nOhh.  Am I glad to --\n\nTo her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the\nfloor, flat as a board.  VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters,\nthrowing his arms wide.\n\nPENGUIN\nMER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!!\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nDICK has shimmied down to a lower branch.  He lets go and\ndrops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding\nagain.  As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER\ncoming from around the house.\n\nHe races over to peer around the corner.  He sees the two cars\nout front.  He sees the last of the goon squad barging in\nthrough the front door.\n\nHis face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window.\nIn the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI\nsurrounded by gun-toting intruders.  One of them grabs her and\ntwists her arm behind her back.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT\n\nVICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE.\n\nVICKI\nWhat did you do to him??\n\nSELINA gives her a catty little smile.\n\nSELINA\nFirst-time jitters, I guess.  Everything\nwas going great, and then...he just went\nlimp as a noodle.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY\n\nDrawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the\nentry hall, pulling a robe around him.  He freezes in his\ntracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front\nparlor, holding a gun to her head.\n\nPENGUIN\nYou'd be the butler.  Why don't you come\non down and attend to your guests?\n\nALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him.  He\nmarches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate\nform.\n\nALFRED\nMr. Wayne.  Is he -- ?\n\nPENGUIN\nYou know how it is.  Some guys just can't\nhold their egg nog.\n\nINT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER\n\nThe PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's\nalready assembled.  FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa\njust next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE\ninside.\n\nPENGUIN\nI should explain the occasion of our\nvisit.  There's a treasure underneath this\nhouse -- and I don't plan to leave until\nyou tell me how to find it.  Now who's\ngoing to talk -- Miss Vale?\n\nVICKI\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\nPENGUIN\nThe cave.  Under the house.  How do I get\nthere?\n\nThe PENGUIN gestures.  FRICK holds the gun to her head.\n\nVICKI (cont.)\nI don't know!  I swear, I would tell\nyou --\n\nPENGUIN\n(turning to ALFRED)\nThen maybe you'd like to tell me.\n\nALFRED\nYou're no more than a common thief.\n\nPENGUIN\nWrong, you old idiot.  I happen to be a\nvery uncommon thief.\n(beat)\nAre you going to tell me, or does Miss\nVale get an early present this year?\n\nFRICK cocks the gun.  VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans\nthe room, weighing his options.  Trembling, he shuts his\neyes --\n\nALFRED\nI...don't...know...\n\nPENGUIN\nThen go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the\ntree.\n\nFRICK's finger tightens on the trigger.  VICKI winces.  ALFRED\nstarts to blurt something out.  But a split-second before he\ncan speak --\n\nSELINA\nWait!\n(crossing over to VICKI)\nWe don't know how to get down there yet.\nWe may need her when Bruce wakes up.\n\nThe PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off.  ALFRED and VICKI heave\nsimultaneous sighs of relief.  He throws her a shamefaced look\n-- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made\nthe right play.\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nBesides -- I want this one for myself.  So\npretty...I'm going to give her a brand new\nface for Christmas.\n\nThe PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on\nthe floor.  He turns to FRICK and FRACK.\n\nPENGUIN\nWhy don't you two tie up our host?\n\nALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the\npremises.  FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back\nparlor which opens off the room they're in.\n\nINT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT\n\nThey dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone\ncords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands\nand feet.\n\nINT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE\n\nStill holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about\nthe room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive\nobjects.\n\nPENGUIN\nIt's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it?\nJust the sort of setting in which I've\nalways imagined myself.\n\nALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of\ndisgust.\n\nPENGUIN (cont.)\nI see.  You think I'm vulgar.  You think\nI'm...nouveau.\n\nALFRED\nI think you're a dirty little man with\na --\n\nThe PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a\ntabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES\ncrashing to the floor.  He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK\nreappear.\n\nPENGUIN\nSee, boys, that's old money talking.\nAfter a while, they actually start to\nbelieve they've earned all this.\n(smirking)\nI don't mind.  Someday I'll be old money\ntoo -- when the statute of limitations\nruns out.\n\nSELINA (O.S.)\nHey!  -- Guess what I just found.\n\nFace full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see\nSELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of...\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nChristmas cookies!\n\nThe PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from\ncramming a handful of cookies down his gullet.  SELINA\ngraciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with\nlimited enthusiasm.\n\nPENGUIN\nLet's spread out and see what we can find.\n(to FRICK and FRACK)\nYou two -- keep an eye on our friends\nhere.  Give me a yell the minute Wayne\ncomes to.\n\nFRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front\nparlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through\nthe house.  CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE --\n\n-- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands\nSTRUGGLING against his bonds.\n\nSERIES OF SHOTS\n\nQUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as\nthey search for the entrance to the cave.  SELINA and the\nPENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for\nsecret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE\nAPART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out\nof frames, etc.\n\nMeanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the\ngrounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the\nparlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on\nALFRED and VICKI.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a\nLOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels.  Suddenly, an\nELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and\nfumbles for the lock --\n\nINT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT\n\nFRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring\nfrom the kitchen.  VICKI looks at ALFRED...\n\nFRICK\nBetter check it out.\n\nFRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and\ndown a long hall to the kitchen.  He tosses a glance back at\nVICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself.\n\nFRICK (cont.)\nWhat is it?  What's going on??\n\nVICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor.  DICK GRAYSON has\nsneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at\nBRUCE's bonds with a letter opener.  Both of them stiffen\nsimultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a\nclear view of DICK and BRUCE.\n\nINT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT\n\nFRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the\nSECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates.  A RED LIGHT is\nblinking, indicating DICK's break-in.  FRACK throws switches\nfrantically, trying to kill the sound.  Finally he succeeds --\nand SHOUTS:\n\nFRACK\nSome kind of security system --\n\nINT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT\n\nDICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects\nof the drug, isn't much use.  He tries to get off the sofa and\ncrumples in a heap.\n\nDICK\nCan you move, man?\n\nBRUCE\nLibrary -- got to get me to the library --\n\nDICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door\nopening onto the hallway.  They're just about to step outside\nwhen FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen.\n\nINT. FRONT PARLOR - ON VICKI AND ALFRED\n\n-- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch\nthe situation develop.\n\nINT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT\n\nFRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the\nmoment.  By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway:\n\nPENGUIN\nWhat is that ungodly racket?\n\nFRACK\nA security alarm.  It went off in the\nkitchen.\n\nPENGUIN\nMy God!  Is someone in here?\n\nHe struts over to huddle with his cronies.  BRUCE and DICK are\nstill poised in the doorway.  It looks bad...\n\nINT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT\n\nALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK\nbickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway.  He pats VICKI's\nknee -- gestures for her to keep her seat --\n\n-- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun.  A moment\nof confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time\nto dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and\nvanish --\n\n-- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for\nlong; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor.\nFRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point-\nblank range.\n\nVICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying.\n\nINT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe room's a mess, books all over the floor.  The groggy BRUCE\nprops himself up against his desk.  He manages to pull the\nbottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret\nswitch.  He's CRYING.\n\nBRUCE\nAlfred...\n\nDICK\nI'll go back.\n\nBRUCE\nI can't...get down there...without you.\n\nDICK turns.  To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is\nswinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE.\n\nINT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT\n\nWe will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a\nsuperficial wound to the arm.  VICKI is on her knees beside\nhim; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt.\n\nPENGUIN\nWhat an extraordinarily stupid thing to\ndo.\n\nVICKI\nSHUT UP.  Help me with him.\n\nThe PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give\nVICKI a hand without him.  They carry him into the parlor, lay\nhim out on the sofa.  VICKI reaches into her purse for a\nhandkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls\nFRACK aside.\n\nPENGUIN\nYou and I had better check the ground\nfloor and see what's going on.  Mr. Frick\n-- do you think you'll be able to manage\nthis pair?\n\nFRICK\nYes sir.\n\nPENGUIN\nOh, good.  That does relieve my mind --\n\nHe turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT\nCORDS on the love seat.  The blood drains out of his face.\n\nPENGUIN (cont.)\nWhere's Wayne???\n\nINT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT\n\nDICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around\nhim in pure, unalloyed amazement.  BRUCE is fumbling with a\npacket on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of\npills and swallows them dry.\n\nThen he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping\nswitches.  They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind\nBRUCE and looks on, dazzled.\n\nINSERT - MONITOR\n\nThe screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his\ntwo armed GOONS through a pair of French doors.\n\nPENGUIN\nCheck the grounds!  The shape he's in, he\ncan't have gotten far.\n\nBACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE\n\nHe turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and\nwaits.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming\ncautiously around the grounds.  They turn suddenly --\n\n-- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over\nevery ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor!\n\nINT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT\n\nThe PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside.\nHe listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels\nfrom outside.  It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in\nhere...\n\nINT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER\n\nDICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne\nManor.  BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down\nbelow.\n\nBRUCE\n-- as soon as he gets to the East wing.\nWait for my signal.  You know what to do.\n\nDICK nods yes and bolts off.\n\nINT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER\n\nVICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint.  With the\ncommotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy-\nfingered.\n\nSuddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- \"SANTA\nBRING MY BABY BACK TO ME.\"  FRICK turns and stares at it in\nconfusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls --\n\n-- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the\nloudspeakers.\n\nBRUCE (O.S.; filter)\nVICKI!  RUN!  NOW!\n\nShe's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall.\nFRICK turns and takes aim --\n\n-- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of\nnowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face!  The shot goes wild and\nthe two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it\nover...\n\nINT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT\n\nVICKI hits the floor of the entry hall.  HUGE OAKEN SLIDING\nDOORS are already slamming shut behind her.  The same thing is\nhappening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is\nsealing itself off!\n\nINT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT\n\nDICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on\nthe chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth.  Before\nFRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the\nback of the skull with a fireplace poker.\n\nHe bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to\nALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination\nfrom the sofa.\n\nDICK\nHere.  You might need it.\n\nALFRED\nThank you, Master Dick.  And...bravo.\n\nINT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT\n\nVICKI has made it to the wall phone.  She can't seem to get a\ndial tone --\n\nVOICE FROM BEHIND\nDo you really think we're that stupid?\n\nVICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is\nSELINA's.\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nI tawt I taw a puddy tat...!!\n\nWith that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out.  VICKI\nturns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before\nshe can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around\nher wrist, jerking the knife loose.  SELINA tugs on the other\nend, reeling her closer.\n\nSELINA\nYou know, I've got a great recipe for\nSliced Bitch --\n\nVICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and\nthrowing SELINA off-balance into the center island.  While\nthey're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to\nbring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of\nthe way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her\nclaws.  VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to\nblock the blow: CLANG.\n\nVICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA\nwith knives and appliances.  It buys her enough time to make\nfor the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her.  Another\ndownswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK\ninto SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in\nthe wood.\n\nVICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose.\n\nINT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER\n\nSELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI.\n\nSELINA\nI love a good old-fashioned catfight --\nbut this is pissing me off.\n\nVICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED\nCOCKTAIL CART before her.  It SLAMS full-force into SELINA,\nwho lands on her back on the great long dining table.  VICKI\nis in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up.\n\nINT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER\n\nVICKI races up the stairs.  She has a good lead, but SELINA\nmakes up the difference in a hurry.  She takes the stairway in\nthree giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks\ndown the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her\nand LOCKING IT.\n\nSELINA\nHERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty\nkitty...\n\nShe KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.\n\nINT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT\n\nSELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door\nbehind her.  VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading\nto a balcony, but it's too long a drop.  She stands there\nparalyzed as SELINA advances.\n\nSELINA\nSo this is where you earn your keep.\n\nShe GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves\nher roughly back onto the bed.  VICKI flails wildly as SELINA\nkneels atop her...\n\nSELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly\nsection of bra --\n\nSELINA\nMmm!  Frederick's of Gotham?\n\nShe plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT\nDOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's\nbelly.  Now VICKI just loses it.  She begins to SHRIEK\nuncontrollably.\n\nSELINA\nNot so loud, honey!  The neighbors'll get\nthe wrong idea.\n(laughing)\nSanta's coming.  Time for all good girls\nto go to sleep...\n\nShe raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's\nneck.  But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes\nwide-eyed and shuts up.  A BLACK SHADOW falls across the\nmoonlit bed.  SELINA tenses --\n\n-- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair --\n\nBATMAN\nMiss me, \"Angel\"?\n\nHe yanks her bodily off the bed.  Before she knows what's\nhappening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT.  She flies into\nthe door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges.\n\nINT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER\n\nBATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself\nup.\n\nSELINA\nOkay -- let's do it, huh?  You and me...\nall the way this time.\n\nShe HISSES and jumps him.  They grapple -- a quick flurry of\nfists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long\nstairway.\n\nShe gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner.\nBATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time...\n\nINT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER\n\nVICKI rushes out of the bedroom.  She looks down the hall and\nsees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN --\nslamming into the wall opposite.  He slumps to the carpet, out\ncold.\n\nA moment later DICK strolls out.  VICKI rushes to his side --\n\nVICKI\nCome on.  We'll be safe in the cave.\n\nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER\n\nBATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is\nslightly ajar.  He pushes it in cautiously...\n\n...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing\ndown mere inches from his face.  It's the PENGUIN wielding the\nax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him.\nBut then --\n\n-- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing\non his back -- and the two of them are going at it again.\nIt's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a\ngood workout in the next thirty seconds.\n\nBATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall\nbehind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into\nSELINA's ribs.  It's a crippling blow; she flies backward,\nknocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES,\nknocking over another -- and another --\n\n-- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over,\ndomino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the\ncowering PENGUIN.\n\nSELINA is badly hurt now.  She makes it out of a rear door to\nthe armory.  BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems\nto be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA.\n\nSEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around\nenough to dig himself out.\n\nINT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER\n\nAs the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the\nLIBRARY.  VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a\nbottom drawer.  A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open...\n\nINT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT\n\nAs she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to\nDICK:\n\nVICKI\nCome on.  Come with us.\n\nDICK\nNo.  I can still help...\n\nINT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER\n\nThe PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of\nthe library and heads off in the opposite direction.  There's\na flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid.\n\nWIPE TO:\n\nINT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER\n\nAt the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are\nVICKI and ALFRED.  They pivot suddenly at the sound of a\nVOICE:\n\nPENGUIN\nSuch primitive entertainment.\n\nHe's holding a gun on the two of them.  He stares about\ndelightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave.\nHis eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its\nlittle plateau.\n\nPENGUIN (cont.)\nSo Bruce equals Batman.  It seems I've\ndiscovered two treasures!\n(an evil smile)\nDon't move.  I'd be only too happy to\nshoot you both.\n\nHe pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave.\nHe spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of\nthe cavern.  It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow\nCATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below.\n\nPENGUIN\nThe Gotham City Treasury.  It's about to\nbe stolen twice.\n\nALFRED\nDon't be absurd. You'll never be able to\nget it out of here.\n\nPENGUIN\nOh, I'll manage somehow.  You two are my\nguarantee of that.\n(nudging VICKI with the gun)\nLet's have a look, shall we?  You go\nfirst.\n\nHe shoves her.  She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her\nhead.\n\nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT\n\nSELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter-\nspeed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes\ndown the hallway.  She's just passed the balcony overlooking\nthe entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path.\n\nHe's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs\nit in.  She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh.\n\nSELINA\nIt could've been so nice -- you and me --\nif only you weren't so screwed up.\n\nBATMAN\nIt's over.  I don't want to hurt you any\nmore.\n\nSELINA\nTell me something -- one thing.  If you\ndon't enjoy all this...why do you do it?\n\nHe just looks at her.  He doesn't have an especially good\nanswer.  She sighs.\n\nSELINA (cont.)\nI'll never understand men.\n\nShe SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat.\nAs he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the\nnarrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall\nfloor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the\nenormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling --\n\n-- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up\na GUN from his belt.  He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails\npast her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which\nsuspends the chandelier.\n\nThe chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it --\nand she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry\nhall.  On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand\nfragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies\nsprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving.\n\nBATMAN advances slowly down the stairs.  Her arms and legs jut\nout at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering\nYOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat.  He stands over her; she glares\nup at him.\n\nBATMAN\nNine lives.\n\nCATWOMAN\nI can't move.  I can't move.\n\nHer face is cut and bleeding.  She tries to lift an arm and\ncan't quite manage it.  He crouches down beside her, still\ncautious...\n\nCATWOMAN (cont.)\nDON'T LOOK AT ME!!\n(pleading)\nDo me, baby...do me now...that's what I\nwant.  Please?\n\nBATMAN looks up.  DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking\nthem, highly curious as to what he'll do.\n\nBATMAN\nNo.\n\nBATMAN slowly rises to his feet.  She lets out another\ngruesome WHINE.\n\nCATWOMAN\nCOME ON.  Don't stop now.  FINISH ME OFF.\n(almost weeping with pain)\nSon of a bitch.  You're all alike...\n\nHer STEEL CLAWS snick into place.  With an agonizing effort\nshe lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist.  She's trying to\nslit her own throat.\n\nHe reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and\nbreaks it open with his thumb.  He drops it amid the shattered\nglass around her face.  A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out,\nand her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into\nunconsciousness.\n\nBATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to\njoin him.\n\nDICK\nYou should've done it, man.  You should've\nkilled her.\n\nBATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing.\n\nBATMAN\nThere's a radio in the cave.  We'll send\nfor help.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER\n\nThe PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK\nFORMATION.  A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk,\nand he forces her to JUMP FOR IT.  Now he has to follow; the\nprospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he\nclears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope.\n\nThey're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK\nFORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the\ncatwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.\n\nPENGUIN\nAh, the illustrious Mr. Wayne.  Look at\nyou now.  Whatever would your friends say?\n(smiling)\nYou've been an exceptionally congenial\nhost -- but I must ask you to back off.\n\nThe PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they\nclimb the last few feet toward the grotto.  BATMAN swings his\ncape around, concealing his hands from view.  He takes a\ncautious step backward.\n\nCLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND\n\nHis free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open.\n\nANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI\n\nThey've pulled almost even with the rock formation.  A LARGE\nDANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks.\n\nPENGUIN\nNo sudden moves.  It's a long way down.\n\nGun at her head, he peers into the grotto...\n\nHIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO\n\nA VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all\nthese years.  GLINTING in the darkness.  Hanging upside-down,\nabove it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them --\ntheir tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN...\n\nHe dislodges a rock.  It tumbles into the grotto...\n\n...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the\nrocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE.\n\nANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI\n\nHe BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him.  He FIRES\nHIS GUN wildly.  The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they\ncome flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM.\nVICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them\nFALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life.\n\nBATMAN\nVICKI!\n\nAn instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG.  Clean\nhit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down\nacross the rocks.\n\nWith BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath\nand VAULTS toward the CATWALK.  She's a foot short; she grabs\nhold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to\npull herself up.  BATMAN races toward her --\n\n-- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky\noutcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN.  The BATS\nhave begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the\ncavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN.\n\nTHUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first\nshot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward.  As the second\nspins him around.  As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE\nRAILING.\n\nVICKI screams.  BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand.\nNow two of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks\n-- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip.\n\nThe ECHOES are cacophanous.  ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the\nvaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly\nprojectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor.  And then --\n\nBATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS\nIT.  It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet.  He stares\ndown at it, and two beats later --\n\n-- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE.  Within\nmoments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON\nTHE SIGNAL.  The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming.  A CHOKED\nWAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands\nthere, PARALYZED.\n\nHe's just been beaten at his own game.  He lets out a last\nawful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM --\n\n-- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream\ndwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether...\n\nBATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk.  He rushes\nover to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her\nprotectively.  Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant\nperches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet.  They embrace\non the edge of the abyss.\n\nOn the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED.  The\nbutler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted,\nclutching his wounded arm.  DICK slings an arm around him and\nhelps him to the stairway.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nSQUAD CARS everywhere.  FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs,\nflanked by COPS.  PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious\nSELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an\nambulance.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT\n\nThe place is an utter mess.  Amid the carnage we find BRUCE\nconferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK.  In b.g.,\na POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound.\n\nGORDON\n...and then Batman showed up?\n\nBRUCE\nHe saved all our lives, Jim.  I can't say\nfor sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind\nthe murders.\n\nGORDON\nGod -- I pray you're right.\n(beat)\nOne thing before we go, Bruce.  Who's the\nkid?\n\nBRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are\nrighting the fallen Christmas tree.\n\nBRUCE\nOh, that's Vicki's little cousin.  He's in\ntown for the holidays.\n\nGORDON\nWell, he picked a hell of a time to visit.\n(turning to go)\nMerry Christmas, Bruce.  Good luck\ncleaning this place up.\n\nGORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR.\nBRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front\nparlor.\n\nINT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT\n\nALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD.  VICKI ambles up to\nBRUCE:\n\nVICKI\nWhat are you going to do with all that\ngold?\n\nBRUCE\nI dunno.  Might be a good start on a place\nto live -- for some people who don't have\none.\n\nShe hugs him.  DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they\nblink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve.\n\nVICKI\nIt's Christmas.\n\nBRUCE\nYeah.  Maybe you should -- open your\npresent.\n\nShe runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly.\n\nVICKI\nOh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter.  None\nof it matters.  We're all safe.  We're\ntogether.\n\nBRUCE\n...You might as well.\n\nHe digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT\nBOX, which he hands to VICKI.  She unwraps it, opens it slowly\n-- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside.\n\nShe gazes up at him, speechless.  He gazes back.\n\nCAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the\ndevastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling\ninto BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them;\nALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace.\nAnd on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we\n\nFADE OUT.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------\nHosted by \"Almost A Movie\"\nhttp://www.maddogmovies.com/almost1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/896492",

stand\nWhen you're pouring water\nOn a drowning man, I like that\n\n[Verse 2]\nPut me on the right track\nAnd then you let me down\nYou stab me in the back, yes you do baby\nEvery time I turn around, alright\nCriticizing my love\nWon't you try, just try to understand\nYou're pouring water, I've got to tell you 'bout it\nOn a drowning man\n[Bridge]\nYou're pouring water on a drowning man\nYou treat me like the fool that I am\nYou bragged that I like everything you do\nYou put salt in my wound, it's sad but it's true\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou warm me with your kissin'\nThen you leave me in the cold\nHow can I know your wishes, will you tell me\nWhen I've never been told? Alright\nI'm cryin' mercy, baby\nJust try to understand\nYou're pouring water, I've got to tell you 'bout it\nI'm an old drowning man, yeah\n\n[Outro]\nYou're pouring water, ha ha\nYou see I'm a

Romance\n\nScreenplay by Quentin Tarantino\n\nWhen you are tired of relationships, try a romance.\n\nINT. BAR \u221a NIGHT\n\nA smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit.\n\nCLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older\nlady named LUCY. She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But,\nyou can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.\nCLARENCE\nIn \"Jailhouse Rock\" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is\nrockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck\nabout anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and\nleaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it big\nhe's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and\nhe's singing, \"Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care\". Now, they got\nhim dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this\nhorrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him\nwearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party,\nbig house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker. I'd\nwatch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm\nno fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most\nwomen. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had too cause my\nlife depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis.\n\nLucy takes a drag from her cigarette.\n\nLUCY\nI'd fuck Elvis.\n\nCLARENCE\nReally?\n\nLUCY\nWhen he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.\nCLARENCE\nI don't blame you.\n(they laugh)\nSo we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests,\nisn't it?\n\nLucy laughs.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, enough about the King, how 'bout you?\n\nLUCY\nHow 'bout me what?\n\nCLARENCE\nHow 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?\n\nLUCY\nWhat are we gonna see?\n\nCLARENCE\nA Donny Chiba triple feature. \"The Streetfighter\", \"Return of the\nStreetfighter\", and \"Sister Streetfighter\".\n\nLUCY\nWho's Sonny Chiba?\nCLARENCE\nHe is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.\n\nLUCY\n(not believing this)\nYou wanna take me to a kung fu movie?\n\nCLARENCE\n(holding up three fingers)\nThree kung fu movies.\n\nLucy takes a drag from her cigarette.\n\nLUCY\n(laughing)\nI don't think so, not my cup of tea.\n\nINT. DINGY HOTEL ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nThe sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots\nand violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained\nblack.\n\nOn the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of\ncocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the\nsuitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. \"Bewitched\" is\nplaying.\n\nAt the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and\nFLOYD DIXON sit around. Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic\nbags and a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't\nknow it listen to him.\n\nDREXL\nNigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.\n\nFLOYD\nNaw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.\n\nDREXL\nThat's bullshit.\n\nBIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl\nand Floyd. Walks through the door carrying hamburgers and french fries in\ntwo greasy brown-paper bags.\n\nFLOYD\nNaw man, that's some serious shit.\n\nDREXL\nNigger, you lie like a big dog.\n\nBIG D\nWhat the fuck are you talkin' about?\nDREXL\nFloyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.\nBIG D\nShit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.\nDREXL\nI heard that.\nFLOYD\nHold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?\nBIG D\nNigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every\nmotherfuckin' thang.\n\nDREXL\nPreach on, Big D.\n\nFLOYD\nLook here. If I ever did eat some pussy \u221a I would never eat any pussy \u221a but,\nif I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be\nashamed as a motherfucker.\n\nBIG D\nShit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass\nthings. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin'\nniggers' dicks.\n\nDREXL\nHeard that.\n\nDrexl and Big D bump fists.\n\nFLOYD\nYeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.\n(he takes a hit off of a joint)\nThere used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their\npussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with\nwhite boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit \u221a\n\nDREXL\n\u221a Because it's good!\n\nFLOYD\nThen, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because\nyou white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for\nevery nigger in the world everywhere.\n\nBIG D\nDrexl. On behalf of me and all the brothers who aren't here, I'd like to\nexpress our gratitude \u221a\n\nDrexl and Big D bust up.\n\nFLOYD\nGo on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got\npussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to\ndo a bunch of fucked-up shit.\n\nBIG D\nSo you do eat pussy!\n\nFLOYD\nNaw naw!\n\nBIG D\nYou don't like it, but you eat that shit.\n(to Drexl)\nHe eats it.\n\nDREXL\nDamn skippy. He like it, too.\n\nBIG D\n(mock English accent)\nMe thinketh he doth protest too much.\n\nFLOYD\nWell fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!\n\nDREXL\nWhy you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question.\nYou with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch \u221a you're with\nJayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say \"Bitch, suck my\ndick!\" and then Jayne Kennedy says, \"First things first, nigger, I ain't\nsuckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!\" Now, what\ndo you say?\n\nFLOYD\nI tell Jayne Kennedy, \"Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!\"\n\nBIG D\nNigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne\nCounty so fast \u221a\n\nDREXL\nNigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.\n\nFLOYD\nI'd say fuck it!\n\nDrexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd\nsitting all alone.\n\nBig D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching \"Bewitched\".\n\nFLOYD\n(yelling after them)\nAin't no man have to eat pussy!\n\nBIG D\n(not even looking)\nTake that shit somewhere else.\n\nDRXL\n(marching back)\nYou tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?\n\nFLOYD\nIf it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.\n\nDREXL\nWith that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy,\nkiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger,\nyou'd aim to please.\n\nBIG D\n(glued on TV)\nI'm hip.\n\nDREXL\nIn fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D,\ntoss me that shotgun.\n\nWithout turning away from \"Bewitched\" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to\nDrexl.\n\nDREXL\n(to Floyd)\nAll right, check this out.\n(referring to shotgun)\nNow, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you.\n\nThen, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away.\n\nBig D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.\n\nDrexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room.\n\nThe blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around.\n\nDrexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again.\n\nBig D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams into the wall and drops.\n\nDrexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves. As he gets to the front\ndoor he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out.\n\nEXT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR \u221a MORNING\n\nA big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a sunrise sky as a\nbackdrop. The song \"Little Bitty Tear\" is heard a capella.\n\nINT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR \u221a MORNING\n\nCLIFF WORLEY is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently\nto the sunrise. He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard. In\nbetween singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed in a\nsecurity guard uniform.\n\nEXT. TRAILER PARK \u221a MORNING\n\nCliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning. He pulls up to his trailer to see\nsomething that stops him short.\n\nCLIFF'S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD\n\nClarence and a nice-looking YOUNG WOMAN are watching for him in front\nof his trailer.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a CLIFF\n\nUpon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down Cliff's cheek.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLIFF'S POV\n\nClarence and the Young Woman walk over to the car. Clarence sticks his face\nthrough the driver's side window.\n\nCLARENCE\nGood Morning, Daddy. Long time no see.\n\nINT. TRAILER HOME \u221a MORNING\n\nAll three enter the trailer home.\n\nCLIFF\nExcuse the place, I haven't been entertaining company as of late. Sorry if\nI'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world I expected\nto see this morning.\n\nClarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room.\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, well, tha's OK, Daddy, I tend to have that effect on people. I'm dyin'\non thirst, you got anything to drink?\n\nHe moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator.\n\nCLIFF\nI think there's a Seven-Up in there.\n\nCLARENCE\n(rumaging around the fridge)\nAnything stronger?\n(pause)\nOh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?\n\nCLIFF\nI can, but I don't.\n\nCLARENCE\n(closing the fridge)\nThat's about all I ever eat.\n\nCliff looks at the Girl. She smiles sweetly at him.\n\nCLIFF\n(to Girl)\nI'm sorry... I'm his father.\n\nYOUNG GIRL\n(sticking her hand out)\nThat's OK, I'm his wife.\n(shaking his hand vigorously)\nAlabama Worley, pleased to meetcha.\n\nShe is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman. However, that's\nwhere the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere.\n\nClarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit\nmagnets in his hand. He throws his other arm around Alabama.\n\nCLARENCE\nOh yeah, we got married.\n(referring to the magnets)\nYou still have these.\n(to Alabama)\nThis isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one.\nI never shit it out, so I guess it's still there. Loverdoll, why don't you be a\nsport and go get us some beer. I want some beer.\n(to Cliff)\nDo you want some beer? Well, if you want some it's here.\n\nHe hands her some money and his car keys.\n\nCLARENCE\nGo to the liquor store \u221a\n(to Cliff)\nWhere is there a liquor store around here?\n\nCLIFF\nUh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Alabama)\nGet a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get\ncause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if\nnot, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look,\nsince you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a\nfoot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-\nDongs.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.\n(to Cliff)\nWhat do you think would taste good?\n\nCLIFF\nI'm really not very \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a\nwhile. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer,\ndefinitly, absolutely, without a doubt.\n(to Cliff)\nWhere's a good chicken place around here?\n\nCLIFF\nI really don't know.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou don't know the chicken places around where you live?\n(to Alabama)\nAsk the guy at the place where a chicken place is.\n\nHe gives her some more money.\n\nCLARENCE\nThis should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.\n\nALABAMA\nOkee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.\n\nShe opens the door and starts out. Clarence turns to his dad as the door shuts.\n\nCLARENCE\nIsn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is\nshe a four alarm fire, or what?\n\nCLIFF\nShe seems very nice.\n\nCLARENCE\nDaddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only\nword for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in\nlove with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's\nwritten all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we\ngotta talk \u221a\n\nCLIFF\nClarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how\nmuch like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and\nthrough. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a\nsudden at eight o'clock in the morning.

Several\nposters advertising \"The Return of T.J. Hooker\" hang on the wall.\n\nDick sits in a chair, holding his sheets in his hands.\n\nRAVENCROFT\nWell, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and\nMarty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for\nthe part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's\nhanging on the hood. And what you're trying to do is get him off.\n(she picks a up a copy of the script)\nWhenever you're ready.\n\nDICK\n(reading and miming driving)\nWhere'd you come from?\n\nRAVENCROFT\n(reading from the script lifelessly)\nI don't know.

He just stares, unable to come to grips with what\nClarence has told him.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel\nfree.\n\nCLIFF\nYou're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes.\nMaking jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a\njoke about this \u221a\n(raising his voice)\n\u221a I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!\n\nCliff pauses and collects himself.\n\nCLIFF\nWhat do you want from me?\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nCLIFF\nStop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in\nsome way. What do you need from me? You need money?\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you still have friends on the force?\n\nCLIFF\nYes, I still have friends on the force.\n\nCLARENCE\nCould you find out if they know anythin'?

I've tried to\nmake your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced\nyou, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a\nyear at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always \"OK\",\n\"No problem\", \"You're a busy guy, I understand\". The whole time you\nwere a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No!\nEverybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad\nparent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm\nbasically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask.\nAnd if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone.

TRAILER HOME \u221a BEDROOM \u221a DAY\n\nCliff's on the telephone in his bedroom, pacing as he talks. The living room od\nthe trailer can be seen from his doorway, where Clarence and Alabama are\nhorsing around. They giggle and cut up throughout the scene. As Cliff talks, all\nthe noise and hubbub of a police station comes through over the line. He's\ntalking to DETECTIVE WILSON, an old friend of his from the force.\n\nWe see both inside the conversation.\n\nCLIFF\nIt's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.\n\nWILSON\nWhat about him?\n\nCLIFF\nWell, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it\nmight be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible\nfor that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.\n\nWILSON\nAre you still working security for Foster & Langley?\n\nCLIFF\nYeah, and the restaurant's on my route.

Now, while\nI have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?\n\nWILSON\nMcTeague.\n\nCLIFF\nI don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?\n\nWILSON\nI don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?\n\nCLIFF\nYou and Robin moved?\n\nWILSON\nShit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got\nmyself a new place \u221a mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the\nbed.

TRAILER HOME \u221a DAY\n\nClarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang. Alabama's amusing\nherself by doing cartwheels and handstands in the background.\n\nCLIFF\nThey have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo tell. Why drug related?\n\nCLIFF\nApparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo shit?\n\nCLIFF\nYeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name\nmean anything to you?\n\nCLARENCE\nNope.\n\nCLIFF\nIf you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.\n\nCLARENCE\nWho is he?\n\nCLIFF\nGangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look,\nClarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did\nthe right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops\naren't looking for me?\n\nCLIFF\nNaw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou\nhad a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nClarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it.\n\nCLARENCE\nThanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.\n\nCLIFF\nI got some money I can give you \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nKeep it.\n\nCLIFF\nWell, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and\nAlabama.

Remeber, you got a wife to think about.\nQuit fuckin' around.\n(pause)\nI love you son.\n\nThey hug each other,\n\nClarence takes a pice of paper out and puts it into Cliff's hand.\n\nCLARENCE\nThis is Dick's number in Hollywood. We don't know where we'll be, but\nyou can get a hold of me through him.\n\nClarence turns toward Alabama and yells to her.\n\nCLARENCE\nBama, we're outta here. Kiss Pops goodbye,\n\nAlabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff\nand gives him a big smackeroo on the lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's\nbubbling like a Fresca.\n\nALABAMA\nBye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.\n\nCLARENCE\n(mock anger)\nWhat kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?\n\nALABAMA\nOh, hush up.\n\nThe two get into the Mustang.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Cliff)\nWe'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood.\n\nClarence starts the engine.

Keep him out of trouble.\n\nALABAMA\nDon't worry, Daddy, I'm keepin' this fella on a short leash.\n\nClarence, slowly, starts driving away.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Cliff)\nAs the sun sets slowly in the west we bid a fond farewell to all the friends\nwe've made... and, with a touch of melancholy, we look forward to the time\nwhen we will all be together again.\n\nClarence peels out, shooting a shower of gravel up in the air.\n\nAs the Mustang disappears Cliff runs his tongue over his lips.\n\nCLIFF\nThe-son-of-a-bitch was right... she does taste like a peach.\n\nINT. DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a DAY\n\nDick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor. Things are pretty neat\nand clean. A nice stereo unit sits on the shelf.

When?\n\nCLARENCE\nTomorrow.\n\nDICK\nWhat's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?\n\nClarence sits down on the hotel room bed. Alabama, wearing only a long T-\nshirt with a big picture of Bullwinkle on it, crawls behind him.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way,\nI won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.\n\nDICK\nGet the fuck outta here!\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm married man.\n\nDICK\nGet the fuck outta here!\n\nCLARENCE\nBelieve it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm\nnot quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it.\nWanna say hi to my better half?\n\nBefore Dick can respond Clarence puts Alabama on the phone.\n\nALABAMA\nHi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.\n\nDICK\nHello, Alabama.\n\nALABAMA\nI can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were\nhis best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.\n\nClarence start dictating to her what to say.\n\nCLARENCE\nTell him we gotta go.\n\nALABAMA\nClarence says we gotta be hittin' it.\n\nDICK\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nTell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.\n\nALABAMA\nHe said don't go nowhere.

DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a DAY\n\nDick hears the click on the other end.\n\nDICK\nHello, hello, Clarence? Clarence's wife?... I mean Alabama... hello?\n\nExtremely confused, Dick jangs up the phone. He goes over to the TV and picks\nup the day's mail. He goes through it.\n\nBILL: Southern California Gas Company.\n\nBILL: Group W.\n\nBILL: Fossenkemp Photography.\n\nBILL: Columbia Record and Tape Club.\n\nLETTER: It's obviously from Clarence. Addressed to Dick. Dick opens it.\n\nEXT. TRAILER \u221a DAY\n\nA lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in\nfront of it in the shape of a planet.\n\nA big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly\nless kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a\nfast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.\n\nINT. TRAILER \u221a DAY\n\nHe steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to\nhis temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder.\n\nGUN CARRIER (DARIO)\nWelcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party.\n\nCliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men,\nstanding: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy),\nand TOOTH-PICK VIC (a fireplug pitbull type).\n\nSitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid\nmob leader Blue Lou Boyle.\n\nCliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario\nand Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair.\n\nCOCCOTTI\n(to Frankie)\nTell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what.\n\nIn Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits.\n\nCliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff.\nFrankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his\nhand, but he has yet to touch a drop.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nDo you know who I am, Mr. Worley?\n\nCLIFF\nI give up. Who are you?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell\nthe angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly\npersonified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is\nVincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man\nyour son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard\nof us before. Am I correct?\n\nCLIFF\nI've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question\nyou've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and,\nat the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.\n(taking out a pack of Chesterfields)\nWant a Chesterfield?\n\nCLIFF\nNo.\n\nCOCCOTTI\n(as he lights up)\nI have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful\nthis must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his\nbrought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road\nwith 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a\nchoice.\n\nCLIFF\nLook, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence \u221a\n\nBefore Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with\nhis fist.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nSmarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got that\npain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It ain't any\nkind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's ever gonna\nget, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your neighbors.\nThey saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in\nfront of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your son?\n\nCliff's defeated.\n\nCLIFF\nI've seen him.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nNow I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance\nyou're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore\nyour boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't\njust mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity.\nWell, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do\nsome business, cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room\nblastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.\n\nCLIFF\nWhat are you talkin' about?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it\noutta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is,\nleft his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the\ncommode filled in all the blanks.\n\nCLIFF\nI don't believe you.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nThat's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that\nI believe you. Where did they go?\n\nCLIFF\nOn their honeymoon.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they\ngo?\n\nCLIFF\nThey didn't tell me.\n\nCoccotti looks at him.\n\nCLIFF\nNow, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years.\nYesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me\nhe needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could\nborrow five hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a\ncheck. We went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me\nGod. They never thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never\nthought to ask.\n\nCoccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil,\nquick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then\nwhips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal\non the wound. Cliff screams.\n\nCoccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.\n\nTooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in\nthe car.\n\nVirgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm\nin agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nSicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my old\nman was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from\ngrowin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen\ndifferent things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has\nseventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen.\nAnd if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to\nhell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna\nshow me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know\nwhere they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away\nfrom.\n\nThe awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart.\nHe looks deep into Coccotti's eyes.\n\nCLIFF\nCould I have one of those Chesterfields now?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nSure.\n\nCoccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.\n\nCLIFF\nGot a match?\n\nCliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.\n\nCLIFF\nOh, don't bother. I got one.\n(he lights the cigarette)\nSo you're a Sicilian, huh?\n\nCOCCOTTI\n(intensly)\nUh-huh.\n\nCLIFF\nYou know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find\nthat shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians\nwere spawned by niggers.\n\nAll the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic\nVic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what\nhe's hearing.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nCome again?\n\nCLIFF\nIt's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you\ndon't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago\nthe Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then,\nSicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But,\nonce the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did\nso much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for\never, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it\nabsolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later,\nSicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's\nwritten. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-\ngrandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a\nfact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?\n\nCoccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic,\ngrabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets\nthrough Cliff's head.\n\nHe pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his\nfeelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon,\nand turns to his men.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity\nin fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands! Go to this\ncomedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me\nwhere that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this\nfucked-up family for good.\n\nTooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was\nall about.\n\nLenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer.\nWhen he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic\nbanana magnet that says: \"Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and\naddress)\".\n\nLENNY\nBoss, get ready to get happy.\n\nTITLE CARD: \"CLARENCE AND ALABAMA HIT L.A.\"\n\nINT. DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a MORNING\n\nDick's asleep in a recliner. He's wearing his clothes from the night before. His\nroom-mate FLOYD is lying on the sofa watching TV.\n\nThe sound of our hands knocking on his door wakes Dick up. He shakes the\nbats out of his belfry, opens the door, and finds the cutest couple in Los Angeles\nstanding in his doorway.\n\nClarence and Alabama immediately start singing \"Hello My Baby\" like the frog\nin the old Chuck Jones cartoon.\n\nCLARENCE/ALABAMA\nHello my baby,\nHello my honey,\nHello my ragtime gal \u221a\n\nDICK\nHi guys.\n\nAlabama throws her arms around Dick, and gives him a quick kiss. After she\nbreaks, Clarence does the same. Clarence and Alabama walk right past Dick\nand into his apartment.\n\nCLARENCE\nWow. Neat place.\n\nINT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND \u221a DAY\n\nThe Pink's employees work like skilled Benihana chefs as they assemble the\nultimate masterpiece hot-dog.\n\nEXT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND \u221a PATIO \u221a DAY\n\nClarence, Alabama, and Dick are sitting at an outdoor table chowing down on\nchili dogs. Alabama is in the middle of a story.\n\nALABAMA\n... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid\nbefore, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished,\ncrowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and\nmy dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow\nzonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus\nappears, and the bus-driver says, \"Get her in here.\". He forgot all about his\nroute and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice\nguy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well,\nhis name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da\nbeen a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was\nfrom. And, so there you go.\n\nCLARENCE\nAnd here we are.\n\nDICK\nThat's a pretty amazing story.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?\n\nDICK\nJust like in Detroit, only skinnier.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou goin' out?\n\nDICK\nWell, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my\nacting class.\n\nCLARENCE\nGood for you.\n\nDICK\nWhat's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head\nbunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional\ninstability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a\nreally good reading for \"T.J. Hooker\" the other day.\n\nALABAMA\nYou're gonna be on \"T.J. Hooker\"?\n\nDICK\nKnock wood.\n\nHe knocks the table and then looks at it.\n\nDICK\n... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.\n\nCLARENCE\nDid you meet Captain Kirk?\n\nDICK\nYou don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.\n\nALABAMA\n(finishing her hot-dog)\nThat was so good I am gonna have another.\n\nDICK\nYou can't have just one.\n\nAlabama leaves to get another hot-dog. Clarence never takes his eyes off her.\n\nDICK\nHow much of that letter was on the up and up?\n\nCLARENCE\nEvery word of it.\n\nDick sees where Clarence's attention is.\n\nDICK\nYou're really in love, aren't you?\n\nCLARENCE\nFor the very first time in my life.\n(pause)\nDo you know what that's like?\n\nClarence is so intense Dick doesn't know how to answer.\n\nDICK\n(regretfully)\nNo, I don't\n(he looks at Alabama)\nHow did you two meet?\n\nClarence leans back thoughtfully and takes a sip from his Hebrew cream soda.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you remember The Lyric?\n\nINT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nSonny Chiba, as \"Streetfighter\" Terry Surki, drives into a group of guys, fists\nand feet flying and whips ass on the silver screen.\n\nClarence sits, legs over the back of the chair in front of him, nibbling on\npopcorn, eyes big as sourcers, and a big smile on his face.\n\nEXT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nA cab pulls up to the outside of The Lyric. The marquee carries the names of the\ntriple feature: \"The Streetfighter\", \"Return of the Streetfighter\" and \"Sister\nStreetfighter\". Alabama steps out of the taxi cab and walks up to the box office.\n\nA BOX OFFICE GIRL reading comic looks at her.\n\nALABAMA\nOne please.\n\nBOX OFFICE GIRL\nNinety-nine cents.\n\nALABAMA\nWhich one is on now?\n\nBOX OFFICE GIRL\n\"Return of the Streetfighter\". It's been on about forty-five minutes.\n\nINT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a LOBBY \u221a NIGHT\n\nAlabama walks into the lobby and goes over to the concession stand. A\nYOUNG USHER takes care of her.\n\nALABAMA\nCan I have a medium popcorn? A super-large Mr. Pibb, and a box of\nGoobers.\n\nINT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nIt's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny Chiba taking on all-\ncomers.\n\nAlabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food. She makes a quick\nscan of the theater. Not many people are there. She makes a beeline for the\nfront whick happens to be Clarence's area of choice. She picks the row of seats\njust behind Clarence and starts asking her way down it.\n\nClarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone moving towards him. He\nturns his attention back to the screen, trying not to be so obvious.\n\nWhen Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks a discarded wine\nbottle, causing her to trip and spill her popcorn over Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\nOh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm the clumsiest person in the world.\n\nCLARENCE\n(picking popcorn out of his hair)\nIt's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.\n\nALABAMA\n(picking popcorn out of his hair)\nWhat a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You\ncould have been a real dick.\n\nAlabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie.\n\nClarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't easy, and get back into\nthe movie.\n\nThey both watch the screen for a moment. Then, Alabama leans forward and\ntaps Clarence on the shoulder.\n\nALABAMA\nExcuse me... I hate to bother you again. Would you mind too terribly filling\nme in on what I missed?\n\nJumping on this opportunity.\n\nCLARENCE\nNot at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.\n\nALABAMA\nThe oriental.\n\nCLARENCE\nThe oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired\nto kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into\nthe police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while\nkeepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a\nnumber on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the\nwindow. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.\n\nALABAMA\nWant some Goobers?\n\nCLARENCE\nThanks a lot.\n\nALABAMA\nI thought Sonny was the good guy.\n\nCLARENCE\nHe ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be\nbullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.\n\nThey both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks asses.\n\nTIME CUT:\n\nOn the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up. Dead bodies lie all around him.\nTHE END (in Japanese) flashes on the screen.\n\nThe theater light go up. Alabama's now sitting in the next seat to Clarence.\nThey're both applauding.\n\nALABAMA\nGreat movie. Action-packed!\n\nCLARENCE\nDoes Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?\n\nALABAMA\nSonny kicks ass.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the \"Streetfighter\". It\nwas the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the\nR.\n\nALABAMA\nIf that was the R, I'd love to see the X.\n\nCLARENCE\nMy name is Clarence, and what is yours?\n\nALABAMA\nAlabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs that your real name? Really?\n\nALABAMA\nThat's my real name, really. I got proof. See.\n\nShe shows Clarence her driver's license.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, cut my legs off and call me Shorty. That's a pretty original moniker\nthere, Alabama. Sounds like a Pam Grier movie.\n(announcer voice)\nShe's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She\ncarried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist,\nand the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!\nPray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!\n\nEXT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence and Alabama are outside the theater. With the marquee lit up in the\nbackground they both perform unskilled martial arts moves. Clarence and\nAlabama break up laughing.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhere's your car? I'll walk you to it.\n\nALABAMA\nI took a cab.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou took a cab to see three kung fu movies?\n\nALABAMA\nSure. Why not?\n\nCLARENCE\nNothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat time is it?\n\nCLARENCE\n'Bout twelve.\n\nALABAMA\nI suppose you gotta get up early, huh?\n\nCLARENCE\nNo. Not particularly.\n(pause)\nHow come?\n\nALABAMA\nWell, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get\nsome pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after\nyou've seen a good movie?\n\nCLARENCE\nI love to get pie after a movie.\n\nALABAMA\nWould you like to get some pie?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'd love some pie.\n\nINT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all-night Denny's. It's about\n12:40 a.m. Clarence is having a piece of chocolate cream pie and a coke.\nAlabama's nibbling on a peace of heated apple pie and sipping on a large Tab.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, enough about the King. How about you?\n\nALABAMA\nHow 'bout me what?\n\nCLARENCE\nTell me about yourself.\n\nALABAMA\nThere's nothing to tell.\n\nCLARENCE\nC'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?\n\nALABAMA\nWhat do you want to know?\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your\nfavorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you\nlike? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's\nthe story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?\nAnd, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?\n\nAlabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\nAsk me them again. One by one.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat do you do?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't remember.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhere are you from.\n\nALABAMA\nMight be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's your favorite color?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's your favorite movie star?\n\nALABAMA\nBurt Reynolds.\n\nCLARENCE\nWould you like a bite of my pie?\n\nALABAMA\nYes, I would.\n\nClarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike it?\n\nALABAMA\nVery much. Now, where were we?\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat kinda music do you like?\n\nALABAMA\nPhil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like \"He's a Rebel\".\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat are your turn-ons?\n\nALABAMA\nMickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like\nElvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.\n\nCLARENCE\nTurn-offs?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only\nthing that comes to mind are Persians.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you have a fella?\n\nShe looks at Clarence and smiles.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of\ntown alone?\n\nALABAMA\nApparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a\nform of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or\nwhere I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even\nknow my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a\nTallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they\ntold me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on\nme, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For\nsome reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told\nhim to stop and I got out.\n\nCLARENCE\nAnd in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?\n\nALABAMA\nBecause you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure\ncouldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.\n\nClarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until\nit makes that slurping sound. He puts it aside and stares into her soul.\n\nA smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin.\n\nALABAMA\nAren't you just dazzled by my imagination, lover boy?\n(eats her last piece of pie)\nWhere to next?\n\nINT. COMIC BOOK STORE \u221a NIGHT\n\nIt's about 1:30 a.m. Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works. It's a\ncomic book store called Heroes For Sale. Alabama thinks this place is super-\ncool.\n\nALABAMA\nWow. What a swell place to work.\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books,\nplay music.\n\nALABAMA\nHow long have you worked here?\n\nCLARENCE\nAlmost four years.\n\nALABAMA\nThat's a long time.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what\nI'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most\nof the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.\n\nALABAMA\nDo you get paid a lot?\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow\nsome money if you need it. Wanna see what \"Spiderman\" number one\nlooks like?\n\nALABAMA\nYou bet. How much is that worth?\n\nClarence gets a box off the shelf.\n\nCLARENCE\nFour hundred bucks.\n\nALABAMA\nI didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. \"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" Lunch\nboxes. \"Green Hornet\" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are\nmain business. There's a lot of collectors around here.\n\nShe holds up a little GI Joe sized action figure of a black policeman.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat's that?\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's a \"Rookies\" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls.\nThey're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors\nin \"The Black Hole\"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid\nplayin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.\n\nHe pulls a plastic-cased \"Spiderman\" comic form the box.\n\nCLARENCE\n\"Spiderman\", number one. The one that started it all.\n\nClarence shows the comic book to Alabama.\n\nALABAMA\nGod, Spiderman looks different.\n\nCLARENCE\nHe was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr.\nGene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just\ndisguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold\non, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.\n\nHe pulls out another comic.\n\nCLARENCE\n\"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos\". One of the coolest series known\nto man. They're completely worthless. You can get number one for about\nfour bucks. But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap.\n(he opens one up)\nJust look at that artwork, will ya. Great stories. Great Characters. Look at\nthis one.\n\nWe see the \"Sgt. Fury\" panels.\n\nCLARENCE\nNick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on\na chain. OK, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on a\nship. He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain\nand the ring goes overboard too. So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it. Isn't\nthat cool?\n\nShe's looking into Clarence's eyes. He turns and meets her gaze.\n\nCLARENCE\nAlabama, I'd like you to have this.\n\nClarence hands her the \"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos\" comic book\nthat he loves so much.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BEDROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie posters, pictures of Elvis,\nanything you can imagine. The two walk through the door.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat a cool room!\n\nShe runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed.\n\nLater. Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album.\nClarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders.\n\nALABAMA\nOooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you\nthen?\n\nCLARENCE\nFive.\n\nShe turns the page.\n\nALABAMA\nOh, you look so cute as little Elvis.\n\nCLARENCE\nI finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.\n\nLATER \u221a LIVING ROOM\n\nClarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's\n\"Piece of My Heart\".\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know when you sat behind me?\n\nALABAMA\nAt the movies?\n\nCLARENCE\nUh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she\ndoesn't want me bothering her.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat would make you think that?\n\nCLARENCE\nI dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.\n\nALABAMA\nYou're not stupid. Just wrong.\n\nThey move to the music. Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the\nsong.\n\nALABAMA\nI love Janis.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.\n\nALABAMA\nShe OD'd, didn't she?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too\nmuch. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what\nshe took.\n\nALABAMA\nYou mean she got a bad batch?\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the\nhappiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't\ntrust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her\nto marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she\ncouldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money.\nSo, she said no. And the guy says, \"Look, I really love you, and I wanna\nprove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what\nhappens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it.\" So she did,\nand he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her\na secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.\n\nALABAMA\nSo he really loved her?\n\nCLARENCE\nUh-huh.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BEDROOM \u221a DAY\n\nIt's the next day, around 1 p.m. Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone. He looks\naround, and no Alabama. Then he hears crying in the distance. He puts on a\nrobe and investigates.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a LIVING ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts. She's curled up in a chair\ncrying. Clarence approaches her. She tries to compose herself.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?\n\nALABAMA\nYou didn't do nothing.\n\nCLARENCE\nDid you hurt yourself?\n(he takes her foot)\nWhatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?\n\nALABAMA\nClarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the\ntheater. I was paid to be there.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls.\nMake sure they're not rippin' the place off.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.\n\nPause.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou're a whore?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.\n(pause)\nI don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that\ncomic book place.\n\nCLARENCE\n\"Heroes For Sale\"?\n\nALABAMA\nYeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.\n\nCLARENCE\nWho?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into\nyou, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was\ngonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I\nwas leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich\nmillionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat dazzling imagination.\n\nALABAMA\nIt's over on the TV. All it says is: \"Dear Clarence.\" I couldn't write\nanymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to\never see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that\nmuch fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, \"Alabama, come clean, Let him\nknow what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to\nDrexl and fuck yourself.\"\n\nCLARENCE\nWho and what is a Drexl?\n\nALABAMA\nMy pimp.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou have a pimp?\n\nALABAMA\nUh-huh.\n\nCLARENCE\nA real live pimp?\n\nALABAMA\nUh-huh.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs he black?\n\nALABAMA\nHe thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs he nice?\n\nALABAMA\nWell, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty\ndecent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with\nArlene the other day.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat did he do to Arlene?\n\nALABAMA\nSlapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.\n\nCLARENCE\nThis motherfucker sounds charming!\n\nClarence is on his feet, furious.\n\nCLARENCE\nGoddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much\nlonger before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How\nthe fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first\nplace?\n\nALABAMA\nAt the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an\nagency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They\nhave a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-\ncollar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five\nhundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry\nbeepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in \"Dressed to Kill\". And when I was\nready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says\nhe makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's\ngonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or\nwind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the\nropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last\nnight. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it\nwas a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a\nsecond date.\n\nCLARENCE\nThank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again.\nBama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went\ntogether all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it,\nyou wanna marry me?\n\nALABAMA\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nWill you be my wife?\n\nWhen Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks.\n\nALABAMA\nYes.\n\nCLARENCE\n(a little surprised)\nYou will?\n\nALABAMA\nYou better not be fucking teasing me.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou better not be fuckin' teasin' me.\n\nThey seal it with a kiss.\n\nLATER \u221a THAT NIGHT\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Alabama's wedding ring.\n\nThe newlyweds are snuggling up together onthe couch watching TV. The movie\nthey're watching is \"The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs. the Master of the\nFlying Guillotine\". Alabama watches the screen, but every so often she looks\ndown to admre the ring on her hand.\n\nCLARENCE\nDid ya ever see \"The Chinese Professionals\"?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't believe so.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the\nIncredible One-Armed Boxer.\n\nWe hear, off screen, the TV Announcer say:\n\nTV ANNOUNCER\n(off)\nWe'll return to Jimmy Wang Yu in... \"The Incredible One-Armed Boxer\nvs. the Master of the Flying Guillotine\", tonight's eight o'clock movie, after\nthese important messages...\n\nClarence looks at the TV. He feels the warmth of Alabama's hand holding his.\nWe see commercials playing.\n\nHe turns in her direction. She's absent-mindedly looking at her wedding ring.\n\nHe smiles and turns back to the TV.\n\nMore commercials.\n\nDolly close on Clarence's face\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nAlabama, right after he proposed.\n\nALABAMA\nYou better not be fucking teasing me.\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nIn a cute, all-night wedding chapel.

Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you\nseen your lovely wife today?\n\nCLARENCE\nOh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.\n\nALABAMA\nOf course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?\n\nMoving on top of her.\n\nCLARENCE\nNot for me.\n\nHe starts kissing her and moving her down on the seat. She resists.\n\nALABAMA\n(playfully)\nNo no no no no no no no no...\n\nCLARENCE\n(playfully)\nYes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nA big mean-looking BLACK MAN in pimp's clothes.\n\nPIMP\nBitch, you better git yo ass back on the street an' git me my money.\n\nPimp on street corner with his arm around Alabama, giving her a sales pitch to\na potential customer.\n\nPIMP\nI'm tellin' you, my man, this bitch is fine.

There's definitely something different about his eyes.\n\nClarence springs off the couch and goes into his bedroom. Alabama's startled\nby his sudden movement.\n\nALABAMA\n(yelling after him)\nWhere you goin', honey?\n\nCLARENCE\n(off)\nI just gotta get somethin'.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BATHROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence splashes water on his face, trying to wash away the images that keep\npolluting his mind. Then, he hears a familiar voice.\n\nFAMILIAR VOICE\n(off)\nWell? Can you live with it?\n\nClarence turns and sees that the voice belongs to Elvis Presley. Clarence isn't surprised to see him.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nELVIS\nCan you live with it?\n\nCLARENCE\nLive with what?\n\nELVIS\nWith that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you?\nAnd gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah.\n\nELVIS\nYou wanna get unhaunted?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah.\n\nELVIS\nThen shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.\n\nCLARENCE\nI can't believe what you're tellin' me.\n\nELVIS\nI ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou'd really do that?\n\nELVIS\nHe don't got no right to live.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to\nkill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.\n\nELVIS\nI don't blame you.\n\nCLARENCE\nIf I thought I could get away with it \u221a\n\nELVIS\nKillin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya\nthink the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find\nwho done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole\nwide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head.

CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BEDROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a A snub-nosed .38, which Clarence loads and sticks down his\nheavy athletic sock.\n\nINT. CALRENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a LIVING ROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence returns.\n\nCLARENCE\nSweetheart, write down your former address.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nWrite down Drexl's address.\n\nALABAMA\nWhy?\n\nCLARENCE\nSo I can go over there and pick up your things.\n\nALABAMA\n(really scared)\nNo, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.\n\nHe kneels down before her and holds her hand.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker.\nHe can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses\nabsolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it\nwould be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?\n\nALABAMA\nYou don't know him \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nYou don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I\nneed for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down\nthe address.\n\nTITLE CARD: \"CASS QUARTER, HEART OF DETROIT\"\n\nEXT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREET \u221a NIGHT\n\nIt's pretty late at night. Clarence steps out of his red Mustang. He's right smack\ndab in the middle of a bad place to be in daytime. He checks the pulse on his\nneck; it's beating like a race horse. To pump himself up he does a quick Elvis\nPresley gyration.\n\nCLARENCE\n(in Elvis voice)\nYeah... Yeah...\n\nHe makes a beeline for the front door of a large, dark apartment building.\n\nINT. DARK BUILDING \u221a NIGHT\n\nHe's inside. His heart's really racing now. He has the TV guide that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand. He climbs a flight of stairs and makes his way down a dark hallway to apartment 22, the residence of Drexl Spivey. Clarence knock on the door.\n\nA YOUNG BLACK MAN, about twenty years old, answers the door. He has\nreally big biceps and is wearing a black and white fishnet football jersey.\n\nYOUNG BLACK MAN\nYou want somethin'?\n\nCLARENCE\nDrexl?\n\nYOUNG BLACK MAN\nNaw, man, I'm Marty. Watcha want?\n\nCLARENCE\nI gotta talk to Drexl.\n\nMARTY\nWell, what the fuck you wanna tell him?\n\nCLARENCE\nIt's about Alabama.\n\nA figure jumps in the doorway wearing a yellow Farah Fawcett T-shirt. It's our\nfriend, Drexl Spivey.\n\nDREXL\nWhere the fuck is that bitch?\n\nCLARENCE\nShe's with me.\n\nDREXL\nWho the fuck are you?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm her husband.\n\nDREXL\nWell. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.\n\nINT. DREXL'S LIVING ROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nDrexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room, continuing a conversation\nthey were having and leaving Clarence standing in the doorway. This is not the\nconfrontation Clarence expected. He trails in behind Drexl and Marty.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nWhat was I sayin'?\n\nMARTY\nRock whores.\n\nDREXL\nYou ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They\ngot that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you.\nThey give you hips, lips, and fingertips.\n\nDrexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence.\n\nDREXL\n(to Clarence)\nYou know what I'm talkin' about.\n\nDrexl gestures to one of the THREE STONED HOOKERS lounging about the\napartment.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nThese bitches over here ain't shit. You stomp them bitches to death to get\nthe kind of pussy I'm talkin' about.\n\nDrexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-\nout boxes of Chinese food. A black exploitation movie is playing on TV.\n\nDREXL\nLooky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with\nCherry Seven-Up.\n\nMARTY\nPussy love pink rocks.\n\nThis is not how Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is exactly what he\nexpected Drexl to be like. He positions himself in front of the food table,\ndemanding Drexl's attention.\n\nDREXL\n(eating with chopsticks, to Clarence)\nGrab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We\ngot everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo thanks.\n\nDREXL\nNo thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down\nhere? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to\nbe eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've\nalready given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly\nwhere your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some\ndinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to\nmyself, \"This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the\nworld. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad\nmotherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my\nChinese, watch my TV.\" See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV\nthere, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out,\nand you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I\nknow I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.\n\nClarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm not eatin' cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' cause I'm not stayin'.\nI'm not lookin' at the movie cause I saw it seven years ago. It's \"The\nMack\" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by\nBobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama\nReleasing Company in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In\nthat envelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener\npastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter. I don't like to dicker.\nI never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's in that\nenvelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that much.\nNot one penny more, not one penny more.\n\nYou could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full\nalert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl.\nDrexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty.\n\nDREXL\nIt's empty.\n\nClarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, \"That's right, asshole.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nDREXL\nOooooooooh weeeeeeee! This child is terrible. Marty, you know what we\ngot here? Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson. Is that who you supposed to be?\nMr. Majestyk? Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary. I ain't\ngot no hold on Alabama. I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand \u221a\n\nBefore Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at\nClarence, catching him of guard.\n\nMarty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting\nhim in a tight choke hold.\n\nClarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus.\nWe'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl\ntakes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.\n\nAll of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold\nrecords, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs.\n\nMarty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence.\n\nSince Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face.\n\nClarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about\nit.\n\nDREXL\nYa wanna fuck with me?\n(hits Clarence)\nYa wanna fuck with me?\n(hits Clarence)\nI'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit!\n\nHe hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.\n\nClarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs\nhis nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and\nstarts twisting.\n\nMarty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip\naroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of\nhis head.\n\nDrexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's\nthumb.\n\nClarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and\nbusting his nose.\n\nMarty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets\nup on his knees.\n\nDrexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are\ngoing at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping\nthem coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other\nbecause of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight.\n\nMarty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of\nLPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to\nhis feet.\n\nDrexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls.\n\nMarty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up\ninto a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.\n\nDrexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.\n\nMarty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nYou OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?\n\nMARTY\nNaw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.\n\nDrexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting.\n\nDREXL\n(to Clarence)\nYou see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk\nin my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin'\nsmack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be\ncrazy.\n(to Marty)\nI don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.\n(laughing)\nHe must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?\n\nMARTY\n(laughing)\nNaw, man, it ain't white boy day.\n\nDREXL\n(to Clarence)\nShit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a\nnigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.\n\nCLARENCE\n(hurting)\nWannabee nigger...\n\nDREXl\nFuck you! My mother was Apache.\n\nDrexl kicks him again. Clarence curls up.\n\nDrexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket.\n\nClarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls still has him down.\n\nDrexl finds it and pulls it out. He flips it open to driver's license.\n\nDREXL\nWell, well, well, looky what we got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds almost\nlike a nigger name.\n(to Clarence)\nHey, dummy.\n\nHe puts his foot on Clarence's chest. Clarence's POV as he looks up.\n\nDREXL\nBefore you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit. I\njust chalked it up to au revoir Alabama. But, because you think you're\nsome macho motherfucker, I know who she's with. You. I know who you\nare, Clarence Worley. And, I know where you live, 4900 116th street,\napartment 48. And I'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same\naddress. Marty, take the car and go get 'er. Bring her dumb ass back here.\n\nHe hands Marty the driver's license. Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nI'll keep lover boy here entertained.\n(to Clarence)\nYou know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her\nsuck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's\ndone it before. But I want you as a audience.\n(hollering to Marty)\nMarty, what the fuck are you doin'?\n\nMARTY\n(off)\nI'm tryin' to find my jacket.\n\nDREXL\nLook in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there\nlately.\n\nWhile Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock\nand pulls out the .38. he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs. Drexl, who's\nstanding over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger\nand blow his balls to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.\n\nDrexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground.\n\nMARTY\n(off)\nWhat's happening?\n\nMarty steps into the room.\n\nClarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest.\n\nTwo of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming. The other\nHooker is curled up in the corner. She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to\nbe terrified.\n\nDrexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his\nballs and his dick.\n\nClarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker.\n\nCLARENCE\nGet a bag and put Alabama's thing in it!\n\nShe doesn't move.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou wanna get shot? I ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it!\n\nThe Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the\nbed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence.\n\nClarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like\na pillbug.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand.\n\nClarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Drexl)\nOpen you eyes, laughing boy.\n\nHe doesn't. Clarence gives him a kick.\n\nCLARENCE\nOpen you eyes!\n\nHe does. It's now Drexl's POV from the floor.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?\n\nHe fires.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a The bullet comes out of the gun and heads right toward us. When\nit reaches us, the screen goes awash in red.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a NIGHT\n\nThe front swings open and Clarence walks in. Alabama jumps off the couch and\nruns toward Clarence, before she reaches him he blurts out:\n\nCLARENCE\nI killed him.\n\nShe stops short.\n\nCLARENCE\nI've got some food in the car, I'll be right back.\n\nClarence leaves. Except for the TV playing, the room is quiet. Alabama sits on\nthe couch.\n\nClarence walks back into the room with a whole bounty of take-out food. He\nheaps it on to the coffee table and starts to chow down.\n\nCLARENCE\nHelp yourself. I got enough. I am fuckin' starvin'. I think I ordered one of\neverythin'.\n\nHe stops and looks at here.\n\nCLARENCE\nI am so hungry.\n\nHe starts eating french fries and hamburgers.\n\nALABAMA\n(in a daze)\nWas it him or you?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there\nI said to myself, \"If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it.\" I could.\nSo I did.\n\nALABAMA\nIs this a joke?\n\nCLARENCE\nNo joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious,\nI've never had a hamburger taste this good.\n\nAlabama starts to cry. Clarence continues eating, ignoring her.\n\nCLARENCE\nCome on, Bama, eat something. You'll feel better.\n\nShe continues crying. He continues eating and ignoring her. Finally he spins on\nher, yelling:\n\nCLARENCE\nWhy are you crying? He's not worth one of your tears. Would you rather it\nhad been me? Do you love him?\n(no answer)\nDo you love him?\n(no answer)\nDo you love him?\n\nShe looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a word out.\n\nALABAMA\nI think what you did was...\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nALABAMA\nI think what you did...\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nALABAMA\n... was so romantic.\n\nClarence is completely taken back. They meet in a long, passionate lovers' kiss.\nTheir kiss breaks and slowly the world comes back to normal.\n\nCLARENCE\nI gotta get outta these clothes.\n\nHe picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in front of them.\n\nALABAMA\n(comically)\nClean clothes. There is a god,\n\nClarence flips open the suitcase. Alabama's and her husband's jaws drop.\n\nALABAMA\nClarence. Those aren't my clothes.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a DAY\n\nWe see the Hollywood Holiday Inn sign. Pan to the parking lot where\nClarence's empty red Mustang is parked.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CALRENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Dick's jaw drops. His hand reaches out of shot.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a The reason for all the jaw dropping... the suitcase is full of\ncocaine!\n\nClarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine.\n\nAlabama's watching the cable TV.\n\nDICK\nHoly Mary, Mother of God.\n\nALABAMA\nThis is great, we got cable.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Alabama)\nBama, you got your blade?\n\nKeeping her eyes on the TV, she pulls out from her purse a Swiss army knife\nwith a tiny dinosaur on it and tosses it to Clarence. Clarence takes off the\ncorkscrew and opens the wine.\n\nHe pours some wine into a couple of hotel plastic cups, a big glass for Dick, a\nlittle one for himself. He hands it to Dick. Dick takes it and drinks.\n\nDICK\nThis shit can't be real.\n\nCLARENCE\nIt'll get ya high.\n\nHe tosses the knife.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you want some wine, sweetheart?\n\nALABAMA\nNope. I'm not really a wine gal.\n\nUsing the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine. He jumps back.\n\nDICK\nIt's fuckin' real!\n(to Clarence)\nIt's fuckin' real!\n\nCLARENCE\nI certainly hope so.\n\nDICK\nYou've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!\n\nCLARENCE\nI know.\n\nDICK\nDo you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?\n\nCLARENCE\nTell me.\n\nDICK\nI don't know! A fuckin' lot!\n\nHe downs his wine. Clarence fills his glass.\n\nDICK\nThis is Drexl's coke?\n\nCLARENCE\nDrexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he\nwants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama\nare gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So,\nyou got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?\n\nDICK\nLook, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.\n\nDick gulps half of his wine. Clarence fills up.\n\nCLARENCE\nBut you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the\nset.\n\nDICK\nYeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know\nthose guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot\nto piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit\nat a time \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nNo way! The whole enchilada in one shot.\n\nDICK\nDo you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred\nthousand. How difficult can that be?\n\nDICK\nIt's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat\ncats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two\nhundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And,\nmore important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could\npossibly help you.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs he big league?\n\nDICK\nHe's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very\npowerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could\nbe interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat'd'ya tell 'em?\n\nDICK\nHardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and\nwhat wasn't.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's this acting class guy's name?\n\nDICK\nElliot.\n\nCLARENCE\nElliot what?\n\nDICK\nElliot Blitzer.\n\nCLARENCE\nOK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the\ngetting to know you stuff.\n\nDICK\nWhere?\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Alabama)\nThe zoo.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Dick)\nThe zoo.\n(pause)\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nDICK\nWould you just shut up a minute and let me think?\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's to think about?\n\nDICK\nShut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're\nmarried. You killed a guy.\n\nCLARENCE\nTwo guys.\n\nDICK\nTwo guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck,\nClarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean\nshit.\n\nCLARENCE\nDon't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a\nfuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he\ndeserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit\nbadge or somethin'.\n\nDick rests his head in his hands.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, buddy, I realize I'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but I need\nyou to rise to the occasion. So, drink some more wine. Get used to the idea,\nand get your friend to the phone.\n\nEXT.

What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob\nquestions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the\nevidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with\na wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he\ncould trust.\n\nELLIOT\nHe trusts you?\n\nCLARENCE\nWe were in Four H together.

Floyd (Dick's room-mate) answers.\n\nVIRGIL\nHello, is Dick Ritchie here?\n\nFLOYD\nNaw, he ain't home right now.\n\nVIRGIL\nDo you live here?\n\nFLOYD\nYeah, I live here.\n\nVIRGIL\nSorta room-mates?\n\nFLOYD\nExactly room-mates.\n\nVIRGIL\nMaybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours\nfrom Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be\ntravelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they\nstayin' here?\n\nFLOYD\nNaw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're\nstayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.\n\nVIRGIL\nHow do you know? You been there?\n\nFLOYD\nNo, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda\neasy to remember.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou're right. It is.\n\nEXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO \u221a PAYPHONE \u221a DAY\n\nClarence is still on the phone with Lee.\n\nCLARENCE\nLee, the reason I'm talkin' with you is I want to open \"Doctor Zhivago\" in\nL.A. And I want you to distribute it.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nStopped in the traffic on Sunset Boulevard.\n\nLEE\nI don't know, Clarence, \"Doctor Zhivago\" is a pretty big movie.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLARENCE\n\nCLARENCE\nThe biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a\nlot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a\nmovie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nHe's still on Sunset Boulevard, the traffic's moving better now.\n\nLEE\nI'm not sayin' I'm not interested. But being a distributer's not what I'm all\nabout. I'm a film producer, I'm on this world to make good movies.\nNothing more. Now, having my big toe dipped into the distribution end\nhelps me on many levels.\n\nTraffic breaks and Lee speeds along. The background whizzes past him.\n\nLEE\n(continuing)\nBut the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of\ndistributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna\naccomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLARENCE\n\nCLARENCE\nNow that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a\nrisk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks,\nthen go straight to cable. This is \"Doctor Zhivago\". This'll be packin' 'em\nin for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to\nwork with anybody's movie but mine.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nSpeeding down a benchside road.\n\nLEE\nWell, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to \"Doctor Zhivago\" are\nin arbitration?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLARENCE\n\nCLARENCE\nI wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a\ncourtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on\nthe cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're\nin bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have\nto come to terms with your Fear and Desire.\n\nPause. Clarence hands the phone to Elliot.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Elliot)\nHe wants to talk ya.\n\nELLIOT\n(into phone)\nMr. Donowitz?\n(pause)\nI told you, through Dick.\n(pause)\nHe's in my acting class.\n(pause)\nAbout a year.\n(pause)\nYeah, he's good.\n(pause)\nThey grew up together.\n(pause)\nSure thing.\n\nElliot hangs up the phone.\n\nELLIOT\nHe says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants\neverybody there.\n(pointing to Clarence)\nHe'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do\nbusiness. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a\nsample bag.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo problems on both counts.\n\nHe offers Elliot the animal crackers.\n\nCLARENCE\nHave a cookie.\n\nElliot takes one.\n\nELLIOT\nThanks.\n\nHe puts it in the mouth.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat wasn't a gorilla, was it?\n\nEXT. HOLIDAY INN \u221a DAY\n\nThe red Mustang with Clarence and Alabama pulls up to the hotel. Alabama\nhops out. Clarence stays in.\n\nALABAMA\nYou did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do\nmy part OK?\n\nCLARENCE\nBabalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.\n\nALABAMA\nI felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head.\nI'm gonna go grab dinner.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm\ngonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated\nmovies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nCLARENCE\nWe now return to \"Bullit\" already in progress.\n\nHe slams the Mustang in reverse and peels out of the hotel. Alabama walks her\nlittle walk from the parking lot to the pool area. Somebody whistles at her, she\nturns to them.\n\nALABAMA\nThank you.\n\nShe gets to her door, takes out the key, and opens the door.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CALRENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nShe steps in only to find Virgil sitting on a chair placed in front of the door with\na sawed-off shotgun aimed right at her.\n\nVIRGIL\n(calmly)\nStep inside and shut the door.\n\nShe doesn't move, she's frozen. Virgil leans forward.\n\nVIRGIL\n(calmly)\nLady. I'm gonna shoot you in the face.\n\nShe does exactly as he says. Virgil rises, still aiming the sawed-off.\n\nVIRGIL\nStep away from the door, move into the bathroom.\n\nShe does. He puts the shotgun down on the chair, then steps closer to her.\n\nVIRGIL\nOK, Alabama, where's our coke, where's Clarence, and when's he coming\nback.\n\nALABAMA\nI think you got the wrong room, my name is Sadie. I don't have any Coke,\nbut there's a Pepsi machine downstairs. I don't know any Clarence, but\nmaybe my husband does. You might have heard of him, he play football. Al\nLylezado. He'll be home any minute, you can ask him.\n\nVirgil can't help but smile.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou're cute.\n\nVirgil jumps up and does a mid-air kung fu kick which catches Alabama square\nin the face, lifting her off the ground and dropping her flat on her back.\n\nINT. MOVING RED MUSTANG \u221a DAY\n\nClarence, in his car, driving to get something to eat, singing to himself.\n\nCLARENCE\n(singing)\n\"Land of stardust, land of glamour,\nVistavision and Cinema,\nEverything about it is a must,\nTo get to Hollywood, or bust...\"\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's laying flat. She actually blacks out for a moment, but the salty taste\nof the blood in her mouth wakes her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil\nstanding there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream. They open again\nto the same sight. She has never felt more helpless in her life.\n\nVIRGIL\nHurts, don't it? It better. Took me a long time to kick like that. I'm third-\ndegree blackbelt, you know? At home I got trophies. Tournaments I was in.\nKicked all kinds of ass. I got great technique. You ain't hurt that bad. Get\non your feet, Fruitloop.\n\nAlabama wobbily complies.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhere's our coke? Where's Clarence? And when he's comin' back?\n\nAlabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without a doubt she's going to\ndie, because this man is going to kill her.\n\nALABAMA\nGo take a flying fuck and a rolling donut.\n\nVirgil doesn't waste a second. He gives her a sidekick straight to the stomach.\nThe air is sucked out of her lungs. She falls to her knees. She's on all fours\ngasping for air that's just not there.\n\nVirgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes. He lights one up with a Zippo lighter.\nHe takes a long, deep drag.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhatsamatta? Can't breathe? Get used to it.\n\nINT. HAMBURGER STAND \u221a DAY\n\nClarence walks through the door of some mom and pop fast-food restaurant.\n\nCLARENCE\nWoah! Smells like hamburgers in here! What's the biggest, fattest\nhamburger you guys got?\n\nThe IRANIAN GUY at the counter says:\n\nIRANIAN GUY\nThat would be Steve's double chili cheeseburger.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, I want two of them bad boys. Two large orders of chili fries. Two\nlarge Diet Cokes.\n(looking at a menu at the wall)\nAnd I'll tell you what, why don't you give me a combination burrito as well.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama is violently thrown into a corner of the room. She braces herself\nagainst the wall. She is very punchy. Virgil steps in front of her.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou think your boyfriend would go through this kind of shit for you?\nDream on, cunt. You're nothin' but a fuckin' fool. And your pretty face is\ngonna turn awful goddamn ugly in about two seconds. Now, where's my\nfuckin' coke?\n\nShe doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse kick on the head. Her\nhead slams into the left side of the wall.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhere's Clarence?!\n\nNothing. He gives her another kick to the head, this time from the other side.\nHer legs start to give way. He catches her and throws her back. He slaps her\nlightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhen's Clarence getting back?\n\nShe can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages, and she gives him the\nmiddle finger. Virgil can't help but smile.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou gotta lot of heart, kid.\n\nHe gives her a spinning roadhouse kick to the head that sends her to the floor.\n\nINT. HAMBURGER STAND \u221a DAY\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Burgers sizzling on a griddle, Chili and cheese is put on them.\n\nClarence is waiting for his order. He notices a CUSTOMER reading a copy of\n\"Newsweek\" with Elvis on the cover.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's a great issue.\n\nThe Customer lowers his magazine a little bit.\n\nCUSTOMER\nYeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.\n\nCLARENCE\nHave you read the story on Elvis?\n\nCUSTOMER\nNo. Not yet.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I\nlook at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I\nended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever\nwrong.\n\nCUSTOMER\nThat good, huh?\n\nHe takes the magazine from the Customer's hands and starts flipping to the\nElvis article.\n\nCLARENCE\nIt tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the\nwhole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew\nup with him, the artists he inspired \u221a Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and\nthe fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the\ncreeps.\n\nCUSTOMER\nI can see what you mean.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every\nbranch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.\n\nClarence and the Customer laugh.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's pretty beat up. She has a fat lip and her face is black and blue. She's\ncrawling around on the floor. Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the\ncocaine. He's also carrying on a running commentary.\n\nVIRGIL\nNow the first guy you kill is always the hardest. I don't care if you're the\nBoston Strangler or Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas boy, Charles\nWhitman, the fella who shot all them guys from that tower, I'll bet you\ngreen money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was the\nbitch of the bunch. No foolin' the first one's a tough row to ho. Now, the\nsecond one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to ho.\nYou still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around. Then you\ncompletely level off on the third one. The third one's easy. It's gotten to the\npoint now I'll do it just to watch their expressions change.\n\nHe's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he flips the matress up off the\nbed, and the black suitcase is right there.\n\nAlabama's crawling, unnoticed to where her purse is lying. Virgil flips open the\nblack case and almost goes snow blind.\n\nVIRGIL\nWell, well, well, looky here. I guess I just reached journey's end. Great.\nOne less thing I gotta worry about.\n\nVirgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse.\n\nShe pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up. Virgil turns toward her.\n\nVIRGIL\nOK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth \u221a\n\nAlabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out knife in both hands. Mr. Karate-\nman smiles.\n\nVIRGIL\nKid, you got a lotta heart.\n\nHe moves toward her.\n\nAlabama's hands are shaking.\n\nVIRGIL\nTell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you a free swing. Now, I only\ndo that for people I like.\n\nHe moves close.\n\nAlabama's eyes study him. He grabs the front of his shirt and rips it open.\nButtons fly everywhere.\n\nVIRGIL\nGo ahead, girl, take a stab at it.\n(giggling)\nYou don't have anything to lose.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose.\nVirgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women\nthat comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many\nwomen all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt\nonly a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into \"I'll\ntake this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do\" seething hatred.\n\nLetting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then\ndrops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a VIRGIL'S FACE\n\nTalk about bloodcurling yells.\n\nVirgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running\ndown his face.\n\nWhile Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter\nthat Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster,\nso it doesn't kill him.\n\nVirgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.\n\nVIRGIL\nOK, no more Mr. Nice-guy.\n\nAlabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it\nand, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the\nnose, breaking it.\n\nHer eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to\nit, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back,\nsending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door.\n\nVirgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama.\nAlabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but\nnot one of them has ever laughed before he did it.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhat's so fuckin' funny?!!\n\nALABAMA\n(laughing)\nYou look so ridiculous.\n\nShe laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off\nthe ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom.\n\nVIRGIL\nLaugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you\nlaughing now?\n\nAlabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and\nsqueezes it out in her hand.\n\nVirgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair.\n\nAlabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his\neyes.\n\nVIRGIL\nOh Jesus!\n\nShe grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face.\n\nVIRGIL\nOh Mary, help me!\n\nThe battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's\nclutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a\nTasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming\ntoward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks\nher into the toilet.\n\nAhe recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the\ntoilet tank.\n\nVirgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama\nbrings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet\nlid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires\nanyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink.\n\nThe toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground.\n\nAlabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net\nhairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his\ngun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame,\nwhich results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face.\n\nHe fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending\nwater spraying.\n\nUpon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama\ndown, and runs out of the bathroom.\n\nVirgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off\nlaying on the ground. He crawls toward it.\n\nAlabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45\nautomatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room.\n\nHe reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.\n\nAlabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-\nrunning-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him.\n\nHe arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and\nsending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room.\n\nAlabama snatches the shotgun.\n\nArched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact.\n\nThe first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second\nhits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest.\n\nAlabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun.\n\nEver since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been\nfunctioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of\nSaint Francis of Assisi.\n\nALABAMA\nLord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nand where there is sadness, joy.\nO Divine Master, grant that I may not\nso much seek to be consoled as to console;\nto be understood as to understand;\nto be loved as to love;\nfor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born\nto eternal life.\n\nClarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn,\nonly to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun.\n\nCLARENCE\nHoney?\n\nShe continues. He puts his gun away.\n\nCLARENCE\nSweetheart? Cops are gonna be here any minute,\n\nShe continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground. She\nlies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms.\n\nClarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his\nshoulder.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a DAY\n\nEverybody is outside their rooms wathcing as Clarence walks through the pool\narea with his bundle. Sirens can be heard.\n\nEXT. MOVING RED MUSTANG \u221a DAY\n\nClarence is driving like mad. Alabama's passed out in the passenger seat. She's\nmuttering to herself. Clarence has one hand on the steering wheel and the other\nstrokes Alabama's hair.\n\nCLARENCE\nSleep baby. Don't dream. Don't worry. Just sleep. You deserve better than\nthis. I'm so sorry. Sleep my angel. Sleep peacefully.\n\nEXT. MOTEL 6 \u221a NIGHT\n\nA new motel. Clarence's red Mustang is parked outside.\n\nINT.

NOWHERE\n\nClarence is in a nondescript room speaking directly to the camera. He's in a\nheadshot.\n\nCLARENCE\nI feel so horrible about what she went through. That fucker really beat the\nshit out of her. She never told him where I was. It's like I always felt that\nthe way she felt about me was a mistake. She couldn't really care that\nmuch. I always felt in the back of my mind, I don't know, she was jokin'.\nBut, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be unraptured\nwith words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to \u221a\nthat's a test of oneself. That's a true romance. I swear to God, I'll cut off my\nhands and gouge out my eyes before I'll every let anything happen to that\nlady again.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT.

MOVING PORSCHE \u221a NIGHT\n\nElliot Blitzer is the driver, standing on it. A blond, glitzy COKE WHORE is\nsitting next to him. They're having a ball. Then they're seeing a red and blue\nlight flashing in the rear-view window. It's the cops.\n\nELLIOT\nFuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined,\ndriving like this!\n(he pulls over)\nKandi, you gotta help me.\n\nKANDI\nWhat can I do?\n\nHe pulls out the sample bag of cocaine that Clarence gave him earlier.\n\nELLIOT\nYou gotta hold this for me.\n\nKANDI\nYou must be high. Uh-huh. No way.\n\nELLIOT\n(frantically)\nJust put it in your purse.\n\nKANDI\nI'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.\n\nELLIOT\nThey won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.\n\nKANDI\nNo way, Jose.\n\nELLIOT\nPlease, they'll be here any minute.

It rips open. Cocaine\ncompletely covers his blue suit. At that moment Elliot turns to face a flashing\nbeam. Tears fill his eyes.\n\nINT. POLICE STATION \u221a INTERROGATION ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nElliot is sitting in a chair at the table. Two young, good-looking, casually\ndressed, Starsky and Hutch-type POLICE DETECTIVES are questioning him.\nThey're known in the department as Nicholson and Dimes.

And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man\nshow nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience \u221a\n\nDIMES\nBut there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy\nwho gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll\nhave so much experience to draw on \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nAnd just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get\nmarried, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because\nyou'll know what it's like to be a woman.\n\nDIMES\n'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right\nanymore \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nThat is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.\n\nElliot starts crying.

Now, children, somebody is stickin' a red-hot poker up my asshole\nand what I don't know is whose hand's on the handle.\n\nYOUNG WISE-GUY #1 (FRANKIE)\nYou think Virgil started gettin' big ideas?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nIt's possible. Anybody can be carried away with delusions of grandeur. But\nafter that incident in Ann Arbor, I trust Virgil.\n\nYOUNG WISE-GUY #2 (DARIO)\nWhat happened?\n\nOLD WISE-GUY(LENNY)\nVirgil got picked up in a warehouse shakedown. He got five years, he\nserved three.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nAnybody who clams up and does hid time, I don't care how I feel about him\npersonally, he's OK.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nKRINKLE'S OFFICE\n\nNICHOLSON\nIt seems a cop from some department, we don't know where, stole a half a\nmillion dollars of coke from the property cage and he's been sittin' on it for\na year and a half. Now the cops got this weirdo \u221a\n\nDIMES\nSuspect's words \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nTo front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his\nboss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.\n\nDIMES\nHe produced \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\".\n\nKRINKLE\nThat Vietnam movie?\n\nNICHOLSON\nUh-huh.\n\nKRINKLE\nThat was a good fuckin' movie.\n\nDIMES\nSure was.\n\nKRINKLE\nDo you believe him?\n\nNICHOLSON\nI believe he believes him.\n\nDIMES\nHe's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny\ngranny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.\n\nNICHOLSON\nThis rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.\n\nKRINKLE\nHe'll wear a wire?\n\nDIMES\nWe talked him into it.\n\nKRINKLE\nDirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.\n\nNICHOLSON\nLook, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire\ndepartment, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the\ntwelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.\n\nDIMES\nCocaine. Dirty cops. Hollywood. This is Crocket and Tubbs all the way.\nAnd we found it, so we want the fuckin' collar.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nINT. RESTAURANT \u221a DAY\n\nYOUNG WISE-GUY #3 (MARVIN)\nMaybe Virgil dropped it off at Cardella's. Cardella turns Virgil's switch\noff, and Cardella decides to open up his own fruit stand.\n\nLENNY\nExcuse me, Mr. Coccotti.\n(to Marvin)\nDo you know Nick Cardella?\n\nMARVIN\nNo.\n\nLENNY\nThen where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?\n\nMARVIN\nI didn't mean \u221a\n\nLENNY\nShut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth\nbefore you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you\ncan throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nChildren, we're digressing. Another possibility is that rat-fuck whore and\nher wack-a-doo cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil. Knowing Virgil, I find\nthat hard to believe. But they sent Drexl to hell, and Drexl was no faggot.\nSo you see, children, I got a lot of questions and no answers. Find out who\nthis wing-and-a-prayer artist is and take him off at the neck.\n\nTITLE CARD: \"THE BIG DAY\"\n\nEXT. IMPERIAL HIGHWAY \u221a SUNRISE\n\nClarence's red Mustang is parked on top of a hill just off of Imperial Highway.\nAs luck would have it, somebody has abandoned a ratty old sofa on the side of\nthe road.

It's real frustratin' to be\nsurrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I\ncouldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough\nenough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to\nan airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin'\nout my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to\ndo most, but couldn't.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nLeavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips.\nFun, fun, fun, fun.\n\nAnother plane takes off.\n\nCLARENCE\nBut knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new\noutlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes\nout there, and go anywhere we ant.\n\nALABAMA\nYou ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where\nwe can really start from scatch.\n\nCLARENCE\nI been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in\nother countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off\nto, my little turtledove?\n\nALABAMA\nCancoon.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhy Cancoon?\n\nALABAMA\nIt's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. \"Clarence and Alabama Go\nto Cancoon\". Don't 'cha think?\n\nCLARENCE\nBut in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nCLARENCE\nDon't you worry 'bout anything. It's all gonna work out for us. We deserve\nit.\n\nINT.

Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm just makin' sure we got everything.\n(pointing to Alabama)\nYou got yours?\n\nShe holds up the suitcase. The phone rings.

Hooker\".\n\nCLARENCE\nNo shit? Dick, that's great!\n\nClarence and Alabama are jumping around. Floyd even smiles.\n\nDICK\n(still stunned)\nThey didn't even want a callback.

They walk and talk.\n\nDICK\nWhat the fuck did you bring that for.\n\nCLARENCE\nIn case.\n\nDICK\nIn case of what?\n\nCLARENCE\nIn case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?\n\nDICK\nLook, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nI know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week\nhas taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a\ngun and not to have it.\n\nPause. Clarence stops walking.\n\nCLARENCE\nHold it, guys. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty scared.\nWhat say we forget the whole thing.\n\nDick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved.\n\nDICK\nDo you really mean it?\n\nCLARENCE\nNo, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think\nabout it. How 'bout you, Bama?\n\nALABAMA\nI thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.\n\nCLARENCE\nIt is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't\nwant you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up\nthere. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's\nwaiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the\ndownside.\n\nDICK\nNow's a helluva time to play \"what if\".\n\nCLARENCE\nThis is our last chance to play \"what if\". I want to do it. I'm just scared of\ngetting caught.\n\nALABAMA\nIt's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat rhymes.\n\nHe kisses her.\n\nDICK\nWell, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta\nhere.\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, let's just get outta here.\n\nThe three walk back to the car. Clarence gets behind the wheel. The other two\nclimb in. Clarence hops back out.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm sorry guys, I gotta do it. As petrified as I am, I just can't walk away.\nI'm gonna be kicking myself in the ass for the rest of my life if I don't go in\nthere. Lee Donowitz isn't a gangster lookin' to skin us, and he's not a cop,\nhe's a famous movie producer lookin' to get high. And I'm just the man\nwho can get him there. So what say we throw caution to the wind and let\nthe chips fall where they may.\n\nClarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the hotel. Dick and\nAlabama exchange looks and follow.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a LOBBY \u221a DAY\n\nElliot's walking around the lobby.

He spots Elliot and\ngoes in his direction. Elliot sees Clarence approaching him. He says to himself,\nquietly:\n\nELLIOT\nElliot, your motivation is to stay out of jail.\n\nClarence walks up to Elliot, they shake hands.\n\nELLIOT\nWhere's everybody else?\n\nCLARENCE\nThey'll be along.\n\nAlabama and Dick enter the lobby, they join up with Clarence and Elliot.\n\nELLIOT\nHi, Dick.\n\nDICK\nHow you doin', Elliot?\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, I guess it's about that time.\n\nELLIOT\nI guess so. Follow me.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a ELEVATOR \u221a DAY\n\nThe four of them are riding in the elevator. As luck would have it, they have the\ncar to themselves. Rinky-drink elevator Muzak is playing.

You apparently think I'm the dumbest\nmotherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a\ndoubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nDIMES\nWe gotta get him outta there.\n\nNICHOLSON\nWhatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELEVATOR\n\nCLARENCE\nSay it, goddamn it!\n\nELLIOT\nYou are the dumbest person in the world.\n\nCLARENCE\nApparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.\n\nELLIOT\nNo. No you're not.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS\n\nNICHOLSON\nHe's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the\nshow must go on.\n\nDIMES\nThis guy's gonna kill him.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELEVATOR\n\nCLARENCE\nStand up.\n\nElliot does. The .38 is still pressed against his forehead.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike Nick Carter used to say: I I'm wrong, I'll apologize. I want you to tell\nme what's waiting for us up there. Something's amiss. I can feel it. If\nanything out of the ordinary goes down, believe this, you're gonna be the\nfirst one shot. Trust me, I am AIDS, you fuck with me, you die. Now quit\nmaking me mad and tell me why I'm so fucking nervous.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNICHOLSON\nHe's bluffin', I knew it. He doesn't know shit.\n\nDIMES\nDon't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou're am actor, so act, motherfucker.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELEVATOR\n\nElliot still hasn't answered.\n\nCLARENCE\nOK.\n\nWith the .38 up against Elliot's head Clarence puts his palm over the top of the\ngun to shield himself from the splatter. Alabama and Dick can't believe what\nhe's gonna do.\n\nElliot, tears running down, starts talking for the benefit of the people at the\nother end of the wire. He sounds like a little boy.\n\nELLIOT\nI don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. I wish somebody would just come\nand get me cause I don't like this. This is not what I thought it would be.\nAnd I wish somebody would just take me away. Just take me away Come\nand get me. Cause I don't like this anymore. I can't take this. I'm sorry but\nI just can't. So, if somebody would just come to my rescue, everything\nwould be alright.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNicholson and Dimes shake their hands, They have a \"well, that's that\"\nexpression an their faces.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELEVATOR\n\nClarence puts down the gun and hugs Elliot.\n\nCLARENCE\nSorry, Elliot.

Dick and Alabama are\nrelieved.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNicholson and Dimes listen open-mouthed, not believing what they're hearing.\n\nINT. DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a DAY\n\nFloyd still lying on the couch watching TV. He hasn't moved since we last saw\nhim.\n\nThere is a knock from the door.\n\nFLOYD\n(not turning away from TV)\nIt's open.\n\nThe front door flies open and the four Wise-guys rapidly enter the room. The\ndoor slams shut.

He'll be out in a quick.\n\nThey all move into the room, it is very luxurious.\n\nANOTHER INCREDIBLY MUSCULAR GUY, Boris, is sitting on the sofa, he\ntoo has an Uzi. Monty begins patting everybody down.\n\nMONTY\nSorry, nothin personal.\n\nHe starts to search Clarence. Clarence back away.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo need to search me, daredevil. All you'll find is a .38 calibre.\n\nBoris gets up from the couch.\n\nBORIS\nWhat compelled you to bring that along?\n\nCLARENCE\nThe same thing that compelled you, Beastmaster, to bring rapid-fire\nweaponry to a business meeting.\n\nBORIS\nI'll take that.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou'll have to.\n\nThe toilet flushes in the bathroom. The door swings open and Lee Donowitz\nemerges.\n\nLEE\nThey're here. Who's who?\n\nELLIOT\nLee, this is my friend Dick, and these are his friends, Clarence and\nAlabama.\n\nBORIS\n(pointing at Clarence)\nThis guy's packin'.\n\nLEE\nReally?\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these \"Soldier of\nFortune\" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident\nthat you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll\nput the gun on the table.\n\nLEE\nI don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you\nbe nice and get coffee for everybody.\n\nThey all sit around a fancy glass table except for Boris, who's getting the coffee,\nand Monty, who's standing behind Lee's chair.\n\nCLARENCE\nOh, Mr. Donowitz \u221a\n\nLEE\nLee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.\n\nCLARENCE\nOK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\" is one\nof my favorite movies. After \"Apocalypse Now\" I think it's the best\nVietnam movie ever.\n\nLEE\nThank you very much, Clarence.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. \"Sophie's\nChoice\", \"Ordinary People\", \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", \"Gandhi\". All that\nstuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.\n\nLEE\nI hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are\nunwatchable movies from unreadable books.\n\nBoris starts placing clear-glass coffee cups in front of everybody and fills\neverybody's cup from a fancy coffee pot that he handles like an expert.\n\nLEE\nClarence, there might be somebody somewhere that agrees with you more\nthan I do, but I wouldn't count on it.\n\nClarence is on a roll and he knows it.\n\nCLARENCE\nThey ain't plays, they ain't books, they certainly ain't movies, they're films.\nAnd do you know what films are? They're for people who don't like\nmovies. \"Mad Max\", that's a movie. \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\",\nthat's a movie. \"Rio Bravo\", that's a movie. \"Rumble Fish\", that's a\nfuckin' movie. And, \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\", that's a movie. It was\nthe first movie with balls to win a lot of Oscars since the \"The Deer\nHunter\".\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nThey're all listening to this.\n\nDIMES\nWhat's this guy doin'? Makin' a drug deal or gettin' a job on the \"New\nYorker\"?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nCLARENCE\nMy uncle Roger and uncle Cliff, both of which were in Nam, saw \"Coming\nHome in a Body Bag\" and thought it was the most accurate Vietnam film\nthey'd ever seen.\n\nLEE\nYou know, Clarence, when a veteran of that bullshit wars says that, it\nmakes the whole project worthwhile. Clarence, my friend, and I call you\nmy friend because we have similar interests, let's take a look at what you\nhave for me.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNICHOLSON\nThank God.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nClarence puts the suitcase on the table.\n\nCLARENCE\nLee, when you see this you're gonna shit.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLOBBY\n\nThe four Wise-guys are at the desk.\n\nLENNY\n(quietly to the others)\nWhat was the Jew-boy's name?\n\nMARVIN\nDonowitz, he said.\n\nFRONT-DESK GUY\nHow can I help you, Gentlemen?\n\nLENNY\nYeah, we're from Warner Bros. What room is Mr. Donowitz in?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nLee's looking over the cocaine and sampling it.\n\nCLARENCE\nNow, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot\nmore.\n\nLEE\nDon't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.\n\nCLARENCE\nMe too, Boris.\n\nBoris fills both of their cups. They both, calm as a lake, take cream and sugar.\nAll eyes are on them. Lee uses light cream and sugar, he begins stirring this\ncup. Clarence uses very heavy cream and sugar.\n\nLEE\n(stirring loudly)\nYou like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.\n\nBoth are cool as cucumbers.\n\nLEE\nI have to hand it to you, this is not nose garbage, this is quality. Can Boris\nmake anybody a sandwich? I got all kinds of sandwich shit from Canters in\nthere.\n\nALABAMA\nNo thank you.\n\nDICK\nNo. But thanks.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that\nmade me a little sick.\n\nLEE\nWhere'd you go?\n\nCLARENCE\nA Norms in Van Nuys.\n\nLEE\nBastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.\n\nLee continues looking at the merchandise.\n\nAlabama writes something in her napkin with a pencil. She slides the napkin\nover to Clarence. It says: \"You're so cool\" with a tiny heart drawn on the\nbottom of it. Clarence takes the pencil and draws an arrow through the heart.\nShe takes the napkin and puts it in her pocket.\n\nLee looks up.\n\nLEE\nOK, Clarence, the merchandise is perfect. But, whenever I'm offered a deal\nthat's too good to be true, it's because it's a lie. Convince me you're on the\nlevel.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNICHOLSON\nIf he don't bite, we ain't got shit except posession.\n\nDIMES\nConvince him.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, Lee, it's like this. You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because I\ndon't know what the fuck I'm doing. You're used to dealin' with\nprofessionals. I'm not a professional. I'm a rank amateur. I could take that,\nand I could cut it, and I could sell it a little bit at a time, and make a\nhelluva lot more money. But, in order to do that, I'd have to become a drug\ndealer. Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting busted all\nof the time. Just meeting you here today scares the shit outta me, and\nyou're not a junkie, a killer or a cop, you're a fucking movie-maker. I like\nyou, and I'm still scared. I'm a punk kid who picked up a rock in the street,\nonly to find out it's the Hope Diamond. It's worth a million dollars, but I\ncan't get the million dollars for it. But, you can. So, I'll sell it to you for a\ncouple a hundred thousand. You go to make a million. It's all found money\nto me anyway. Me and my wife are minimum wage kids, two hundred\nthousand is the world.\n\nLEE\nElliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.\n(to Elliot)\nThanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on\nyou. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.\n(to Lee)\nHe's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.\n\nLEE\nWhy does he trust you?\n\nCLARENCE\nWe grew up together.\n\nLEE\nIf you don't know shit, ehy does he think you can sell it?\n\nCLARENCE\nI bullshitted him.\n\nLee starts laughing.\n\nLEE\nThat's wild. This fucking guy's a madman. I love it. Monty, go in the other\nroom and get the money.\n\nClarence, Alabama and Dick exchange looks.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNicholson and Dimes exchange looks.\n\nDIMES & NICHOLSON\nBingo!\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELEVATOR\n\nThe four Wise-guys are coming up.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nLEE\n(pointing to Alabama)\nWhat's your part in this?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm his wife.\n\nLEE\n(referring to Dick)\nHow 'bout you?\n\nDICK\nI know Elliot.\n\nLEE\nAnd Elliot knows me. Tell me, Clarence, what department does you friend\nwork in?\n\nDick and Alabama panic.\n\nCLARENCE\n(without missing a beat)\nCarson County Sheriffs.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nThe internal affairs officers high five.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nMonty brings in a briefcase of money and puts it down on the table.\n\nLEE\nWanna count your money?\n\nCLARENCE\nActually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nThey all stand.\n\nDIMES\nOK, boys. Let's go get 'em.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a LEE'S HOTEL ROOM \u221a BATHROOM \u221a\nDAY\n\nClarence steps inside the bathroom and shuts the door. As soon as it's shut he\nstarts doing the twist. He can't believe he's pulled it off. He goes to the toilet\nand starts taking a piss. He turns and sees Elvis sitting on the sink.\n\nELVIS\nClarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.\n\nCLARENCE\nI was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.\n\nELVIS\nAll anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.\n\nCLARENCE\nCan you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.\n\nELVIS\nOh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: \"I'll take that gun\", \"You'll\nhave to\".\n\nCLARENCE\nThat was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came\nfrom. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought,\nthat's a cool line, I gotta remember that.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nEverything's just as it was.\n\nSudenly, Nicholson, Dimes and the four Detectives break into the room with\nguns drawn.\n\nDIMES & NICHOLSON\nPolice! Freeze, you're all under arrest!\n\nEverybody at the table stands up. Boris and Monty stand ready with the Uzis.\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou two! Put the guns on the floor and back away.\n\nMONTY\nFuck you! All you pigs put your guns on the floor and back away.\n\nLEE\nMonty, what are you talking about? So what they say.\n\nDIMES\nThis is your last warning! Drop those fuckin' guns!\n\nBORIS\nThis is your last warning! We could kill all six of ya and ya fuckin' know it!\nNow get on the floor!\n\nDICK\nWhat the fuck am I doing here?\n\nLEE\nBoris! Everybody's gonna get killed! They're cops!\n\nMONTY\nSo they're cops. Who gives a shit?\n\nBORIS\nLee, something I never told you about me. I don't like cops.\n\nDIMES\nOK, let's everybody calm down and get nice. Nobody has to die. We don't\nwant it, and you don't want it.\n\nLEE\nWe don't want it.\n\nThe four Wise-guys burst through the door, shotguns drawn, except for Frankie,\nwho has two .45 automatics, one in each hand.\n\nHalf of the cops spin around.\n\nWURLITZER\nFreeze!\n\nLENNY\nWho are you guys?\n\nWURLITZER\nPolice.\n\nDARIO\n(to Lenny)\nDo we get any extra if we have to kill cops?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nBATHROOM\n\nClarence and Elvis.\n\nCLARENCE\nHow do you think I'm doin' with Lee?\n\nELVIS\nAre you kiddin'? He loves you.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?\n\nELVIS\nYou're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as\nkissin' his ass.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\".\n\nELVIS\nThat's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and\nhe can see that.\n\nElvis fixes Clarence's collar.\n\nELVIS\nI like ya, Clarence. Always have.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nThis is a Mexican stand-off if there ever was one. Gangsters on one end with\nshotguns. Bodyguards with machine guns on the other. And cops with handguns\nin the middle.\n\nDick's ready to pass out.\n\nAlabama's so scared she pees on herself.\n\nFor Elliot, this has been the worst day of his life, and he's just about had it.\n\nELLIOT\nOfficer Dimes? Officer Dimes.\n\nDimes looks at Elliot.\n\nELLIOT\nThis has nothing to do with me anymore. Can I just leave and you guys just\nsettle it by yourselves?\n\nDIMES\nElliot, shut the fuck up and stay put!\n\nLEE\n(to Elliot)\nHow did you know his name? How the fuck did he know your name? Why,\nyou fuckin' little piece of shit!\n\nELLIOT\nLee, understand, I didn't want to \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nShut the fuck up!\n\nLEE\nWell, I hope you're not planning on acting any time in the next twenty\nyears cause your career is over as of now! You might as weel burn you\nSAG card! To think I treated you as a son! And you stabbed me in the\nheart!\n\nLee can't control his anger any more. He grabs the coffee pot off the table and\nflings hot coffee into Elliot's face. Elliot screams and falls to his knees,\n\nInstinctively, Nicholson shoots Lee twice.\n\nAlabama screams.\n\nBoris lets loose with his Uzi, pinting Nicholson red with bullets.\n\nDIMES\n(screaming)\nCody!!!\n\nNicholson flies backwards.\n\nMarvin fires his shotgun, hits Nicholson in the back, Nicholson's body jerks\nback and forth then on the floor.\n\nClarence opens the bathroom door.\n\nDimes hits the ground firing.\n\nA shot catches Clarence in the forehead.\n\nAlabama screams.\n\nDario fires his sawed-off. It catches Clarence in the chest, hurling him on the\nbathroom sink, smashing the mirror.\n\nIt might have been a stand-off before, but once the firing starts everybody either\nhits the ground or runs for cover.\n\nDimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA Officer and Wurtlitzer hit the ground.\n\nBoris dives into the kitchen area.\n\nMonty tips the table over.\n\nMarvin dives behind the sofa.\n\nDario runs out of the door and down the hall.\n\nWith bullets flying this way and that, some don't have time to anything. Two IA\nOfficers are shot right away.\n\nFrankie takes an Uzi hit. He goes down firing both automatics.\n\nElliot gets it from both sides.\n\nAlabama is crawling across the floor, like a soldier in war, towards the\nbathroom.\n\nClarence, still barely alive, lays on the sink, twitching. He moves and falls off.\n\nAlabama continues crawling.\n\nMarvin brings his sawed-off from behind the sofa and fires. The shotgun blast\nhits the glass table and Monty. Monty stands up screaming.\n\nThe Cops on the ground let loose, firing into Monty.\n\nAs Monty gets hit, his finger hits the trigger of the Uzi, spreading fire all over\nthe apartment.\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a DAY\n\nCop cars start arriving in twos in front of the hotel.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nGUNFIGHT\n\nAlabama crawling.\n\nThe suitcase full of cocaine is by Dick. Dick grabs it and tosses it in the air.\nMarvin comes from behind the sofa and fires. The suitcase is hit in mid-air.\nWhite powder goes everywhere. The room is enveloped in cocaine.\n\nDick takes this cue and makes a dash out the door.\n\nAn IA Officer goes after him.\n\nLenny makes a break for it.\n\nWurlitzer goes after him but is pinned down by Marvin.\n\nAlabama reaches the bathroom and finds Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\nSweety?\n\nClarence's face is awash with blood.\n\nCLARENCE\nI... I can't see you... I've got blood in my eyes...\n\nHe dies.\n\nAlabama tries to give him outh-to-mouth resuscitation.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a HALLWAY \u221a DAY\n\nDario runs down the hall, right into a cluster of uniformed police.\n\nHe fires his shotgun, hitting two, just before the others chop him to ribbons.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a ANOTHER HALLWAY\n\nThe hallway's empty but we hear footsteps approaching fast. Dick comes\naround the corner, running as if on fire. Then we see the IA Officer turn the\nsame corner.\n\nIA OFFICER\n(aiming gun)\nFreeze!\n\nDick does.\n\nDICK\nI'm unarmed!\n\nIA OFFICER\nPut your hands on your head, you son-of-a-bitch!\n\nHe does. Then, from off screen, a shotgun blast tears into the IA Officer,\nsending him to the wall.\n\nDICK\nOh shit.\n\nHe starts running again and runs out of frame, then Lenny turns around the\ncorner and runs down the hall.\n\nDick runs into the elevator area, he hits the buttons, he's trapped, it's like a box.\n\nLenny catches up. Dick raises his hands. Lenny aimes his sawed-off.\n\nDICK\nLook, I don't know who you are, but whatever it was that I did to you, I'm\nsorry.\n\nTwo elevator doors on either side of them open.\n\nLenny looks at Dick. He drops his aim and says:\n\nLENNY\nLotsa luck.\n\nLenny dives into one elevator car. Dick jumps into the other, just as the doors\nclose.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nHOTEL ROOM\n\nThe Mexican stand-off has become two different groups of two pinning each\nother down.\n\nWurlitzer has Marvin pinned down behind the sofa and Dimes has Boris pinned\ndown in the kitchen.\n\nIn the bathroom, Alabama's pounding on Clarence's bloody chest, trying to get\nhis heart started. It's not working. She slaps him hard in the face a couple of\ntimes.\n\nALABAMA\nWake up, goddamn it!\n\nDimes discards his handgun and pulls one of the sawed-off shotguns from the\ngrip of a dead Wise-guy.\n\nBoris peeks around the wall to fire.\n\nDimes lets loose with a blast. A scream is heard.\n\nBORIS\n(off)\nI'm shot! Stop!\n\nDIMES\nThrow out your gun, asshole!\n\nThe Uzi's tossed out.\n\nDimes goes to where Wurlitzer is.\n\nDIMES\n(to Marvin)\nOK, black jacket! It's two against one now! Toss the gun and lie face down\non the floor or die like all you friends.\n\nThe shotgun's tossed out from behind the sofa.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a ELEVATOR \u221a DAY\n\nDick's sitting on the ground, he can't believe any of this. The doors open on the\nfourth floor. He runs out into the hallway.\n\nHALLWAY\n\nHe starts trying the room doors for an open one.\n\nDICK\nOh, God, if you just get me outta this I swear to God I'll never fuck up\nagain. Please, just let me get to \"T.J. Hooker\" on Monday.\n\nSTEWARDESS'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nDick steps in. THREE GORGEOUS GIRLS are doing a killer aerobics workout\nto a video on TV. The music is so loud they're so into their exercises, they don't\nhear Dick tiptoe behind them and crawl underneath the bed.\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nBoris has caught a lot of buckshots, but he'll live. He's lying on the kitchen\nfloor. Dimes stands over him. He has the sawed-off in his hand.\n\nDIMES\nDon't even give me an excuse, motherfucker.\n\nDimes pats him down for other weapons, there are none.\n\nWurlitzer puts the cuffs on Marvin and sits him down on the couch.\n\nDimes looks in the bathroom and sees the dead Clarence with Alabama crying\nover him.\n\nDimes walks over to Wurlitzer.\n\nDIMES\nEverything's under control here.\n\nWURLITZER\nSorry about Nicholson.\n\nDIMES\nMe too.\n\nWURLITZER\nI'm gonna go see what's goin' on outside.\n\nDIMES\nYou do that.\n\nWurlitzer exits. Dimes grabs the phone.\n\nLOBBY\n\nShotgun in hand, Lenny moves hurriedly down the lobby.\n\nA COP yells out.\n\nCOP\nYou! Stop!\n\nLenny brings up his sawed-off and lets him have it. OTHER COPS rush\nforward. Lenny grabs a woman standing by.\n\nLENNY\nGet back or I'll blow this bitch's brains to kingdom come!\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nDimes on the phone talking with the department. Boris is still moving on the\nfloor. Marvin is sitting on the couch with his hands cuffed behind his back.\nAlabama is crying over Clarence, then she feels something in his jacket. She\nreaches in and pulls out his .38. She wipes her eyes. She holds the gun in her\nhand and remembers Clarence saying:\n\nCLARENCE\n(off)\nShe's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She\ncarried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist,\nand the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!\nPray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!\n\nAlabama steps out of the bathroom, gun in hand.\n\nMarvin turns his head toward her. She shoots him twice.\n\nDimes, still on the phone, spins around in time to see her raise her gun. She\nfires. He's hit in the head and flung to the floor.\n\nShe sees Boris on the kitchen floor.\n\nALABAMA\nBye-bye, Boris. Good luck.\n\nBORIS\nYou too, cutie.\n\nShe starts to leave and then spots the briefcase full of money. She takes it and\nwalks out the door.\n\nHALLWAY\n\nThe elevator opens and Wurlitzer steps out.\n\nAlabama comes around the corner.\n\nWURLITZER\nHey, you!\n\nAlabama shoots him three times in the belly. She steps into the elevator, the\ndoors close.\n\nLOBBY\n\nAlabama enters the lobby and proceeds to walk out. In the background, COPS\nare all over the place and Lenny is still yelling with the woman hostage.\n\nLENNY\nI wanna car here, takin' me to the airport, with a plane full of gas ready to\ntake me to Kilimanjaro and... and a million bucks!\n(pause)\nSmall bills!\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a PARKING LOT \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama puts the briefcase in the trunk. She gets into the Mustang and drives\naway.\n\nINT. MUSTANG \u221a MOVING \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's driving fast down the freeway. The DJ on the radio is trying to be\nfunny. She's muttering to herself.\n\nALABAMA\nI could have walked away. I told you that. I told you I could have walked\naway. This is not my fault. I did not do this. You did this one hundred\npercent to yourself. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling bad. I\nshould laugh cause you don't deserve any better. I could get another guy\nlike that. I'm hot lookin'. What are you? Dead! Dumb jerk. Asshole. You're\na asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole. You wanted it all, didn't ya?\nDidn't ya? Well watcha got now? You ain't got the money. You ain't got\nme. You ain't even got your body anymore. You got nothin'. Nada. Zip.\nGoose egg. Nil. Donut.\n\nThe song \"Little Arrows\" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio. Alabama breaks\ndown and starts crying. She pulls the car over to the side. The song continues.\nShe wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket. She tosses it on\nthe dashboard. She picks up the .38 and sticks it in her mouth.\n\nShe pulls back hammer. She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view\nmirror. She turns it the other way. She looks straight ahead. Her finger tightens\non the trigger. She sees the napkin on the dashboard. She opens it up and reads\nit: \"You're so cool\".\n\nShe tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase. She\nlooks around for, and finally finds, the \"Sgt.

of the hundred bottles with the radio beamer tower and its hangars, chimbneys and equilines or, at least, he was\u2019nt actually the then last king of all Ireland for the time being for the jolly
