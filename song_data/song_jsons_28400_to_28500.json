2]\nChristmas lights glisten\nI've got my eye on the door\nJust waiting for you to walk in\nBut the time is ticking\nPeople ask me how I've been\nAs I comb back through my memory\nHow you said you'd be here\nYou said you'd be here\n[Chorus]\nAnd it was like slow motion\nStanding there in my party dress\nIn red lipstick\nWith no one to impress\nAnd they're all laughing\nAs I'm looking around the room\nBut there was one thing missing\nAnd that was the moment I knew\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd the hours pass by\nNow I just wanna be alone\nBut your close friends always seem to know\nWhen there's something really wrong\nSo they follow me down the hall\nAnd there in the bathroom\nI try not to fall apart\nAnd the sinking feeling starts\nAs I say hopelessly\n\"He said he'd be here\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it was like slow motion\nStanding there in my party dress\nIn red lipstick\nWith no one to impress\nAnd they're all laughing\nAnd asking me about you\nBut there was one thing missing (Missing)\nAnd that was

know that he is blind\nStill I say, there's a way for us\n\nI love him\nBut when the night is over\nHe is gone\nThe river's just a river\nWithout him\nThe world around me changes\nThe trees are bare and everywhere\nThe streets are full of strangers\n\nI love him\nBut every day I'm learning\nAll my life\nI've only been pretending\nWithout me\nHis world will go on turning\nA world that's full of

In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O\u2019Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of the City of Chicago and Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin, judicially admitted that: At the hearing, Andrew Wilson will testify that on February 14, 1982, he was arrested at an apartment by several officers, including respondents Burge and Yucaitis. As Wilson was being taken to the car to be transported to Area II, he heard Burge telling the transporting officers not to \u201cmess with\u201d Wilson and that they would deal with him when they arrived at the station. Wilson was then taken to Area II by Yucaitis and three other officers. Transcript of Testimony of Andrew Wilson, July 7, 10, 11, 1989, at 2914-31 When they arrived at Area II, Wilson was taken to a room where the four transporting officers, including Yucaitis, and other officers started beating him. They hit him, kicked him, knocked him down and slammed him into a window so hard that it broke. In addition, one of the officers grabbed a plastic garbage bag and put it over Wilson\u2019s head, holding it around his neck so that he could not breathe. The officers took the bag off when Wilson bit a hole in it. The officers stopped beating Wilson when Burge entered the room and stated that if it had been him, he would not have left any marks on Wilson. Tr. at 2932-36 Wilson was taken to a second room and handcuffed to the wall. Yucaitis then took Wilson to a telephone and told him to call his brother. When Wilson replied that he did not want to talk but wanted a lawyer, he was taken back to the second room again handcuffed to the wall. Tr. At 2937-44. Burge entered the room and told Wilson he was going to make a statement because Burge\u2019s reputation was at stake. Burge left the room and Yucaitis came in with a brown paper bag. Yucaitis opened the bag and took out a black box about 12-14 inches long, 8-9 inches wide and 6 \u00bd-7 inches high. The box had a crank and two wires with clamps. Yucaitis squatted down in front of Wilson with the box between his own legs, and put one clamp in Wilson\u2019s nose and one on Wilson\u2019s ears, and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson\u2019s teeth to grind and was so painful that he kicked Yucaitis. Yucaitis punched him in the mouth and cranked the box again. Yucaitis left the room and then returned, put the black box in the bag, and left again. Tr. at 2947-55. Respondent O\u2019Hara then came in and took Wilson to see the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, Lawrence Hyman. According to Wilson\u2019s testimony, with O\u2019Hara present, Wilson asked Hyman, \u201cYou want me to make a statement after they\u2019ve been torturing me?\u201d O\u2019Hara took Wilson back to the second room. Tr. at 2956-59. Burge later returned to the second room with the brown paper bag and said, \u201cFun time.\u201d Burge put a pair of handcuffs on Wilson\u2019s other arm and another pair on Wilson\u2019s 3 ankles. He then placed the bag in the garbage can and left. He returned, took out the black box, put the clamps on Wilson\u2019s ears and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson\u2019s to grind his teeth and knocked Wilson out of his chair. Wilson kept rubbing the clips from the electrical device off his ears. Tr at 2961-63. Wilson was then handcuffed across the radiator, kneeling with his arms outstretched. Burge and another officer put the clamps on Wilson\u2019s little fingers and cranked the box repeatedly this time for longer periods. As he was being shocked, Wilson\u2019s chest, leg and face were forced against the radiator and he was burned. Tr. at 2963-66 When Burge stopped cranking and took the clamps off Wilson\u2019s little fingers, he took another shocking device out of the bag. It plugged into an electrical outlet and had a cord sticking out of it. Burge placed the device very near Wilson\u2019s skin so that he could feel it tingling. Burge then jabbed the second device into Wilson\u2019s back and Wilson got a full jolt, slamming Wilson into the grill on the window. Wilson began spitting out blood. Burge and the other officer put the devices back in the bag and left. Tr. at 296-68. A while later, Wilson was taken to Area I headquarters for a lineup. At Area I, Burge stuck his gun in Wilson\u2019s mouth and cocked it back and forth. When Wilson arrived back at Area II after the lineup, Burge told him that if he did not make a statement, he would shock him again. Later, Burge told Wilson he was going to \u201cfry his black ass.\u201d Tr. at 2969-75. Memorandum In Opposition, pp.4-6.\n\n8.

Jones testified that he kept hollering and telling Burge that he wasn\u2019t supposed to do this to him, that Burge said to him that he had no proof, that Burge asked detective Flood, who was present for the shocking, if he saw anything and Flood looked at the ceiling and said no. Jones further stated that Burge said, \u201c[n]o court and no State are going to take your word against a Lieutenant\u2019s word,\u201d and Burge later hit him in the head with a stapler. People v. Jones, 8/5/82, pp. 65-71, 74.\n\n12. Melvin Jones further testified that on February 6, 1982, while he was still being detained in an Area 2 interview room, Defendant McWeeny entered the room with another detective and questioned Jones, after which Lieutenant Burge entered the room and asked McWeeny if Jones had started talking yet. Jones further stated that when McWeeny said Jones hadn\u2019t said anything yet, Burge pulled out a gun and cocked it, put it up to Jones\u2019 head and said\nhe was going to \u201cblow Jones\u2019 black head off.\u201d Id. pp. 76-79.\n\n13. Melvin Jones testified on February 19, 1992 on behalf of the City at the Chicago Police Board Hearing, that McWeeny told Burge to get out of the room and McWeeny stated to him later that evening that he [McWeeny] \u201chad got the Lieutenant off me for right now. He said, if you are going to talk, you know, it would be easier for me.\u201d Id. at 79; Chicago Police Board, 2/19/92, p. 856.\n\n14. Cassandra Watson, Melvin Jones\u2019 attorney in 1982, testified at the Chicago Police 5 Board Hearings on 2/19/92 that Jones told her within the first 10 days of February, 1982 that he had been beaten and threatened at Area 2, that while he was in an interview room at Area 2 a gun had been placed to his head, and that Lieutenant Burge had electrically shocked him with an electrical shock box.

In their Memorandum In Opposition, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that: Melvin Jones will testify that on February 5, 1982, just nine days prior to Andrew Wilson\u2019s arrest, he was taken to an Area II interrogation room where he was handcuffed and questioned by Area II detectives concerning his knowledge and participation in a murder. When he failed to give information implicating himself in the murder, respondent Burge entered the room and told Jones that he was going to talk. Burge then asked Jones if he had ever heard of him, and when Jones replied that he had not, Burge told him that before he left the station Jones would \u201cwish he had never set eyes on him.\u201d Burge left the interrogation room but returned after Jones persisted in his refusal to talk to the interrogating detectives. Burge had Jones cuffed to a second ring and then produced and plugged into the wall socket a wooden box measuring approximately 10\" x 6\" x 6\", with tweezers and a long nail type device. He again asked Jones if he was going to talk. When Jones again refused, Burge pulled down Jones\u2019 pants and shorts and, using\nthe electrical device, shocked Jones three times, on the foot, thigh, and penis. While he was shocking Jones, Burge demanded that Jones talk. He told Jones that he had also shocked \u201cSatan\u201d (Anthony Holmes) and \u201cCochise,\u201d forcing them to crawl all over the floor. He also told Jones that nobody would believe his word against a lieutenant\u2019s. Burge asked another Area II detective present in the room if he had seen anything, and the detective looked at the ceiling and said no. Burge also tied a sock in Jones\u2019 mouth. Burge was interrupted in his interrogation of Jones, apparently by the news that a policeman had been shot and killed on a bus in his area. Later, Burge also struck Jones with a stapler. When Jones continued to deny knowing anything about the murder, Burge again entered the interrogation room. He pointed a gun at Jones\u2019 head, cocked it and told Jones he was going to \u201cblow his black head off.\u201d 6\nCity and Martin\u2019s Memorandum In Opposition, pp. 7-8.\n\n17.

In a letter dated January 9, 1991, OPS Director Gayle Shines wrote to counsel for Andrew Wilson that \u201cSuperintendent Martin has referred to me your letter of 19 December and the attached Fact Sheet.\u201d\n\n90. The City Council or its Finance committee never issued a report or took any other action after the December 24th torture hearings.\n\n91. On January 28, 1991, Amnesty International issued a Report calling for \u201ca full inquiry into allegations that Chicago police systematically tortured criminal suspects from 1972 to 1984,\u201d and in response, the spokesman for Mayor Daley said she had \u201c\u2018no comment whatsoever.\u2019\u201d Chicago Sun Times, 1/28/91, \u201cPolice Torture Probe Sought Here.\u201d\n\n92. On or about November 2, 1990 OPS Director Gayle Shines approved as\n\u201ccompelling\u201d and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 25 page Report and findings made by OPS investigator Michael Goldston concerning allegations of torture and abuse at Area 2. This Report included the following findings:\nAs to the matter of alleged physical abuse, the preponderance of the evidence is that abuse did occur and that it was systematic. The time span involved covers more than ten years. The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture. The evidence presented by some individuals convinced juries and appellate courts that personnel assigned to Area 2 engaged in methodical abuse. 20 The number of incidents in which an Area 2 command member is identified as an accused can lead to only one conclusion. Particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and participated in it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end. This conclusion is also supported by the number of incidents in which Area 2 offices are named as the location of the abuse.\nOPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings, and Cover Letter, Shines to Martin, dated November 2, 1990 (Goldston Report).\n\n93. In her forwarding memo of November 2, 1990, OPS Director Shines, while\napproving the conclusions of Goldston and Sanders, further informed Superintendent Martin that they both did \u201ca masterful job of marshaling the facts in this intensive and extensive project and their conclusions are compelling.\u201d 11/2/90 Cover Memo, Shines to Martin, with OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings enclosed.\n\n94. On or about November 2, 1990, OPS Director Gayle Shines approved \u201cas\ncompelling\u201d and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 66 page report and conclusions of OPS investigator Francine Sanders which found that based on \u201cthe overwhelming body of evidence which supports the allegations\u201d that administrative charges of excessive force should be sustained against Jon Burge and John Yucaitis including that they \u201crepeatedly administered electrical stimulation to Mr [Andrew] Wilson\u2019s body in order to create pain\u201d and that Burge \u201cheld Mr. Wilson, while handcuffed, against a hot radiator causing burns to Mr. Wilson\u2019s face, chest and thigh.\u201d Chicago Police Office of Professional Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), pp.62-66.\n\n95. Martin acknowledged the \u201c serious nature\u201d of Goldston\u2019s conclusions Martin memo to Shines, 11/18/90.\n\n96. At no time from receiving the Goldston Report in November of 1990 until he left 21 office in April of 1992, did Martin, OPS Director Shines, or any other City policymaking official take any steps to further investigate the allegations made by the some fifty victims listed in the Goldston report.\n\n97. Instead, Martin, after waiting three months, wrote Shines seeking \u201cfurther\nclarification\u201d concerning the Goldston and Sanders Reports. Memo, Martin to Shines, 2/6/91.\n\n98. Despite all of the torture evidence contained in the Goldston and Sanders Reports, in the Fact Sheet, and that was previously presented to Martin and the City Council, the City and Martin did not seek the prosecution of Burge and his confederates in the Wilson case, for a continuing conspiracy on the basis of the numerous other torture cases listed in the Goldston report, or to prosecute Burge for the numerous other cases which were documented in the\nevidence presented, including the Patterson and Madison Hobley cases.\n\n99. In her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Martin, Shines supplied the \u201cclarifications\u201d sought by Martin, and informed him that the OPS findings \u201creflect the unprecedented comprehensiveness of this investigation.\u201d Shines memo, 4/30/91.\n\n100. With her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Superintendent Martin, OPS Director\nShines included investigator Goldston\u2019s clarification memo, in which Goldston set forth that his investigation established that Area 2 detectives and supervisors Jon Burge, John Byrne, Peter Dignan, Charles Grunhard, John Yucaitis, Thomas McKenna, and Patrick O\u2019Hara were \u201cplayers\u201d\nwhose names \u201crepeatedly appeared as connected to allegations of abuse.\u201d Goldston Memo of 4/30/91, attached to Shines Memo to Martin of the same date.\n\n101. After waiting an additional seven months, in November of 1991, Superintendent Leroy Martin approved the findings set forth in the Chicago Police Office of Professional 22 Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, dated October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), Burge and Yucaitis were administratively charged by the CPD for abusing Andrew Wilson in the manner found in the Report, and separation proceedings were initiated before the\nChicago Police Board. Cr 123543 (reopened).\n\n102. However, after secret communications with Corporation Counsel Kelly Welch, which the City still refuses to produce, Martin refused to accept or adopt the Goldston findings, open any additional criminal or administrative investigations into the numerous allegations of Area 2 torture, to commission additional investigation into the alleged systemic pattern and practice of torture, or to discipline or seek criminal charges against any of the named officers, but rather contacted the Police Foundation in order to have them evaluate the methodology used by Goldston in arriving at his findings. Martin Letter to Williams, 11/8/91; City Privilege Log.\n\n103. During this time period, community groups, including Citizen\u2019s Alert, by letters and in face to face meetings, were demanding that Martin release the results of the OPS investigation into torture at Area 2. Powers Letter to Martin, 8/14/91.\n\n104. Instead, Martin, through his lawyers at the Corporation Counsel\u2019s Office, fought production and public release of the Goldston Report and its findings. See, generally, proceedings in Fallon v. Dillon, 90 C 6722.\n\n105. In November of 1991, after Defendant Martin and Corporation Counsel Kelly\nWelsh had initiated proceedings before the Police Board to fire Burge, Yucaitis and O\u2019Hara for torturing Andrew Wilson, Mayor Daley \u201cdefended his decision not to take action against the officers when he was state\u2019s attorney in 1982, explaining that . . [Wilson] refused to cooperate with his office at that time.\u201d Chicago Tribune, 11/26/91 \u201c3 Cops Face Hearing in Torture Case.\u201d 23\n\n106. On or about February 7, 1992, the Goldston and Sanders were publicly released, over the City\u2019s strenuous objection, pursuant to the order of Judge Milton Shadur in the case of Fallon v. Dillon, #90-C-6722.\n\n107. In an article which appeared in the February 8, 1992 Chicago Tribune,\nSuperintendent Leroy Martin, whgo was one of the previous Area 2 Commanders, was quoted as saying that it was an \u201coutright lie\u201d that Area 2 commanders knew about or condoned torture.

The testimony reveals an astounding pattern or plan on the part of respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O\u2019Hara] to torture certain suspects, often with substantial criminal records, into confessing to crimes\nor to condone such activity. 24 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, p. 1.\n\n110. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, identified the \u201cseven\nadditional victims of torture tactics at Area II headquarters\u201d as Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes,\nGeorge Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree. Id., pp. 7-\n14.\n111. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission - - - that the similar acts\ntestimony of Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin,\nLeroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree\n[I]s highly probative of the modus operandi used or condoned in the torturing of suspects\nto elicit statements. Respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O\u2019Hara\u2019s] methods of torture\nthrough electric shock, bagging, and holding a gun to a suspect\u2019s head are more that\nsufficiently unique to establish a modus operandi for 404 b purposes. In addition, the\ntestimony establishes a pattern of and plan to torture these suspects in these similar ways\nto elicit confessions to violent crimes.\nId. p. 17.\n112. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin\nJones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and\nLawrence Poree:\nclearly establishes respondents\u2019 [Burge, Yucaitis and O\u2019Hara\u2019s] motive and intent in\ntorturing or condoning the torture of Wilson. Respondents generally engaged in these\nsimilar practices in order to coerce a confession to a serious crime.\nId. p. 22. 25\n113. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin\nJones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and\nLawrence Poree:\nshows the physical existence of one or more electric shock devices at Area II, prior to\nand subsequent to Wilson\u2019s arrest, and Burge\u2019s possession of and familiarity with the use\nof the devices. It is also admissible to show knowledge of that technique and of the\nbagging technique, about which respondents deny knowing, and the technique of putting\na gun to the head of a victim.\nId., p. 24.\n114. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission:\nThere is no question that the similarities between [Andrew] Wilson\u2019s testimony\nand the similar victims\u2019 testimony is more than sufficient to meet the 404 b standard.\nBurge was the main perpetrator of the torture in almost all of the cases, and, when he was\nnot the principal, he was still involved. In the case of all but one of the victims, the\nvictim was picked up and taken to Area II where he was then interrogated regarding his\nknowledge or involvement in a serious offense. Although Donald White was taken\ninstead to Area I, he was taken there and interrogated by Area II detectives. All of the\nvictims were black and generally had significant criminal histories.\nAlso similar was the way in which several victims were threatened with\nconsequences if they refused to make a statement. After an initial refusal, the\npunishment would begin and then would become stronger and more painful as the\nrefusals to speak persisted. The most striking similarities, however, are found in the\nmethods of torture used on the suspects. Wilson was electro shocked by Yucaitis using\nthe black box and by Burge who used the black box and a curling-iron looking device,\nwas \u201cbagged\u201d and beaten, and was threatened with a gun placed in his mouth. Jones,\nHolmes, Poree, Powell and Orange were similarly electro shocked by Burge. Holmes,\nPowell, White and Mumin were all \u201cbagged\u201d and beaten to the point where they lost or\nalmost lost consciousness. Burge pointed a cocked gun at Jones\u2019s head, hit Poree in the\nhead with a pistol, and placed a revolver containing one bullet at Mumin\u2019s head and\nsnapped it three times slowly. White had a gun placed in his mouth. Additionally, each\nof the victims was slapped around and punched.\nBurge\u2019s statements to the victims were also very similar. Burge told both Jones\nand Mumin that nobody would ever believe their word against his. As he did in relation\nto Wilson, he referred to the absence of marks on Mumin\u2019s body. He said \u201cfun time\u201d as 26\nhe approached Wilson and Poree with the black box, and laughed when he bagged\nMumin. He told Wilson he would \u201cfry his black ass\u201d and Jones he would \u201cblow his\nblack head off.\u201d\nAs the case law cited above aptly demonstrates, these actions or the condoning of\nthese actions are overwhelming in their similarity.\nId., pp. 25-26.\n115. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the\nfollowing judicial admission:\nGiven the similarities between the serious offenses charged and the offenses to which the\nsimilar victims will testify, there is no question that the offenses are close enough in time\nto be relevant to this case. Tak[ing] the offenses in sequence, they reveal a pattern of\nalmost identical acts of torture directed towards persons suspected of violent crimes.\nWhile the sequence spans twelve years, each offense is close enough to the next to\nconnect it to the relevant pattern of behavior. Moreover, Melvin Jones\u2019 and Donald\nWhite\u2019s testimony will demonstrate that they were tortured just days before Andrew\nWilson was tortured.\nId., p. 28.\n116. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:\nIndeed, as the testimony of the similar victims shows, respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and\nO\u2019Hara] counted on the fact that their testimony would be believed over that of a convict\nwhen they persisted in their pattern of torture.\nId., p. 28.\n117. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, Jon Burge, Patrick\nO\u2019Hara and John Yucaitis, 86-C-2360, entitled \u201cCity of Chicago\u2019s Memorandum in Response\nTo Plaintiff Andrew Wilson\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d the City, through its lawyers,\nmade the following judicial admission:\nPlaintiff Andrew Wilson has testified that he was beaten, kicked, punched, burned by\nbeing harnessed to a radiator, and repeatedly electro shocked on his hands, face, ears, and 27\nbetween his legs by defendant police officers. Plaintiff now seeks summary judgment that\nthis outrageous conduct, unsanctioned and condemned by the City, and for which\ndefendant officers were fired and/or disciplined, was within the defendants\u2019 scope of\nemployment.\nCity Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Wilson\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 1.\n118.

Plaintiff has failed to furnish any\nevidence to suggest that the instruments used by the officers to shock him - - -the black\nbox device and the modified curling iron - - were furnished by the City.\nId., p. 17.\n119. In its Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson\u2019s Motion for\nSummary Judgment,\u201d the City, through its lawyers, made the judicial admission that\nBurge \u201ccruelly torture[d]\u201d Andrew Wilson and \u201cdenie[d] him necessary medical\nassistance.\u201d\nId., p. 19.\n120. In this Memorandum, the City, through its lawyers, made the following admission\nconcerning it change of position from defending Burge for his alleged torture of Andrew Wilson\nto asserting that said torture was so outrageous as to be outside the scope of Burge\u2019s\nemployment: \u201cThe change in the City\u2019s position was the result of inquiries undertaken by the\nCity in good faith and in the public interest.\u201d Id. p. 12.\n121. On July 30, 1992, almost two years after Superintendent Martin had first received\nthe Goldston findings, the Police Foundation submitted its report to Superintendent of Police\nMatt Rodriguez. After noting that because \u201changings, shockings, \u2018baggings\u2019 beatings, chokings,\nand beatings were alleged to occur, many in the Area 2 Headquarters itself, a thorough and\nrigorous investigation seemed required,\u201d and that it passed no judgment as to whether the torture\nalleged had in fact took place, the Report criticized Goldston\u2019s methodology.

In U.S. ex. rel. Maxwell v. Gilmore, 1999 WL 130331 (N.D.Ill.) at *14; Judge\nShadur stated the following in his decision:\nIt is now common knowledge that in the early to mid-1980s Chicago Police Commander\nJon Burge and many officers working under him regularly engaged in the physical abuse 33\nand torture of prisoners to extract confessions. Both internal police accounts and\nnumerous lawsuits and appeals brought by suspects alleging such abuse substantiate that\nthose beatings and other means of torture occurred as an established practice, not just on\nan isolated basis.\n150.

Dr. Kirschner further testified that in his opinion there was a pattern and practice\nof torture at Area 2 and later at Area 3 Headquarters under the command of Jon Burge, and that\nthis opinion was based, inter alia, on his evaluations of several alleged Area 2 and 3 torture 71\nvictims, including Andrew Wilson, Darrell Cannon, Leroy Orange and Marcus Wiggins,\ndiscussions with Chicago detectives who acknowledged that there was police torture at Area 2,\nthe fact that frequent allegations of electric shock, bagging, Russian Roulette only arose from\nArea 2 and later from Area 3 Headquarters while Jon Burge was the commander, and not\nagainst other officers in other station houses, and that the patterns and methodologies at Area 2\nand 3 under Burge and Byrne closely mirrored those which he observed, investigated, and\nevaluated in places such as Turkey and Israel. Id. at 5-6, 10-45, 57-59, 69, 80-81, 90-93, 96.\n347.

Brzeczek further averred that he made the following true and accurate statements\nto Chicago Tribune reporter Steve Mills which appeared in an April 29 2002 Chicago Tribune\narticle:\nTwenty years later, Brzeczek, now a defense attorney, said that there is \u2018no doubt in my\nmind\u2019 that Burge and his detectives tortured some suspects. The whole situation at Area 2\n[was] a disgrace and an embarrassment. It\u2019s time something is done about it,\u201d Brzeczek\nsaid, referring to the former Burnside station on the southside where most of the torture\nallegedly occurred.\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n349. Brzeczek further averred that \u201csubsequent to [his] resignation from the Chicago\nPolice Department, [he] monitored litigation initiated by persons making claims and/or\nallegations regarding torture sustained at the hands of police officers at Detective Division Area\n2. [He] further monitored the prosecution of certain police officers previously assigned to Area 2\nbased on allegations of torture and other improper treatment of prisoners under their control 72\nbefore the Chicago police Board. [He] also monitored media coverage of allegations and legal\nactions arising out of allegations of torture and other improper treatment brought by persons\nagainst police officers assigned to Detective Division Area 2.\u201d Id., \u00b6 10.\n350. Brzeczek further averred that \u201cbased on the fact that allegations continued to arise\nalleging torture and other improper treatment occurring at a time after [he] left the Chicago\nPolice Department on April 29, 1983, and based upon the fact that Richard M. Daley, State\u2019s\nAttorney of Cook County, did not conduct (or at least affiant is not aware of any such action),\nany investigation into the allegations brought to his attention by the affiant in the letter as\naforesaid, affiant was and is convinced that some persons held in custody at Area 2 had to be\ntortured.\u201d Id., \u00b611.\n351. In his affidavit, Brzeczek further averred that \u201cbased on the sheer number of the\nallegations, the findings of the courts in certain litigation brought against officers assigned to the\nDetective Division Area 2, and the fact that police officers were discharged and/or suspended for\ntheir roles in allegations made against them for the improper treatment of prisoners while\nassigned to Detective Division Area 2, the affiant was and is convinced that some persons were\ntortured while in custody at Detective Division Area 2.\u201d Id., \u00b612.\n352.

And its, do you acknowledge - - -\nA: Including, including the Chicago Police Department.\nCity Council Hearing, Committee on Police, Fire an Municipal Institutions, Public\nHearing on Police Brutality, Day 5, October 11, 1989, p. 285.\n357. On October 11, 1989, Police Superintendent Leroy Martin testified before the\nChicago City Council and gave the following answers to the following question by Alderman\nCaldwell:\nQ: One final question, Superintendent, and this was asked of Dr. Fogel on\nnumerous occasions.

On or about October 19, 1987, OPS Director Fogel sent a document entitled\n\u201cProposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,\u201d to the Mayor of the City of Chicago\nin which he wrote:\nBy accepting all cases, even erring on the liberal side, to be accommodative to the\npublic, OPS gives the appearance of moving forward on all complaints. The opposite\noccurs. The appearance of doing a thorough investigation with full due process\nand endless unnecessary reviews for all, actually operates to immunize police\nfrom internal discipline, increases their overtime, leads to an enormous \u201cpaper storm\u201d\nand has institutionalized lying.\n\u201cProposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,\u201d October 19, 1987, p. 2.\n359. [Deleted]\n360. In Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d 985, (7th Cir. 1987) the Seventh Circuit 76\nCourt of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict against Area 2 Violent Crimes detectives, supervisors\nand commanding officers, including detectives James Houtsma, Dennis McGuire, John McCabe,\nand Raymond McNally, Sgt. Alvin Palmer, Lt. Griffith, and Commander Milton Deas, for\nconspiracy to \u201crailroad\u201d 18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating:\nWe cannot say that the jury acted unreasonably in finding that all of the\nindividual defendants were voluntary participants in a common venture to\nrailroad George Jones.\nJones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d at 992.\n361. In Jones v. City of Chicago, the Seventh Circuit affirmed a jury verdict against the\nCity of Chicago for maintaining a \u201cstreet files\u201dcustom or policy which led to the railroading of\n18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating:\nThe custom in question is the maintenance of the \"street files,\" police\nfiles withheld from the state's attorney and therefore unavailable as a\nsource of exculpatory information that might induce him not to prosecute\nor, failing that, would at least be available to defense counsel under\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). As\nwe noted recently, information undermining the credibility of a government\nwitness is within the scope of Brady's rule. See United States v.\nHerrera-Medina, 853 F.2d 564, slip op. at 5 (7th Cir. 1988).\nAlthough the lawfulness of the street-files practice has never been\nadjudicated, the City, which has abandoned the practice, does not challenge\nthe jury's implicit finding that it denied criminal defendants due process\nof law. Brady v. Maryland does not require the police to keep written\nrecords of all their investigatory activities; but attempts to circumvent\nthe rule of that case by retaining records in clandestine files\ndeliberately concealed from prosecutors and defense counsel cannot be\ntolerated. The City sensibly does not attempt to defend such behavior in\nthis court.\nThere is little doubt that the clandestine character of the street files\nplayed a role in Jones's misfortunes. Cf. Harris v. City of Pagedale, 821\nF.2d 499, 507 (8th Cir. 1987). If the state's attorney had had [*996]\naccess to them, he would have discovered memos by Kelly and especially by\nLaverty that would have given any prosecutor pause. Alternatively, defense 77\ncounsel would have obtained them prior to trial and the trial would have\nended even sooner than it did. The only question is whether this custom was\na custom of the City of Chicago. As the custom was department-wide\nand of long standing, the jury was entitled to conclude that it had been\nconsciously approved at the highest policy-making level for decisions\ninvolving the police department -- the standard suggested by the recent\nplurality opinion in City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 108 S.\nCt. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988). See also Stokes v. Bullins, 844 F.2d 269,\n273 (5th Cir. 1988).\nJones, 856 F. 2d at 995.\n362. Jerry Mahaffey testified at his motion to suppress hearing in February of 1984 that\nhe was arrested in his apartment at 11216 S.

Judge Duff, the Judge in Wilson v. City of Chicago, ruled that Burge\u2019s name could\nnot be used by Porch before the jury; hence Porch referred to Burge as Sergeant X in his Wilson\ntestimony. Wilson v. City of Chicago, 6/27/89, pp. 1874-92.\n384. Timothy Thompson testified at his motion to suppress hearing on May 24, 1984 that\nhe was arrested by Jon Burge and other officers on September 29, 1979, he was choked and hit\nin the eye by one of the arresting officers at the time he was arrested, that he was taken in a\nsquad car by Burge and another Area 2 detective to the police station at 90th and Cottage Grove,\nand he was questioned by Burge and this detective at the police station People v.

In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators further wrote: 113\nRecent news articles and publicly released documents and depositions reveal that the\nOPS reopened nine torture investigations in 1992 and 1993 as a result of prior OPS\nfindings that physical abuse of African American suspects at Area 2 from 1973 to 1986\nincluded \"psychological techniques and planned torture,\" was \"systematic,\" and\n\"methodical,\" and that Area 2 command members, particularly Jon Burge, \"were aware\nof the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or\nfailing to take any action to bring it to an end.\" Goldston Report, pp 2-3. The now public\nevidence further reveals that OPS investigators Tillman, Lawrence, and Cosey conducted\nthorough investigations in each of these cases, discovered new evidence not available\nduring the initial investigations, and sustained findings in six of the cases. The sustained\nfindings included findings that victims were electric shocked, suffocated with a plastic\nbag, suspended in air by their handcuffs, beaten and stomped, and racially abused. The\nevidence further shows that these sustained findings were entered against several police\nofficers who were and are still Chicago police officers in good standing, most notably\nLieutenant Peter Dignan, who had allegations of torture and abuse sustained against him\nin five of the six cases. The evidence further reveals that these findings and the\ninvestigative files were tendered to OPS Director Gayle Shines in 1994 for her review,\nand that she overturned the findings in four of the cases in late 1994 and early 1995, at\nthe same time that Peter Dignan was nominated by the Mayor and the Department for\nmerit promotion to Lieutenant. Ms. Shines has admitted that in the approximately 2500\nsustained cases which she reviewed during her eight year career as Director, she\noverturned a total of 10 cases, including these four against Dignan.\nThe evidence further shows that in the other two cases, Darrell Cannon and Stanley\nHoward, Ms. Shines never completed her review of the sustained findings of torture, but\nrather kept these files in her office for four years, together with the other seven files.\nCannon, who was on trial in a murder case, and Howard, who is on death row, sought\nthese files by subpoena, but Shines and the Department failed to produce these files,\nwhich contained highly exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, after Ms. Shines left the OPS\nin 1998, counsel to the Superintendent, Thomas Needham, obtained the nine torture files\nfrom the OPS and, without consultation with the Superintendent, summarily reversed the\nsustained findings and closed the cases. Needham, who, as a longtime assistant state\u2019s\nattorney, was closely connected to the prosecution of several torture victims, including\nCannon, admitted that his summary reversals of the torture findings were not based on\nthe merits of the cases, but rather on the fact that the files had languished in Shines\u2019\noffice for so long a period of time. The Superintendent never reviewed these cases on the\nmerits as he is required by police procedure to do, and he only learned of his counsel\u2019s\nunjustifiable actions by reading about them in a February 1999 Chicago Tribune article.\nAdditionally, the public evidence reveals that the OPS failed to investigate numerous\nadditional documented cases of police torture against African American suspects. In the\ncase of Melvin Jones, Mary Powers of Citizen\u2019s Alert specifically requested by a letter\ndated July 26, 1989 that the OPS open an investigation into the recently revealed\nallegations that Jones was electric shocked at by Jon Burge and several other Area 2\ndetectives who remain on the force to this day. Contrary to police and OPS procedure, no\ninvestigation was ever opened, despite the fact that the City has subsequently admitted in 114\nofficial court papers that Jones was in fact tortured. Similarly, in the Shadeed Mumin\ncase, an investigation was opened and OPS investigators developed compelling new\nevidence that he was tortured by Burge and an unidentified detective. Just as the OPS\ninvestigator was about to identify this officer, the OPS discontinued the investigation,\nsupposedly because the investigation had not been assigned a complaint register number.\nIn numerous other cases, including Aaron Patterson and nine other men who are\npresently on death row as a result of confessions which they allege were tortured from\nthem, the OPS has failed to conduct any investigation whatsoever into these most serious\nallegations.\nId.\n589. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators made the following demands:\n1. Given Ms. Shines\u2019 clear misconduct, lack of objectivity, and failure to complete her\nreview of the Cannon and Howard sustained findings, that new OPS Director, Callie\nBaird, conduct an independent review on the merits of the six sustained torture\ncases;\n2. If Ms. Baird concurs with one or more of the sustained findings, that the\nSuperintendent fully and fairly review those findings on the merits, as he is required by\npolice procedure to do;\n3. That counsel Thomas Needham be disqualified from any role in reviewing or\notherwise participating in any torture investigations;\n4. That Peter Dignan and any other active officers against whom torture findings were\nentered by OPS investigators be suspended pending complete review;\n5. That the department and its OPS open an investigation into the allegations that Melvin\nJones was electric shocked by Jon Burge and other still active detectives and consider\nin making its findings that the City has admitted that Jones was in fact tortured;\n6. That the Department and its OPS reopen and complete the Shadeed Mumin\ninvestigation;\n7. That the Department and its OPS open investigations into the other numerous\ndocumented cases of police torture, as listed in the Appendix attached hereto,\nincluding those allegations made by men on death row;\n8. That the Department commission an independent investigation into the serious\nviolations of departmental rules and court process by high ranking police and OPS\nofficials, including Thomas Needham and Gayle Shines;\n9. That the Department and the OPS Director meet with representatives from the\nundersigned groups and discuss these proposals and to periodically report on the\nprogress of these investigations;\n10.That these investigations and findings be subject to public scrutiny.\nId. 115\n590. In the August 2, 1999, from Citizens Alert, the signators set forth the following cases\nfor Director Baird\u2019s Review:\nDarrell Cannon CR#134723\nStanley Howard CR# 142017\nGregory Banks CR# 188617\nDavid Bates CR# 188617\nLee Holmes CR# 126802\nPhilip Adkins CR# 142201\nThomas Craft CR# 200390\nId.\n591. In the August 2, 1999, letter, the signators listed the following cases to be Opened8\nby OPS:\nMelvin Jones TyShaun Ross\nShadeed Mumin Derrick King\nAaron Patterson Michael Coleman\nLeonard Hinton Sylvester Green\nLeroy Orange Paul Mike\nAlonzo Smith Walter Johnson\nLeonard Hinton Roy Brown\nLeroy Orange Eric Smith\nJerry Mahaffey Franklin Burchette\nReginald Mahaffey Vincent Wade\nJames Cody Willie Porch\nLenard Kidd Raymond Golden\nLonza Holmes Tony Thompson\nMichael Tillman Timothy Thompson\nStephen Bell\nAndrew Maxwell\nMadison Hobley\nRonald Kitchen\nId.\n592. Superintendent Hillard subsequently met with representatives from the signators of\nthe August 2, 1999 Citizens Alert letter.\n593. Other than Hillard\u2019s meeting with representatives from the signators of the August\n2, 1999 Citizens Alert letter, no action was taken on any of the demands made in the letter. 116\n594. In an e mail dated 1/10/02, Corporation Counsel Mara S. Georges wrote to her\nassistant: \u201cSheila O\u2019Grady would like us to explore bringing an action against Burge. Will you\nplease think about it and give us your thoughts?\u201d \u201cNew documents Report that City Considered\nSuing Burge, City continues Paying For Fired Commander\u2019s Legal Defense,\u201d NBC 5.com.,\n4/29/04.\n595. On January 1, 2002, Sheila O\u2019Grady was Mayor Daley\u2019s Chief of Staff. Id.\n596. In response, Jeffrey Given, Georges\u2019 assistant, wrote that suing Burge \u201cwould\nseem to undercut our ability to defend [against the inmates\u2019] suit by challenging the underlying\nfacts . . .\u201d \u201cCity Considered Suing Burge; Officials Weighed Their Options to Fight Growing\nUproar over Torture Allegations Against the Fired Police Commander,\u201d Chicago Tribune,\n4/29/04.\n597. Mindful that the torture allegations were gaining new momentum, Given and\nGeorges also considered mounting a public relations campaign to counter continuing negative\npublicity about Burge and the City\u2019s role in the torture scandal. Id.\n598. Given and Georges recognized that the campaign would not be easy for a wide\nvariety of reasons, including that some of Burge\u2019s men were still on the police force, the\ndepartment had been embarrassed by Needham\u2019s unilateral shelving of the OPS torture\ninvestigations despite the investigators\u2019 sustained findings, and that the Tribune\u2019s then recent\nseries on the continuing CPD practice of obtaining false confessions had again focused attention\non the issue, and Given further stated \u201cbut query how we\u2019ll do in the court of public opinion\nafter a long, public, expensive and embarrassing discovery process?\u201d NBC5.com; Chicago\nTribune.\n599. Instead of suing Burge, or otherwise distancing the City from him, the City decided 117\nto invest unlimited public funds in representing Burge and at least thirty-five other Area 2\ndetectives accused of torture and abuse in the four torture cases and to fight production and\npublic disclosure of additional documents that would further expose the City\u2019s central role in the\ntorture scandal in civil and criminal cases and with the Special Prosecutor. Id.\n600. On August 27, 2004 in his sworn testimony before the Prisoner Review Board,\nformer Area 2 Commander and Superintendent Leroy Martin falsely denied that he did not have\ncontemporaneous knowledge of the allegations of torture and abuse against Jon Burge and other\nArea 2 detectives while he was Commander. Tr. of 8/27/04 Parole Revocation Hearing of Darrell\nCannon.\n601. In her concurring opinion in Hinton v. Uchtman (sub. nom.)___F 3d ___ (7th Cir.\n2005), Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Diane Wood found:\n[T]he claim Hinton has made regarding his confession illustrates dramatically the\nhigh price our system of criminal justice pays when police abuse runs rampant: a\ncloud hangs over everything that the bad actors touched . . . [A] mountain of\nevidence indicates that torture was an ordinary occurrence at the Area Two station\nof the Chicago Police Department during the exact time period pertinent to\nHinton's case. Eventually, as this sorry tale came to light, the Office of\nProfessional Standards Investigation of the Police Department looked into the\nallegations, and it issued a report that concluded that police torture under the\ncommand of Lt. Jon Burge \u2014 the officer in charge of Hinton's case \u2014 had been a\nregular part of the system for more than ten years. And, in language reminiscent\nof the news reports of 2004 concerning the notorious Abu Ghraib facility in Iraq,\nthe report said that \"[t]he type of abuse described was not limited to the usual\nbeating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and\nplanned torture.\" The report detailed specific cases, such as the case of Andrew\nWilson, who was taken to Area Two on February 14, 1982. There a group led by\nBurge beat Wilson, stuffed a bag over his head, handcuffed him to a radiator, and\nrepeatedly administered electric shocks to his ears, nose, and genitals. See People\nv. Wilson, 506 N.E.2d 571 (Ill. 1987). Burge eventually lost his job with the\npolice, though not until 1992. See In the Matter of the Charges Filed Against Jon\nBurge, No. 91-1856 (Chicago Police Board, February 11, 1993). To this day,\nBurge has not been prosecuted for any of these actions, though it appears that he\nat least thinks that he may still be at some risk of prosecution. See, for example, 118\n\"Cop brutality probe must be thorough, fair,\" Chi. Sun-Times, May 16, 2002\n(editorial); Hal Dardick, \"Burge repeatedly takes 5th; Former police commander\nstays mum on torture questions,\" Chi. Tribune, Sept. 2, 2004 (noting allegations\nthat Burge or people reporting to him had tortured 108 Black and Latino suspects\nbetween August 1972 and September 1991). . . .\nBehavior like that attributed to Burge imposes a huge cost on society: it\ncreates distrust of the police generally, despite the fact that most police officers\nwould abhor such tactics, and it creates a cloud over even the valid convictions in\nwhich the problem officer played a role. Indeed, the alleged conduct is so\nextreme that, if proven, it would fall within the prohibitions established by the\nUnited Nations Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), which defines torture as\n\"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is\nintentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a\nthird person information or a confession . . .,\" thereby violating the fundamental\nhuman rights principles that the United States is committed to uphold. . . .Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1518278", "artist_names": "Terry McDermott", "full_title": "I Want To Know What Love Is by\u00a0Terry\u00a0McDermott", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/bd677a875539abd92bab6da1c082596c.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bd677a875539abd92bab6da1c082596c.500x500x1.jpg", "id": 1518278, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429893959, "path": "/Terry-mcdermott-i-want-to-know-what-love-is-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Terry-mcdermott-i-want-to-know-what-love-is-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2012, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "2012", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "2012", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/bd677a875539abd92bab6da1c082596c.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bd677a875539abd92bab6da1c082596c.500x500x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "I Want To Know What Love Is", "title_with_featured": "I Want To Know What Love Is", "updated_by_human_at": 1554980182, "url": "https://genius.com/Terry-mcdermott-i-want-to-know-what-love-is-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/26089", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "id": 26089, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "index_character": "t", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Terry McDermott", "slug": "Terry-mcdermott", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Terry-mcdermott"}, "artist": "Terry McDermott", "lyrics": "I Want To Know What Love Is LyricsI gotta take a little time\nA little time to think things over\nI better read between the lines\nIn case I need it when I'm older\nNow this mountain I must climb\nFeels like a world upon my shoulders\nI through the clouds I see love shine\nIt keeps me warm as life grows colder\nIn my life there's been heartache and pain\nI don't know if I can face it again\nCan't stop now, I've traveled so far\nTo change this lonely life\nI wanna know what love is\nI want you to show me\nI wanna feel what love is\nI know you can show me\nI'm gonna take a little time\nA little time to look around me\nI've got nowhere left to hide\nIt looks like love has finally found me\nIn my life there's been heartache and pain\nI don't know if I can face it again\nI can't stop now, I've traveled so far\nTo change this lonely life\nI wanna know what love is\nI want you to show me\nI wanna feel what love is\nI know you can show me\nI wanna know what love is\nI want you to show me\nAnd I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is\nAnd I know, I know you can show me\nLet's talk about love\nI wanna know what love is, the love that you feel inside\nI want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love\nI wanna feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide\nI know you can show me, yeah\nI wanna know what love is, let's talk about love\nI want you to show me, I wanna feel it too\nI wanna feel what love is, I want to feel it too\nAnd I know and I know, I know you can show me\nShow me love is real, yeah\nI wanna know what love is...You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 12, "api_path": "/songs/100500", "artist_names": "Wiz Khalifa (Ft.

Each 'new recruit' whom the Verdurins failed to persuade that the evenings spent by other people, in other houses than theirs, were as dull as ditch-water, saw himself banished forthwith. Women being in this respect more rebellious than men, more reluctant to lay aside all worldly curiosity and the desire to find out for themselves whether other drawing-rooms might not sometimes be as entertaining, and the Verdurins feeling, moreover, that this critical spirit and this demon of frivolity might, by their contagion, prove fatal to the orthodoxy of the little church, they had been obliged to expel, one after another, all those of the 'faithful' who were of the female sex\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from the doctor's young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively that season (for all that Mme. Verdurin herself was a thoroughly 'good' woman, and came of a respectable middle-class family, excessively rich and wholly undistinguished, with which she had gradually and of her own accord severed all connection) to a young woman almost of a 'certain class,' a Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy, whom Mme. Verdurin called by her Christian name, Odette, and pronounced a 'love,' and to the pianist's aunt, who looked as though she had, at one period, 'answered the bell': ladies quite ignorant of the world, who in their social simplicity were so easily led to believe that the Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse de Guermantes were obliged to pay large sums of money to other poor wretches, in order to have anyone at their dinner-parties, that if somebody had offered to procure them an invitation to the house of either of those great dames, the old doorkeeper and the woman of 'easy virtue' would have contemptuously declined\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verdurins never invited you to dinner; you had your 'place laid' there. There was never any programme for the evening's entertainment. The young pianist would play, but only if he felt inclined, for no one was forced to do anything, and, as M. Verdurin used to say: \"We're all friends here. Liberty Hall, you know!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the pianist suggested playing the Ride of the Valkyries, or the Prelude to Tristan, Mme. Verdurin would protest, not that the music was displeasing to her, but, on the contrary, that it made too violent an impression. \"Then you want me to have one of my headaches? You know quite well, it's the same every time he plays that. I know what I'm in for. Tomorrow, when I want to get up\u2014nothing doing!\" If he was not going to play they talked, and one of the friends\u2014usually the painter who was in favour there that year\u2014would \"spin,\" as M. Verdurin put it, \"a damned funny yarn that made 'em all split with laughter,\" and especially Mme. Verdurin, for whom\u2014so strong was her habit of taking literally the figurative accounts of her emotions\u2014Dr. Cottard, who was then just starting in general practice, would \"really have to come one day and set her jaw, which she had dislocated with laughing too much.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Evening dress was barred, because you were all 'good pals,' and didn't want to look like the 'boring people' who were to be avoided like the plague, and only asked to the big evenings, which were given as seldom as possible, and then only if it would amuse the painter or make the musician better known. The rest of the time you were quite happy playing charades and having supper in fancy dress, and there was no need to mingle any strange element with the little 'clan.'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But just as the 'good pals' came to take a more and more prominent place in Mme. Verdurin's life, so the 'bores,' the 'nuisances' grew to include everybody and everything that kept her friends away from her, that made them sometimes plead 'previous engagements,' the mother of one, the professional duties of another, the 'little place in the country' of a third. If Dr. Cottard felt bound to say good night as soon as they rose from table, so as to go back to some patient who was seriously ill; \"I don't know,\" Mme. Verdurin would say, \"I'm sure it will do him far more good if you don't go disturbing him again this evening; he will have a good night without you; to-morrow morning you can go round early and you will find him cured.\" From the beginning of December it would make her quite ill to think that the 'faithful' might fail her on Christmas and New Year's Days. The pianist's aunt insisted that he must accompany her, on the latter, to a family dinner at her mother's\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You don't suppose she'll die, your mother,\" exclaimed Mme. Verdurin bitterly, \"if you don't have dinner with her on New Year's Day, like people in the provinces!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her uneasiness was kindled again in Holy Week: \"Now you, Doctor, you're a sensible, broad-minded man; you'll come, of course, on Good Friday, just like any other day?\" she said to Cottard in the first year of the little 'nucleus,' in a loud and confident voice, as though there could be no doubt of his answer. But she trembled as she waited for it, for if he did not come she might find herself condemned to dine alone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I shall come on Good Friday\u2014to say good-bye to you, for we are going to spend the holidays in Auvergne.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In Auvergne? To be eaten by fleas and all sorts of creatures! A fine lot of good that will do you!\" And after a solemn pause: \"If you had only told us, we would have tried to get up a party, and all gone there together, comfortably.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, too, if one of the 'faithful' had a friend, or one of the ladies a young man, who was liable, now and then, to make them miss an evening, the Verdurins, who were not in the least afraid of a woman's having a lover, provided that she had him in their company, loved him in their company and did not prefer him to their company, would say: \"Very well, then, bring your friend along.\" And he would be put to the test, to see whether he was willing to have no secrets from Mme. Verdurin, whether he was susceptible of being enrolled in the 'little clan.' If he failed to pass, the faithful one who had introduced him would be taken on one side, and would be tactfully assisted to quarrel with the friend or mistress. But if the test proved satisfactory, the newcomer would in turn be numbered among the 'faithful.' And so when, in the course of this same year, the courtesan told M. Verdurin that she had made the acquaintance of such a charming gentleman, M. Swann, and hinted that he would very much like to be allowed to come, M. Verdurin carried the request at once to his wife. He never formed an opinion on any subject until she had formed hers, his special duty being to carry out her wishes and those of the 'faithful' generally, which he did with boundless ingenuity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dear, Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy has something to say to you. She would like to bring one of her friends here, a M. Swann. What do you say?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, as if anybody could refuse anything to a little piece of perfection like that. Be quiet; no one asked your opinion. I tell you that you are a piece of perfection.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just as you like,\" replied Odette, in an affected tone, and then went on: \"You know I'm not fishing for compliments.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Very well; bring your friend, if he's nice.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now there was no connection whatsoever between the 'little nucleus' and the society which Swann frequented, and a purely worldly man would have thought it hardly worth his while, when occupying so exceptional a position in the world, to seek an introduction to the Verdurins. But Swann was so ardent a lover that, once he had got to know almost all the women of the aristocracy, once they had taught him all that there was to learn, he had ceased to regard those naturalisation papers, almost a patent of nobility, which the Faubourg Saint-Germain had bestowed upon him, save as a sort of negotiable bond, a letter of credit with no intrinsic value, which allowed him to improvise a status for himself in some little hole in the country, or in some obscure quarter of Paris, where the good-looking daughter of a local squire or solicitor had taken his fancy. For at such times desire, or love itself, would revive in him a feeling of vanity from which he was now quite free in his everyday life, although it was, no doubt, the same feeling which had originally prompted him towards that career as a man of fashion in which he had squandered his intellectual gifts upon frivolous amusements, and had made use of his erudition in matters of art only to advise society ladies what pictures to buy and how to decorate their houses; and this vanity it was which made him eager to shine, in the sight of any fair unknown who had captivated him for the moment, with a brilliance which the name of Swann by itself did not emit. And he was most eager when the fair unknown was in humble circumstances. Just as it is not by other men of intelligence that an intelligent man is afraid of being thought a fool, so it is not by the great gentleman but by boors and 'bounders' that a man of fashion is afraid of finding his social value underrated. Three-fourths of the mental ingenuity displayed, of the social falsehoods scattered broadcast ever since the world began by people whose importance they have served only to diminish, have been aimed at inferiors. And Swann, who behaved quite simply and was at his ease when with a duchess, would tremble^ for fear of being despised, and would instantly begin to pose, were he to meet her grace's maid\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike so many people, who, either from lack of energy or else from a resigned sense of the obligation laid upon them by their social grandeur to remain moored like houseboats to a certain point on the bank of the stream of life, abstain from the pleasures which are offered to them above and below that point, that degree in life in which they will remain fixed until the day of their death, and are content, in the end, to describe as pleasures, for want of any better, those mediocre distractions, that just not intolerable tedium which is enclosed there with them; Swann would endeavour not to find charm and beauty in the women with whom he must pass time, but to pass his time among women whom he had already found to be beautiful and charming. And these were, as often as not, women whose beauty was of a distinctly 'common' type, for the physical qualities which attracted him instinctively, and without reason, were the direct opposite of those that he admired in the women painted or sculptured by his favourite masters. Depth of character, or a melancholy expression on a woman's face would freeze his senses, which would, however, immediately melt at the sight of healthy, abundant, rosy human flesh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If on his travels he met a family whom it would have been more correct for him to make no attempt to know, but among whom a woman caught his eye, adorned with a special charm that was new to him, to remain on his 'high horse' and to cheat the desire that she had kindled in him, to substitute a pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in her company by writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come and join him, would have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication in the face of life, as stupid a renunciation of a new form of happiness as if, instead of visiting the country where he was, he had shut himself up in his own rooms and looked at 'views' of Paris. He did not immure himself in the solid structure of his social relations, but had made of them, so as to be able to set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman might take his fancy, one of those collapsible tents which explorers carry about with them. Any part of it which was not portable or could not be adapted to some fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless, however enviable it might appear to others. How often had his credit with a duchess, built up of the yearly accumulation of her desire to do him some favour for which she had never found an opportunity, been squandered in a moment by his calling upon her, in an indiscreetly worded message, for a recommendation by telegraph which would put him in touch at once with one of her agents whose daughter he had noticed in the country, just as a starving man might barter a diamond for a crust of bread. Indeed, when it was too late, he would laugh at himself for it, for there was in his nature, redeemed by many rare refinements, an element of clownishness. Then he belonged to that class of intelligent men who have led a life of idleness, and who seek consolation and, perhaps, an excuse in the idea, which their idleness offers to their intelligence, of objects as worthy of their interest as any that could be attained by art or learning, the idea that 'Life' contains situations more interesting and more romantic than all the romances ever written. So, at least, he would assure and had no difficulty in persuading the more subtle among his friends in the fashionable world, notably the Baron de Charlus, whom he liked to amuse with stories of the startling adventures that had befallen him, such as when he had met a woman in the train, and had taken her home with him, before discovering that she was the sister of a reigning monarch, in whose hands were gathered, at that moment, all the threads of European politics, of which he found himself kept informed in the most delightful fashion, or when, in the complexity of circumstances, it depended upon the choice which the Conclave was about to make whether he might or might not become the lover of somebody's cook\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals and academicians, to whom he was bound by such close ties, that Swann compelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders. All his friends were accustomed to receive, from time to time, letters which called on them for a word of recommendation or introduction, with a diplomatic adroitness which, persisting throughout all his successive 'affairs' and using different pretexts, revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest indiscretion, a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest. I used often to recall to myself when, many years later, I began to take an interest in his character because of the similarities which, in wholly different respects, it offered to my own, how, when he used to write to my grandfather (though not at the time we are now considering, for it was about the date of my own birth that Swann's great 'affair' began, and made a long interruption in his amatory practices) the latter, recognising his friend's handwriting on the envelope, would exclaim: \"Here is Swann asking for something; on guard!\" And, either from distrust or from the unconscious spirit of devilry which urges us to offer a thing only to those who do not want it, my grandparents would meet with an obstinate refusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers, as when he begged them for an introduction to a girl who dined with us every Sunday, and whom they were obliged, whenever Swann mentioned her, to pretend that they no longer saw, although they would be wondering, all through the week, whom they could invite to meet her, and often failed, in the end, to find anyone, sooner than make a sign to him who would so gladly have accepted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally a couple of my grandparents' acquaintance, who had been complaining for some time that they never saw Swann now, would announce with satisfaction, and perhaps with a slight inclination to make my grandparents envious of them, that he had suddenly become as charming as he could possibly be, and was never out of their house. My grandfather would not care to shatter their pleasant illusion, but would look at my grandmother, as he hummed the air of:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  What is this mystery?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I cannot understand it;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or of:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Vision fugitive...;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  In matters such as this\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'Tis best to close one's eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann's new friend \"What about Swann? Do you still see as much of him as ever?\" the other's face would lengthen: \"Never mention his name to me again!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I thought that you were such friends...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins of my grandmother, dining almost every evening at their house. Suddenly, and without any warning, he ceased to appear. They supposed him to be ill, and the lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him when, in her kitchen, she found a letter in his hand, which her cook had left by accident in the housekeeping book. In this he announced that he was leaving Paris and would not be able to come to the house again. The cook had been his mistress, and at the moment of breaking off relations she was the only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary to inform\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But when his mistress for the time being was a woman in society, or at least one whose birth was not so lowly, nor her position so irregular that he was unable to arrange for her reception in 'society,' then for her sake he would return to it, but only to the particular orbit in which she moved or into which he had drawn her. \"No good depending on Swann for this evening,\" people would say; \"don't you remember, it's his American's night at the Opera?\" He would secure invitations for her to the most exclusive drawing-rooms, to those houses where he himself went regularly, for weekly dinners or for poker; every evening, after a slight 'wave' imparted to his stiffly brushed red locks had tempered with a certain softness the ardour of his bold green eyes, he would select a flower for his buttonhole and set out to meet his mistress at the house of one or other of the women of his circle; and then, thinking of the affection and admiration which the fashionable folk, whom he always treated exactly as he pleased, would, when he met them there, lavish upon him in the presence of the woman whom he loved, he would find a fresh charm in that worldly existence of which he had grown weary, but whose substance, pervaded and warmly coloured by the flickering light which he had slipped into its midst, seemed to him beautiful and rare, now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But while each of these attachments, each of these flirtations had been the realisation, more or less complete, of a dream born of the sight of a face or a form which Swann had spontaneously, and without effort on his part, found charming, it was quite another matter when, one day at the theatre, he was introduced to Odette de Cr\u00e9cy by an old friend of his own, who had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom he might very possibly come to an understanding; but had made her out to be harder of conquest than she actually was, so as to appear to be conferring a special favour by the introduction. She had struck Swann not, certainly, as being devoid of beauty, but as endowed with a style of beauty which left him indifferent, which aroused in him no desire, which gave him, indeed, a sort of physical repulsion; as one of those women of whom every man can name some, and each will name different examples, who are the converse of the type which our senses demand. To give him any pleasure her profile was too sharp, her skin too delicate, her cheek-bones too prominent, her features too tightly drawn. Her eyes were fine, but so large that they seemed to be bending beneath their own weight, strained the rest of her face and always made her appear unwell or in an ill humour. Some time after this introduction at the theatre she had written to ask Swann whether she might see his collections, which would interest her so much, she, \"an ignorant woman with a taste for beautiful things,\" saying that she would know him better when once she had seen him in his 'home,' where she imagined him to be \"so comfortable with his tea and his books\"; although she had not concealed her surprise at his being in that part of the town, which must be so depressing, and was \"not nearly smart enough for such a very smart man.\" And when he allowed her to come she had said to him as she left how sorry she was to have stayed so short a time in a house into which she was so glad to have found her way at last, speaking of him as though he had meant something more to her than the rest of the people she knew, and appearing to unite their two selves with a kind of romantic bond which had made him smile. But at the time of life, tinged already with disenchantment, which Swann was approaching, when a man can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting too much in return, this linking of hearts, if it is no longer, as in early youth, the goal towards which love, of necessity, tends, still is bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it may well become the cause of love if it presents itself first. In his younger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he loves; later, the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be enough to make him fall in love with her. And 50, at an age when it would appear\u2014since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective pleasure\u2014that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part in its procreation, love may come into being, love of the most physical order, without any foundation in desire. At this time of life a man has already been wounded more than once by the darts of love; it no longer evolves by itself, obeying its own incomprehensible and fatal laws, before his passive and astonished heart. We come to its aid; we falsify it by memory and by suggestion; recognising one of its symptoms we recall and recreate the rest. Since we possess its hymn, engraved on our hearts in its entirety, there is no need of any woman to repeat the opening lines, potent with the admiration which her beauty inspires, for us to remember all that follows. And if she begin in the middle, where it sings of our existing, henceforward, for one another only, we are well enough attuned to that music to be able to take it up and follow our partner, without hesitation, at the first pause in her voice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Odette de Cr\u00e9cy came again to see Swann; her visits grew more frequent, and doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he felt at the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in the interval, not remembering it as either so expressive or, in spite of her youth, so faded; he used to regret, while she was talking to him, that her really considerable beauty was not of the kind which he spontaneously admired. It must be remarked that Odette's face appeared thinner and more prominent than it actually was, because her forehead and the upper part of her cheeks, a single and almost plane surface, were covered by the masses of hair which women wore at that period, drawn forward in a fringe, raised in crimped waves and falling in stray locks over her ears; while as for her figure, and she was admirably built, it was impossible to make out its continuity (on account of the fashion then prevailing, and in spite of her being one of the best-dressed women in Paris) for the corset, jetting forwards in an arch, as though over an imaginary stomach, and ending in a sharp point, beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts, gave a woman, that year, the appearance of being composed of different sections badly fitted together; to such an extent did the frills, the flounces, the inner bodice follow, in complete independence, controlled only by the fancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material, the line which led them to the knots of ribbon, falls of lace, fringes of vertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust, but nowhere attached themselves to the living creature, who, according as the architecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her own, found herself either strait-laced to suffocation or else completely buried\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, after Odette had left him, Swann would think with a smile of her telling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again; he remembered the anxious, timid way in which she had once begged him that it might not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at him then, fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her a touching air beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in the front of her round bonnet of white straw, tied with strings of black velvet. \"And won't you,\" she had ventured, \"come just once and take tea with me?\" He had pleaded pressure of work, an essay\u2014which, in reality, he had abandoned years ago\u2014on Vermeer of Delft. \"I know that I am quite useless,\" she had replied, \"a little wild thing like me beside a learned great man like you. I should be like the frog in the fable! And yet I should so much like to learn, to know things, to be initiated. What fun it would be to become a regular bookworm, to bury my nose in a lot of old papers!\" she had gone on, with that self-satisfied air which a smart woman adopts when she insists that her one desire is to give herself up, without fear of soiling her fingers, to some unclean task, such as cooking the dinner, with her \"hands right in the dish itself.\" \"You will only laugh at me, but this painter who stops you from seeing me,\" she meant Vermeer, \"I have never even heard of him; is he alive still? Can I see any of his things in Paris, so as to have some idea of what is going on behind that great brow which works so hard, that head which I feel sure is always puzzling away about things; just to be able to say 'There, that's what he's thinking about!' What a dream it would be to be able to help you with your work.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had sought an excuse in his fear of forming new friendships, which he gallantly described as his fear of a hopeless passion. \"You are afraid of falling in love? How funny that is, when I go about seeking nothing else, and would give my soul just to find a little love somewhere!\" she had said, so naturally and with such an air of conviction that he had been genuinely touched. \"Some woman must have made you suffer. And you think that the rest are all like her. She can't have understood you: you are so utterly different from ordinary men. That's what I liked about you when I first saw you; I felt at once that you weren't like everybody else.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And then, besides, there's yourself\u2014\u2014\" he had continued, \"I know what women are; you must have a whole heap of things to do, and never any time to spare.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I? Why, I have never anything to do. I am always free, and I always will be free if you want me. At whatever hour of the day or night it may suit you to see me, just send for me, and I shall be only too delighted to come. Will you do that? Do you know what I should really like\u2014to introduce you to Mme. Verdurin, where I go every evening. Just fancy my finding you there, and thinking that it was a little for my sake that you had gone.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt, in thus remembering their conversations, in thinking about her thus when he was alone, he did no more than call her image into being among those of countless other women in his romantic dreams; but if, thanks to some accidental circumstance (or even perhaps without that assistance, for the circumstance which presents itself at the moment when a mental state, hitherto latent, makes itself felt, may well have had no influence whatsoever upon that state), the image of Odette de Cr\u00e9cy came to absorb the whole of his dreams, if from those dreams the memory of her could no longer be eliminated, then her bodily imperfections would no longer be of the least importance, nor would the conformity of her body, more or less than any other, to the requirements of Swann's taste; since, having become the body of her whom he loved, it must henceforth be the only one capable of causing him joy or anguish\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It so happened that my grandfather had known\u2014which was more than could be said of any other actual acquaintance\u2014the family of these Verdurins. But he had entirely severed his connection with what he called \"young Verdurin,\" taking a general view of him as one who had fallen\u2014though without losing hold of his millions\u2014among the riff-raff of Bohemia. One day he received a letter from Swann asking whether my grandfather could put him in touch with the Verdurins. \"On guard! on guard!\" he exclaimed as he read it, \"I am not at all surprised; Swann was bound to finish up like this. A nice lot of people! I cannot do what he asks, because, in the first place, I no longer know the gentleman in question. Besides, there must be a woman in it somewhere, and I don't mix myself up in such matters. Ah, well, we shall see some fun if Swann begins running after the little Verdurins.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And on my grandfather's refusal to act as sponsor, it was Odette herself who had taken Swann to the house\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verdurins had had dining with them, on the day when Swann made his first appearance, Dr. and Mme. Cottard, the young pianist and his aunt, and the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course of the evening, by several more of the 'faithful.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to reply to any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or in earnest. And so in any event he would embellish all his facial expressions with the offer of a conditional, a provisional smile whose expectant subtlety would exonerate him from the charge of being a simpleton, if the remark addressed to him should turn out to have been facetious. But as he must also be prepared to face the alternative, he never dared to allow this smile a definite expression on his features, and you would see there a perpetually flickering uncertainty, in which you might decipher the question that he never dared to ask: \"Do you really mean that?\" He was no more confident of the manner in which he ought to conduct himself in the street, or indeed in life generally, than he was in a drawing-room; and he might be seen greeting passers-by, carriages, and anything that occurred with a malicious smile which absolved his subsequent behaviour of all impropriety, since it proved, if it should turn out unsuited to the occasion, that he was well aware of that, and that if he had assumed a smile, the jest was a secret of his own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On all those points, however, where a plain question appeared to him to be permissible, the Doctor was unsparing in his endeavours to cultivate the wilderness of his ignorance and uncertainty and so to complete his education\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So it was that, following the advice given him by a wise mother on his first coming up to the capital from his provincial home, he would never let pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him without an effort to secure the fullest information upon it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards figures of speech, he was insatiable in his thirst for knowledge, for often imagining them to have a more definite meaning than was actually the case, he would want to know what, exactly, was intended by those which he most frequently heard used: 'devilish pretty,' 'blue blood,' 'a cat and dog life,' 'a day of reckoning,' 'a queen of fashion, 'to give a free hand,' 'to be at a deadlock,' and so forth; and in what particular circumstances he himself might make use of them in conversation. Failing these, he would adorn it with puns and other 'plays upon words' which he had learned by rote. As for the names of strangers which were uttered in his hearing, he used merely to repeat them to himself in a questioning tone, which, he thought, would suffice to furnish him with explanations for which he would not ostensibly seek\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the critical faculty, on the universal application of which he prided himself, was, in reality, completely lacking, that refinement of good breeding which consists in assuring some one whom you are obliging in any way, without expecting to be believed, that it is really yourself that is obliged to him, was wasted on Cottard, who took everything that he heard in its literal sense. However blind she may have been to his faults, Mme. Verdurin was genuinely annoyed, though she still continued to regard him as brilliantly clever, when, after she had invited him to see and hear Sarah Bernhardt from a stage box, and had said politely: \"It is very good of you to have come, Doctor, especially as I'm sure you must often have heard Sarah Bernhardt; and besides, I'm afraid we're rather too near the stage,\" the Doctor, who had come into the box with a smile which waited before settling upon or vanishing from his face until some one in authority should enlighten him as to the merits of the spectacle, replied: \"To be sure, we are far too near the stage, and one is getting sick of Sarah Bernhardt. But you expressed a wish that I should come. For me, your wish is a command. I am only too glad to be able to do you this little service. What would one not do to please you, you are so good.\" And he went on, \"Sarah Bernhardt; that's what they call the Voice of God, ain't it? You see, often, too, that she 'sets the boards on fire.' That's an odd expression, ain't it?\" in the hope of an enlightening commentary, which, however, was not forthcoming\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"D'you know,\" Mme. Verdurin had said to her husband, \"I believe we are going the wrong way to work when we depreciate anything we offer the Doctor. He is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday existence; he knows nothing himself of what things are worth, and he accepts everything that we say as gospel.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I never dared to mention it,\" M. Verdurin had answered, \"but I've noticed the same thing myself.\" And on the following New Year's Day, instead of sending Dr. Cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs, and pretending that it was a mere trifle, M. Verdurin bought an artificial stone for three hundred, and let it be understood that it was something almost impossible to match\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Mme. Verdurin had announced that they were to see M. Swann that evening; \"Swann!\" the Doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal by his astonishment, for the smallest piece of news would always take utterly unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in readiness for anything. And seeing that no one answered him, \"Swann! Who on earth is Swann?\" he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided as soon as Mme. Verdurin had explained, \"Why, Odette's friend, whom she told us about.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,\" answered the Doctor, at once mollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of Swann's appearing at the Verdurins', because he supposed him to be in love with Odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings. \"Nothing amuses me more than match-making,\" he confided to Cottard; \"I have been tremendously successful, even with women!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In telling the Verdurins that Swann was extremely 'smart,' Odette had alarmed them with the prospect of another 'bore.' When he arrived, however, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which, though they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best society. He had, indeed, one of those advantages which men who have lived and moved in the world enjoy over others, even men of intelligence and refinement, who have never gone into society, namely that they no longer see it transfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills the imagination, but regard it as quite unimportant. Their good nature, freed from all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming too friendly, grown independent, in fact, has the ease, the grace of movement of a trained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out precisely the movement that is required without any clumsy participation by the rest of his body. The simple and elementary gestures used by a man of the world when he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown youth who is being introduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before the Ambassador to whom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded, without his being conscious of it, the whole of Swann's social deportment, so that in the company of people of a lower grade than his own, such as the Verdurins and their friends, he instinctively shewed an assiduity, and made overtures with which, by their account, any of their 'bores' would have dispensed. He chilled, though for a moment only, on meeting Dr. Cottard; for seeing him close one eye with an ambiguous smile, before they had yet spoken to one another (a grimace which Cottard styled \"letting 'em all come\"), Swann supposed that the Doctor recognised him from having met him already somewhere, probably in some house of 'ill-fame,' though these he himself very rarely visited, never having made a habit of indulging in the mercenary sort of love. Regarding such an allusion as in bad taste, especially before Odette, whose opinion of himself it might easily alter for the worse, Swann assumed his most icy manner. But when he learned that the lady next to the Doctor was Mme. Cottard, he decided that so young a husband would not deliberately, in his wife's hearing, have made any allusion to amusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the Doctor's expression in the sense which he had at first suspected. The painter at once invited Swann to visit his studio with Odette, and Swann found him very pleasant. \"Perhaps you will be more highly favoured than I have been,\" Mme. Verdurin broke in, with mock resentment of the favour, \"perhaps you will be allowed to see Cottard's portrait\" (for which she had given the painter a commission). \"Take care, Master Biche,\" she reminded the painter, whom it was a time-honoured pleasantry to address as 'Master,' \"to catch that nice look in his eyes, that witty little twinkle. You know, what I want to have most of all is his smile; that's what I've asked you to paint\u2014the portrait of his smile.\" And since the phrase struck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to make sure that as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and even made use of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer before she uttered it again. Swann begged to be introduced to everyone, even to an old friend of the Verdurins, called Saniette, whose shyness, simplicity and good-nature had deprived him of all the consideration due to his skill in palaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished family to which he belonged. When he spoke, his words came with a confusion which was delightful to hear because one felt that it indicated not so much a defect in his speech as a quality of his soul, as it were a survival from the age of innocence which he had never wholly outgrown. All the consonants which he did not manage to pronounce seemed like harsh utterances of which his gentle lips were incapable. By asking to be made known to M. Saniette, Swann made M. Verdurin reverse the usual form of introduction (saying, in fact, with emphasis on the distinction: \"M. Swann, pray let me present to you our friend Saniette\") but he aroused in Saniette himself a warmth of gratitude, which, however, the Verdurins never disclosed to Swann, since Saniette rather annoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him with friends. On the other hand the Verdurins were extremely touched by Swann's next request, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the pianist's aunt. She wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for she believed that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing could be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as it always was for some time after a meal. She bowed to Swann with deference, but drew herself up again with great dignity. As she was entirely uneducated, and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and pronunciation, she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling manner, thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in the surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had actually made it or not; with the result that her talk was a sort of continuous, blurred expectoration, out of which would emerge, at rare intervals, those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive. Swann supposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in conversation with M. Verdurin, who, however, was not at all amused\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She is such an excellent woman!\" he rejoined. \"I grant you that she is not exactly brilliant; but I assure you that she can talk most charmingly when you are alone with her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am sure she can,\" Swann hastened to conciliate him. \"All I meant was that she hardly struck me as 'distinguished,'\" he went on, isolating the epithet in the inverted commas of his tone, \"and, after all, that is something of a compliment.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Wait a moment,\" said M. Verdurin, \"now, this will surprise you; she writes quite delightfully. You have never heard her nephew play? It is admirable; eh, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something, M. Swann?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I should count myself most fortunate...\" Swann was beginning, a trifle pompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it said, and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the use of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a solemn word used seriously, as the word 'fortunate' had been used just now by Swann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately pedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in what he called an old 'tag' or 'saw,' however common it might still be in current usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing was a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation, which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at that point, although in reality it had never entered his mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Most fortunate for France!\" he recited wickedly, shooting up both arms with great vigour. M. Verdurin could not help laughing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What are all those good people laughing at over there? There's no sign of brooding melancholy down in your corner,\" shouted Mme. Verdurin. \"You don't suppose I find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on the stool of repentance,\" she went on peevishly, like a spoiled child\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood, which a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in her drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school 'form,' and 'swore,' as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture which she had besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which her 'faithful' were in the habit of making her from time to time, so that the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to the house. She tried to persuade them to confine their tributes to flowers and sweets, which had at least the merit of mortality; but she was never successful, and the house was gradually filled with a collection of foot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens, barometers and vases, a constant repetition and a boundless incongruity of useless but indestructible objects\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation of the 'faithful,' and would revel in all their fun; but, since the accident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in real hilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which signified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that she was 'laughing until she cried.' At the least witticism aimed by any of the circle against a 'bore,' or against a former member of the circle who was now relegated to the limbo of 'bores'\u2014and to the utter despair of M. Verdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his wife, but who, since his laughter was the 'real thing,' was out of breath in a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a feigned but continuous hilarity\u2014she would utter a shrill cry, shut tight her little bird-like eyes, which were beginning to be clouded over by a cataract, and quickly, as though she had only just time to avoid some indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow, burying her face in her hands, which completely engulfed it, and prevented her from seeing anything at all, she would appear to be struggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh which, were she to give way to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate. So, stupefied with the gaiety of the 'faithful,' drunken with comradeship, scandal and asseveration, Mme. Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a cage-bird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft and sob with fellow-feeling\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile M. Verdurin, after first asking Swann's permission to light his pipe (\"No ceremony here, you understand; we're all pals!\"), went and begged the young musician to sit down at the piano\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Leave him alone; don't bother him; he hasn't come here to be tormented,\" cried Mme. Verdurin. \"I won't have him tormented.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But why on earth should it bother him?\" rejoined M. Verdurin. \"I'm sure M. Swann has never heard the sonata in F sharp which we discovered; he is going to play us the pianoforte arrangement.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no, no, not my sonata!\" she screamed, \"I don't want to be made to cry until I get a cold in the head, and neuralgia all down my face, like last time; thanks very much, I don't intend to repeat that performance; you are all very kind and considerate; it is easy to see that none of you will have to stay in bed, for a week.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This little scene, which was re-enacted as often as the young pianist sat down to play, never failed to delight the audience, as though each of them were witnessing it for the first time, as a proof of the seductive originality of the 'Mistress' as she was styled, and of the acute sensitiveness of her musical 'ear.' Those nearest to her would attract the attention of the rest, who were smoking or playing cards at the other end of the room, by their cries of 'Hear, hear!' which, as in Parliamentary debates, shewed that something worth listening to was being said. And next day they would commiserate with those who had been prevented from coming that evening, and would assure them that the 'little scene' had never been so amusingly done\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, all right, then,\" said M. Verdurin, \"he can play just the andante.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just the andante! How you do go on,\" cried his wife. \"As if it weren't 'just the andante' that breaks every bone in my body. The 'Master' is really too priceless! Just as though, 'in the Ninth,' he said 'we need only have the finale,' or 'just the overture' of the Meistersinger.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Doctor, however, urged Mme. Verdurin to let the pianist play, not because he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the distressing effects that music always had upon her, for he recognised the existence of certain neurasthenic states\u2014but from his habit, common to many doctors, of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription as soon as it appeared to jeopardise, what seemed to him far more important, the success of some social gathering at which he was present, and of which the patient whom he had urged for once to forget her dyspepsia or headache formed an essential factor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You won't be ill this time, you'll find,\" he told her, seeking at the same time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze. \"And, if you are ill, we will cure you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Will you, really?\" Mme. Verdurin spoke as though, with so great a favour in store for her, there was nothing for it but to capitulate. Perhaps, too, by dint of saying that she was going to be ill, she had worked herself into a state in which she forgot, occasionally, that it was all only a 'little scene,' and regarded things, quite sincerely, from an invalid's point of view. For it may often be remarked that invalids grow weary of having the frequency of their attacks depend always on their own prudence in avoiding them, and like to let themselves think that they are free to do everything that they most enjoy doing, although they are always ill after doing it, provided only that they place themselves in the hands of a higher authority which, without putting them to the least inconvenience, can and will, by uttering a word or by administering a tabloid, set them once again upon their feet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Odette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered sofa near the piano, saying to Mme. Verdurin, \"I have my own little corner, haven't I?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Mme. Verdurin, seeing Swann by himself upon a chair, made him get up. \"You're not at all comfortable there; go along and sit by Odette; you can make room for M. Swann there, can't you, Odette?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What charming Beauvais!\" said Swann, stopping to admire the sofa before he sat down on it, and wishing to be polite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am glad you appreciate my sofa,\" replied Mme. Verdurin, \"and I warn you that if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well abandon the idea at once. They never made any more like it. And these little chairs, too, are perfect marvels. You can look at them in a moment. The emblems in each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the subject of the tapestry on the chair; you know, you combine amusement with instruction when you look at them;\u2014I can promise you a delightful time, I assure you. Just look at the little border around the edges; here, look, the little vine on a red background in this one, the Bear and the Grapes. Isn't it well drawn? What do you say? I think they knew a thing or two about design! Doesn't it make your mouth water, this vine? My husband makes out that I am not fond of fruit, because I eat less than he does. But not a bit of it, I am greedier than any of you, but I have no need to fill my mouth with them when I can feed on them with my eyes. What are you all laughing at now, pray? Ask the Doctor; he will tell you that those grapes act on me like a regular purge. Some people go to Fontainebleau for cures; I take my own little Beauvais cure here. But, M. Swann, you mustn't run away without feeling the little bronze mouldings on the backs. Isn't it an exquisite surface? No, no, not with your whole hand like that; feel them property!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If Mme. Verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes,\" said the painter, \"we shan't get any music to-night.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Be quiet, you wretch! And yet we poor women,\" she went on, \"are forbidden pleasures far less voluptuous than this. There is no flesh in the world as soft as these. None. When M. Verdurin did me the honour of being madly jealous... come, you might at least be polite. Don't say that you never have been jealous!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, my dear, I have said absolutely nothing. Look here, Doctor, I call you as a witness; did I utter a word?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann had begun, out of politeness, to finger the bronzes, and did not like to stop\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Come along; you can caress them later; now it is you that are going to be caressed, caressed in the ear; you'll like that, I think. Here's the young gentleman who will take charge of that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the pianist had played, Swann felt and shewed more interest in him than in any of the other guests, for the following reason:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The year before, at an evening party, he had heard a piece of music played on the piano and violin. At first he had appreciated only the material quality of the sounds which those instruments secreted. And it had been a source of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the violin-part, delicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole, he had suddenly perceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of sound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent, level, and breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea, silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight. But at a given moment, without being able to distinguish any clear outline, or to give a name to what was pleasing him, suddenly enraptured, he had tried to collect, to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony\u2014he knew not which\u2014that had just been played, and had opened and expanded his soul, just as the fragrance of certain roses, wafted upon the moist air of evening, has the power of dilating our nostrils. Perhaps it was owing to his own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so confused an impression, one of those that are, notwithstanding, our only purely musical impressions, limited in their extent, entirely original, and irreducible into any other kind. An impression of this order, vanishing in an instant, is, so to speak, an impression sine materia. Presumably the notes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out before our eyes, over surfaces greater or smaller according to their pitch and volume; to trace arabesque designs, to give us the sensation of breadth or tenuity, stability or caprice. But the notes themselves have vanished before these sensations have developed sufficiently to escape submersion under those which the following, or even simultaneous notes have already begun to awaken in us. And this indefinite perception would continue to smother in its molten liquidity the motifs which now and then emerge, barely discernible, to plunge again and disappear and drown; recognised only by the particular kind of pleasure which they instil, impossible to describe, to recollect, to name; ineffable;\u2014if our memory, like a labourer who toils at the laying down of firm foundations beneath the tumult of the waves, did not, by fashioning for us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases, enable us to compare and to contrast them with those that follow. And so, hardly had the delicious sensation, which Swann had experienced, died away, before his memory had furnished him with an immediate transcript, summary, it is true, and provisional, but one on which he had kept his eyes fixed while the playing continued, so effectively that, when the same impression suddenly returned, it was no longer uncapturable. He was able to picture to himself its extent, its symmetrical arrangement, its notation, the strength of its expression; he had before him that definite object which was no longer pure music, but rather design, architecture, thought, and which allowed the actual music to be recalled. This time he had distinguished, quite clearly, a phrase which emerged for a few moments from the waves of sound. It had at once held out to him an invitation to partake of intimate pleasures, of whose existence, before hearing it, he had never dreamed, into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could initiate him; and he had been filled with love for it, as with a new and strange desire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here, there, everywhere, towards a state of happiness noble, unintelligible, yet clearly indicated. And then, suddenly having reached a certain point from which he was prepared to follow it, after pausing for a moment, abruptly it changed its direction, and in a fresh movement, more rapid, multiform, melancholy, incessant, sweet, it bore him off with it towards a vista of joys unknown. Then it vanished. He hoped, with a passionate longing, that he might find it again, a third time. And reappear it did, though without speaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a pleasure less profound. But when he was once more at home he needed it, he was like a man into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for a moment passing by, has brought a new form of beauty, which strengthens and enlarges his own power of perception, without his knowing even whether he is ever to see her again whom he loves already, although he knows nothing of her, not even her name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed, in the first few months, to be bringing into Swann's life the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation. He had so long since ceased to direct his course towards any ideal goal, and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral satisfactions, that he had come to believe, though without ever formally stating his belief even to himself, that he would remain all his life in that condition, which death alone could alter. More than this, since his mind no longer entertained any lofty ideals, he had ceased to believe in (although he could not have expressly denied) their reality. He had grown also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations, which allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance. Just as he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have done better by not going into society, knowing very well that if he had accepted an invitation he must put in an appearance, and that afterwards, if he did not actually call, he must at least leave cards upon his hostess; so in his conversation he took care never to express with any warmth a personal opinion about a thing, but instead would supply facts and details which had a value of a sort in themselves, and excused him from shewing how much he really knew. He would be extremely precise about the recipe for a dish, the dates of a painter's birth and death, and the titles of his works. Sometimes, in spite of himself, he would let himself go so far as to utter a criticism of a work of art, or of some one's interpretation of life, but then he would cloak his words in a tone of irony, as though he did not altogether associate himself with what he was saying. But now, like a confirmed invalid whom, all of a sudden, a change of air and surroundings, or a new course of treatment, or, as sometimes happens, an organic change in himself, spontaneous and unaccountable, seems to have so far recovered from his malady that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto beyond all hope, of starting to lead\u2014and better late than never\u2014a wholly different life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase that he had heard, in certain other sonatas which he had made people play over to him, to see whether he might not, perhaps, discover his phrase among them, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe, but to which, as though the music had had upon the moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative influence, he was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of the power to consecrate his life. But, never having managed to find out whose work it was that he had heard played that evening, he had been unable to procure a copy, and finally had forgotten the quest. He had indeed, in the course of the next few days, encountered several of the people who had been at the party with him, and had questioned them; but most of them had either arrived after or left before the piece was played; some had indeed been in the house, but had gone into another room to talk, and those who had stayed to listen had no clearer impression than the rest. As for his hosts, they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians whom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play; but, as these last were now on tour somewhere, Swann could learn nothing further. He had, of course, a number of musical friends, but, vividly as he could recall the exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little phrase had given him, and could see, still, before his eyes the forms that it had traced in outline, he was quite incapable of humming over to them the air. And so, at last, he ceased to think of it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to-night, at Mme. Verdurin's, scarcely had the little pianist begun to play when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole bars, Swann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that resonance, which was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain of sound, to veil the mystery of its birth\u2014and recognised, secret, whispering, articulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved. And it was so peculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which nothing else could have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met, in a friend's drawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once, in the street, and had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the phrase withdrew and vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the wandering currents of its fragrance, leaving upon Swann's features a reflection of its smile. But now, at last, he could ask the name of his fair unknown (and was told that it was the andante movement of Vinteuil's sonata for the piano and violin), he held it safe, could have it again to himself, at home, as often as he would, could study its language and acquire its secret\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, when the pianist had finished, Swann crossed the room and thanked him with a vivacity which delighted Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Isn't he charming?\" she asked Swann, \"doesn't he just understand it, his sonata, the little wretch? You never dreamed, did you, that a piano could be made to express all that? Upon my word, there's everything in it except the piano! I'm caught out every time I hear it; I think I'm listening to an orchestra. Though it's better, really, than an orchestra, more complete.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The young pianist bent over her as he answered, smiling and underlining each of his words as though he were making an epigram: \"You are most generous to me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And while Mme. Verdurin was saying to her husband, \"Run and fetch him a glass of orangeade; it's well earned!\" Swann began to tell Odette how he had fallen in love with that little phrase. When their hostess, who was a little way off, called out, \"Well! It looks to me as though some one was saying nice things to you, Odette!\" she replied, \"Yes, very nice,\" and he found her simplicity delightful. Then he asked for some information about this Vinteuil; what else he had done, and at what period in his life he had composed the sonata;\u2014what meaning the little phrase could have had for him, that was what Swann wanted most to know\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But none of these people who professed to admire this musician (when Swann had said that the sonata was really charming Mme. Verdurin had exclaimed, \"I quite believe it! Charming, indeed! But you don't dare to confess that you don't know Vinteuil's sonata; you have no right not to know it!\"\u2014and the painter had gone on with, \"Ah, yes, it's a very fine bit of work, isn't it? Not, of course, if you want something 'obvious,' something 'popular,' but, I mean to say, it makes a very great impression on us artists.\"), none of them seemed ever to have asked himself these questions, for none of them was able to reply\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even to one or two particular remarks made by Swann on his favourite phrase, \"D'you know, that's a funny thing; I had never noticed it; I may as well tell you that I don't much care about peering at things through a microscope, and pricking myself on pin-points of difference; no; we don't waste time splitting hairs in this house; why not? well, it's not a habit of ours, that's all,\" Mme. Verdurin replied, while Dr. Cottard gazed at her with open-mouthed admiration, and yearned to be able to follow her as she skipped lightly from one stepping-stone to another of her stock of ready-made phrases. Both he, however, and Mme. Cottard, with a kind of common sense which is shared by many people of humble origin, would always take care not to express an opinion, or to pretend to admire a piece of music which they would confess to each other, once they were safely at home, that they no more understood than they could understand the art of 'Master' Biche. Inasmuch as the public cannot recognise the charm, the beauty, even the outlines of nature save in the stereotyped impressions of an art which they have gradually assimilated, while an original artist starts by rejecting those impressions, so M. and Mme. Cottard, typical, in this respect, of the public, were incapable of finding, either in Vinteuil's sonata or in Biche's portraits, what constituted harmony, for them, in music or beauty in painting. It appeared to them, when the pianist played his sonata, as though he were striking haphazard from the piano a medley of notes which bore no relation to the musical forms to which they themselves were accustomed, and that the painter simply flung the colours haphazard upon his canvas. When, on one of these, they were able to distinguish a human form, they always found it coarsened and vulgarised (that is to say lacking all the elegance of the school of painting through whose spectacles they themselves were in the habit of seeing the people\u2014real, living people, who passed them in the streets) and devoid of truth, as though M. Biche had not known how the human shoulder was constructed, or that a woman's hair was not, ordinarily, purple\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, when the 'faithful' were scattered out of earshot, the Doctor felt that the opportunity was too good to be missed, and so (while Mme. Verdurin was adding a final word of commendation of Vinteuil's sonata) like a would-be swimmer who jumps into the water, so as to learn, but chooses a moment when there are not too many people looking on: \"Yes, indeed; he's what they call a musiciandi primo cartello!\" he exclaimed, with a sudden determination\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann discovered no more than that the recent publication of Vinteuil's sonata had caused a great stir among the most advanced school of musicians, but that it was still unknown to the general public\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know some one, quite well, called Vinteuil,\" said Swann, thinking of the old music-master at Combray who had taught my grandmother's sisters\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Perhaps that's the man!\" cried Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, no!\" Swann burst out laughing. \"If you had ever seen him for a moment you wouldn't put the question.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Then to put the question is to solve the problem?\" the Doctor suggested\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But it may well be some relative,\" Swann went on. \"That would be bad enough; but, after all, there is no reason why a genius shouldn't have a cousin who is a silly old fool. And if that should be so, I swear there's no known or unknown form of torture I wouldn't undergo to get the old fool to introduce me to the man who composed the sonata; starting with the torture of the old fool's company, which would be ghastly.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The painter understood that Vinteuil was seriously ill at the moment, and that Dr. Potain despaired of his life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What!\" cried Mme. Verdurin, \"Do people still call in Potain?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah! Mme. Verdurin,\" Cottard simpered, \"you forget that you are speaking of one of my colleagues\u2014I should say, one of my masters.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The painter had heard, somewhere, that Vinteuil was threatened with the loss of his reason. And he insisted that signs of this could be detected in certain passages in the sonata. This remark did not strike Swann as ridiculous; rather, it puzzled him. For, since a purely musical work contains none of those logical sequences, the interruption or confusion of which, in spoken or written language, is a proof of insanity, so insanity diagnosed in a sonata seemed to him as mysterious a thing as the insanity of a dog or a horse, although instances may be observed of these\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't speak to me about 'your masters'; you know ten times as much as he does!\" Mme. Verdurin answered Dr. Cottard, in the tone of a woman who has the courage of her convictions, and is quite ready to stand up to anyone who disagrees with her. \"Anyhow, you don't kill your patients!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, Madame, he is in the Academy.\" The Doctor smiled with bitter irony. \"If a sick person prefers to die at the hands of one of the Princes of Science... It is far more smart to be able to say, 'Yes, I have Potain.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, indeed! More smart, is it?\" said Mme. Verdurin. \"So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there? I didn't know that.... Oh, you do make me laugh!\" she screamed, suddenly, burying her face in her hands. \"And here was I, poor thing, talking quite seriously, and never seeing that you were pulling my leg.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for M. Verdurin, finding it rather a strain to start laughing again over so small a matter, he was content with puffing out a cloud of smoke from his pipe, while he reflected sadly that he could never again hope to keep pace with his wife in her Atalanta-flights across the field of mirth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"D'you know; we like your friend so very much,\" said Mme. Verdurin, later, when Odette was bidding her good night. \"He is so unaffected, quite charming. If they're all like that, the friends you want to bring here, by all means bring them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin remarked that Swann had failed, all the same, to appreciate the pianist's aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I dare say he felt a little strange, poor man,\" suggested Mme. Verdurin. \"You can't expect him to catch the tone of the house the first time he comes; like Cottard, who has been one of our little 'clan' now for years. The first time doesn't count; it's just for looking round and finding out things. Odette, he understands all right, he's to join us to-morrow at the Ch\u00e2telet. Perhaps you might call for him and bring him.\" \"No, he doesn't want that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, very well; just as you like. Provided he doesn't fail us at the last moment.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Greatly to Mme. Verdurin's surprise, he never failed them. He would go to meet them, no matter where, at restaurants outside Paris (not that they went there much at first, for the season had not yet begun), and more frequently at the play, in which Mme. Verdurin delighted. One evening, when they were dining at home, he heard her complain that she had not one of those permits which would save her the trouble of waiting at doors and standing in crowds, and say how useful it would be to them at first-nights, and gala performances at the Opera, and what a nuisance it had been, not having one, on the day of Gambetta's funeral. Swann never spoke of his distinguished friends, but only of such as might be regarded as detrimental, whom, therefore, he thought it snobbish, and in not very good taste to conceal; while he frequented the Faubourg Saint-Germain he had come to include, in the latter class, all his friends in the official world of the Third Republic, and so broke in, without thinking: \"I'll see to that, all right. You shall have it in time for the Danicheff revival. I shall be lunching with the Prefect of Police to-morrow, as it happens, at the Elys\u00e9e.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What's that? The Elys\u00e9e?\" Dr. Cottard roared in a voice of thunder\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, at M. Gr\u00e9vy's,\" replied Swann, feeling a little awkward at the effect which his announcement had produced\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you often taken like that?\" the painter asked Cottard, with mock-seriousness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a rule, once an explanation had been given, Cottard would say: \"Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,\" after which he would shew not the least trace of emotion. But this time Swann's last words, instead of the usual calming effect, had that of heating, instantly, to boiling-point his astonishment at the discovery that a man with whom he himself was actually sitting at table, a man who had no official position, no honours or distinction of any sort, was on visiting terms with the Head of the State\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What's that you say? M. Gr\u00e9vy? Do you know M. Gr\u00e9vy?\" he demanded of Swann, in the stupid and incredulous tone of a constable on duty at the palace, when a stranger has come up and asked to see the President of the Republic; until, guessing from his words and manner what, as the newspapers say, 'it is a case of,' he assures the poor lunatic that he will be admitted at once, and points the way to the reception ward of the police infirmary\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know him slightly; we have some friends in common\" (Swann dared not add that one of these friends was the Prince of Wales). \"Anyhow, he is very free with his invitations, and, I assure you, his luncheon-parties are not the least bit amusing; they're very simple affairs, too, you know; never more than eight at table,\" he went on, trying desperately to cut out everything that seemed to shew off his relations with the President in a light too dazzling for the Doctor's eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereupon Cottard, at once conforming in his mind to the literal interpretation of what Swann was saying, decided that invitations from M. Gr\u00e9vy were very little sought after, were sent out, in fact, into the highways and hedge-rows. And from that moment he never seemed at all surprised to hear that Swann, or anyone else, was 'always at the Elys\u00e9e'; he even felt a little sorry for a man who had to go to luncheon-parties which, he himself admitted, were a bore\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, good, good; that's quite all right then,\" he said, in the tone of a customs official who has been suspicious up to now, but, after hearing your explanations, stamps your passport and lets you proceed on your journey without troubling to examine your luggage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I can well believe you don't find them amusing, those parties; indeed, it's very good of you to go to them!\" said Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the President of the Republic only as a 'bore' to be especially dreaded, since he had at his disposal means of seduction, and even of compulsion, which, if employed to captivate her 'faithful,' might easily make them 'fail.' \"It seems, he's as deaf as a post; and eats with his fingers.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Upon my word! Then it can't be much fun for you, going there.\" A note of pity sounded in the Doctor's voice; and then struck by the number\u2014only eight at table\u2014\"Are these luncheons what you would describe as 'intimate'?\" he inquired briskly, not so much out of idle curiosity as in his linguistic zeal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But so great and glorious a figure was the President of the French Republic in the eyes of Dr. Cottard that neither the modesty of Swann nor the spite of Mme. Verdurin could ever wholly efface that first impression, and he never sat down to dinner with the Verdurins without asking anxiously, \"D'you think we shall see M. Swann here this evening? He is a personal friend of M. Gr\u00e9vy's. I suppose that means he's what you'd call a 'gentleman'?\" He even went to the length of offering Swann a card of invitation to the Dental Exhibition\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This will let you in, and anyone you take with you,\" he explained, \"but dogs are not admitted. I'm just warning you, you understand, because some friends of mine went there once, who hadn't been told, and there was the devil to pay.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for M. Verdurin, he did not fail to observe the distressing effect upon his wife of the discovery that Swann had influential friends of whom he had never spoken\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If no arrangement had been made to 'go anywhere,' it was at the Verdurins' that Swann would find the 'little nucleus' assembled, but he never appeared there except in the evenings, and would hardly ever accept their invitations to dinner, in spite of Odette's entreaties\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I could dine with you alone somewhere, if you'd rather,\" she suggested\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But what about Mme. Verdurin?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, that's quite simple. I need only say that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How charming of you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Swann said to himself that, if he could make Odette feel (by consenting to meet her only after dinner) that there were other pleasures which he preferred to that of her company, then the desire that she felt for his would be all the longer in reaching the point of satiety. Besides, as he infinitely preferred to Odette's style of beauty that of a little working girl, as fresh and plump as a rose, with whom he happened to be simultaneously in love, he preferred to spend the first part of the evening with her, knowing that he was sure to see Odette later on. For the same reason, he would never allow Odette to call for him at his house, to take him on to the Verdurins'. The little girl used to wait, not far from his door, at a street corner; R\u00e9mi, his coachman, knew where to stop; she would jump in beside him, and hold him in her arms until the carriage drew up at the Verdurins'. He would enter the drawing-room; and there, while Mme. Verdurin, pointing to the roses which he had sent her that morning, said: \"I am furious with you!\" and sent him to the place kept for him, by the side of Odette, the pianist would play to them\u2014for their two selves, and for no one else\u2014that little phrase by Vinteuil which was, so to speak, the national anthem of their love. He began, always, with a sustained tremolo from the violin part, which, for several bars, was unaccompanied, and filled all the foreground; until suddenly it seemed to be drawn aside, and\u2014just as in those interiors by Pieter de Hooch, where the subject is set back a long way through the narrow framework of a half-opened door\u2014infinitely remote, in colour quite different, velvety with the radiance of some intervening light, the little phrase appeared, dancing, pastoral, interpolated, episodic, belonging to another world. It passed, with simple and immortal movements, scattering on every side the bounties of its grace, smiling ineffably still; but Swann thought that he could now discern in it some disenchantment. It seemed to be aware how vain, how hollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way. In its airy grace there was, indeed, something definitely achieved, and complete in itself, like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an outburst of vain regret. But little did that matter to him; he looked upon the sonata less in its own light\u2014as what it might express, had, in fact, expressed to a certain musician, ignorant that any Swann or Odette, anywhere in the world, existed, when he composed it, and would express to all those who should hear it played in centuries to come\u2014than as a pledge, a token of his love, which made even the Verdurins and their little pianist think of Odette and, at the same time, of himself\u2014which bound her to him by a lasting tie; and at that point he had (whimsically entreated by Odette) abandoned the idea of getting some 'professional' to play over to him the whole sonata, of which he still knew no more than this one passage. \"Why do you want the rest?\" she had asked him. \"Our little bit; that's all we need.\" He went farther; agonised by the reflection, at the moment when it passed by him, so near and yet so infinitely remote, that, while it was addressed to their ears, it knew them not, he would regret, almost, that it had a meaning of its own, an intrinsic and unalterable beauty, foreign to themselves, just as in the jewels given to us, or even in the letters written to us by a woman with whom we are in love, we find fault with the 'water' of a stone, or with the words of a sentence because they are not fashioned exclusively from the spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of a 'lass unparalleled.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would happen, as often as not, that he had stayed so long outside, with his little girl, before going to the Verdurins' that, as soon as the little phrase had been rendered by the pianist, Swann would discover that it was almost time for Odette to go home. He used to take her back as far as the door of her little house in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse, behind the Arc de Triomphe. And it was perhaps on this account, and so as not to demand the monopoly of her favours, that he sacrificed the pleasure (not so essential to his well-being) of seeing her earlier in the evening, of arriving with her at the Verdurins', to the exercise of this other privilege, for which she was grateful, of their leaving together; a privilege which he valued all the more because, thanks to it, he had the feeling that no one else would see her, no one would thrust himself between them, no one could prevent him from remaining with her in spirit, after he had left her for the night\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, night after night, she would be taken home in Swann's carriage; and one night, after she had got down, and while he stood at the gate and murmured \"Till to-morrow, then!\" she turned impulsively from him, plucked a last lingering chrysanthemum in the tiny garden which flanked the pathway from the street to her house, and as he went back to his carriage thrust it into his hand. He held it pressed to his lips during the drive home, and when, in due course, the flower withered, locked it away, like something very precious, in a secret drawer of his desk\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He would escort her to her gate, but no farther. Twice only had he gone inside to take part in the ceremony\u2014of such vital importance in her life\u2014of 'afternoon tea.' The loneliness and emptiness of those short streets (consisting, almost entirely, of low-roofed houses, self-contained but not detached, their monotony interrupted here and there by the dark intrusion of some sinister little shop, at once an historical document and a sordid survival from the days when the district was still one of ill repute), the snow which had lain on the garden-beds or clung to the branches of the trees, the careless disarray of the season, the assertion, in this man-made city, of a state of nature, had all combined to add an element of mystery to the warmth, the flowers, the luxury which he had found inside\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Passing by (on his left-hand side, and on what, although raised some way above the street, was the ground floor of the house) Odette's bedroom, which looked out to the back over another little street running parallel with her own, he had climbed a staircase that went straight up between dark painted walls, from which hung Oriental draperies, strings of Turkish beads, and a huge Japanese lantern, suspended by a silken cord from the ceiling (which last, however, so that her visitors should not have to complain of the want of any of the latest comforts of Western civilisation, was lighted by a gas-jet inside), to the two drawing-rooms, large and small. These were entered through a narrow lobby, the wall of which, chequered with the lozenges of a wooden trellis such as you see on garden walls, only gilded, was lined from end to end by a long rectangular box in which bloomed, as though in a hothouse, a row of large chrysanthemums, at that time still uncommon, though by no means so large as the mammoth blossoms which horticulturists have since succeeded in making grow. Swann was irritated, as a rule, by the sight of these flowers, which had then been 'the rage' in Paris for about a year, but it had pleased him, on this occasion, to see the gloom of the little lobby shot with rays of pink and gold and white by the fragrant petals of these ephemeral stars, which kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of winter afternoons. Odette had received him in a tea-gown of pink silk, which left her neck and arms bare. She had made him sit down beside her in one of the many mysterious little retreats which had been contrived in the various recesses of the room, sheltered by enormous palmtrees growing out of pots of Chinese porcelain, or by screens upon which were fastened photographs and fans and bows of ribbon. She had said at once, \"You're not comfortable there; wait a minute, I'll arrange things for you,\" and with a titter of laughter, the complacency of which implied that some little invention of her own was being brought into play, she had installed behind his head and beneath his feet great cushions of Japanese silk, which she pummelled and buffeted as though determined to lavish on him all her riches, and regardless of their value. But when her footman began to come into the room, bringing, one after another, the innumerable lamps which (contained, mostly, in porcelain vases) burned singly or in pairs upon the different pieces of furniture as upon so many altars, rekindling in the twilight, already almost nocturnal, of this winter afternoon, the glow of a sunset more lasting, more roseate, more human\u2014filling, perhaps, with romantic wonder the thoughts of some solitary lover, wandering in the street below and brought to a standstill before the mystery of the human presence which those lighted windows at once revealed and screened from sight\u2014she had kept an eye sharply fixed on the servant, to see whether he set each of the lamps down in the place appointed it. She felt that, if he were to put even one of them where it ought not to be, the general effect of her drawing-room would be destroyed, and that her portrait, which rested upon a sloping easel draped with plush, would not catch the light. And so, with feverish impatience, she followed the man's clumsy movements, scolding him severely when he passed too close to a pair of beaupots, which she made a point of always tidying herself, in case the plants should be knocked over\u2014and went across to them now to make sure that he had not broken off any of the flowers. She found something 'quaint' in the shape of each of her Chinese ornaments, and also in her orchids, the cattleyas especially (these being, with chrysanthemums, her favourite flowers), because they had the supreme merit of not looking in the least like other flowers, but of being made, apparently, out of scraps of silk or satin. \"It looks just as though it had been cut out of the lining of my cloak,\" she said to Swann, pointing to an orchid, with a shade of respect in her voice for so 'smart' a flower, for this distinguished, unexpected sister whom nature had suddenly bestowed upon her, so far removed from her in the scale of existence, and yet so delicate, so refined, so much more worthy than many real women of admission to her drawing-room. As she drew his attention, now to the fiery-tongued dragons painted upon a bowl or stitched upon a fire-screen, now to a fleshy cluster of orchids, now to a dromedary of inlaid silver-work with ruby eyes, which kept company, upon her mantelpiece, with a toad carved in jade, she would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the monsters or laughing at their absurdity, now blushing at the indecency of the flowers, now carried away by an irresistible desire to run across and kiss the toad and dromedary, calling them 'darlings.' And these affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of her attitudes, notably her devotion to Our Lady of the Laghetto who had once, when Odette was living at Nice, cured her of a mortal illness, and whose medal, in gold, she always carried on her person, attributing to it unlimited powers. She poured out Swann's tea, inquired \"Lemon or cream?\" and, on his answering \"Cream, please,\" went on, smiling, \"A cloud!\" And as he pronounced it excellent, \"You see, I know just how you like it.\" This tea had indeed seemed to Swann, just as it seemed to her, something precious, and love is so far obliged to find some justification for itself, some guarantee of its duration in pleasures which, on the contrary, would have no existence apart from love and must cease with its passing, that when he left her, at seven o'clock, to go and dress for the evening, all the way home, sitting bolt upright in his brougham, unable to repress the happiness with which the afternoon's adventure had filled him, he kept on repeating to himself: \"What fun it would be to have a little woman like that in a place where one could always be certain of finding, what one never can be certain of finding, a really good cup of tea.\" An hour or so later he received a note from Odette, and at once recognised that florid handwriting, in which an affectation of British stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its shapeless characters, significant, perhaps, to less intimate eyes than his, of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, a want of sincerity and decision. Swann had left his cigarette-case at her house. \"Why,\" she wrote, \"did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More important, perhaps, was a second visit which he paid her, a little later. On his way to the house, as always when he knew that they were to meet, he formed a picture of her in his mind; and the necessity, if he was to find any beauty in her face, of fixing his eyes on the fresh and rosy protuberance of her cheekbones, and of shutting out all the rest of those cheeks which were so often languorous and sallow, except when they were punctuated with little fiery spots, plunged him in acute depression, as proving that one's ideal is always unattainable, and one's actual happiness mediocre. He was taking her an engraving which she had asked to see. She was not very well; she received him, wearing a wrapper of mauve cr\u00eape de Chine, which draped her bosom, like a mantle, with a richly embroidered web. As she stood there beside him, brushing his cheek with the loosened tresses of her hair, bending one knee in what was almost a dancer's pose, so that she could lean without tiring herself over the picture, at which she was gazing, with bended head, out of those great eyes, which seemed so weary and so sullen when there was nothing to animate her, Swann was struck by her resemblance to the figure of Zipporah, Jethro's Daughter, which is to be seen in one of the Sistine frescoes. He had always found a peculiar fascination in tracing in the paintings of the Old Masters, not merely the general characteristics of the people whom he encountered in his daily life, but rather what seems least susceptible of generalisation, the individual features of men and women whom he knew, as, for instance, in a bust of the Doge Loredan by Antonio Rizzo, the prominent cheekbones, the slanting eyebrows, in short, a speaking likeness to his own coachman R\u00e9mi; in the colouring of a Ghirlandaio, the nose of M. de Palancy; in a portrait by Tintoretto, the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an outcrop of whisker, the broken nose, the penetrating stare, the swollen eyelids of Dr. du Boulbon. Perhaps because he had always regretted, in his heart, that he had confined his attention to the social side of life, had talked, always, rather than acted, he felt that he might find a sort of indulgence bestowed upon him by those great artists, in his perception of the fact that they also had regarded with pleasure and had admitted into the canon of their works such types of physiognomy as give those works the strongest possible certificate of reality and trueness to life; a modern, almost a topical savour; perhaps, also, he had so far succumbed to the prevailing frivolity of the world of fashion that he felt the necessity of finding in an old masterpiece some such obvious and refreshing allusion to a person about whom jokes could be made and repeated and enjoyed to-day. Perhaps, on the other hand, he had retained enough of the artistic temperament to be able to find a genuine satisfaction in watching these individual features take on a more general significance when he saw them, uprooted and disembodied, in the abstract idea of similarity between an historic portrait and a modern original, whom it was not intended to represent. However that might be, and perhaps because the abundance of impressions which he, for some time past, had been receiving\u2014though, indeed, they had come to him rather through the channel of his appreciation of music\u2014had enriched his appetite for painting as well, it was with an unusual intensity of pleasure, a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon his character and conduct, that Swann remarked Odette's resemblance to the Zipporah of that Alessandro de Mariano, to whom one shrinks from giving his more popular surname, now that 'Botticelli' suggests not so much the actual work of the Master as that false and banal conception of it which has of late obtained common currency. He no longer based his estimate of the merit of Odette's face on the more or less good quality of her cheeks, and the softness and sweetness\u2014as of carnation-petals\u2014which, he supposed, would greet his lips there, should he ever hazard an embrace, but regarded it rather as a skein of subtle and lovely silken threads, which his gazing eyes collected and wound together, following the curving line from the skein to the ball, where he mingled the cadence of her neck with the spring of her hair and the droop of her eyelids, as though from a portrait of herself, in which her type was made clearly intelligible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stood gazing at her; traces of the old fresco were apparent in her face and limbs, and these he tried incessantly, afterwards, to recapture, both when he was with Odette, and when he was only thinking of her in her absence; and, albeit his admiration for the Florentine masterpiece was probably based upon his discovery that it had been reproduced in her, the similarity enhanced her beauty also, and rendered her more precious in his sight. Swann reproached himself with his failure, hitherto, to estimate at her true worth a creature whom the great Sandro would have adored, and counted himself fortunate that his pleasure in the contemplation of Odette found a justification in his own system of aesthetic. He told himself that, in choosing the thought of Odette as the inspiration of his dreams of ideal happiness, he was not, as he had until then supposed, falling back, merely, upon an expedient of doubtful and certainly inadequate value, since she contained in herself what satisfied the utmost refinement of his taste in art. He failed to observe that this quality would not naturally avail to bring Odette into the category of women whom he found desirable, simply because his desires had always run counter to his aesthetic taste. The words 'Florentine painting' were invaluable to Swann. They enabled him (gave him, as it were, a legal title) to introduce the image of Odette into a world of dreams and fancies which, until then, she had been debarred from entering, and where she assumed a new and nobler form. And whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh, by perpetually reviving his misgivings as to the quality of her face, her figure, the whole of her beauty, used to cool the ardour of his love, those misgivings were swept away and that love confirmed now that he could re-erect his estimate of her on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles; while the kiss, the bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but moderately attractive, had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat withered flesh and sluggish blood, coming, as now they came, to crown his adoration of a masterpiece in a gallery, must, it seemed, prove as exquisite as they would be supernatural\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And when he was tempted to regret that, for months past, he had done nothing but visit Odette, he would assure himself that he was not unreasonable in giving up much of his time to the study of an inestimably precious work of art, cast for once in a new, a different, an especially charming metal, in an unmatched exemplar which he would contemplate at one moment with the humble, spiritual, disinterested mind of an artist, at another with the pride, the selfishness, the sensual thrill of a collector\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On his study table, at which he worked, he had placed, as it were a photograph of Odette, a reproduction of Jethro's Daughter. He would gaze in admiration at the large eyes, the delicate features in which the imperfection of her skin might be surmised, the marvellous locks of hair that fell along her tired cheeks; and, adapting what he had already felt to be beautiful, on aesthetic grounds, to the idea of a living woman, he converted it into a series of physical merits which he congratulated himself on finding assembled in the person of one whom he might, ultimately, possess. The vague feeling of sympathy which attracts a spectator to a work of art, now that he knew the type, in warm flesh and blood, of Jethro's Daughter, became a desire which more than compensated, thenceforward, for that with which Odette's physical charms had at first failed to inspire him. When he had sat for a long time gazing at the Botticelli, he would think of his own living Botticelli, who seemed all the lovelier in contrast, and as he drew towards him the photograph of Zipporah he would imagine that he was holding Odette against his heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not only Odette's indifference, however, that he must take pains to circumvent; it was also, not infrequently, his own; feeling that, since Odette had had every facility for seeing him, she seemed no longer to have very much to say to him when they did meet, he was afraid lest the manner\u2014at once trivial, monotonous, and seemingly unalterable\u2014which she now adopted when they were together should ultimately destroy in him that romantic hope, that a day might come when she would make avowal of her passion, by which hope alone he had become and would remain her lover. And so to alter, to give a fresh moral aspect to that Odette, of whose unchanging mood he was afraid of growing weary, he wrote, suddenly, a letter full of hinted discoveries and feigned indignation, which he sent off so that it should reach her before dinner-time. He knew that she would be frightened, and that she would reply, and he hoped that, when the fear of losing him clutched at her heart, it would force from her words such as he had never yet heard her utter: and he was right\u2014by repeating this device he had won from her the most affectionate letters that she had, so far, written him, one of them (which she had sent to him at midday by a special messenger from the Maison Dor\u00e9e\u2014it was the day of the Paris-Murcie F\u00eate given for the victims of the recent floods in Murcia) beginning \"My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write\u2014\u2014\"; and these letters he had kept in the same drawer as the withered chrysanthemum. Or else, if she had not had time to write, when he arrived at the Verdurins' she would come running up to him with an \"I've something to say to you!\" and he would gaze curiously at the revelation in her face and speech of what she had hitherto kept concealed from him of her heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even as he drew near to the Verdurins' door, and caught sight of the great lamp-lit spaces of the drawing-room windows, whose shutters were never closed, he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming creature whom he would see, as he entered the room, basking in that golden light. Here and there the figures of the guests stood out, sharp and black, between lamp and window, shutting off the light, like those little pictures which one sees sometimes pasted here and there upon a glass screen, whose other panes are mere transparencies. He would try to make out Odette. And then, when he was once inside, without thinking, his eyes sparkled suddenly with such radiant happiness that M. Verdurin said to the painter: \"H'm. Seems to be getting warm.\" Indeed, her presence gave the house what none other of the houses that he visited seemed to possess: a sort of tactual sense, a nervous system which ramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so the simple and regular manifestations of a social organism, namely the 'little clan,' were transformed for Swann into a series of daily encounters with Odette, and enabled him to feign indifference to the prospect of seeing her, or even a desire not to see her; in doing which he incurred no very great risk since, even although he had written to her during the day, he would of necessity see her in the evening and accompany her home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But one evening, when, irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark drive together, he had taken his other 'little girl' all the way to the Bois, so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at the Verdurins', he was so late in reaching them that Odette, supposing that he did not intend to come, had already left. Seeing the room bare of her, Swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish; he shook with the sense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began then for the first time to estimate, having always, hitherto, had that certainty of finding it whenever he would, which (as in the case of all our pleasures) reduced, if it did not altogether blind him to its dimensions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that she wasn't here?\" M. Verdurin asked his wife. \"I think we may say that he's hooked.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The face he pulled?\" exploded Dr. Cottard who, having left the house for a moment to visit a patient, had just returned to fetch his wife and did not know whom they were discussing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"D'you mean to say you didn't meet him on the doorstep\u2014the loveliest of Swanns?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No. M. Swann has been here?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just for a moment. We had a glimpse of a Swann tremendously agitated. In a state of nerves. You see, Odette had left.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You mean to say that she has gone the 'whole hog' with him; that she has 'burned her boats'?\" inquired the Doctor cautiously, testing the meaning of his phrases\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, of course not; there's absolutely nothing in it; in fact, between you and me, I think she's making a great mistake, and behaving like a silly little fool, which she is, incidentally.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Come, come, come!\" said M. Verdurin, \"How on earth do you know that there's 'nothing in it'? We haven't been there to see, have we now?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She would have told me,\" answered Mme. Verdurin with dignity. \"I may say that she tells me everything. As she has no one else at present, I told her that she ought to live with him. She makes out that she can't; she admits, she was immensely attracted by him, at first; but he's always shy with her, and that makes her shy with him. Besides, she doesn't care for him in that way, she says; it's an ideal love, 'Platonic,' you know; she's afraid of rubbing the bloom off\u2014oh, I don't know half the things she says, how should I? And yet he's exactly the sort of man she wants.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I beg to differ from you,\" M. Verdurin courteously interrupted. \"I am only half satisfied with the gentleman. I feel that he 'poses.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin's whole body stiffened, her eyes stared blankly as though she had suddenly been turned into a statue; a device by means of which she might be supposed not to have caught the sound of that unutterable word which seemed to imply that it was possible for people to 'pose' in her house, and, therefore, that there were people in the world who 'mattered more' than herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Anyhow, if there is nothing in it, I don't suppose it's because our friend believes in her virtue. And yet, you never know; he seems to believe in her intelligence. I don't know whether you heard the way he lectured her the other evening about Vinteuil's sonata. I am devoted to Odette, but really\u2014to expound theories of aesthetic to her\u2014the man must be a prize idiot.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Look here, I won't have you saying nasty things about Odette,\" broke in Mme. Verdurin in her 'spoiled child' manner. \"She is charming.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There's no reason why she shouldn't be charming; we are not saying anything nasty about her, only that she is not the embodiment of either virtue or intellect. After all,\" he turned to the painter, \"does it matter so very much whether she is virtuous or not? You can't tell; she might be a great deal less charming if she were.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the landing Swann had run into the Verdurins' butler, who had been somewhere else a moment earlier, when he arrived, and who had been asked by Odette to tell Swann (but that was at least an hour ago) that she would probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at Pr\u00e9vost's on her way home. Swann set off at once for Pr\u00e9vost's, but every few yards his carriage was held up by others, or by people crossing the street, loathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath his wheels, were it not that a policeman fumbling with a note-book would delay him even longer than the actual passage of the pedestrian. He counted the minutes feverishly, adding a few seconds to each so as to be quite certain that he had not given himself short measure, and so, possibly, exaggerated whatever chance there might actually be of his arriving at Pr\u00e9vost's in time, and of finding her still there. And then, in a moment of illumination, like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep and is conscious of the absurdity of the dream-shapes among which his mind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself and them, Swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the thoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard at the Verdurins' that Odette had left, how novel the heartache from which he was suffering, but of which he was only now conscious, as though he had just woken up. What! all this disturbance simply because he would not see Odette, now, till to-morrow, exactly what he had been hoping, not an hour before, as he drove toward Mme. Verdurin's. He was obliged to admit also that now, as he sat in the same carriage and drove to Pr\u00e9vost's, he was no longer the same man, was no longer alone even\u2014but that a new personality was there beside him, adhering to him, amalgamated with him, a creature from whom he might, perhaps, be unable to liberate himself, towards whom he might have to adopt some such stratagem as one uses to outwit a master or a malady. And yet, during this last moment in which he had felt that another, a fresh personality was thus conjoined with his own, life had seemed, somehow, more interesting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at Pr\u00e9vost's (the tension of waiting for which so ravished, stripped so bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea, not one memory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take shelter and repose) would probably, after all, should it take place, be much the same as all their meetings, of no great importance. As on every other evening, once he was in Odette's company, once he had begun to cast furtive glances at her changing countenance, and instantly to withdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of desire and believe no more in his indifference, he would cease to be able even to think of her, so busy would he be in the search for pretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately, and to assure himself, without betraying his concern, that he would find her again, next evening, at the Verdurins'; pretexts, that is to say, which would enable him to prolong for the time being, and to renew for one day more the disappointment, the torturing deception that must always come to him with the vain presence of this woman, whom he might approach, yet never dared embrace\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was not at Prevost's; he must search for her, then, in every restaurant upon the boulevards. To save time, while he went in one direction, he sent in the other his coachman R\u00e9mi (Rizzo's Doge Loredan) for whom he presently\u2014after a fruitless search\u2014found himself waiting at the spot where the carriage was to meet him. It did not appear, and Swann tantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching moment, as one in which R\u00e9mi would say to him: \"Sir, the lady is there,\" or as one in which R\u00e9mi would say to him: \"Sir, the lady was not in any of the caf\u00e9s.\" And so he saw himself faced by the close of his evening\u2014a thing uniform, and yet bifurcated by the intervening accident which would either put an end to his agony by discovering Odette, or would oblige him to abandon any hope of finding her that night, to accept the necessity of returning home without having seen her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The coachman returned; but, as he drew up opposite him, Swann asked, not \"Did you find the lady?\" but \"Remind me, to-morrow, to order in some more firewood. I am sure we must be running short.\" Perhaps he had persuaded himself that, if R\u00e9mi had at last found Odette in some caf\u00e9, where she was waiting for him still, then his night of misery was already obliterated by the realisation, begun already in his mind, of a night of joy, and that there was no need for him to hasten towards the attainment of a happiness already captured and held in a safe place, which would not escape his grasp again. But it was also by the force of inertia; there was in his soul that want of adaptability which can be seen in the bodies of certain people who, when the moment comes to avoid a collision, to snatch their clothes out of reach of a flame, or to perform any other such necessary movement, take their time (as the saying is), begin by remaining for a moment in their original position, as though seeking to find in it a starting-point, a source of strength and motion. And probably, if the coachman had interrupted him with, \"I have found the lady,\" he would have answered, \"Oh, yes, of course; that's what I told you to do. I had quite forgotten,\" and would have continued to discuss his supply of firewood, so as to hide from his servant the emotion that he had felt, and to give himself time to break away from the thraldom of his anxieties and abandon himself to pleasure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The coachman came back, however, with the report that he could not find her anywhere, and added the advice, as an old and privileged servant, \"I think, sir, that all we can do now is to go home.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the air of indifference which Swann could so lightly assume when R\u00e9mi uttered his final, unalterable response, fell from him like a cast-off cloak when he saw R\u00e9mi attempt to make him abandon hope and retire from the quest\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Certainly not!\" he exclaimed. \"We must find the lady. It is most important. She would be extremely put out\u2014it's a business matter\u2014and vexed with me if she didn't see me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I do not see how the lady can be vexed, sir,\" answered R\u00e9mi, \"since it was she that went away without waiting for you, sir, and said she was going to Pr\u00e9vost's, and then wasn't there.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the restaurants were closing, and their lights began to go out. Under the trees of the boulevards there were still a few people strolling to and fro, barely distinguishable in the gathering darkness. Now and then the ghost of a woman glided up to Swann, murmured a few words in his ear, asked him to take her home, and left him shuddering. Anxiously he explored every one of these vaguely seen shapes, as though among the phantoms of the dead, in the realms of darkness, he had been searching for a lost Eurydice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among all the methods by which love is brought into being, among all the agents which disseminate that blessed bane, there are few so efficacious as the great gust of agitation which, now and then, sweeps over the human spirit. For then the creature in whose company we are seeking amusement at the moment, her lot is cast, her fate and ours decided, that is the creature whom we shall henceforward love. It is not necessary that she should have pleased us, up till then, any more, or even as much as others. All that is necessary is that our taste for her should become exclusive. And that condition is fulfilled so soon as\u2014in the moment when she has failed to meet us\u2014for the pleasure which we were on the point of enjoying in her charming company is abruptly substituted an anxious torturing desire, whose object is the creature herself, an irrational, absurd desire, which the laws of civilised society make it impossible to satisfy and difficult to assuage\u2014the insensate, agonising desire to possess her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann made R\u00e9mi drive him to such restaurants as were still open; it was the sole hypothesis, now, of that happiness which he had contemplated so calmly; he no longer concealed his agitation, the price he set upon their meeting, and promised, in case of success, to reward his coachman, as though, by inspiring in him a will to triumph which would reinforce his own, he could bring it to pass, by a miracle, that Odette\u2014assuming that she had long since gone home to bed,\u2014might yet be found seated in some restaurant on the boulevards. He pursued the quest as far as the Maison Dor\u00e9e, burst twice into Tortoni's and, still without catching sight of her, was emerging from the Caf\u00e9 Anglais, striding with haggard gaze towards his carriage, which was waiting for him at the corner of the Boulevard des Italiens, when he collided with a person coming in the opposite direction; it was Odette; she explained, later, that there had been no room at Pr\u00e9vost's, that she had gone, instead, to sup at the Maison Dor\u00e9e, and had been sitting there in an alcove where he must have overlooked her, and that she was now looking for her carriage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had so little expected to see him that she started back in alarm. As for him, he had ransacked the streets of Paris, not that he supposed it possible that he should find her, but because he would have suffered even more cruelly by abandoning the attempt. But now the joy (which, his reason had never ceased to assure him, was not, that evening at least, to be realised) was suddenly apparent, and more real than ever before; for he himself had contributed nothing to it by anticipating probabilities,\u2014it remained integral and external to himself; there was no need for him to draw on his own resources to endow it with truth\u2014'twas from itself that there emanated, 'twas itself that projected towards him that truth whose glorious rays melted and scattered like the cloud of a dream the sense of loneliness which had lowered over him, that truth upon which he had supported, nay founded, albeit unconsciously, his vision of bliss. So will a traveller, who has come down, on a day of glorious weather, to the Mediterranean shore, and is doubtful whether they still exist, those lands which he has left, let his eyes be dazzled, rather than cast a backward glance, by the radiance streaming towards him from the luminous and unfading azure at his feet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting, and ordered his own to follow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had in her hand a bunch of cattleyas, and Swann could see, beneath the film of lace that covered her head, more of the same flowers fastened to a swansdown plume. She was wearing, under her cloak, a flowing gown of black velvet, caught up on one side so as to reveal a large triangular patch of her white silk skirt, with an 'insertion,' also of white silk, in the cleft of her low-necked bodice, in which were fastened a few more cattleyas. She had scarcely recovered from the shock which the sight of Swann had given her, when some obstacle made the horse start to one side. They were thrown forward from their seats; she uttered a cry, and fell back quivering and breathless\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's all right,\" he assured her, \"don't be frightened.\" And he slipped his arm round her shoulder, supporting her body against his own; then went on: \"Whatever you do, don't utter a word; just make a sign, yes or no, or you'll be out of breath again. You won't mind if I put the flowers straight on your bodice; the jolt has loosened them. I'm afraid of their dropping out; I'm just going to fasten them a little more securely.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was not used to being treated with so much formality by men, and smiled as she answered: \"No, not at all; I don't mind in the least.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he, chilled a little by her answer, perhaps, also, to bear out the pretence that he had been sincere in adopting the stratagem, or even because he was already beginning to believe that he had been, exclaimed: \"No, no; you mustn't speak. You will be out of breath again. You can easily answer in signs; I shall understand. Really and truly now, you don't mind my doing this? Look, there is a little\u2014I think it must be pollen, spilt over your dress,\u2014may I brush it off with my hand? That's not too hard; I'm not hurting you, am I? I'm tickling you, perhaps, a little; but I don't want to touch the velvet in case I rub it the wrong way. But, don't you see, I really had to fasten the flowers; they would have fallen out if I hadn't. Like that, now; if I just push them a little farther down.... Seriously, I'm not annoying you, am I? And if I just sniff them to see whether they've really lost all their scent? I don't believe I ever smelt any before; may I? Tell the truth, now.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still smiling, she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly, as who should say, \"You're quite mad; you know very well that I like it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He slipped his other hand upwards along Odette's cheek; she fixed her eyes on him with that languishing and solemn air which marks the women of the old Florentine's paintings, in whose faces he had found the type of hers; swimming at the brink of her fringed lids, her brilliant eyes, large and finely drawn as theirs, seemed on the verge of breaking from her face and rolling down her cheeks like two great tears. She bent her neck, as all their necks may be seen to bend, in the pagan scenes as well as in the scriptural. And although her attitude was, doubtless, habitual and instinctive, one which she knew to be appropriate to such moments, and was careful not to forget to assume, she seemed to need all her strength to hold her face back, as though some invisible force were drawing it down towards Swann's. And Swann it was who, before she allowed her face, as though despite her efforts, to fall upon his lips, held it back for a moment longer, at a little distance between his hands. He had intended to leave time for her mind to overtake her body's movements, to recognise the dream which she had so long cherished and to assist at its realisation, like a mother invited as a spectator when a prize is given to the child whom she has reared and loves. Perhaps, moreover, Swann himself was fixing upon these features of an Odette not yet possessed, not even kissed by him, on whom he was looking now for the last time, that comprehensive gaze with which, on the day of his departure, a traveller strives to bear away with him in memory the view of a country to which he may never return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he was so shy in approaching her that, after this evening which had begun by his arranging her cattleyas and had ended in her complete surrender, whether from fear of chilling her, or from reluctance to appear, even retrospectively, to have lied, or perhaps because he lacked the audacity to formulate a more urgent requirement than this (which could always be repeated, since it had not annoyed her on the first occasion), he resorted to the same pretext on the following days. If she had any cattleyas pinned to her bodice, he would say: \"It is most unfortunate; the cattleyas don't need tucking in this evening; they've not been disturbed as they were the other night; I think, though, that this one isn't quite straight. May I see if they have more scent than the others?\" Or else, if she had none: \"Oh! no cattleyas this evening; then there's nothing for me to arrange.\" So that for some time there was no change from the procedure which he had followed on that first evening, when he had started by touching her throat, with his fingers first and then with his lips, but their caresses began invariably with this modest exploration. And long afterwards, when the arrangement (or, rather, the ritual pretence of an arrangement) of her cattleyas had quite fallen into desuetude, the metaphor \"Do a cattleya,\" transmuted into a simple verb which they would employ without a thought of its original meaning when they wished to refer to the act of physical possession (in which, paradoxically, the possessor possesses nothing), survived to commemorate in their vocabulary the long forgotten custom from which it sprang. And yet possibly this particular manner of saying \"to make love\" had not the precise significance of its synonyms. However disillusioned we may be about women, however we may regard the possession of even the most divergent types as an invariable and monotonous experience, every detail of which is known and can be described in advance, it still becomes a fresh and stimulating pleasure if the women concerned be\u2014or be thought to be\u2014so difficult as to oblige us to base our attack upon some unrehearsed incident in our relations with them, as was originally for Swann the arrangement of the cattleyas. He trembled as he hoped, that evening, (but Odette, he told himself, if she were deceived by his stratagem, could not guess his intention) that it was the possession of this woman that would emerge for him from their large and richly coloured petals; and the pleasure which he already felt, and which Odette tolerated, he thought, perhaps only because she was not yet aware of it herself, seemed to him for that reason\u2014as it might have seemed to the first man when he enjoyed it amid the flowers of the earthly paradise\u2014a pleasure which had never before existed, which he was striving now to create, a pleasure\u2014and the special name which he was to give to it preserved its identity\u2014entirely individual and new\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ice once broken, every evening, when he had taken her home, he must follow her into the house; and often she would come out again in her dressing-gown, and escort him to his carriage, and would kiss him before the eyes of his coachman, saying: \"What on earth does it matter what people see?\" And on evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins' (which happened occasionally, now that he had opportunities of meeting Odette elsewhere), when\u2014more and more rarely\u2014he went into society, she would beg him to come to her on his way home, however late he might be. The season was spring, the nights clear and frosty. He would come away from an evening party, jump into his victoria, spread a rug over his knees, tell the friends who were leaving at the same time, and who insisted on his going home with them, that he could not, that he was not going in their direction; then the coachman would start off at a fast trot without further orders, knowing quite well where he had to go. His friends would be left marvelling, and, as a matter of fact, Swann was no longer the same man. No one ever received a letter from him now demanding an introduction to a woman. He had ceased to pay any attention to women, and kept away from the places in which they were ordinarily to be met. In a restaurant, or in the country, his manner was deliberately and directly the opposite of that by which, only a few days earlier, his friends would have recognised him, that manner which had seemed permanently and unalterably his own. To such an extent does passion manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character, which not only takes the place of our normal character but actually obliterates the signs by which that character has hitherto been discernible. On the other hand, there was one thing that was, now, invariable, namely that wherever Swann might be spending the evening, he never failed to go on afterwards to Odette. The interval of space separating her from him was one which he must as inevitably traverse as he must descend, by an irresistible gravitation, the steep slope of life itself. To be frank, as often as not, when he had stayed late at a party, he would have preferred to return home at once, without going so far out of his way, and to postpone their meeting until the morrow; but the very fact of his putting himself to such inconvenience at an abnormal hour in order to visit her, while he guessed that his friends, as he left them, were saying to one another: \"He is tied hand and foot; there must certainly be a woman somewhere who insists on his going to her at all hours,\" made him feel that he was leading the life of the class of men whose existence is coloured by a love-affair, and in whom the perpetual sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical interests has engendered a spiritual charm. Then, though he may not consciously have taken this into consideration, the certainty that she was waiting for him, that she was not anywhere or with anyone else, that he would see her before he went home, drew the sting from that anguish, forgotten, it is true, but latent and ever ready to be reawakened, which he had felt on the evening when Odette had left the Verdurins' before his arrival, an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable that it might even be called a state of happiness. Perhaps it was to that hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which Odette had since assumed in his life. Other people are, as a rule, so immaterial to us that, when we have entrusted to any one of them the power to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves, that person seems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with poetry, makes of our lives a vast expanse, quick with sensation, on which that person and ourselves are ever more or less in contact. Swann could not without anxiety ask himself what Odette would mean to him in the years that were to come. Sometimes, as he looked up from his victoria on those fine and frosty nights of early spring, and saw the dazzling moonbeams fall between his eyes and the deserted streets, he would think of that other face, gleaming and faintly roseate like the moon's, which had, one day, risen on the horizon of his mind and since then had shed upon the world that mysterious light in which he saw it bathed. If he arrived after the hour at which Odette sent her servants to bed, before ringing the bell at the gate of her little garden, he would go round first into the other street, over which, at the ground-level, among the windows (all exactly alike, but darkened) of the adjoining houses, shone the solitary lighted window of her room. He would rap upon the pane, and she would hear the signal, and answer, before running to meet him at the gate. He would find, lying open on the piano, some of her favourite music, the Valse des Roses, the Pauvre Fou of Tagliafico (which, according to the instructions embodied in her will, was to be played at her funeral); but he would ask her, instead, to give him the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. It was true that Odette played vilely, but often the fairest impression that remains in our minds of a favourite air is one which has arisen out of a jumble of wrong notes struck by unskilful fingers upon a tuneless piano. The little phrase was associated still, in Swann's mind, with his love for Odette. He felt clearly that this love was something to which there were no corresponding external signs, whose meaning could not be proved by any but himself; he realised, too, that Odette's qualities were not such as to justify his setting so high a value on the hours he spent in her company. And often, when the cold government of reason stood unchallenged, he would readily have ceased to sacrifice so many of his intellectual and social interests to this imaginary pleasure. But the little phrase, as soon as it struck his ear, had the power to liberate in him the room that was needed to contain it; the proportions of Swann's soul were altered; a margin was left for a form of enjoyment which corresponded no more than his love for Odette to any external object, and yet was not, like his enjoyment of that love, purely individual, but assumed for him an objective reality superior to that of other concrete things. This thirst for an untasted charm, the little phrase would stimulate it anew in him, but without bringing him any definite gratification to assuage it. With the result that those parts of Swann's soul in which the little phrase had obliterated all care for material interests, those human considerations which affect all men alike, were left bare by it, blank pages on which he was at liberty to inscribe the name of Odette. Moreover, where Odette's affection might seem ever so little abrupt and disappointing, the little phrase would come to supplement it, to amalgamate with it its own mysterious essence. Watching Swann's face while he listened to the phrase, one would have said that he was inhaling an anaesthetic which allowed him to breathe more deeply. And the pleasure which the music gave him, which was shortly to create in him a real longing, was in fact closely akin, at such moments, to the pleasure which he would have derived from experimenting with perfumes, from entering into contract with a world for which we men were not created, which appears to lack form because our eyes cannot perceive it, to lack significance because it escapes our intelligence, to which we may attain by way of one sense only. Deep repose, mysterious refreshment for Swann,\u2014for him whose eyes, although delicate interpreters of painting, whose mind, although an acute observer of manners, must bear for ever the indelible imprint of the barrenness of his life,\u2014to feel himself transformed into a creature foreign to humanity, blinded, deprived of his logical faculty, almost a fantastic unicorn, a chimaera-like creature conscious of the world through his two ears alone. And as, notwithstanding, he sought in the little phrase for a meaning to which his intelligence could not descend, with what a strange frenzy of intoxication must he strip bare his innermost soul of the whole armour of reason, and make it pass, unattended, through the straining vessel, down into the dark filter of sound. He began to reckon up how much that was painful, perhaps even how much secret and unappeased sorrow underlay the sweetness of the phrase; and yet to him it brought no suffering. What matter though the phrase repeated that love is frail and fleeting, when his love was so strong! He played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused, he felt it stealing over him, but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened his sense of his own happiness. He would make Odette play him the phrase again, ten, twenty times on end, insisting that, while she played, she must never cease to kiss him. Every kiss provokes another. Ah, in those earliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life. How closely, in their abundance, are they pressed one against another; until lovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour, as to count the flowers in a meadow in May. Then she would pretend to stop, saying: \"How do you expect me to play when you keep on holding me? I can't do everything at once. Make up your mind what you want; am I to play the phrase or do you want to play with me?\" Then he would become annoyed, and she would burst out with a laugh which, was transformed, as it left her lips, and descended upon him in a shower of kisses. Or else she would look at him sulkily, and he would see once again a face worthy to figure in Botticelli's 'Life of Moses,' he would place it there, giving to Odette's neck the necessary inclination; and when he had finished her portrait in distemper, in the fifteenth century, on the wall of the Sixtine, the idea that she was, none the less, in the room with him still, by the piano, at that very moment, ready to be kissed and won, the idea of her material existence, of her being alive, would sweep over him with so violent an intoxication that, with eyes starting from his head and jaws that parted as though to devour her, he would fling himself upon this Botticelli maiden and kiss and bite her cheeks. And then, as soon as he had left the house, not without returning to kiss her once again, because he had forgotten to take away with him, in memory, some detail of her fragrance or of her features, while he drove home in his victoria, blessing the name of Odette who allowed him to pay her these daily visits, which, although they could not, he felt, bring any great happiness to her, still, by keeping him immune from the fever of jealousy\u2014by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak of the heart-sickness which had manifested itself in him that evening, when he had failed to find her at the Verdurins'\u2014might help him to arrive, without any recurrence of those crises, of which the first had been so distressing that it must also be the last, at the termination of this strange series of hours in his life, hours almost enchanted, in the same manner as these other, following hours, in which he drove through a deserted Paris by the light of the moon: noticing as he drove home that the satellite had now changed its position, relatively to his own, and was almost touching the horizon; feeling that his love, also, was obedient to these immutable laws of nature, he asked himself whether this period, upon which he had entered, was to last much longer, whether presently his mind's eye would cease to behold that dear countenance, save as occupying a distant and diminished position, and on the verge of ceasing to shed on him the radiance of its charm. For Swann was finding in things once more, since he had fallen in love, the charm that he had found when, in his adolescence, he had fancied himself an artist; with this difference, that what charm lay in them now was conferred by Odette alone. He could feel reawakening in himself the inspirations of his boyhood, which had been dissipated among the frivolities of his later life, but they all bore, now, the reflection, the stamp of a particular being; and during the long hours which he now found a subtle pleasure in spending at home, alone with his convalescent spirit, he became gradually himself again, but himself in thraldom to another\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He went to her only in the evenings, and knew nothing of how she spent her time during the day, any more than he knew of her past; so little, indeed, that he had not even the tiny, initial clue which, by allowing us to imagine what we do not know, stimulates a desire foreknowledge. And so he never asked himself what she might be doing, or what her life had been. Only he smiled sometimes at the thought of how, some years earlier, when he still did not know her, some one had spoken to him of a woman who, if he remembered rightly, must certainly have been Odette, as of a 'tart,' a 'kept' woman, one of those women to whom he still attributed (having lived but little in their company) the entire set of characteristics, fundamentally perverse, with which they had been, for many years, endowed by the imagination of certain novelists. He would say to himself that one has, as often as not, only to take the exact counterpart of the reputation created by the world in order to judge a person fairly, when with such a character he contrasted that of Odette, so good, so simple, so enthusiastic in the pursuit of ideals, so nearly incapable of not telling the truth that, when he had once begged her, so that they might dine together alone, to write to Mme. Verdurin, saying that she was unwell, the next day he had seen her, face to face with Mme. Verdurin, who asked whether she had recovered, blushing, stammering, and, in spite of herself, revealing in every feature how painful, what a torture it was to her to act a lie; and, while in her answer she multiplied the fictitious details of an imaginary illness, seeming to ask pardon, by her suppliant look and her stricken accents, for the obvious falsehood of her words\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On certain days, however, though these came seldom, she would call upon him in the afternoon, to interrupt his musings or the essay on Ver-meer to which he had latterly returned. His servant would come in to say that Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy was in the small drawing-room. He would go in search of her, and, when he opened the door, on Odette's blushing countenance, as soon as she caught sight of Swann, would appear\u2014changing the curve of her lips, the look in her eyes, the moulding of her cheeks\u2014an all-absorbing smile. Once he was left alone he would see again that smile, and her smile of the day before, another with which she had greeted him sometime else, the smile which had been her answer, in the carriage that night, when he had asked her whether she objected to his rearranging her cattleyas; and the life of Odette at all other times, since he knew nothing of it, appeared to him upon a neutral and colourless background, like those sheets of sketches by Watteau upon which one sees, here and there, in every corner and in all directions, traced in three colours upon the buff paper, innumerable smiles. But, once in a while, illuminating a chink of that existence which Swann still saw as a complete blank, even if his mind assured him that it was not so, because he was unable to imagine anything that might occupy it, some friend who knew them both, and suspecting that they were in love, had not dared to tell him anything about her that was of the least importance, would describe Odette's figure, as he had seen her, that very morning, going on foot up the Rue Abbattucci, in a cape trimmed with skunks, wearing a Rembrandt hat, and a bunch of violets in her bosom. This simple outline reduced Swann to utter confusion by enabling him suddenly to perceive that Odette had an existence which was not wholly subordinated to his own; he burned to know whom she had been seeking to fascinate by this costume in which he had never seen her; he registered a vow to insist upon her telling him where she had been going at that intercepted moment, as though, in all the colourless life\u2014a life almost nonexistent, since she was then invisible to him\u2014of his mistress, there had been but a single incident apart from all those smiles directed towards himself; namely, her walking abroad beneath a Rembrandt hat, with a bunch of violets in her bosom\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except when he asked her for Vinteuil's little phrase instead of the Valse des Roses, Swann made no effort to induce her to play the things that he himself preferred, nor, in literature any more than in music, to correct the manifold errors of her taste. He fully realised that she was not intelligent. When she said how much she would like him to tell her about the great poets, she had imagined that she would suddenly get to know whole pages of romantic and heroic verse, in the style of the Vicomte de Borelli, only even more moving. As for Vermeer of Delft, she asked whether he had been made to suffer by a woman, if it was a woman that had inspired him, and once Swann had told her that no one knew, she had lost all interest in that painter. She would often say: \"I'm sure, poetry; well, of course, there'd be nothing like it if it was all true, if the poets really believed the things they said. But as often as not you'll find there's no one so mean and calculating as those fellows. I know something about poetry. I had a friend, once, who was in love with a poet of sorts. In his verses he never spoke of anything but love, and heaven, and the stars. Oh! she was properly taken in! He had more than three hundred thousand francs out of her before he'd finished.\" If, then, Swann tried to shew her in what artistic beauty consisted, how one ought to appreciate poetry or painting, after a minute or two she would cease to listen, saying: \"Yes... I never thought it would be like that.\" And he felt that her disappointment was so great that he preferred to lie to her, assuring her that what he had said was nothing, that he had only touched the surface, that he had not time to go into it all properly, that there was more in it than that. Then she would interrupt with a brisk, \"More in it? What?... Do tell me!\", but he did not tell her, for he realised how petty it would appear to her, and how different from what she had expected, less sensational and less touching; he was afraid, too, lest, disillusioned in the matter of art, she might at the same time be disillusioned in the greater matter of love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the result that she found Swann inferior, intellectually, to what she had supposed. \"You're always so reserved; I can't make you out.\" She marvelled increasingly at his indifference to money, at his courtesy to everyone alike, at the delicacy of his mind. And indeed it happens, often enough, to a greater man than Swann ever was, to a scientist or artist, when he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom he lives, that the feeling in them which proves that they have been convinced of the superiority of his intellect is created not by any admiration for his ideas\u2014for those are entirely beyond them\u2014but by their respect for what they term his good qualities. There was also the respect with which Odette was inspired by the thought of Swann's social position, although she had no desire that he should attempt to secure invitations for herself. Perhaps she felt that such attempts would be bound to fail; perhaps, indeed, she feared lest, merely by speaking of her to his friends, he should provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind. The fact remains that she had consistently held him to his promise never to mention her name. Her reason for not wishing to go into society was, she had told him, a quarrel which she had had, long ago, with another girl, who had avenged herself by saying nasty things about her. \"But,\" Swann objected, \"surely, people don't all know your friend.\" \"Yes, don't you see, it's like a spot of oil; people are so horrid.\" Swann was unable, frankly, to appreciate this point; on the other hand, he knew that such generalisations as \"People are so horrid,\" and \"A word of scandal spreads like a spot of oil,\" were generally accepted as true; there must, therefore, be cases to which they were literally applicable. Could Odette's case be one of these? He teased himself with the question, though not for long, for he too was subject to that mental oppression which had so weighed upon his father, whenever he was faced by a difficult problem. In any event, that world of society which concealed such terrors for Odette inspired her, probably, with no very great longing to enter it, since it was too far removed from the world which she already knew for her to be able to form any clear conception of it. At the same time, while in certain respects she had retained a genuine simplicity (she had, for instance, kept up a friendship with a little dressmaker, now retired from business, up whose steep and dark and fetid staircase she clambered almost every day), she still thirsted to be in the fashion, though her idea of it was not altogether that held by fashionable people. For the latter, fashion is a thing that emanates from a comparatively small number of leaders, who project it to a considerable distance\u2014with more or less strength according as one is nearer to or farther from their intimate centre\u2014over the widening circle of their friends and the friends of their friends, whose names form a sort of tabulated index. People 'in society' know this index by heart, they are gifted in such matters with an erudition from which they have extracted a sort of taste, of tact, so automatic in its operation that Swann, for example, without needing to draw upon his knowledge of the world, if he read in a newspaper the names of the people who had been guests at a dinner, could tell at once how fashionable the dinner had been, just as a man of letters, merely by reading a phrase, can estimate exactly the literary merit of its author. But Odette was one of those persons (an extremely numerous class, whatever the fashionable world may think, and to be found in every section of society) who do not share this knowledge, but imagine fashion to be something of quite another kind, which assumes different aspects according to the circle to which they themselves belong, but has the special characteristic\u2014common alike to the fashion of which Odette used to dream and to that before which Mme. Cottard bowed\u2014of being directly accessible to all. The other kind, the fashion of 'fashionable people,' is, it must be admitted, accessible also; but there are inevitable delays. Odette would say of some one: \"He never goes to any place that isn't really smart.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if Swann were to ask her what she meant by that, she would answer, with a touch of contempt, \"Smart places! Why, good heavens, just fancy, at your age, having to be told what the smart places are in Paris! What do you expect me to say? Well, on Sunday mornings there's the Avenue de l'Imp\u00e9ratrice, and round the lake at five o'clock, and on Thursdays the Eden-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, and the Hippodrome on Fridays; then there are the balls...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What balls?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, silly, the balls people give in Paris; the smart ones, I mean. Wait now, Herbinger, you know who I mean, the fellow who's in one of the jobbers' offices; yes, of course, you must know him, he's one of the best-known men in Paris, that great big fair-haired boy who wears such swagger clothes; he always has a flower in his buttonhole and a light-coloured overcoat with a fold down the back; he goes about with that old image, takes her to all the first-nights. Very well! He gave a ball the other night, and all the smart people in Paris were there. I should have loved to go! but you had to shew your invitation at the door, and I couldn't get one anywhere. After all, I'm just as glad, now, that I didn't go; I should have been killed in the crush, and seen nothing. Still, just to be able to say one had been to Herbinger's ball. You know how vain I am! However, you may be quite certain that half the people who tell you they were there are telling stories.... But I am surprised that you weren't there, a regular 'tip-topper' like you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann made no attempt, however, to modify this conception of fashion; feeling that his own came no nearer to the truth, was just as fatuous, devoid of all importance, he saw no advantage to be gained by imparting it to his mistress, with the result that, after a few months, she ceased to take any interest in the people to whose houses he went, except when they were the means of his obtaining tickets for the paddock at race-meetings or first-nights at the theatre. She hoped that he would continue to cultivate such profitable acquaintances, but she had come to regard them as less smart since the day when she had passed the Marquise de Villeparisis in the street, wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet with strings\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But she looks like a pew-opener, like an old charwoman, darling! That a marquise! Goodness knows I'm not a marquise, but you'd have to pay me a lot of money before you'd get me to go about Paris rigged out like that!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor could she understand Swann's continuing to live in his house on the Quai d'Orl\u00e9ans, which, though she dared not tell him so, she considered unworthy of him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was true that she claimed to be fond of 'antiques,' and used to assume a rapturous and knowing air when she confessed how she loved to spend the whole day 'rummaging' in second-hand shops, hunting for 'bric-\u00e0-brac,' and things of the 'right date.' Although it was a point of honour, to which she obstinately clung, as though obeying some old family custom, that she should never answer any questions, never give any account of what she did during the daytime, she spoke to Swann once about a friend to whose house she had been invited, and had found that everything in it was 'of the period.' Swann could not get her to tell him what 'period' it was. Only after thinking the matter over she replied that it was 'mediaeval'; by which she meant that the walls were panelled. Some time later she spoke to him again of her friend, and added, in the hesitating but confident tone in which one refers to a person whom one has met somewhere, at dinner, the night before, of whom one had never heard until then, but whom one's hosts seemed to regard as some one so celebrated and important that one hopes that one's listener will know quite well who is meant, and will be duly impressed: \"Her dining-room... is... eighteenth century!\" Incidentally, she had thought it hideous, all bare, as though the house were still unfinished; women looked frightful in it, and it would never become the fashion. She mentioned it again, a third time, when she shewed Swann a card with the name and address of the man who had designed the dining-room, and whom she wanted to send for, when she had enough money, to see whether he could not do one for her too; not one like that, of course, but one of the sort she used to dream of, one which, unfortunately, her little house would not be large enough to contain, with tall sideboards, Renaissance furniture and fireplaces like the Ch\u00e2teau at Blois. It was on this occasion that she let out to Swann what she really thought of his abode on the Quai d'Orl\u00e9ans; he having ventured the criticism that her friend had indulged, not in the Louis XVI style, for, he went on, although that was not, of course, done, still it might be made charming, but in the 'Sham-Antique.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You wouldn't have her live, like you, among a lot of broken-down chairs and threadbare carpets!\" she exclaimed, the innate respectability of the middle-class housewife rising impulsively to the surface through the acquired dilettantism of the 'light woman.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People who enjoyed 'picking-up' things, who admired poetry, despised sordid calculations of profit and loss, and nourished ideals of honour and love, she placed in a class by themselves, superior to the rest of humanity. There was no need actually to have those tastes, provided one talked enough about them; when a man had told her at dinner that he loved to wander about and get his hands all covered with dust in the old furniture shops, that he would never be really appreciated in this commercial age, since he was not concerned about the things that interested it, and that he belonged to another generation altogether, she would come home saying: \"Why, he's an adorable creature; so sensitive! I had no idea,\" and she would conceive for him a strong and sudden friendship. But, on the other hand, men who, like Swann, had these tastes but did not speak of them, left her cold. She was obliged, of course, to admit that Swann was most generous with his money, but she would add, pouting: \"It's not the same thing, you see, with him,\" and, as a matter of fact, what appealed to her imagination was not the practice of disinterestedness, but its vocabulary\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling that, often, he could not give her in reality the pleasures of which she dreamed, he tried at least to ensure that she should be happy in his company, tried not to contradict those vulgar ideas, that bad taste which she displayed on every possible occasion, which all the same he loved, as he could not help loving everything that came from her, which even fascinated him, for were they not so many more of those characteristic features, by virtue of which the essential qualities of the woman emerged, and were made visible? And so, when she was in a happy mood because she was going to see the Reine Topaze, or when her eyes grew serious, troubled, petulant, if she was afraid of missing the flower-show, or merely of not being in time for tea, with muffins and toast, at the Rue Royale tea-rooms, where she believed that regular attendance was indispensable, and set the seal upon a woman's certificate of 'smartness,' Swann, enraptured, as all of us are, at times, by the natural behaviour of a child, or by the likeness of a portrait, which appears to be on the point of speaking, would feel so distinctly the soul of his mistress rising to fill the outlines of her face that he could not refrain from going across and welcoming it with his lips. \"Oh, then, so little Odette wants us to take her to the flower-show, does she? she wants to be admired, does she? very well, we will take her there, we can but obey her wishes.\" As Swann's sight was beginning to fail, he had to resign himself to a pair of spectacles, which he wore at home, when working, while to face the world he adopted a single eyeglass, as being less disfiguring. The first time that she saw it in his eye, she could not contain herself for joy: \"I really do think\u2014for a man, that is to say\u2014it is tremendously smart! How nice you look with it! Every inch a gentleman. All you want now is a title!\" she concluded, with a tinge of regret in her voice. He liked Odette to say these things, just as, if he had been in love with a Breton girl, he would have enjoyed seeing her in her coif and hearing her say that she believed in ghosts. Always until then, as is common among men whose taste for the fine arts develops independently of their sensuality, a grotesque disparity had existed between the satisfactions which he would accord to either taste simultaneously; yielding to the seduction of works of art which grew more and more subtle as the women in whose company he enjoyed them grew more illiterate and common, he would take a little servant-girl to a screened box in a theatre where there was some decadent piece which he had wished to see performed, or to an exhibition of impressionist painting, with the conviction, moreover, that an educated, 'society' woman would have understood them no better, but would not have managed to keep quiet about them so prettily. But, now that he was in love with Odette, all this was changed; to share her sympathies, to strive to be one with her in spirit was a task so attractive that he tried to find satisfaction in the things that she liked, and did find a pleasure, not only in copying her habits but in adopting her opinions, which was all the deeper because, as those habits and opinions sprang from no roots in her intelligence, they suggested to him nothing except that love, for the sake of which he had preferred them to his own. If he went again to Serge Panine, if he looked out for opportunities of going to watch Olivier M\u00e9tra conducting, it was for the pleasure of being initiated into every one of the ideas in Odette's mind, of feeling that he had an equal share in all her tastes. This charm of drawing him closer to her, which her favourite plays and pictures and places possessed, struck him as being more mysterious than the intrinsic charm of more beautiful things and places, which appealed to him by their beauty, but without recalling her. Besides, having allowed the intellectual beliefs of his youth to grow faint, until his scepticism, as a finished 'man of the world,' had gradually penetrated them unawares, he held (or at least he had held for so long that he had fallen into the habit of saying) that the objects which we admire have no absolute value in themselves, that the whole thing is a matter of dates and castes, and consists in a series of fashions, the most vulgar of which are worth just as much as those which are regarded as the most refined. And as he had decided that the importance which Odette attached to receiving cards tot a private view was not in itself any more ridiculous than the pleasure which he himself had at one time felt in going to luncheon with the Prince of Wales, so he did not think that the admiration which she professed for Monte-Carlo or for the Righi was any more unreasonable than his own liking for Holland (which she imagined as ugly) and for Versailles (which bored her to tears). And so he denied himself the pleasure of visiting those places, consoling himself with the reflection that it was for her sake that he wished to feel, to like nothing that was not equally felt and liked by her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like everything else that formed part of Odette's environment, and was no more, in a sense, than the means whereby he might see and talk to her more often, he enjoyed the society of the Verdurins. With them, since, at the heart of all their entertainments, dinners, musical evenings, games, suppers in fancy dress, excursions to the country, theatre parties, even the infrequent 'big evenings' when they entertained 'bores,' there were the presence of Odette, the sight of Odette, conversation with Odette, an inestimable boon which the Verdurins, by inviting him to their house, bestowed on Swann, he was happier in the little 'nucleus' than anywhere else, and tried to find some genuine merit in each of its members, imagining that his tastes would lead him to frequent their society for the rest of his life. Never daring to whisper to himself, lest he should doubt the truth of the suggestion, that he would always be in love with Odette, at least when he tried to suppose that he would always go to the Verdurins' (a proposition which, a priori, raised fewer fundamental objections on the part of his intelligence), he saw himself for the future continuing to meet Odette every evening; that did not, perhaps, come quite to the same thing as his being permanently in love with her, but for the moment while he was in love with her, to feel that he would not, one day, cease to see her was all that he could ask. \"What a charming atmosphere!\" he said to himself. \"How entirely genuine life is to these people! They are far more intelligent, far more artistic, surely, than the people one knows. Mme. Verdurin, in spite of a few trifling exaggerations which are rather absurd, has a sincere love of painting and music! What a passion for works of art, what anxiety to give pleasure to artists! Her ideas about some of the people one knows are not quite right, but then their ideas about artistic circles are altogether wrong! Possibly I make no great intellectual demands upon conversation, but I am perfectly happy talking to Cottard, although he does trot out those idiotic puns. And as for the painter, if he is rather unpleasantly affected when he tries to be paradoxical, still he has one of the finest brains that I have ever come across. Besides, what is most important, one feels quite free there, one does what one likes without constraint or fuss. What a flow of humour there is every day in that drawing-room! Certainly, with a few rare exceptions, I never want to go anywhere else again. It will become more and more of a habit, and I shall spend the rest of my life among them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And as the qualities which he supposed to be an intrinsic part of the Verdurin character were no more, really, than their superficial reflection of the pleasure which had been enjoyed in their society by his love for Odette, those qualities became more serious, more profound, more vital, as that pleasure increased. Since Mme. Verdurin gave Swann, now and then, what alone could constitute his happiness; since, on an evening when he felt anxious because Odette had talked rather more to one of the party than to another, and, in a spasm of irritation, would not take the initiative by asking her whether she was coming home, Mme. Verdurin brought peace and joy to his troubled spirit by the spontaneous exclamation: \"Odette! You'll see M. Swann home, won't you?\"; since, when the summer holidays came, and after he had asked himself uneasily whether Odette might not leave Paris without him, whether he would still be able to see her every day, Mme. Verdurin was going to invite them both to spend the summer with her in the country; Swann, unconsciously allowing gratitude and self-interest to filter into his intelligence and to influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that Mme. Verdurin was \"a great and noble soul.\" Should any of his old fellow-pupils in the Louvre school of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist, \"I'd a hundred times rather,\" he would reply, \"have the Verdurins.\" And, with a solemnity of diction which was new in him: \"They are magnanimous creatures, and magnanimity is, after all, the one thing that matters, the one thing that gives us distinction here on earth. Look you, there are only two classes of men, the magnanimous, and the rest; and I have reached an age when one has to take sides, to decide once and for all whom one is going to like and dislike, to stick to the people one likes, and, to make up for the time one has wasted with the others, never to leave them again as long as one lives. Very well!\" he went on, with the slight emotion which a man feels when, even without being fully aware of what he is doing, he says something, not because it is true but because he enjoys saying it, and listens to his own voice uttering the words as though they came from some one else, \"The die is now cast; I have elected to love none but magnanimous souls, and to live only in an atmosphere of magnanimity. You ask me whether Mme. Verdurin is really intelligent. I can assure you that she has given me proofs of a nobility of heart, of a loftiness of soul, to which no one could possibly attain\u2014how could they?\u2014without a corresponding loftiness of mind. Without question, she has a profound understanding of art. But it is not, perhaps, in that that she is most admirable; every little action, ingeniously, exquisitely kind, which she has performed for my sake, every friendly attention, simple little things, quite domestic and yet quite sublime, reveal a more profound comprehension of existence than all your textbooks of philosophy.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He might have reminded himself, all the same, that there were various old friends of his family who were just as simple as the Verdurins, companions of his early days who were just as fond of art, that he knew other 'great-hearted creatures,' and that, nevertheless, since he had cast his vote in favour of simplicity, the arts, and magnanimity, he had entirely ceased to see them. But these people did not know Odette, and, if they had known her, would never have thought of introducing her to him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so there was probably not, in the whole of the Verdurin circle, a single one of the 'faithful' who loved them, or believed that he loved them, as dearly as did Swann. And yet, when M. Verdurin said that he was not satisfied with Swann, he had not only expressed his own sentiments, he had unwittingly discovered his wife's. Doubtless Swann had too particular an affection for Odette, as to which he had failed to take Mme. Verdurin daily into his confidence; doubtless the very discretion with which he availed himself of the Verdurins' hospitality, refraining, often, from coming to dine with them for a reason which they never suspected, and in place of which they saw only an anxiety on his part not to have to decline an invitation to the house of some 'bore' or other; doubtless, also, and despite all the precautions which he had taken to keep it from them, the gradual discovery which they were making of his brilliant position in society\u2014doubtless all these things contributed to their general annoyance with Swann. But the real, the fundamental reason was quite different. What had happened was that they had at once discovered in him a locked door, a reserved, impenetrable chamber in which he still professed silently to himself that the Princesse de Sagan was not grotesque, and that Cottard's jokes were not amusing; in a word (and for all that he never once abandoned his friendly attitude towards them all, or revolted from their dogmas), they had discovered an impossibility of imposing those dogmas upon him, of entirely converting him to their faith, the like of which they had never come across in anyone before. They would have forgiven his going to the houses of 'bores' (to whom, as it happened, in his heart of hearts he infinitely preferred the Verdurins and all their little 'nucleus') had he consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those 'bores' in the presence of the 'faithful.' But that was an abjuration which, as they well knew, they were powerless to extort\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What a difference was there in a 'newcomer' whom Odette had asked them to invite, although she herself had met him only a few times, and on whom they were building great hopes\u2014the Comte de Forcheville! (It turned out that he was nothing more nor less than the brother-in-law of Saniette, a discovery which filled all the 'faithful' with amazement: the manners of the old palaeographer were so humble that they had always supposed him to be of a class inferior, socially, to their own, and had never expected to learn that he came of a rich and relatively aristocratic family.) Of course, Forcheville was enormously the 'swell,' which Swann was not or had quite ceased to be; of course, he would never dream of placing, as Swann now placed, the Verdurin circle above any other. But he lacked that natural refinement which prevented Swann from associating himself with the criticisms (too obviously false to be worth his notice) that Mme. Verdurin levelled at people whom he knew. As for the vulgar and affected tirades in which the painter sometimes indulged, the bag-man's pleasantries which Cottard used to hazard,\u2014whereas Swann, who liked both men sincerely, could easily find excuses for these without having either the courage or the hypocrisy to applaud them, Forcheville, on the other hand, was on an intellectual level which permitted him to be stupified, amazed by the invective (without in the least understanding what it all was about), and to be frankly delighted by the wit. And the very first dinner at the Verdurins' at which Forcheville was present threw a glaring light upon all the differences between them, made his qualities start into prominence and precipitated the disgrace of Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was, at this dinner, besides the usual party, a professor from the Sorbonne, one Brichot, who had met M. and Mme. Verdurin at a watering-place somewhere, and, if his duties at the university and his other works of scholarship had not left him with very little time to spare, would gladly have come to them more often. For he had that curiosity, that superstitious outlook on life, which, combined with a certain amount of scepticism with regard to the object of their studies, earn for men of intelligence, whatever their profession, for doctors who do not believe in medicine, for schoolmasters who do not believe in Latin exercises, the reputation of having broad, brilliant, and indeed superior minds. He affected, when at Mme. Verdurin's, to choose his illustrations from among the most topical subjects of the day, when he spoke of philosophy or history, principally because he regarded those sciences as no more, really, than a preparation for life itself, and imagined that he was seeing put into practice by the 'little clan' what hitherto he had known only from books; and also, perhaps, because, having had drilled into him as a boy, and having unconsciously preserved, a feeling of reverence for certain subjects, he thought that he was casting aside the scholar's gown when he ventured to treat those subjects with a conversational licence, which seemed so to him only because the folds of the gown still clung\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Early in the course of the dinner, when M. de Forcheville, seated on the right of Mme. Verdurin, who, in the 'newcomer's' honour, had taken great pains with her toilet, observed to her: \"Quite original, that white dress,\" the Doctor, who had never taken his eyes off him, so curious was he to learn the nature and attributes of what he called a \"de,\" and was on the look-out for an opportunity of attracting his attention, so as to come into closer contact with him, caught in its flight the adjective 'blanche' and, his eyes still glued to his plate, snapped out, \"Blanche? Blanche of Castile?\" then, without moving his head, shot a furtive glance to right and left of him, doubtful, but happy on the whole. While Swann, by the painful and futile effort which he made to smile, testified that he thought the pun absurd, Forcheville had shewn at once that he could appreciate its subtlety, and that he was a man of the world, by keeping within its proper limits a mirth the spontaneity of which had charmed Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What are you to say of a scientist like that?\" she asked Forcheville. \"You can't talk seriously to him for two minutes on end. Is that the sort of thing you tell them at your hospital?\" she went on, turning to the Doctor. \"They must have some pretty lively times there, if that's the case. I can see that I shall have to get taken in as a patient!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think I heard the Doctor speak of that wicked old humbug, Blanche of Castile, if I may so express myself. Am I not right, Madame?\" Brichot appealed to Mme. Verdurin, who, swooning with merriment, her eyes tightly closed, had buried her face in her two hands, from between which, now and then, escaped a muffled scream\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Good gracious, Madame, I would not dream of shocking the reverent-minded, if there are any such around this table, sub rosa... I recognise, moreover, that our ineffable and Athenian\u2014oh, how infinitely Athenian\u2014Republic is capable of honouring, in the person of that obscurantist old she-Capet, the first of our chiefs of police. Yes, indeed, my dear host, yes, indeed!\" he repeated in his ringing voice, which sounded a separate note for each syllable, in reply to a protest by M. Verdurin. \"The Chronicle of Saint Denis, and the authenticity of its information is beyond question, leaves us no room for doubt on that point. No one could be more fitly chosen as Patron by a secularising proletariat than that mother of a Saint, who let him see some pretty fishy saints besides, as Suger says, and other great St. Bernards of the sort; for with her it was a case of taking just what you pleased.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Who is that gentleman?\" Forcheville asked Mme. Verdurin. \"He seems to speak with great authority.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What! Do you mean to say you don't know the famous Brichot? Why, he's celebrated all over Europe.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, that's Br\u00e9chot, is it?\" exclaimed Forcheville, who had not quite caught the name. \"You must tell me all about him\"; he went on, fastening a pair of goggle eyes on the celebrity. \"It's always interesting to meet well-known people at dinner. But, I say, you ask us to very select parties here. No dull evenings in this house, I'm sure.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, you know what it is really,\" said Mme. Verdurin modestly. \"They feel safe here. They can talk about whatever they like, and the conversation goes off like fireworks. Now Brichot, this evening, is nothing. I've seen him, don't you know, when he's been with me, simply dazzling; you'd want to go on your knees to him. Well, with anyone else he's not the same man, he's not in the least witty, you have to drag the words out of him, he's even boring.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That's strange,\" remarked Forcheville with fitting astonishment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A sort of wit like Brichot's would have been regarded as out-and-out stupidity by the people among whom Swann had spent his early life, for all that it is quite compatible with real intelligence. And the intelligence of the Professor's vigorous and well-nourished brain might easily have been envied by many of the people in society who seemed witty enough to Swann. But these last had so thoroughly inculcated into him their likes and dislikes, at least in everything that pertained to their ordinary social existence, including that annex to social existence which belongs, strictly speaking, to the domain of intelligence, namely, conversation, that Swann could not see anything in Brichot's pleasantries; to him they were merely pedantic, vulgar, and disgustingly coarse. He was shocked, too, being accustomed to good manners, by the rude, almost barrack-room tone which this student-in-arms adopted, no matter to whom he was speaking. Finally, perhaps, he had lost all patience that evening as he watched Mme. Verdurin welcoming, with such unnecessary warmth, this Forcheville fellow, whom it had been Odette's unaccountable idea to bring to the house. Feeling a little awkward, with Swann there also, she had asked him on her arrival: \"What do you think of my guest?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he, suddenly realising for the first time that Forcheville, whom he had known for years, could actually attract a woman, and was quite a good specimen of a man, had retorted: \"Beastly!\" He had, certainly, no idea of being jealous of Odette, but did not feel quite so happy as usual, and when Brichot, having begun to tell them the story of Blanche of Castile's mother, who, according to him, \"had been with Henry Plantagenet for years before they were married,\" tried to prompt Swann to beg him to continue the story, by interjecting \"Isn't that so, M. Swann?\" in the martial accents which one uses in order to get down to the level of an unintelligent rustic or to put the 'fear of God' into a trooper, Swann cut his story short, to the intense fury of their hostess, by begging to be excused for taking so little interest in Blanche of Castile, as he had something that he wished to ask the painter. He, it appeared, had been that afternoon to an exhibition of the work of another artist, also a friend of Mme. Verdurin, who had recently died, and Swann wished to find out from him (for he valued his discrimination) whether there had really been anything more in this later work than the virtuosity which had struck people so forcibly in his earlier exhibitions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"From that point of view it was extraordinary, but it did not seem to me to be a form of art which you could call 'elevated,'\" said Swann with a smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Elevated... to the height of an Institute!\" interrupted Cottard, raising his arms with mock solemnity. The whole table burst out laughing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What did I tell you?\" said Mme. Verdurin to Forcheville. \"It's simply impossible to be serious with him. When you least expect it, out he comes with a joke.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she observed that Swann, and Swann alone, had not unbent. For one thing he was none too well pleased with Cottard for having secured a laugh at his expense in front of Forcheville. But the painter, instead of replying in a way that might have interested Swann, as he would probably have done had they been alone together, preferred to win the easy admiration of the rest by exercising his wit upon the talent of their dead friend\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I went up to one of them,\" he began, \"just to see how it was done; I stuck my nose into it. Yes, I don't think! Impossible to say whether it was done with glue, with soap, with sealing-wax, with sunshine, with leaven, with excrem...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And one make twelve!\" shouted the Doctor, wittily, but just too late, for no one saw the point of his interruption\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It looks as though it were done with nothing at all,\" resumed the painter. \"No more chance of discovering the trick than there is in the 'Night Watch,' or the 'Regents,' and it's even bigger work than either Rembrandt or Hals ever did. It's all there,\u2014and yet, no, I'll take my oath it isn't.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, just as singers who have reached the highest note in their compass, proceed to hum the rest of the air in falsetto, he had to be satisfied with murmuring, smiling the while, as if, after all, there had been something irresistibly amusing in the sheer beauty of the painting: \"It smells all right; it makes your head go round; it catches your breath; you feel ticklish all over\u2014and not the faintest clue to how it's done. The man's a sorcerer; the thing's a conjuring-trick, it's a miracle,\" bursting outright into laughter, \"it's dishonest!\" Then stopping, solemnly raising his head, pitching his voice on a double-bass note which he struggled to bring into harmony, he concluded, \"And it's so loyal!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except at the moment when he had called it \"bigger than the 'Night Watch,'\" a blasphemy which had called forth an instant protest from Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the 'Night Watch' as the supreme masterpiece of the universe (conjointly with the 'Ninth' and the 'Samothrace'), and at the word \"excrement,\" which had made Forcheville throw a sweeping glance round the table to see whether it was 'all right,' before he allowed his lips to curve in a prudish and conciliatory smile, all the party (save Swann) had kept their fascinated and adoring eyes fixed upon the painter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I do so love him when he goes up in the air like that!\" cried Mme. Verdurin, the moment that he had finished, enraptured that the table-talk should have proved so entertaining on the very night that Forcheville was dining with them for the first time. \"Hallo, you!\" she turned to her husband, \"what's the matter with you, sitting there gaping like a great animal? You know, though, don't you,\" she apologised for him to the painter, \"that he can talk quite well when he chooses; anybody would think it was the first time he had ever listened to you. If you had only seen him while you were speaking; he was just drinking it all in. And to-morrow he will tell us everything you said, without missing a word.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, really, I'm not joking!\" protested the painter, enchanted by the success of his speech. \"You all look as if you thought I was pulling your legs, that it was just a trick. I'll take you to see the show, and then you can say whether I've been exaggerating; I'll bet you anything you like, you'll come away more 'up in the air' than I am!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But we don't suppose for a moment that you're exaggerating; we only want you to go on with your dinner, and my husband too. Give M. Biche some more sole, can't you see his has got cold? We're not in any hurry; you're dashing round as if the house was on fire. Wait a little; don't serve the salad just yet.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Cottard, who was a shy woman and spoke but seldom, was not lacking, for all that, in self-assurance when a happy inspiration put the right word in her mouth. She felt that it would be well received; the thought gave her confidence, and what she was doing was done with the object not so much of shining herself, as of helping her husband on in his career. And so she did not allow the word 'salad,' which Mme. Verdurin had just uttered, to pass unchallenged\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's not a Japanese salad, is it?\" she whispered, turning towards Odette\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, in her joy and confusion at the combination of neatness and daring which there had been in making so discreet and yet so unmistakable an allusion to the new and brilliantly successful play by Dumas, she broke down in a charming, girlish laugh, not very loud, but so irresistible that it was some time before she could control it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Who is that lady? She seems devilish clever,\" said Forcheville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, it is not. But we will have one for you if you will all come to dinner on Friday.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You will think me dreadfully provincial, sir,\" said Mme. Cottard to Swann, \"but, do you know, I haven't been yet to this famous Francillon that everybody's talking about. The Doctor has been (I remember now, he told me what a very great pleasure it had been to him to spend the evening with you there) and I must confess, I don't see much sense in spending money on seats for him to take me, when he's seen the play already. Of course an evening at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais is never wasted, really; the acting's so good there always; but we have some very nice friends,\" (Mme. Cottard would hardly ever utter a proper name, but restricted herself to \"some friends of ours\" or \"one of my friends,\" as being more 'distinguished,' speaking in an affected tone and with all the importance of a person who need give names only when she chooses) \"who often have a box, and are kind enough to take us to all the new pieces that are worth going to, and so I'm certain to see this Francillon sooner or later, and then I shall know what to think. But I do feel such a fool about it, I must confess, for, whenever I pay a call anywhere, I find everybody talking\u2014it's only natural\u2014about that wretched Japanese salad. Really and truly, one's beginning to get just a little tired of hearing about it,\" she went on, seeing that Swann seemed less interested than she had hoped in so burning a topic. \"I must admit, though, that it's sometimes quite amusing, the way they joke about it: I've got a friend, now, who is most original, though she's really a beautiful woman, most popular in society, goes everywhere, and she tells me that she got her cook to make one of these Japanese salads, putting in everything that young M. Dumas says you're to put in, in the play. Then she asked just a few friends to come and taste it. I was not among the favoured few, I'm sorry to say. But she told us all about it on her next 'day'; it seems it was quite horrible, she made us all laugh till we cried. I don't know; perhaps it was the way she told it,\" Mme. Cottard added doubtfully, seeing that Swann still looked grave\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, imagining that it was, perhaps, because he had not been amused by Francillon: \"Well, I daresay I shall be disappointed with it, after all. I don't suppose it's as good as the piece Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy worships, Serge Panine. There's a play, if you like; so deep, makes you think! But just fancy giving a receipt for a salad on the stage of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais! Now, Serge Panine\u2014! But then, it's like everything that comes from the pen of M. Georges Ohnet, it's so well written. I wonder if you know the Ma\u00eetre des Forges, which I like even better than Serge Panine.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Pardon me,\" said Swann with polite irony, \"but I can assure you that my want of admiration is almost equally divided between those masterpieces.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Really, now; that's very interesting. And what don't you like about them? Won't you ever change your mind? Perhaps you think he's a little too sad. Well, well, what I always say is, one should never argue about plays or novels. Everyone has his own way of looking at things, and what may be horrible to you is, perhaps, just what I like best.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was interrupted by Forcheville's addressing Swann. What had happened was that, while Mme. Cottard was discussing Francillon, Forcheville had been expressing to Mme. Verdurin his admiration for what he called the \"little speech\" of the painter. \"Your friend has such a flow of language, such a memory!\" he had said to her when the painter had come to a standstill, \"I've seldom seen anything like it. He'd make a first-rate preacher. By Jove, I wish I was like that. What with him and M. Br\u00e9chot you've drawn two lucky numbers to-night; though I'm not so sure that, simply as a speaker, this one doesn't knock spots off the Professor. It comes more naturally with him, less like reading from a book. Of course, the way he goes on, he does use some words that are a bit realistic, and all that; but that's quite the thing nowadays; anyhow, it's not often I've seen a man hold the floor as cleverly as that, 'hold the spittoon,' as we used to say in the regiment, where, by the way, we had a man he rather reminds me of. You could take anything you liked\u2014I don't know what\u2014this glass, say; and he'd talk away about it for hours; no, not this glass; that's a silly thing to say, I'm sorry; but something a little bigger, like the battle of Waterloo, or anything of that sort, he'd tell you things you simply wouldn't believe. Why, Swann was in the regiment then; he must have known him.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you see much of M. Swann?\" asked Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh dear, no!\" he answered, and then, thinking that if he made himself pleasant to Swann he might find favour with Odette, he decided to take this opportunity of flattering him by speaking of his fashionable friends, but speaking as a man of the world himself, in a tone of good-natured criticism, and not as though he were congratulating Swann upon some undeserved good fortune: \"Isn't that so, Swann? I never see anything of you, do I?\u2014But then, where on earth is one to see him? The creature spends all his time shut up with the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles, with the Laumes and all that lot!\" The imputation would have been false at any time, and was all the more so, now that for at least a year Swann had given up going to almost any house but the Verdurins'. But the mere names of families whom the Verdurins did not know were received by them in a reproachful silence. M. Verdurin, dreading the painful impression which the mention of these 'bores,' especially when flung at her in this tactless fashion, and in front of all the 'faithful,' was bound to make on his wife, cast a covert glance at her, instinct with anxious solicitude. He saw then that in her fixed resolution to take no notice, to have escaped contact, altogether, with the news which had just been addressed to her, not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf as well, as we pretend to be when a friend who has been in the wrong attempts to slip into his conversation some excuse which we should appear to be accepting, should we appear to have heard it without protesting, or when some one utters the name of an enemy, the very mention of whom in our presence is forbidden; Mme. Verdurin, so that her silence should have the appearance, not of consent but of the unconscious silence which inanimate objects preserve, had suddenly emptied her face of all life, of all mobility; her rounded forehead was nothing, now, but an exquisite study in high relief, which the name of those La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles, with whom Swann was always 'shut up,' had failed to penetrate; her nose, just perceptibly wrinkled in a frown, exposed to view two dark cavities that were, surely, modelled from life. You would have said that her half-opened lips were just about to speak. It was all no more, however, than a wax cast, a mask in plaster, the sculptor's design for a monument, a bust to be exhibited in the Palace of Industry, where the public would most certainly gather in front of it and marvel to see how the sculptor, in expressing the unchallengeable dignity of the Verdurins, as opposed to that of the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles or Laumes, whose equals (if not, indeed, their betters) they were, and the equals and betters of all other 'bores' upon the face of the earth, had managed to invest with a majesty that was almost Papal the whiteness and rigidity of his stone. But the marble at last grew animated and let it be understood that it didn't do to be at all squeamish if one went to that house, since the woman was always tipsy and the husband so uneducated that he called a corridor a 'collidor'!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You'd need to pay me a lot of money before I'd let any of that lot set foot inside my house,\" Mme. Verdurin concluded, gazing imperially down on Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She could scarcely have expected him to capitulate so completely as to echo the holy simplicity of the pianist's aunt, who at once exclaimed: \"To think of that, now! What surprises me is that they can get anybody to go near them; I'm sure I should be afraid; one can't be too careful. How can people be so common as to go running after them?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he might, at least, have replied, like Forcheville: \"Gad, she's a duchess; there are still plenty of people who are impressed by that sort of thing,\" which would at least have permitted Mme. Verdurin the final retort, \"And a lot of good may it do them!\" Instead of which, Swann merely smiled, in a manner which shewed, quite clearly, that he could not, of course, take such an absurd suggestion seriously. M. Verdurin, who was still casting furtive and intermittent glances at his wife, could see with regret, and could understand only too well that she was now inflamed with the passion of a Grand Inquisitor who cannot succeed in stamping out a heresy; and so, in the hope of bringing Swann round to a retractation (for the courage of one's opinions is always a form of calculating cowardice in the eyes of the 'other side'), he broke in:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tell us frankly, now, what you think of them yourself. We shan't repeat it to them, you may be sure.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To which Swann answered: \"Why, I'm not in the least afraid of the Duchess (if it is of the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles that you're speaking). I can assure you that everyone likes going to see her. I don't go so far as to say that she's at all 'deep'\u2014\" he pronounced the word as if it meant something ridiculous, for his speech kept the traces of certain mental habits which the recent change in his life, a rejuvenation illustrated by his passion for music, had inclined him temporarily to discard, so that at times he would actually state his views with considerable warmth\u2014\"but I am quite sincere when I say that she is intelligent, while her husband is positively a bookworm. They are charming people.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His explanation was terribly effective; Mme. Verdurin now realised that this one state of unbelief would prevent her 'little nucleus' from ever attaining to complete unanimity, and was unable to restrain herself, in her fury at the obstinacy of this wretch who could not see what anguish his words were causing her, but cried aloud, from the depths of her tortured heart, \"You may think so if you wish, but at least you need not say so to us.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It all depends upon what you call intelligence.\" Forcheville felt that it was his turn to be brilliant. \"Come now, Swann, tell us what you mean by intelligence.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There,\" cried Odette, \"that's one of the big things I beg him to tell me about, and he never will.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but...\" protested Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but nonsense!\" said Odette\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A water-butt?\" asked the Doctor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To you,\" pursued Forcheville, \"does intelligence mean what they call clever talk; you know, the sort of people who worm their way into society?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Finish your sweet, so that they can take your plate away!\" said Mme. Verdurin sourly to Saniette, who was lost in thought and had stopped eating. And then, perhaps a little ashamed of her rudeness, \"It doesn't matter; take your time about it; there's no hurry; I only reminded you because of the others, you know; it keeps the servants back.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There is,\" began Brichot, with a resonant smack upon every syllable, \"a rather curious definition of intelligence by that pleasing old anarchist F\u00e9nelon...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just listen to this!\" Mme. Verdurin rallied Forcheville and the Doctor. \"He's going to give us F\u00e9nelon's definition of intelligence. That's interesting. It's not often you get a chance of hearing that!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Brichot was keeping F\u00e9nelon's definition until Swann should have given his own. Swann remained silent, and, by this fresh act of recreancy, spoiled the brilliant tournament of dialectic which Mme. Verdurin was rejoicing at being able to offer to Forcheville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You see, it's just the same as with me!\" Odette was peevish. \"I'm not at all sorry to see that I'm not the only one he doesn't find quite up to his level.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"These de La Tr\u00e9mouailles whom Mme. Verdurin has exhibited to us as so little to be desired,\" inquired Brichot, articulating vigorously, \"are they, by any chance, descended from the couple whom that worthy old snob, S\u00e9vign\u00e9, said she was delighted to know, because it was so good for her peasants? True, the Marquise had another reason, which in her case probably came first, for she was a thorough journalist at heart, and always on the look-out for 'copy.' And, in the journal which she used to send regularly to her daughter, it was Mme. de La Tr\u00e9mouaille, kept well-informed through all her grand connections, who supplied the foreign politics.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh dear, no. I'm quite sure they aren't the same family,\" said Mme. Verdurin desperately\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saniette who, ever since he had surrendered his untouched plate to the butler, had been plunged once more in silent meditation, emerged finally to tell them, with a nervous laugh, a story of how he had once dined with the Duc de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, the point of which was that the Duke did not know that George Sand was the pseudonym of a woman. Swann, who really liked Saniette, felt bound to supply him with a few facts illustrative of the Duke's culture, which would prove that such ignorance on his part was literally impossible; but suddenly he stopped short; he had realised, as he was speaking, that Saniette needed no proof, but knew already that the story was untrue for the simple reason that he had at that moment invented it. The worthy man suffered acutely from the Verdurins' always finding him so dull; and as he was conscious of having been more than ordinarily morose this evening, he had made up his mind that he would succeed in being amusing, at least once, before the end of dinner. He surrendered so quickly, looked so wretched at the sight of his castle in ruins, and replied in so craven a tone to Swann, appealing to him not to persist in a refutation which was already superfluous, \"All right; all right; anyhow, even if I have made a mistake that's not a crime, I hope,\" that Swann longed to be able to console him by insisting that the story was indubitably true and exquisitely funny. The Doctor, who had been listening, had an idea that it was the right moment to interject \"Se non \u00e8 vero,\" but he was not quite certain of the words, and was afraid of being caught out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After dinner, Forcheville went up to the Doctor. \"She can't have been at all bad looking, Mme. Verdurin; anyhow, she's a woman you can really talk to; that's all I want. Of course she's getting a bit broad in the beam. But Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy! There's a little woman who knows what's what, all right. Upon my word and soul, you can see at a glance she's got the American eye, that girl has. We are speaking of Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy,\" he explained, as M. Verdurin joined them, his pipe in his mouth. \"I should say that, as a specimen of the female form\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'd rather have it in my bed than a clap of thunder!\" the words came tumbling from Cottard, who had for some time been waiting in vain until Forcheville should pause for breath, so that he might get in his hoary old joke, a chance for which might not, he feared, come again, if the conversation should take a different turn; and he produced it now with that excessive spontaneity and confidence which may often be noticed attempting to cover up the coldness, and the slight flutter of emotion, inseparable from a prepared recitation. Forcheville knew and saw the joke, and was thoroughly amused. As for M. Verdurin, he was unsparing of his merriment, having recently discovered a way of expressing it by a symbol, different from his wife's, but equally simple and obvious. Scarcely had he begun the movement of head and shoulders of a man who was 'shaking with laughter' than he would begin also to cough, as though, in laughing too violently, he had swallowed a mouthful of smoke from his pipe. And by keeping the pipe firmly in his mouth he could prolong indefinitely the dumb-show of suffocation and hilarity. So he and Mme. Verdurin (who, at the other side of the room, where the painter was telling her a story, was shutting her eyes preparatory to flinging her face into her hands) resembled two masks in a theatre, each representing Comedy, but in a different way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin had been wiser than he knew in not taking his pipe out of his mouth, for Cottard, having occasion to leave the room for a moment, murmured a witty euphemism which he had recently acquired and repeated now whenever he had to go to the place in question: \"I must just go and see the Duc d'Aumale for a minute,\" so drolly, that M. Verdurin's cough began all over again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, then, take your pipe out of your mouth; can't you see, you'll choke if you try to bottle up your laughter like that,\" counselled Mme. Verdurin, as she came round with a tray of liqueurs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What a delightful man your husband is; he has the wit of a dozen!\" declared Forcheville to Mme. Cottard. \"Thank you, thank you, an old soldier like me can never say 'No' to a drink.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"M. de Forcheville thinks Odette charming,\" M. Verdurin told his wife\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, do you know, she wants so much to meet you again some day at luncheon. We must arrange it, but don't on any account let Swann hear about it. He spoils everything, don't you know. I don't mean to say that you're not to come to dinner too, of course; we hope to see you very often. Now that the warm weather's coming, we're going to have dinner out of doors whenever we can. That won't bore you, will it, a quiet little dinner, now and then, in the Bois? Splendid, splendid, that will be quite delightful....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aren't you going to do any work this evening, I say?\" she screamed suddenly to the little pianist, seeing an opportunity for displaying, before a 'newcomer' of Forcheville's importance, at once her unfailing wit and her despotic power over the 'faithful.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"M. de Forcheville was just going to say something dreadful about you,\" Mme. Cottard warned her husband as he reappeared in the room. And he, still following up the idea of Forcheville's noble birth, which had obsessed him all through dinner, began again with: \"I am treating a Baroness just now, Baroness Putbus; weren't there some Putbuses in the Crusades? Anyhow they've got a lake in Pomerania that's ten times the size of the Place de la Concorde. I am treating her for dry arthritis; she's a charming woman. Mme. Verdurin knows her too, I believe.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which enabled Forcheville, a moment later, finding himself alone with Mme. Cottard, to complete his favourable verdict on her husband with: \"He's an interesting man, too; you can see that he knows some good people. Gad! but they get to know a lot of things, those doctors.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"D'you want me to play the phrase from the sonata for M. Swann?\" asked the pianist\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What the devil's that? Not the sonata-snake, I hope!\" shouted M. de Forcheville, hoping to create an effect. But Dr. Cottard, who had never heard this pun, missed the point of it, and imagined that M. de Forcheville had made a mistake. He dashed in boldly to correct it: \"No, no. The word isn't serpent-\u00e0-sonates, it's serpent-\u00e0-sonnettes!\" he explained in a tone at once zealous, impatient, and triumphant\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forcheville explained the joke to him. The Doctor blushed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You'll admit it's not bad, eh, Doctor?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! I've known it for ages.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then they were silenced; heralded by the waving tremolo of the violin-part, which formed a bristling bodyguard of sound two octaves above it\u2014and as in a mountainous country, against the seeming immobility of a vertically falling torrent, one may distinguish, two hundred feet below, the tiny form of a woman walking in the valley\u2014the little phrase had just appeared, distant but graceful, protected by the long, gradual unfurling of its transparent, incessant and sonorous curtain. And Swann, in his heart of hearts, turned to it, spoke to it as to a confidant in the secret of his love, as to a friend of Odette who would assure him that he need pay no attention to this Forcheville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah! you've come too late!\" Mme. Verdurin greeted one of the 'faithful,' whose invitation had been only 'to look in after dinner,' \"we've been having a simply incomparable Brichot! You never heard such eloquence! But he's gone. Isn't that so, M. Swann? I believe it's the first time you've met him,\" she went on, to emphasize the fact that it was to her that Swann owed the introduction. \"Isn't that so; wasn't he delicious, our Brichot?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann bowed politely\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No? You weren't interested?\" she asked dryly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but I assure you, I was quite enthralled. He is perhaps a little too peremptory, a little too jovial for my taste. I should like to see him a little less confident at times, a little more tolerant, but one feels that he knows a great deal, and on the whole he seems a very sound fellow.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The party broke up very late. Cottard's first words to his wife were: \"I have rarely seen Mme. Verdurin in such form as she was to-night.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What exactly is your Mme. Verdurin? A bit of a bad hat, eh?\" said Forcheville to the painter, to whom he had offered a 'lift.' Odette watched his departure with regret; she dared not refuse to let Swann take her home, but she was moody and irritable in the carriage, and, when he asked whether he might come in, replied, \"I suppose so,\" with an impatient shrug of her shoulders. When they had all gone, Mme. Verdurin said to her husband: \"Did you notice the way Swann laughed, such an idiotic laugh, when we spoke about Mme. La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had remarked, more than once, how Swann and Forcheville suppressed the particle 'de' before that lady's name. Never doubting that it was done on purpose, to shew that they were not afraid of a title, she had made up her mind to imitate their arrogance, but had not quite grasped what grammatical form it ought to take. Moreover, the natural corruptness of her speech overcoming her implacable republicanism, she still said instinctively \"the de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles,\" or, rather (by an abbreviation sanctified by the usage of music-hall singers and the writers of the 'captions' beneath caricatures, who elide the 'de'), \"the d'La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles,\" but she corrected herself at once to \"Madame La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle.\u2014The Duchess, as Swann calls her,\" she added ironically, with a smile which proved that she was merely quoting, and would not, herself, accept the least responsibility for a classification so puerile and absurd\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don't mind saying that I thought him extremely stupid.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin took it up. \"He's not sincere. He's a crafty customer, always hovering between one side and the other. He's always trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. What a difference between him and Forcheville. There, at least, you have a man who tells you straight out what he thinks. Either you agree with him or you don't. Not like the other fellow, who's never definitely fish or fowl. Did you notice, by the way, that Odette seemed all out for Forcheville, and I don't blame her, either. And then, after all, if Swann tries to come the man of fashion over us, the champion of distressed Duchesses, at any rate the other man has got a title; he's always Comte de Forcheville!\" he let the words slip delicately from his lips, as though, familiar with every page of the history of that dignity, he were making a scrupulously exact estimate of its value, in relation to others of the sort\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't mind saying,\" Mme. Verdurin went on, \"that he saw fit to utter some most venomous, and quite absurd insinuations against Brichot. Naturally, once he saw that Brichot was popular in this house, it was a way of hitting back at us, of spoiling our party. I know his sort, the dear, good friend of the family, who pulls you all to pieces on the stairs as he's going away.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Didn't I say so?\" retorted her husband. \"He's simply a failure; a poor little wretch who goes through life mad with jealousy of anything that's at all big.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had the truth been known, there was not one of the 'faithful' who was not infinitely more malicious than Swann; but the others would all take the precaution of tempering their malice with obvious pleasantries, with little sparks of emotion and cordiality; while the least indication of reserve on Swann's part, undraped in any such conventional formula as \"Of course, I don't want to say anything\u2014\" to which he would have scorned to descend, appeared to them a deliberate act of treachery. There are certain original and distinguished authors in whom the least 'freedom of speech' is thought revolting because they have not begun by flattering the public taste, and serving up to it the commonplace expressions to which it is used; it was by the same process that Swann infuriated M. Verdurin. In his case as in theirs it was the novelty of his language which led his audience to suspect the blackness of his designs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was still unconscious of the disgrace that threatened him at the Verdurins', and continued to regard all their absurdities in the most rosy light, through the admiring eyes of love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a rule he made no appointments with Odette except for the evenings; he was afraid of her growing tired of him if he visited her during the day as well; at the same time he was reluctant to forfeit, even for an hour, the place that he held in her thoughts, and so was constantly looking out for an opportunity of claiming her attention, in any way that would not be displeasing to her. If, in a florist's or a jeweller's window, a plant or an ornament caught his eye, he would at once think of sending them to Odette, imagining that the pleasure which the casual sight of them had given him would instinctively be felt, also, by her, and would increase her affection for himself; and he would order them to be taken at once to the Rue La p\u00e9rouse, so as to accelerate the moment in which, as she received an offering from him, he might feel himself, in a sense, transported into her presence. He was particularly anxious, always, that she should receive these presents before she went out for the evening, so that her sense of gratitude towards him might give additional tenderness to her welcome when he arrived at the Verdurins', might even\u2014for all he knew\u2014if the shopkeeper made haste, bring him a letter from her before dinner, or herself, in person, upon his doorstep, come on a little extraordinary visit of thanks. As in an earlier phase, when he had experimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt upon her character, he sought now by that of gratification to elicit from her fresh particles of her intimate feelings, which she had never yet revealed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often she was embarrassed by lack of money, and under pressure from a creditor would come to him for assistance. He enjoyed this, as he enjoyed everything which could impress Odette with his love for herself, or merely with his influence, with the extent of the use that she might make of him. Probably if anyone had said to him, at the beginning, \"It's your position that attracts her,\" or at this stage, \"It's your money that she's really in love with,\" he would not have believed the suggestion, nor would he have been greatly distressed by the thought that people supposed her to be attached to him, that people felt them, to be united by any ties so binding as those of snobbishness or wealth. But even if he had accepted the possibility, it might not have caused him any suffering to discover that Odette's love for him was based on a foundation more lasting than mere affection, or any attractive qualities which she might have found in him; on a sound, commercial interest; an interest which would postpone for ever the fatal day on which she might be tempted to bring their relations to an end. For the moment, while he lavished presents upon her, and performed all manner of services, he could rely on advantages not contained in his person, or in his intellect, could forego the endless, killing effort to make himself attractive. And this delight in being a lover, in living by love alone, of the reality of which he was inclined to be doubtful, the price which, in the long run, he must pay for it, as a dilettante in immaterial sensations, enhanced its value in his eyes\u2014as one sees people who are doubtful whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are really enjoyable, become convinced that they are, as also of the rare quality and absolute detachment of their own taste, when they have agreed to pay several pounds a day for a room in an hotel, from which that sight and that sound may be enjoyed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day, when reflections of this order had brought him once again to the memory of the time when some one had spoken to him of Odette as of a 'kept' woman, and when, once again, he had amused himself with contrasting that strange personification, the 'kept' woman\u2014an iridescent mixture of unknown and demoniacal qualities, embroidered, as in some fantasy of Gustave Moreau, with poison-dripping flowers, interwoven with precious jewels\u2014with that Odette upon whose face he had watched the passage of the same expressions of pity for a sufferer, resentment of an act of injustice, gratitude for an act of kindness, which he had seen, in earlier days, on his own mother's face, and on the faces of friends; that Odette, whose conversation had so frequently turned on the things that he himself knew better than anyone, his collections, his room, his old servant, his banker, who kept all his title-deeds and bonds;\u2014the thought of the banker reminded him that he must call on him shortly, to draw some money. And indeed, if, during the current month, he were to come less liberally to the aid of Odette in her financial difficulties than in the month before, when he had given her five thousand francs, if he refrained from offering her a diamond necklace for which she longed, he would be allowing her admiration for his generosity to decline, that gratitude which had made him so happy, and would even be running the risk of her imagining that his love for her (as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer) had itself diminished. And then, suddenly, he asked himself whether that was not precisely what was implied by 'keeping' a woman (as if, in fact, that idea of 'keeping' could be derived from elements not at all mysterious nor perverse, but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life, such as that thousand-franc note, a familiar and domestic object, torn in places and mended with gummed paper, which his valet, after paying the household accounts and the rent, had locked up hi a drawer in the old writing-desk whence he had extracted it to send it, with four others, to Odette) and whether it was not possible to apply to Odette, since he had known her (for he never imagined for a moment that she could ever have taken a penny from anyone else, before), that title, which he had believed so wholly inapplicable to her, of 'kept' woman. He could not explore the idea further, for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was, with him, congenital, intermittent and providential, happened, at that moment, to extinguish every particle of light in his brain, as instantaneously as, at a later period, when electric lighting had been everywhere installed, it became possible, merely by fingering a switch, to cut off all the supply of light from a house. His mind fumbled, for a moment, in the darkness, he took off his spectacles, wiped the glasses, passed his hands over his eyes, but saw no light until he found himself face to face with a wholly different idea, the realisation that he must endeavour, in the coming month, to send Odette six or seven thousand-franc notes instead of five, simply as a surprise for her and to give her pleasure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the evening, when he did not stay at home until it was time to meet Odette at the Verdurins', or rather at one of the open-air restaurants which they liked to frequent in the Bois and especially at Saint-Cloud, he would go to dine in one of those fashionable houses in which, at one time, he had been a constant guest. He did not wish to lose touch with people who, for all that he knew, might be of use, some day, to Odette, and thanks to whom he was often, in the meantime, able to procure for her some privilege or pleasure. Besides, he had been used for so long to the refinement and comfort of good society that, side by side with his contempt, there had grown up also a desperate need for it, with the result that, when he had reached the point after which the humblest lodgings appeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely mansions, his senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he could not enter the former without a feeling of acute discomfort. He had the same regard\u2014to a degree of identity which they would never have suspected\u2014for the little families with small incomes who asked him to dances in their flats (\"straight upstairs to the fifth floor, and the door on the left\") as for the Princesse de Parme, who gave the most splendid parties in Paris; but he had not the feeling of being actually 'at the ball' when he found himself herded with the fathers of families in the bedroom of the lady of the house, while the spectacle of wash-hand-stands covered over with towels, and of beds converted into cloak-rooms, with a mass of hats and great-coats sprawling over their counterpanes, gave him the same stifling sensation that, nowadays, people who have been used for half a lifetime to electric light derive from a smoking lamp or a candle that needs to be snuffed. If he were dining out, he would order his carriage for half-past seven; while he changed his clothes, he would be wondering, all the time, about Odette, and in this way was never alone, for the constant thought of Odette gave to the moments in which he was separated from her the same peculiar charm as to those in which she was at his side. He would get into his carriage and drive off, but he knew that this thought had jumped in after him and had settled down upon his knee, like a pet animal which he might take everywhere, and would keep with him at the dinner-table, unobserved by his fellow-guests. He would stroke and fondle it, warm himself with it, and, as a feeling of languor swept over him, would give way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat and nostrils\u2014a new experience, this,\u2014as he fastened the bunch of columbines in his buttonhole. He had for some time been feeling neither well nor happy, especially since Odette had brought Forcheville to the Verdurins', and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in the country. But he could never summon up courage to leave Paris, even for a day, while Odette was there. The weather was warm; it was the finest part of the spring. And for all that he was driving through a city of stone to immure himself in a house without grass or garden, what was incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned, near Combray, where, at four in the afternoon, before coming to the asparagus-bed, thanks to the breeze that was wafted across the fields from M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, he could enjoy the fragrant coolness of the air as well beneath an arbour of hornbeams in the garden as by the bank of the pond, fringed with forget-me-not and iris; and where, when he sat down to dinner, trained and twined by the gardener's skilful hand, there ran all about his table currant-bush and rose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After dinner, if he had an early appointment in the Bois or at Saint-Cloud, he would rise from table and leave the house so abruptly\u2014especially if it threatened to rain, and so to scatter the 'faithful' before their normal time\u2014that on one occasion the Princesse des Laumes (at whose house dinner had been so late that Swann had left before the coffee came in, to join the Verdurins on the Island in the Bois) observed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Really, if Swann were thirty years older, and had diabetes, there might be some excuse for his running away like that. He seems to look upon us all as a joke.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He persuaded himself that the spring-time charm, which he could not go down to Combray to enjoy, he would find at least on the He des Cygnes or at Saint-Cloud. But as he could think only of Odette, he would return home not knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young leaves, or if the moon had been shining. He would be welcomed by the little phrase from the sonata, played in the garden on the restaurant piano. If there was none in the garden, the Verdurins would have taken immense pains to have a piano brought out either from a private room or from the restaurant itself; not because Swann was now restored to favour; far from it. But the idea of arranging an ingenious form of entertainment for some one, even for some one whom they disliked, would stimulate them, during the time spent in its preparation, to a momentary sense of cordiality and affection. Now and then he would remind himself that another fine spring evening was drawing to a close, and would force himself to notice the trees and the sky. But the state of excitement into which Odette's presence never failed to throw him, added to a feverish ailment which, for some time now, had scarcely left him, robbed him of that sense of quiet and comfort which is an indispensable background to the impressions that we derive from nature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One evening, when Swann had consented to dine with the Verdurins, and had mentioned during dinner that he had to attend, next day, the annual banquet of an old comrades' association, Odette had at once exclaimed across the table, in front of everyone, in front of Forcheville, who was now one of the 'faithful,' in front of the painter, in front of Cottard:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I know, you have your banquet to-morrow; I sha'n't see you, then, till I get home; don't be too late.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And although Swann had never yet taken offence, at all seriously, at Odette's demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the 'faithful,' he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow, before them all, with that calm immodesty, the fact that they saw each other regularly every evening, his privileged position in her house, and her own preference for him which it implied. It was true that Swann had often reflected that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman; and in the supremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to himself there was nothing that especially flattered him when he heard it proclaimed to all the 'faithful'; but since he had observed that, to several other men than himself, Odette seemed a fascinating and desirable woman, the attraction which her body held for him had aroused a painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest particles of her heart. And he had begun to attach an incalculable value to those moments passed in her house in the evenings, when he held her upon his knee, made her tell him what she thought about this or that, and counted over that treasure to which, alone of all his earthly possessions, he still clung. And so, after this dinner, drawing her aside, he took care to thank her effusively, seeking to indicate to her by the extent of his gratitude the corresponding intensity of the pleasures which it was in her power to bestow on him, the supreme pleasure being to guarantee him immunity, for as long as his love should last and he remain vulnerable, from the assaults of jealousy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he came away from his banquet, the next evening, it was pouring rain, and he had nothing but his victoria. A friend offered to take him home in a closed carriage, and as Odette, by the fact of her having invited him to come, had given him an assurance that she was expecting no one else, he could, with a quiet mind and an untroubled heart, rather than set off thus in the rain, have gone home and to bed. But perhaps, if she saw that he seemed not to adhere to his resolution to end every evening, without exception, in her company, she might grow careless, and fail to keep free for him just the one evening on which he particularly desired it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was after eleven when he reached her door, and as he made his apology for having been unable to come away earlier, she complained that it was indeed very late; the storm had made her unwell, her head ached, and she warned him that she would not let him stay longer than half an hour, that at midnight she would send him away; a little while later she felt tired and wished to sleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No cattleya, then, to-night?\" he asked, \"and I've been looking forward so to a nice little cattleya.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she was irresponsive; saying nervously: \"No, dear, no cattleya tonight. Can't you see, I'm not well?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It might have done you good, but I won't bother you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She begged him to put out the light before he went; he drew the curtains close round her bed and left her. But, when he was in his own house again, the idea suddenly struck him that, perhaps, Odette was expecting some one else that evening, that she had merely pretended to be tired, that she had asked him to put the light out only so that he should suppose that she was going to sleep, that the moment he had left the house she had lighted it again, and had reopened her door to the stranger who was to be her guest for the night. He looked at his watch. It was about an hour and a half since he had left her; he went out, took a cab, and stopped it close to her house, in a little street running at right angles to that other street, which lay at the back of her house, and along which he used to go, sometimes, to tap upon her bedroom window, for her to let him in. He left his cab; the streets were all deserted and dark; he walked a few yards and came out almost opposite her house. Amid the glimmering blackness of all the row of windows, the lights in which had long since been put out, he saw one, and only one, from which overflowed, between the slats of its shutters, dosed like a wine-press over its mysterious golden juice, the light that filled the room within, a light which on so many evenings, as soon as he saw it, far off, as he turned into the street, had rejoiced his heart with its message: \"She is there\u2014expecting you,\" and now tortured him with: \"She is there with the man she was expecting.\" He must know who; he tiptoed along by the wall until he reached the window, but between the slanting bars of the shutters he could see nothing; he could hear, only, in the silence of the night, the murmur of conversation. What agony he suffered as he watched that light, in whose golden atmosphere were moving, behind the closed sash, the unseen and detested pair, as he listened to that murmur which revealed the presence of the man who had crept in after his own departure, the perfidy of Odette, and the pleasures which she was at that moment tasting with the stranger\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet he was not sorry that he had come; the torment which had forced him to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its uncertainty, now that Odette's other life, of which he had had, at that first moment, a sudden helpless suspicion, was definitely there, almost within his grasp, before his eyes, in the full glare of the lamp-light, caught and kept there, an unwitting prisoner, in that room into which, when he would, he might force his way to surprise and seize it; or rather he would tap upon the shutters, as he had often done when he had come there very late, and by that signal Odette would at least learn that he knew, that he had seen the light and had heard the voices; while he himself, who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him, as sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been tricked, now it was he that saw them, confident and persistent in their error, tricked and trapped by none other than himself, whom they believed to be a mile away, but who was there, in person, there with a plan, there with the knowledge that he was going, in another minute, to tap upon the shutter. And, perhaps, what he felt (almost an agreeable feeling) at that moment was something more than relief at the solution of a doubt, at the soothing of a pain; was an intellectual pleasure. If, since he had fallen in love, things had recovered a little of the delicate attraction that they had had for him long ago\u2014though only when a light was shed upon them by a thought, a memory of Odette\u2014now it was another of the faculties, prominent in the studious days of his youth, that Odette had quickened with new life, the passion for truth, but for a truth which, too, was interposed between himself and his mistress, receiving its light from her alone, a private and personal truth the sole object of which (an infinitely precious object, and one almost impersonal in its absolute beauty) was Odette\u2014Odette in her activities, her environment, her projects, and her past. At every other period in his life, the little everyday words and actions of another person had always seemed wholly valueless to Swann; if gossip about such things were repeated to him, he would dismiss it as insignificant, and while he listened it was only the lowest, the most commonplace part of his mind that was interested; at such moments he felt utterly dull and uninspired. But in this strange phase of love the personality of another person becomes so enlarged, so deepened, that the curiosity which he could now feel aroused in himself, to know the least details of a woman's daily occupation, was the same thirst for knowledge with which he had once studied history. And all manner of actions, from which, until now, he would have recoiled in shame, such as spying, to-night, outside a window, to-morrow, for all he knew, putting adroitly provocative questions to casual witnesses, bribing servants, listening at doors, seemed to him, now, to be precisely on a level with the deciphering of manuscripts, the weighing of evidence, the interpretation of old monuments, that was to say, so many different methods of scientific investigation, each one having a definite intellectual value and being legitimately employable in the search for truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As his hand stole out towards the shutters he felt a pang of shame at the thought that Odette would now know that he had suspected her, that he had returned, that he had posted himself outside her window. She had often told him what a horror she had of jealous men, of lovers who spied. What he was going to do would be extremely awkward, and she would detest him for ever after, whereas now, for the moment, for so long as he refrained from knocking, perhaps even in the act of infidelity, she loved him still. How often is not the prospect of future happiness thus sacrificed to one's impatient insistence upon an immediate gratification. But his desire to know the truth was stronger, and seemed to him nobler than his desire for her. He knew that the true story of certain events, which he would have given his life to be able to reconstruct accurately and in full, was to be read within that window, streaked with bars of light, as within the illuminated, golden boards of one of those precious manuscripts, by whose wealth of artistic treasures the scholar who consults them cannot remain unmoved. He yearned for the satisfaction of knowing the truth which so impassioned him in that brief, fleeting, precious transcript, on that translucent page, so warm, so beautiful. And besides, the advantage which he felt\u2014which he so desperately wanted to feel\u2014that he had over them, lay perhaps not so much in knowing as in being able to shew them that he knew. He drew himself up on tiptoe. He knocked. They had not heard; he knocked again; louder; their conversation ceased. A man's voice\u2014he strained his ears to distinguish whose, among such of Odette's friends as he knew, the voice could be\u2014asked:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Who's that?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could not be certain of the voice. He knocked once again. The window first, then the shutters were thrown open. It was too late, now, to retire, and since she must know all, so as not to seem too contemptible, too jealous and inquisitive, he called out in a careless, hearty, welcoming tone:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Please don't bother; I just happened to be passing, and saw the light. I wanted to know if you were feeling better.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looked up. Two old gentlemen stood facing him, in the window, one of them with a lamp in his hand; and beyond them he could see into the room, a room that he had never seen before. Having fallen into the habit, When he came late to Odette, of identifying her window by the fact that it was the only one still lighted in a row of windows otherwise all alike, he had been misled, this time, by the light, and had knocked at the window beyond hers, in the adjoining house. He made what apology he could and hurried home, overjoyed that the satisfaction of his curiosity had preserved their love intact, and that, having feigned for so long, when in Odette's company, a sort of indifference, he had not now, by a demonstration of jealousy, given her that proof of the excess of his own passion which, in a pair of lovers, fully and finally dispenses the recipient from the obligation to love the other enough. He never spoke to her of this misadventure, he ceased even to think of it himself. But now and then his thoughts in their wandering course would come upon this memory where it lay unobserved, would startle it into life, thrust it more deeply down into his consciousness, and leave him aching with a sharp, far-rooted pain. As though this had been a bodily pain, Swann's mind was powerless to alleviate it; in the case of bodily pain, however, since it is independent of the mind, the mind can dwell upon it, can note that it has diminished, that it has momentarily ceased. But with this mental pain, the mind, merely by recalling it, created it afresh. To determine not to think of it was but to think of it still, to suffer from it still. And when, in conversation with his friends, he forgot his sufferings, suddenly a word casually uttered would make him change countenance as a wounded man does when a clumsy hand has touched his aching limb. When he came away from Odette, he was happy, he felt calm, he recalled the smile with which, in gentle mockery, she had spoken to him of this man or of that, a smile which was all tenderness for himself; he recalled the gravity of her head which she seemed to have lifted from its axis to let it droop and fall, as though against her will, upon his lips, as she had done on that first evening in the carriage; her languishing gaze at him while she lay nestling in his arms, her bended head seeming to recede between her shoulders, as though shrinking from the cold\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But then, at once, his jealousy, as it had been the shadow of his love, presented him with the complement, with the converse of that new smile with which she had greeted him that very evening,\u2014with which, now, perversely, she was mocking Swann while she tendered her love to another\u2014of that lowering of her head, but lowered now to fall on other lips, and (but bestowed upon a stranger) of all the marks of affection that she had shewn to him. And all these voluptuous memories which he bore away from her house were, as one might say, but so many sketches, rough plans, like the schemes of decoration which a designer submits to one in outline, enabling Swann to form an idea of the various attitudes, aflame or faint with passion, which she was capable of adopting for others. With the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he tasted in her company, every new caress that he invented (and had been so imprudent as to point out to her how delightful it was), every fresh charm that he found in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his secret torture-chamber\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A fresh turn was given to the screw when Swann recalled a sudden expression which he had intercepted, a few days earlier, and for the first time, in Odette's eyes. It was after dinner at the Verdurins'. Whether it was because Forcheville, aware that Saniette, his brother-in-law, was not in favour with them, had decided to make a butt of him, and to shine at his expense, or because he had been annoyed by some awkward remark which Saniette had made to him, although it had passed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever tactless allusion it might conceal, or possibly because he had been for some time looking out for an opportunity of securing the expulsion from the house of a fellow-guest who knew rather too much about him, and whom he knew to be so nice-minded that he himself could not help feeling embarrassed at times merely by his presence in the room, Forcheville replied to Saniette's tactless utterance with such a volley of abuse, going out of his way to insult him, emboldened, the louder he shouted, by the fear, the pain, the entreaties of his victim, that the poor creature, after asking Mme. Verdurin whether he should stay and receiving no answer, had left the house in stammering confusion and with tears in his eyes. Odette had looked on, impassive, at this scene; but when the door had closed behind Saniette, she had forced the normal expression of her face down, as the saying is, by several pegs, so as to bring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as Forcheville; her eyes had sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his audacity, of ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim; she had darted at him a look of complicity in the crime, which so clearly implied: \"That's finished him off, or I'm very much mistaken. Did you see what a fool he looked? He was actually crying,\" that Forcheville, when his eyes met hers, sobered in a moment from the anger, or pretended anger with which he was still flushed, smiled as he explained: \"He need only have made himself pleasant and he'd have been here still; a good scolding does a man no harm, at any time.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day when Swann had gone out early in the afternoon to pay a call, and had failed to find the person at home whom he wished to see, it occurred to him to go, instead, to Odette, at an hour when, although he never went to her house then as a rule, he knew that she was always at home, resting or writing letters until tea-time, and would enjoy seeing her for a moment, if it did not disturb her. The porter told him that he believed Odette to be in; Swann rang the bell, thought that he heard a sound, that he heard footsteps, but no one came to the door. Anxious and annoyed, he went round to the other little street, at the back of her house, and stood beneath her bedroom window; the curtains were drawn and he could see nothing; he knocked loudly upon the pane, he shouted; still no one came. He could see that the neighbours were staring at him. He turned away, thinking that, after all, he had perhaps been mistaken in believing that he heard footsteps; but he remained so preoccupied with the suspicion that he could turn his mind to nothing else. After waiting for an hour, he returned. He found her at home; she told him that she had been in the house when he rang, but had been asleep; the bell had awakened her; she had guessed that it must be Swann, and had run out to meet him, but he had already gone. She had, of course, heard him knocking at the window. Swann could at once detect in this story one of those fragments of literal truth which liars, when taken by surprise, console themselves by introducing into the composition of the falsehood which they have to invent, thinking that it can be safely incorporated, and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude. It was true that, when Odette had just done something which she did not wish to disclose, she would take pains to conceal it in a secret place in her heart. But as soon as she found herself face to face with the man to whom she was obliged to lie, she became uneasy, all her ideas melted like wax before a flame, her inventive and her reasoning faculties were paralysed, she might ransack her brain but would find only a void; still, she must say something, and there lay within her reach precisely the fact which she had wished to conceal, which, being the truth, was the one thing that had remained. She broke off from it a tiny fragment, of no importance in itself, assuring herself that, after all, it was the best thing to do, since it was a detail of the truth, and less dangerous, therefore, than a falsehood. \"At any rate, this is true,\" she said to herself; \"that's always something to the good; he may make inquiries; he will see that this is true; it won't be this, anyhow, that will give me away.\" But she was wrong; it was what gave her away; she had not taken into account that this fragmentary detail of the truth had sharp edges which could not: be made to fit in, except to those contiguous fragments of the truth from which she had arbitrarily detached it, edges which, whatever the fictitious details in which she might embed it, would continue to shew, by their overlapping angles and by the gaps which she had forgotten to fill, that its proper place was elsewhere\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She admits that she heard me ring, and then knock, that she knew it was myself, that she wanted to see me,\" Swann thought to himself. \"But that doesn't correspond with the fact that she did not let me in.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He did not, however, draw her attention to this inconsistency, for he thought that, if left to herself, Odette might perhaps produce some falsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth; she spoke; he did not interrupt her, he gathered up, with an eager and sorrowful piety, the words that fell from her lips, feeling (and rightly feeling, since she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke) that, like the veil of a sanctuary, they kept a vague imprint, traced a faint outline of that infinitely precious and, alas, undiscoverable truth;\u2014what she had been doing, that afternoon, at three o'clock, when he had called,\u2014a truth of which he would never possess any more than these falsifications, illegible and divine traces, a truth which would exist henceforward only in the secretive memory of this creature, who would contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value, but would never yield it up to him. It was true that he had, now and then, a strong suspicion that Odette's daily activities were not hi themselves passionately interesting, and that such relations as she might have with other men did not exhale, naturally, in a universal sense, or for every rational being, a spirit of morbid gloom capable of infecting with fever or of inciting to suicide. He realised, at such moments, that that interest, that gloom, existed in him only as a malady might exist, and that, once he was cured of the malady, the actions of Odette, the kisses that she might have bestowed, would become once again as innocuous as those of countless other women. But the consciousness that the painful curiosity with which Swann now studied them had its origin only in himself was not enough to make him decide that it was unreasonable to regard that curiosity as important, and to take every possible step to satisfy it. Swann had, in fact, reached an age the philosophy of which\u2014supported, in his case, by the current philosophy of the day, as well as by that of the circle in which he had spent most of his life, the group that surrounded the Princesse des Laumes, in which one's intelligence was understood to increase with the strength of one's disbelief in everything, and nothing real and incontestable was to be discovered, except the individual tastes of each of its members\u2014is no longer that of youth, but a positive, almost a medical philosophy, the philosophy of men who, instead of fixing their aspirations upon external objects, endeavour to separate from the accumulation of the years already spent a definite residue of habits and passions which they can regard as characteristic and permanent, and with which they will deliberately arrange, before anything else, that the kind of existence which they choose to adopt shall not prove inharmonious. Swann deemed it wise to make allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived from not knowing what Odette had done, just as he made allowance for the impetus which a damp climate always gave to his eczema; to anticipate in his budget the expenditure of a considerable sum on procuring, with regard to the daily occupations of Odette, information the lack of which would make him unhappy, just as he reserved a margin for the gratification of other tastes from which he knew that pleasure was to be expected (at least, before he had fallen in love) such as his taste for collecting things, or for good cooking\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he proposed to take leave of Odette, and to return home, she begged him to stay a little longer, and even detained him forcibly, seizing him by the arm as he was opening the door to go. But he gave no thought to that, for, among the crowd of gestures and speeches and other little incidents which go to make up a conversation, it is inevitable that we should pass (without noticing anything that arouses our interest) by those that hide a truth for which our suspicions are blindly searching, whereas we stop to examine others beneath which nothing lies concealed. She kept on saying: \"What a dreadful pity; you never by any chance come in the afternoon, and the one time you do come then I miss you.\" He knew very well that she was not sufficiently in love with him to be so keenly distressed merely at having missed his visit, but as she was a good-natured woman, anxious to give him pleasure, and often sorry when she had done anything that annoyed him, he found it quite natural that she should be sorry, on this occasion, that she had deprived him of that pleasure of spending an hour in her company, which was so very great a pleasure, if not to herself, at any rate to him. All the same, it was a matter of so little importance that her air of unrelieved sorrow began at length to bewilder him. She reminded him, even more than was usual, of the faces of some of the women created by the painter of the Primavera.' She had, at that moment, their downcast, heartbroken expression, which seems ready to succumb beneath the burden of a grief too heavy to be borne, when they are merely allowing the Infant Jesus to play with a pomegranate, or watching Moses pour water into a trough. He had seen the same sorrow once before on her face, but when, he could no longer say. Then, suddenly, he remembered it; it was when Odette had lied, in apologising to Mme. Verdurin on the evening after the dinner from which she had stayed away on a pretext of illness, but really so that she might be alone with Swann. Surely, even had she been the most scrupulous of women, she could hardly have felt remorse for so innocent a lie. But the lies which Odette ordinarily told were less innocent, and served to prevent discoveries which might have involved her in the most terrible difficulties with one or another of her friends. And so, when she lied, smitten with fear, feeling herself to be but feebly armed for her defence, unconfident of success, she was inclined to weep from sheer exhaustion, as children weep sometimes when they have not slept. She knew, also, that her lie, as a rule, was doing a serious injury to the man to whom she was telling it, and that she might find herself at his mercy if she told it badly. Therefore she felt at once humble and culpable in his presence. And when she had to tell an insignificant, social lie its hazardous associations, and the memories which it recalled, would leave her weak with a sense of exhaustion and penitent with a consciousness of wrongdoing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What depressing lie was she now concocting for Swann's benefit, to give her that pained expression, that plaintive voice, which seemed to falter beneath the effort that she was forcing herself to make, and to plead for pardon? He had an idea that it was not merely the truth about what had occurred that afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him, but something more immediate, something, possibly, which had not yet happened, but might happen now at any time, and, when it did, would throw a light upon that earlier event. At that moment, he heard the front-door bell ring. Odette never stopped speaking, but her words dwindled into an inarticulate moan. Her regret at not having seen Swann that afternoon, at not having opened the door to him, had melted into a universal despair\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could hear the gate being closed, and the sound of a carriage, as though some one were going away\u2014probably the person whom Swann must on no account meet\u2014after being told that Odette was not at home. And then, when he reflected that, merely by coming at an hour when he was not in the habit of coming, he had managed to disturb so many arrangements of which she did not wish him to know, he had a feeling of discouragement that amounted, almost, to distress. But since he was in love with Odette, since he was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards her, the pity with which he might have been inspired for himself he felt for her only, and murmured: \"Poor darling!\" When finally he left her, she took up several letters which were lying on the table, and asked him if he would be so good as to post them for her. He walked along to the post-office, took the letters from his pocket, and, before dropping each of them into the box, scanned its address. They were all to tradesmen, except the last, which was to Forcheville. He kept it in his hand. \"If I saw what was in this,\" he argued, \"I should know what she calls him, what she says to him, whether there really is anything between them. Perhaps, if I don't look inside, I shall be lacking in delicacy towards Odette, since in this way alone I can rid myself of a suspicion which is, perhaps, a calumny on her, which must, in any case, cause her suffering, and which can never possibly be set at rest, once the letter is posted.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He left the post-office and went home, but he had kept the last letter in his pocket. He lighted a candle, and held up close to its flame the envelope which he had not dared to open. At first he could distinguish nothing, but the envelope was thin, and by pressing it down on to the stiff card which it enclosed he was able, through the transparent paper, to read the concluding words. They were a coldly formal signature. If, instead of its being himself who was looking at a letter addressed to Forcheville, it had been Forcheville who had read a letter addressed to Swann, he might have found words in it of another, a far more tender kind! He took a firm hold of the card, which was sliding to and fro, the envelope being too large for it and then, by moving it with his finger and thumb, brought one line after another beneath the part of the envelope where the paper was not doubled, through which alone it was possible to read\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In spite of all these manoeuvres he could not make it out clearly. Not that it mattered, for he had seen enough to assure himself that the letter was about some trifling incident of no importance, and had nothing at all to do with love; it was something to do with Odette's uncle. Swann had read quite plainly at the beginning of the line \"I was right,\" but did not understand what Odette had been right in doing, until suddenly a word which he had not been able, at first, to decipher, came to light and made the whole sentence intelligible: \"I was right to open the door; it was my uncle.\" To open the door! Then Forcheville had been there when Swann rang the bell, and she had sent him away; hence the sound that Swann had heard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After that he read the whole letter; at the end she apologised for having treated Forcheville with so little ceremony, and reminded him that he had left his cigarette-case at her house, precisely what she had written to Swann after one of his first visits. But to Swann she had added: \"Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back.\" To Forcheville nothing of that sort; no allusion that could suggest any intrigue between them. And, really, he was obliged to admit that in all this business Forcheville had been worse treated than himself, since Odette was writing to him to make him believe that her visitor had been an uncle. From which it followed that he, Swann, was the man to whom she attached importance, and for whose sake she had sent the other away. And yet, if there had been nothing between Odette and Forcheville, why not have opened the door at once, why have said, \"I was right to open the door; it was my uncle.\" Right? if she was doing nothing wrong at that moment how could Forcheville possibly have accounted for her not opening the door? For a time Swann stood still there, heartbroken, bewildered, and yet happy; gazing at this envelope which Odette had handed to him without a scruple, so absolute was her trust in his honour; through its transparent window there had been disclosed to him, with the secret history of an incident which he had despaired of ever being able to learn, a fragment of the life of Odette, seen as through a narrow, luminous incision, cut into its surface without her knowledge. Then his jealousy rejoiced at the discovery, as though that jealousy had had an independent existence, fiercely egotistical, gluttonous of every thing that would feed its vitality, even at the expense of Swann himself. Now it had food in store, and Swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening, over the visits that Odette had received about five o'clock, and could seek to discover where Forcheville had been at that hour. For Swann's affection for Odette still preserved the form which had been imposed on it, from the beginning, by his ignorance of the occupations in which she passed her days, as well as by the mental lethargy which prevented him from supplementing that ignorance by imagination. He was not jealous, at first, of the whole of Odette's life, but of those moments only in which an incident, which he had perhaps misinterpreted, had led him to suppose that Odette might have played him false. His jealousy, like an octopus which throws out a first, then a second, and finally a third tentacle, fastened itself irremovably first to that moment, five o'clock in the afternoon, then to another, then to another again. But Swann was incapable of inventing his sufferings. They were only the memory, the perpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from without\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From without, however, everything brought him fresh suffering. He decided to separate Odette from Forcheville, by taking her away for a few days to the south. But he imagined that she was coveted by every male person in the hotel, and that she coveted them in return. And so he, who, in old days, when he travelled, used always to seek out new people and crowded places, might now be seen fleeing savagely from human society as if it had cruelly injured him. And how could he not have turned misanthrope, when in every man he saw a potential lover for Odette? Thus his jealousy did even more than the happy, passionate desire which he had originally felt for Odette had done to alter Swann's character, completely changing, in the eyes of the world, even the outward signs by which that character had been intelligible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read Odette's letter to Forcheville, Swann went to a dinner which the Verdurins were giving in the Bois. As the party was breaking up he noticed a series of whispered discussions between Mme. Verdurin and several of her guests, and thought that he heard the pianist being reminded to come next day to a party at Chatou; now he, Swann, had not been invited to any party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verdurins had spoken only in whispers, and in vague terms, but the painter, perhaps without thinking, shouted out: \"There must be no lights of any sort, and he must play the Moonlight Sonata in the dark, for us to see by.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin, seeing that Swann was within earshot, assumed that expression in which the two-fold desire to make the speaker be quiet and to preserve, oneself, an appearance of guilelessness in the eyes of the listener, is neutralised in an intense vacuity; in which the unflinching signs of intelligent complicity are overlaid by the smiles of innocence, an expression invariably adopted by anyone who has noticed a blunder, the enormity of which is thereby at once revealed if not to those who have made it, at any rate to him in whose hearing it ought not to have been made. Odette seemed suddenly to be in despair, as though she had decided not to struggle any longer against the crushing difficulties of life, and Swann was anxiously counting the minutes that still separated him from the point at which, after leaving the restaurant, while he drove her home, he would be able to ask for an explanation, to make her promise, either that she would not go to Chatou next day, or that she would procure an invitation for him also, and to lull to rest in her arms the anguish that still tormented him. At last the carriages were ordered. Mme. Verdurin said to Swann:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Good-bye, then. We shall see you soon, I hope,\" trying, by the friendliness of her manner and the constraint of her smile, to prevent him from noticing that she Was not saying, as she would always have until then:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To-morrow, then, at Chatou, and at my house the day after.\" M. and Mme. Verdurin made Forcheville get into their carriage; Swann's was drawn up behind it, and he waited for theirs to start before helping Odette into his own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Odette, we'll take you,\" said Mme. Verdurin, \"we've kept a little corner specially for you, beside M. de Forcheville.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, Mme. Verdurin,\" said Odette meekly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What! I thought I was to take you home,\" cried Swann, flinging discretion to the winds, for the carriage-door hung open, time was precious, and he could not, in his present state, go home without her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But Mme. Verdurin has asked me...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That's all right, you can quite well go home alone; we've left you like this dozens of times,\" said Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I had something important to tell Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Very well, you can write it to her instead.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Good-bye,\" said Odette, holding out her hand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He tried hard to smile, but could only succeed in looking utterly dejected\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What do you think of the airs that Swann is pleased to put on with us?\" Mme. Verdurin asked her husband when they had reached home. \"I was afraid he was going to eat me, simply because we offered to take Odette back. It really is too bad, that sort of thing. Why doesn't he say, straight out, that we keep a disorderly house? I can't conceive how Odette can stand such manners. He positively seems to be saying, all the time, 'You belong to me!' I shall tell Odette exactly what I think about it all, and I hope she will have the sense to understand me.\" A moment later she added, inarticulate with rage: \"No, but, don't you see, the filthy creature...\" using unconsciously, and perhaps in satisfaction of the same obscure need to justify herself\u2014like Fran\u00e7oise at Combray when the chicken refused to die\u2014the very words which the last convulsions of an inoffensive animal in its death agony wring from the peasant who is engaged in taking its life. And when Mme. Verdurin's carriage had moved on, and Swann's took its place, his coachman, catching sight of his face, asked whether he was unwell, or had heard bad news\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann sent him away; he preferred to walk, and it was on foot, through the Bois, that he came home. He talked to himself, aloud, and in the same slightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt when describing the charms of the 'little nucleus' and extolling the magnanimity of the Verdurins. But just as the conversation, the smiles, the kisses of Odette became as odious to him as he had once found them charming, if they were diverted to others than himself, so the Verdurins' drawing-room, which, not an hour before, had still seemed to him amusing, inspired with a genuine feeling for art and even with a sort of moral aristocracy, now that it was another than himself whom Odette was going to meet there, to love there without restraint, laid bare to him all its absurdities, its stupidity, its shame\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He drew a fanciful picture, at which he shuddered in disgust, of the party next evening at Chatou. \"Imagine going to Chatou, of all places! Like a lot of drapers after closing time! Upon my word, these people are sublime in their smugness; they can't really exist; they must all have come out of one of Labiche's plays!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Cottards would be there; possibly Brichot. \"Could anything be more grotesque than the lives of these little creatures, hanging on to one another like that. They'd imagine they were utterly lost, upon my soul they would, if they didn't all meet again to-morrow at Chatou!\" Alas! there would be the painter there also, the painter who enjoyed match-making, who would invite Forcheville to come with Odette to his studio. He could see Odette, in a dress far too smart for the country, \"for she is so vulgar in that way, and, poor little thing, she is such a fool!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could hear the jokes that Mme. Verdurin would make after dinner, jokes which, whoever the 'bore' might be at whom they were aimed, had always amused him because he could watch Odette laughing at them, laughing with him, her laughter almost a part of his. Now he felt that it was possibly at him that they would make Odette laugh. \"What a fetid form of humour!\" he exclaimed, twisting his mouth into an expression of disgust so violent that he could feel the muscles of his throat stiffen against his collar. \"How, in God's name, can a creature made in His image find anything to laugh at in those nauseating witticisms? The least sensitive nose must be driven away in horror from such stale exhalations. It is really impossible to believe that any human being is incapable of understanding that, in allowing herself merely to smile at the expense of a fellow-creature who has loyally held out his hand to her, she is casting herself into a mire from which it will be impossible, with the best will in the world, ever to rescue her. I dwell so many miles above the puddles in which these filthy little vermin sprawl and crawl and bawl their cheap obscenities, that I cannot possibly be spattered by the witticisms of a Verdurin!\" he cried, tossing up his head and arrogantly straightening his body. \"God knows that I have honestly attempted to pull Odette out of that sewer, and to teach her to breathe a nobler and a purer air. But human patience has its limits, and mine is at an end,\" he concluded, as though this sacred mission to tear Odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasms dated from longer than a few minutes ago, as though he had not undertaken it only since it had occurred to him that those sarcasms might, perchance, be directed at himself, and might have the effect of detaching Odette from him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could see the pianist sitting down to play the Moonlight Sonata, and the grimaces of Mme. Verdurin, in terrified anticipation of the wrecking of her nerves by Beethoven's music. \"Idiot, liar!\" he shouted, \"and a creature like that imagines that she's fond of Art!\" She would say to Odette, after deftly insinuating a few words of praise for Forcheville, as she had so often done for himself: \"You can make room for M. de Forcheville there, can't you, Odette?\"... '\"In the dark!' Codfish! Pander!\"... 'Pander' was the name he applied also to the music which would invite them to sit in silence, to dream together, to gaze in each other's eyes, to feel for each other's hands. He felt that there was much to be said, after all, for a sternly censorous attitude towards the arts, such as Plato adopted, and Bossuet, and the old school of education in France\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a word, the life which they led at the Verdurins', which he had so often described as 'genuine,' seemed to him now the worst possible form of life, and their 'little nucleus' the most degraded class of society. \"It really is,\" he repeated, \"beneath the lowest rung of the social ladder, the nethermost circle of Dante. Beyond a doubt, the august words of the Florentine refer to the Verdurins! When one comes to think of it, surely people 'in society' (and, though one may find fault with them now and then, still, after all they are a very different matter from that gang of blackmailers) shew a profound sagacity in refusing to know them, or even to dirty the tips of their fingers with them. What a sound intuition there is in that 'Noli me tangere' motto of the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had long since emerged from the paths and avenues of the Bois, he had almost reached his own house, and still, for he had not yet thrown off the intoxication of grief, or his whim of insincerity, but was ever more and more exhilarated by the false intonation, the artificial sonority of his own voice, he continued to perorate aloud in the silence of the night: \"People 'in society' have their failings, as no one knows better than I; but, after all, they are people to whom some things, at least, are impossible. So-and-so\" (a fashionable woman whom he had known) \"was far from being perfect, but, after all, one did find in her a fundamental delicacy, a loyalty in her conduct which made her, whatever happened, incapable of a felony, which fixes a vast gulf between her and an old hag like Verdurin. Verdurin! What a name! Oh, there's something complete about them, something almost fine in their trueness to type; they're the most perfect specimens of their disgusting class! Thank God, it was high time that I stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse with such infamy, such dung.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, just as the virtues which he had still attributed, an hour or so earlier, to the Verdurins, would not have sufficed, even although the Verdurins had actually possessed them, if they had not also favoured and protected his love, to excite Swann to that state of intoxication in which he waxed tender over their magnanimity, an intoxication which, even when disseminated through the medium of other persons, could have come to him from Odette alone;\u2014so the immorality (had it really existed) which he now found in the Verdurins would have been powerless, if they had not invited Odette with Forcheville and without him, to unstop the vials of his wrath and to make him scarify their 'infamy.' Doubtless Swann's voice shewed a finer perspicacity than his own when it refused to utter those words full of disgust at the Verdurins and their circle, and of joy at his having shaken himself free of it, save in an artificial and rhetorical tone, and as though his words had been chosen rather to appease his anger than to express his thoughts. The latter, in fact, while he abandoned himself to invective, were probably, though he did not know it, occupied with a wholly different matter, for once he had reached his house, no sooner had he closed the front-door behind him than he suddenly struck his forehead, and, making his servant open the door again, dashed out into the street shouting, in a voice which, this time, was quite natural; \"I believe I have found a way of getting invited to the dinner at Chatou to-morrow!\" But it must have been a bad way, for M. Swann was not invited; Dr. Cottard, who, having been summoned to attend a serious case in the country, had not seen the Verdurins for some days, and had been prevented from appearing at Chatou, said, on the evening after this dinner, as he sat down to table at their house:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, aren't we going to see M. Swann this evening? He is quite what you might call a personal friend...\" \"I sincerely trust that we sha'n't!\" cried Mme. Verdurin. \"Heaven preserve us from him; he's too deadly for words, a stupid, ill-bred boor.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On hearing these words Cottard exhibited an intense astonishment blended with entire submission, as though in the face of a scientific truth which contradicted everything that he had previously believed, but was supported by an irresistible weight of evidence; with timorous emotion he bowed his head over his plate, and merely replied: \"Oh\u2014oh\u2014oh\u2014oh\u2014oh!\" traversing, in an orderly retirement of his forces, into the depths of his being, along a descending scale, the whole compass of his voice. After which there was no more talk of Swann at the Verdurins'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_______________________________\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so that drawing-room which had brought Swann and Odette together became an obstacle in the way of their meeting. She no longer said to him, as she had said in the early days of their love: \"We shall meet, anyhow, to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the Verdurins',\" but \"We sha'n't be able to meet to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the Verdurins'.\" Or else the Verdurins were taking her to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, to see Une Nuit de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre, and Swann could read in her eyes that terror lest he should ask her not to go, which, but a little time before, he could not have refrained from greeting with a kiss as it flitted across the face of his mistress, but which now exasperated him. \"Yet I'm not really angry,\" he assured himself, \"when I see how she longs to run away and scratch from maggots in that dunghill of cacophony. I'm disappointed; not for myself, but for her; disappointed to find that, after living for more than six months in daily contact with myself, she has not been capable of improving her mind even to the point of spontaneously eradicating from it a taste for Victor Mass\u00e9! More than that, to find that she has not arrived at the stage of understanding that there are evenings on which anyone with the least shade of refinement of feeling should be willing to forego an amusement when she is asked to do so. She ought to have the sense to say: 'I shall not go,' if it were only from policy, since it is by what she answers now that the quality of her soul will be determined once and for all.\" And having persuaded himself that it was solely, after all, in order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate of Odette's spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him that evening instead of going to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, he adopted the same line of reasoning with her, with the same degree of insincerity as he had used with himself, or even with a degree more, for in her case he was yielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self-esteem\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I swear to you,\" he told her, shortly before she was to leave for the theatre, \"that, in asking you not to go, I should hope, were I a selfish man, for nothing so much as that you should refuse, for I have a thousand other things to do this evening, and I shall feel that I have been tricked and trapped myself, and shall be thoroughly annoyed, if, after all, you tell me that you are not going. But my occupations, my pleasures are not everything; I must think of you also. A day may come when, seeing me irrevocably sundered from you, you will be entitled to reproach me with not having warned you at the decisive hour in which I felt that I was going to pass judgment on you, one of those stern judgments which love cannot long resist. You see, your Nuit de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (what a title!) has no bearing on the point. What I must know is whether you are indeed one of those creatures in the lowest grade of mentality and even of charm, one of those contemptible creatures who are incapable of foregoing a pleasure. For if you are such, how could anyone love you, for you are not even a person, a definite, imperfect, but at least perceptible entity. You are a formless water that will trickle down any slope that it may come upon, a fish devoid of memory, incapable of thought, which all its life long in its aquarium will continue to dash itself, a hundred times a day, against a wall of glass, always mistaking it for water. Do you realise that your answer will have the effect\u2014I do not say of making me cease from that moment to love you, that goes without saying, but of making you less attractive to my eyes when I realise that you are not a person, that you are beneath everything in the world and have not the intelligence to raise yourself one inch higher? Obviously, I should have preferred to ask you, as though it had been a matter of little or no importance, to give up your Nuit de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject a name), in the hope that you would go to it none the less. But, since I had resolved to weigh you in the balance, to make so grave an issue depend upon your answer, I considered it more honourable to give you due warning.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, Odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty. Although the meaning of his tirade was beyond her, she grasped that it was to be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication, scenes which her familiarity with the ways of men enabled her, without paying any heed to the words that were uttered, to conclude that men would not make unless they were in love; that, from the moment when they were in love, it was superfluous to obey them, since they would only be more in love later on. And so, she would have heard Swann out with the utmost tranquillity had she not noticed that it was growing late, and that if he went on speaking for any length of time she would \"never\" as she told him with a fond smile, obstinate but slightly abashed, \"get there in time for the Overture.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which, more than anything else, would make him cease to love her, would be her refusal to abandon the habit of lying. \"Even from the point of view of coquetry, pure and simple,\" he had told her, \"can't you see how much of your attraction you throw away when you stoop to lying? By a frank admission\u2014how many faults you might redeem! Really, you are far less intelligent than I supposed!\" In vain, however, did Swann expound to her thus all the reasons that she had for not lying; they might have succeeded in overthrowing any universal system of mendacity, but Odette had no such system; she contented herself, merely, whenever she wished Swann to remain in ignorance of anything that she had done, with not telling him of it. So that a lie was, to her, something to be used only as a special expedient; and the one thing that could make her decide whether she should avail herself of a lie or not was a reason which, too, was of a special and contingent order, namely the risk of Swann's discovering that she had not told him the truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Physically, she was passing through an unfortunate phase; she was growing stouter, and the expressive, sorrowful charm, the surprised, wistful expressions which she had formerly had, seemed to have vanished with her first youth, with the result that she became most precious to Swann at the very moment when he found her distinctly less good-looking. He would gaze at her for hours on end, trying to recapture the charm which he had once seen in her and could not find again. And yet the knowledge that, within this new and strange chrysalis, it was still Odette that lurked, still the same volatile temperament, artful and evasive, was enough to keep Swann seeking, with as much passion as ever, to captivate her. Then he would look at photographs of her, taken two years before, and would remember how exquisite she had been. And that would console him, a little, for all the sufferings that he voluntarily endured on her account\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the Verdurins took her off to Saint-Germain, or to Chatou, or to Meulan, as often as not, if the weather was fine, they would propose to remain there for the night, and not go home until next day. Mme. Verdurin would endeavour to set at rest the scruples of the pianist, whose aunt had remained in Paris: \"She will be only too glad to be rid of you for a day. How on earth could she be anxious, when she knows you're with us? Anyhow, I'll take you all under my wing; she can put the blame on me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If this attempt failed, M. Verdurin would set off across country until he came to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger, after first finding out which of the 'faithful' had anyone whom they must warn. But Odette would thank him, and assure him that she had no message for anyone, for she had told Swann, once and for all, that she could not possibly send messages to him, before all those people, without compromising herself. Sometimes she would be absent for several days on end, when the Verdurins took her to see the tombs at Dreux, or to Compi\u00e8gne, on the painter's advice, to watch the sun setting through the forest\u2014after which they went on to the Ch\u00e2teau of Pierrefonds\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To think that she could visit really historic buildings with me, who have spent ten years in the study of architecture, who am constantly bombarded, by people who really count, to take them over Beauvais or Saint-Loup-de-Naud, and refuse to take anyone but her; and instead of that she trundles off with the lowest, the most brutally degraded of creatures, to go into ecstasies over the petrified excretions of Louis-Philippe and Viollet-le-Duc! One hardly needs much knowledge of art, I should say, to do that; though, surely, even without any particularly refined sense of smell, one would not deliberately choose to spend a holiday in the latrines, so as to be within range of their fragrant exhalations.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But when she had set off for Dreux or Pierrefonds\u2014alas, without allowing him to appear there, as though by accident, at her side, for, as she said, that would \"create a dreadful impression,\"\u2014he would plunge into the most intoxicating romance in the lover's library, the railway timetable, from which he learned the ways of joining her there in the afternoon, in the evening, even in the morning. The ways? More than that, the authority, the right to join her. For, after all, the time-table, and the trains themselves, were not meant for dogs. If the public were carefully informed, by means of printed advertisements, that at eight o'clock in the morning a train started for Pierrefonds which arrived there at ten, that could only be because going to Pierrefonds was a lawful act, for which permission from Odette would be superfluous; an act, moreover, which might be performed from a motive altogether different from the desire to see Odette, since persons who had never even heard of her performed it daily, and in such numbers as justified the labour and expense of stoking the engines\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So it came to this; that she could not prevent him from going to Pierrefonds if he chose to do so. Now that was precisely what he found that he did choose to do, and would at that moment be doing were he, like the travelling public, not acquainted with Odette. For a long time past he had wanted to form a more definite impression of Viollet-le-Duc's work as a restorer. And the weather being what it was, he felt an overwhelming desire to spend the day roaming in the forest of Compi\u00e8gne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was, indeed, a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access to the one spot that tempted him to-day. To-day! Why, if he went down there, in defiance of her prohibition, he would be able to see her that very day! But then, whereas, if she had met, at Pierrefonds, some one who did not matter, she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure: \"What, you here?\" and would have invited him to come and see her at the hotel where she was staying with the Verdurins, if, on the other hand, it was himself, Swann, that she encountered there, she would be annoyed, would complain that she was being followed, would love him less in consequence, might even turn away in anger when she caught sight of him. \"So, then, I am not to be allowed to go away for a day anywhere!\" she would reproach him on her return, whereas in fact it was he himself who was not allowed to go\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had had the sudden idea, so as to contrive to visit Compi\u00e8gne and Pierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet Odette, of securing an invitation from one of his friends, the Marquis de Forestelle, who had a country house in that neighbourhood. This friend, to whom Swann suggested the plan without disclosing its ulterior purpose, was beside himself with joy; he did not conceal his astonishment at Swann's consenting at last, after fifteen years, to come down and visit his property, and since he did not (he told him) wish to stay there, promised to spend some days, at least, in taking him for walks and excursions in the district. Swann imagined himself down there already with M. de Forestelle. Even before he saw Odette, even if he did not succeed in seeing her there, what a joy it would be to set foot on that soil where, not knowing the exact spot in which, at any moment, she was to be found, he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility of her suddenly appearing: in the courtyard of the Ch\u00e2teau, now beautiful in his eyes since it was on her account that he had gone to visit it; in all the streets of the town, which struck him as romantic; down every ride of the forest, roseate with the deep and tender glow of sunset;\u2014innumerable and alternative hiding-places, to which would fly simultaneously for refuge, in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his happy, vagabond and divided heart. \"We mustn't, on any account,\" he would warn M. de Forestelle, \"run across Odette and the Verdurins. I have just heard that they are at Pierrefonds, of all places, to-day. One has plenty of time to see them in Paris; it would hardly be worth while coming down here if one couldn't go a yard without meeting them.\" And his host would fail to understand why, once they had reached the place, Swann would change his plans twenty times in an hour, inspect the dining-rooms of all the hotels in Compi\u00e8gne without being able to make up his mind to settle down in any of them, although he had found no trace anywhere of the Verdurins, seeming to be in search of what he had claimed to be most anxious to avoid, and would in fact avoid, the moment he found it, for if he had come upon the little 'group,' he would have hastened away at once with studied indifference, satisfied that he had seen Odette and she him, especially that she had seen him when he was not, apparently, thinking about her. But no; she would guess at once that it was for her sake that he had come there. And when M. de Forestelle came to fetch him, and it was time to start, he excused himself: \"No, I'm afraid not; I can't go to Pierrefonds to-day. You see, Odette is there.\" And Swann was happy in spite of everything in feeling that if he, alone among mortals, had not the right to go to Pierrefonds that day, it was because he was in fact, for Odette, some one who differed from all other mortals, her lover; and because that restriction which for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel freely where one would, was but one of the many forms of that slavery, that love which was so dear to him. Decidedly, it was better not to risk a quarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for her return. He spent his days in poring over a map of the forest of Compi\u00e8gne, as though it had been that of the 'Pays du Tendre'; he surrounded himself with photographs of the Ch\u00e2teau of Pierrefonds. When the day dawned on which it was possible that she might return, he opened the time-table again, calculated what train she must have taken, and, should she have postponed her departure, what trains were still left for her to take. He did not leave the house, for fear of missing a telegram, he did not go to bed, in case, having come by the last train, she decided to surprise him with a midnight visit. Yes! The front-door bell rang. There seemed some delay in opening the door, he wanted to awaken the porter, he leaned out of the window to shout to Odette, if it was Odette, for in spite of the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to deliver in person, they were quite capable of telling her that he was not at home. It was only a servant coming in. He noticed the incessant rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never before paid any attention. He could hear them, one after another, a long way off, coming nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing away into the distance a message which was not for him. He waited all night, to no purpose, for the Verdurins had returned unexpectedly, and Odette had been in Paris since midday; it had not occurred to her to tell him; not knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone at a theatre, had long since gone home to bed, and was peacefully asleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact, she had never given him a thought. And such moments as these, in which she forgot Swann's very existence, were of more value to Odette, did more to attach him to her, than all her infidelities. For in this way Swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had once before been effective in making his interest blossom into love, on the night when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins' and had hunted for her all evening. And he did not have (as I had, afterwards, at Combray in my childhood) happy days in which to forget the sufferings that would return with the night. For his days, Swann must pass them without Odette; and as he told himself, now and then, to allow so pretty a woman to go out by herself in Paris was just as rash as to leave a case filled with jewels in the middle of the street. In this mood he would scowl furiously at the passers-by, as though they were so many pickpockets. But their faces\u2014a collective and formless mass\u2014escaped the grasp of his imagination, and so failed to feed the flame of his jealousy. The effort exhausted Swann's brain, until, passing his hand over his eyes, he cried out: \"Heaven help me!\" as people, after lashing themselves into an intellectual frenzy in their endeavours to master the problem of the reality of the external world, or that of the immortality of the soul, afford relief to their weary brains by an unreasoning act of faith. But the thought of his absent mistress was incessantly, indissolubly blended with all the simplest actions of Swann's daily life\u2014when he took his meals, opened his letters, went for a walk or to bed\u2014by the fact of his regret at having to perform those actions without her; like those initials of Philibert the Fair which, in the church of Brou, because of her grief, her longing for him, Margaret of Austria intertwined everywhere with her own. On some days, instead of staying at home, he would go for luncheon to a restaurant not far off, to which he had been attracted, some time before, by the excellence of its cookery, but to which he now went only for one of those reasons, at once mystical and absurd, which people call 'romantic'; because this restaurant (which, by the way, still exists) bore the same name as the street in which Odette lived: the Lap\u00e9rouse. Sometimes, when she had been away on a short visit somewhere, several days would elapse before she thought of letting him know that she had returned to Paris. And then she would say quite simply, without taking (as she would once have taken) the precaution of covering herself, at all costs, with a little fragment borrowed from the truth, that she had just, at that very moment, arrived by the morning train. What she said was a falsehood; at least for Odette it was a falsehood, inconsistent, lacking (what it would have had, if true) the support of her memory of her actual arrival at the station; she was even prevented from forming a mental picture of what she was saying, while she said it, by the contradictory picture, in her mind, of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at the moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train. In Swann's mind, however, these words, meeting no opposition, settled and hardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so indubitable that, if some friend happened to tell him that he had come by the same train and had not seen Odette, Swann would have been convinced that it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or hour, since his version did not agree with the words uttered by Odette. These words had never appeared to him false except when, before hearing them, he had suspected that they were going to be. For him to believe that she was lying, an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable. It was also, however, sufficient. Given that, everything that Odette might say appeared to him suspect. Did she mention a name: it was obviously that of one of her lovers; once this supposition had taken shape, he would spend weeks in tormenting himself; on one occasion he even approached a firm of 'inquiry agents' to find out the address and the occupation of the unknown rival who would give him no peace until he could be proved to have gone abroad, and who (he ultimately learned) was an uncle of Odette, and had been dead for twenty years\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although she would not allow him, as a rule, to meet her at public gatherings, saying that people would talk, it happened occasionally that, at an evening party to which he and she had each been invited\u2014at Forcheville's, at the painter's, or at a charity ball given in one of the Ministries\u2014he found himself in the same room with her. He could see her, but dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be spying upon the pleasures which she tasted in other company, pleasures which\u2014while he drove home in utter loneliness, and went to bed, as anxiously as I myself was to go to bed, some years later, on the evenings when he came to dine with us at Combray\u2014seemed illimitable to him since he had not been able to see their end. And, once or twice, he derived from such evenings that kind of happiness which one would be inclined (did it not originate in so violent a reaction from an anxiety abruptly terminated) to call peaceful, since it consists in a pacifying of the mind: he had looked in for a moment at a revel in the painter's studio, and was getting ready to go home; he was leaving behind him Odette, transformed into a brilliant stranger, surrounded by men to whom her glances and her gaiety, which were not for him, seemed to hint at some voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed there or elsewhere (possibly at the Bal des Incoh\u00e9rents, to which he trembled to think that she might be going on afterwards) which made Swann more jealous than the thought of their actual physical union, since it was more difficult to imagine; he was opening the door to go, when he heard himself called back in these words (which, by cutting off from the party that possible ending which had so appalled him, made the party itself seem innocent in retrospect, made Odette's return home a thing no longer inconceivable and terrible, but tender and familiar, a thing that kept close to his side, like a part of his own daily life, in his carriage; a thing that stripped Odette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety in her appearance, shewed that it was only a disguise which she had assumed for a moment, for his sake and not in view of any mysterious pleasures, a disguise of which she had already wearied)\u2014in these words, which Odette flung out after him as he was crossing the threshold: \"Can't you wait a minute for me? I'm just going; we'll drive back together and you can drop me.\" It was true that on one occasion Forcheville had asked to be driven home at the same time, but when, on reaching Odette's gate, he had begged to be allowed to come in too, she had replied, with a finger pointed at Swann: \"Ah! That depends on this gentleman. You must ask him. Very well, you may come in, just for a minute, if you insist, but you mustn't stay long, for, I warn you, he likes to sit and talk quietly with me, and he's not at all pleased if I have visitors when he's here. Oh, if you only knew the creature as I know him; isn't that so, my love, there's no one that really knows you, is there, except me?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Swann was, perhaps, even more touched by the spectacle of her addressing him thus, in front of Forcheville, not only in these tender words of predilection, but also with certain criticisms, such as: \"I feel sure you haven't written yet to your friends, about dining with them on Sunday. You needn't go if you don't want to, but you might at least be polite,\" or \"Now, have you left your essay on Vermeer here, so that you can do a little more to it to-morrow? What a lazy-bones! I'm going to make you work, I can tell you,\" which proved that Odette kept herself in touch with his social engagements and his literary work, that they had indeed a life in common. And as she spoke she bestowed on him a smile which he interpreted as meaning that she was entirely his\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, while she was making them some orangeade, suddenly, just as when the reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting all round an object, on the wall beyond it, huge and fantastic shadows which, in time, contract and are lost in the shadow of the object itself, all the terrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of Odette melted away and vanished in the charming creature who stood there before his eyes. He had the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in Odette's house, in the lamp-light, was, perhaps, after all, not an artificial hour, invented for his special use (with the object of concealing that frightening and delicious thing which was incessantly in his thoughts without his ever being able to form a satisfactory impression of it, an hour of Odette's real life, of her life when he was not there, looking on) with theatrical properties and pasteboard fruits, but was perhaps a genuine hour of Odette's life; that, if he himself had not been there, she would have pulled forward the same armchair for Forcheville, would have poured out for him, not any unknown brew, but precisely that orangeade which she was now offering to them both; that the world inhabited by Odette was not that other world, fearful and supernatural, in which he spent his time in placing her\u2014and which existed, perhaps, only in his imagination, but the real universe, exhaling no special atmosphere of gloom, comprising that table at which he might sit down, presently, and write, and this drink which he was being permitted, now, to taste; all the objects which he contemplated with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude, for if, in absorbing his dreams, they had delivered him from an obsession, they themselves were, in turn, enriched by the absorption; they shewed him the palpable realisation of his fancies, and they interested his mind; they took shape and grew solid before-his eyes, and at the same time they soothed his troubled heart. Ah! had fate but allowed him to share a single dwelling with Odette, so that in her house he should be in his own; if, when asking his servant what there would be for luncheon, it had been Odette's bill of fare that he had learned from the reply; if, when Odette wished to go for a walk, in the morning, along the Avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne, his duty as a good husband had obliged him, though he had no desire to go out, to accompany her, carrying her cloak when she was too warm; and in the evening, after dinner, if she wished to stay at home, and not to dress, if he had been forced to stay beside her, to do what she asked; then how completely would all the trivial details of Swann's life, which seemed to him now so gloomy, simply because they would, at the same time, have formed part of the life of Odette, have taken on\u2014like that lamp, that orangeade, that armchair, which had absorbed so much of his dreams, which materialised so much of his longing,\u2014a sort of superabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much longed was a calm, a peace, which would not have created an atmosphere favourable to his love. When Odette ceased to be for him a creature always absent, regretted, imagined; when the feeling that he had for her was no longer the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by the phrase from the sonata, but constant affection and gratitude, when those normal relations were established between them which would put an end to his melancholy madness; then, no doubt, the actions of Odette's daily life would appear to him as being of but little intrinsic interest\u2014as he had several times, already, felt that they might be, on the day, for instance, when he had read, through its envelope, her letter to Forcheville. Examining his complaint with as much scientific detachment as if he had inoculated himself with it in order to study its effects, he told himself that, when he was cured of it, what Odette might or might not do would be indifferent to him. But in his morbid state, to tell the truth, he feared death itself no more than such a recovery, which would, in fact, amount to the death of all that he then was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After these quiet evenings, Swann's suspicions would be temporarily lulled; he would bless the name of Odette, and next day, in the morning, would order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her, because her kindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude, or the desire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love for her which had need of some such outlet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But at other times, grief would again take hold of him; he would imagine that Odette was Forcheville's mistress, and that, when they had both sat watching him from the depths of the Verdurins' landau, in the Bois, on the evening before the party at Chatou to which he had not been invited, while he implored her in vain, with that look of despair on his face which even his coachman had noticed, to come home with him, and then turned away, solitary, crushed,\u2014she must have employed, to draw Forcheville's attention to him, while she murmured: \"Do look at him, storming!\" the same glance, brilliant, malicious, sidelong, cunning, as on the evening when Forcheville had driven Saniette from the Verdurins'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At such times Swann detested her. \"But I've been a fool, too,\" he would argue. \"I'm paying for other men's pleasures with my money. All the same, she'd better take care, and not pull the string too often, for I might very well stop giving her anything at all. At any rate, we'd better knock off supplementary favours for the time being. To think that, only yesterday, when she said she would like to go to Bayreuth for the season, I was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly little places the King of Bavaria has there, for the two of us. However she didn't seem particularly keen; she hasn't said yes or no yet. Let's hope that she'll refuse. Good God! Think of listening to Wagner for a fortnight on end with her, who takes about as much interest in music as a fish does in little apples; it will be fun!\" And his hatred, like his love, needing to manifest itself in action, he amused himself with urging his evil imaginings further and further, because, thanks to the perfidies with which he charged Odette, he detested her still more, and would be able, if it turned out\u2014as he tried to convince himself\u2014that she was indeed guilty of them, to take the opportunity of punishing her, emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath. In this way, he went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from her, in which she would ask him for money to take the house at Bayreuth, but with the warning that he was not to come there himself, as she had promised Forcheville and the Verdurins to invite them. Oh, how he would have loved it, had it been conceivable that she would have that audacity. What joy he would have in refusing, in drawing up that vindictive reply, the terms of which he amused himself by selecting and declaiming aloud, as though he had actually received her letter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The very next day, her letter came. She wrote that the Verdurins and their friends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances of Wagner, and that, if he would be so good as to send her the money, she would be able at last, after going so often to their house, to have the pleasure of entertaining the Verdurins in hers. Of him she said not a word; it was to be taken for granted that their presence at Bayreuth would be a bar to his\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then that annihilating answer, every word of which he had carefully rehearsed overnight, without venturing to hope that it could ever be used, he had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her. Alas! he felt only too certain that with the money which she had, or could easily procure, she would be able, all the same, to take a house at Bayreuth, since she wished to do so, she who was incapable of distinguishing between Bach and Clapisson. Let her take it, then; she would have to live in it more frugally, that was all. No means (as there would have been if he had replied by sending her several thousand-franc notes) of organising, each evening, in her hired castle, those exquisite little suppers, after which she might perhaps be seized by the whim (which, it was possible, had never yet seized her) of falling into the arms of Forcheville. At any rate, this loathsome expedition, it would not be Swann who had to pay for it. Ah! if he could only manage to prevent it, if she could sprain her ankle before starting, if the driver of the carriage which was to take her to the station would consent (no matter how great the bribe) to smuggle her to some place where she could be kept for a time in seclusion, that perfidious woman, her eyes tinselled with a smile of complicity for Forcheville, which was what Odette had become for Swann in the last forty-eight hours\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she was never that for very long; after a few days the shining, crafty eyes lost their brightness and their duplicity, that picture of an execrable Odette saying to Forcheville: \"Look at him storming!\" began to grow pale and to dissolve. Then gradually reappeared and rose before him, softly radiant, the face of the other Odette, of that Odette who al^o turned with a smile to Forcheville, but with a smile in which there was nothing but affection for Swann, when she said: \"You mustn't stay long, for this gentleman doesn't much like my having visitors when he's here. Oh! if you only knew the creature as I know him!\" that same smile with which she used to thank Swann for some instance of his courtesy which she prized so highly, for some advice for which she had asked him in one of those grave crises in her life, when she could turn to him alone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, to this other Odette, he would ask himself what could have induced him to write that outrageous letter, of which, probably, until then, she had never supposed him capable, a letter which must have lowered him from the high, from the supreme place which, by his generosity, by his loyalty, he had won for himself in her esteem. He would become less dear to her, since it was for those qualities, which she found neither in Forcheville nor in any other, that she loved him. It was for them that Odette so often shewed him a reciprocal kindness, which counted for less than nothing in his moments of jealousy, because it was not a sign of reciprocal desire, was indeed a proof rather of affection than of love, but the importance of which he began once more to feel in proportion as the spontaneous relaxation of his suspicions, often accelerated by the distraction brought to him by reading about art or by the conversation of a friend, rendered his passion less exacting of reciprocities\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now that, after this swing of the pendulum, Odette had naturally returned to the place from which Swann's jealousy had for the moment driven her, in the angle in which he found her charming, he pictured her to himself as full of tenderness, with a look of consent in her eyes, and so beautiful that he could not refrain from moving his lips towards her, as though she had actually been in the room for him to kiss; and he preserved a sense of gratitude to her for that bewitching, kindly glance, as strong as though she had really looked thus at him, and it had not been merely his imagination that had portrayed it in order to satisfy his desire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What distress he must have caused her! Certainly he found adequate reasons for his resentment, but they would not have been sufficient to make him feel that resentment, if he had not so passionately loved her. Had he not nourished grievances, just as serious, against other women, to whom he would, none the less, render willing service to-day, feeling no anger towards them because he no longer loved them? If the day ever came when he would find himself in the same state of indifference with regard to Odette, he would then understand that it was his jealousy alone which had led him to find something atrocious, unpardonable, in this desire (after all, so natural a desire, springing from a childlike ingenuousness and also from a certain delicacy in her nature) to be able, in her turn, when an occasion offered, to repay the Verdurins for their hospitality, and to play the hostess in a house of her own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He returned to the other point of view\u2014opposite to that of his love and of his jealousy, to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental equity, and in order to make allowance for different eventualities\u2014from which he tried to form a fresh judgment of Odette, based on the supposition that he had never been in love with her, that she was to him just a woman like other women, that her life had not been (whenever he himself was not present) different, a texture woven in secret apart from him, and warped against him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with Forcheville or with other men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with him, and which his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements? At Bayreuth, as in Paris, if it should happen that Forcheville thought of him at all, it would only be as of some one who counted for a great deal in the life of Odette, some one for whom he was obliged to make way, when they met in her house. If Forcheville and she scored a triumph by being down there together in spite of him, it was he who had engineered that triumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going there, whereas if he had approved of her plan, which for that matter was quite defensible, she would have had the appearance of being there by his counsel, she would have felt herself sent there, housed there by him, and for the pleasure which she derived from entertaining those people who had so often entertained her, it was to him that she would have had to acknowledge her indebtedness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if\u2014instead of letting her go off thus, at cross-purposes with him, without having seen him again\u2014he were to send her this money, if he were to encourage her to take this journey, and to go out of his way to make it comfortable and pleasant for her, she would come running to him, happy, grateful, and he would have the joy\u2014the sight of her face\u2014which he had not known for nearly a week, a joy which none other could replace. For the moment that Swann was able to form a picture of her without revulsion, that he could see once again the friendliness in her smile, and that the desire to tear her away from every rival was no longer imposed by his jealousy upon his love, that love once again became, more than anything, a taste for the sensations which Odette's person gave him, for the pleasure which he found in admiring, as one might a spectacle, or in questioning, as one might a phenomenon, the birth of one of her glances, the formation of one of her smiles, the utterance of an intonation of her voice. And this pleasure, different from every other, had in the end created in him a need of her, which she alone, by her presence or by her letters, could assuage, almost as disinterested, almost as artistic, as perverse as another need which characterised this new period in Swann's life, when the sereness, the depression of the preceding years had been followed by a sort of spiritual superabundance, without his knowing to what he owed this unlooked-for enrichment of his life, any more than a person in delicate health who from a certain moment grows stronger, puts on flesh, and seems for a time to be on the road to a complete recovery:\u2014this other need, which, too, developed in him independently of the visible, material world, was the need to listen to music and to learn to know it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, by the chemical process of his malady, after he had created jealousy out of his love, he began again to generate tenderness, pity for Odette. She had become once more the old Odette, charming and kind. He was full of remorse for having treated her harshly. He wished her to come to him, and, before she came, he wished to have already procured for her some pleasure, so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her face and moulding her smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So, too, Odette, certain of seeing him come to her in a few days, as tender and submissive as before, and plead with her for a reconciliation, became inured, was no longer afraid of displeasing him, or even of making him angry, and refused him, whenever it suited her, the favours by which he set most store\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during their quarrel, when he had told her that he would not send her any money, but would do what he could to hurt her. Perhaps she did not realise, either, how sincere he still was, if not with her, at any rate with himself, on other occasions when, for the sake of their future relations, to shew Odette that he was capable of doing without her, that a rupture was still possible between them, he decided to wait some time before going to see her again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes several days had elapsed, during which she had caused him no fresh anxiety; and as, from the next few visits which he would pay her, he knew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure, but, more probably, some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in which he found himself, he wrote to her that he was very busy, and would not be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested. Meanwhile, a letter from her, crossing his, asked him to postpone one of those very meetings. He asked himself, why; his suspicions, his grief, again took hold of him. He could no longer abide, in the new state of agitation into which he found himself plunged, by the arrangements which he had made in his preceding state of comparative calm; he would run to find her, and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following days. And even if she had not written first, if she merely acknowledged his letter, it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing her. For, upsetting all Swann's calculations, Odette's acceptance had entirely changed his attitude. Like everyone who possesses something precious, so as to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to possess it, he had detached the precious object from his mind, leaving, as he thought, everything else in the same state as when it was there. But the absence of one part from a whole is not only that, it is not simply a partial omission, it is a disturbance of all the other parts, a new state which it was impossible to foresee from the old\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But at other times\u2014when Odette was on the point of going away for a holiday\u2014it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the pretext, that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until her return, giving the appearance (and expecting the reward) of a serious rupture, which she would perhaps regard as final, to a separation, the greater part of which was inevitable, since she was going away, which, in fact, he was merely allowing to start a little sooner than it must. At once he could imagine Odette, puzzled, anxious, distressed at having received neither visit nor letter from him and this picture of her, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break himself of the habit of seeing her. At odd moments, no doubt, in the furthest recesses of his brain, where his determination had thrust it away, and thanks to the length of the interval, the three weeks' separation to which he had agreed, it was with pleasure that he would consider the idea that he would see Odette again on her return; but it was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself whether he would not readily consent to the doubling of the period of so easy an abstinence. It had lasted, so far, but three days, a much shorter time than he had often, before, passed without seeing Odette, and without having, as on this occasion he had, premeditated a separation. And yet, there and then, some tiny trace of contrariety in his mind, or of weakness in his body,\u2014by inciting him to regard the present as an exceptional moment, one not to be governed by the rules, one in which prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of the soothing effects of a pleasure and to give his will (until the time should come when its efforts might serve any purpose) a holiday\u2014suspended the action of his will, which ceased to exert its inhibitive control; or, without that even, the thought of some information for which he had forgotten to ask Odette, such as if she had decided in what colour she would have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to some investment, whether they were 'ordinary' or 'preference' shares that she wished him to buy (for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without seeing her, but if, after that, the carriage had to be painted over again, if the shares produced no dividend, a fine lot of good he would have done),\u2014and suddenly, like a stretched piece of elastic which is let go, or the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open, the idea of seeing her again, from the remote point in time to which it had been attached, sprang back into the field of the present and of immediate possibilities\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance, so irresistible, in fact, that Swann had been far less unhappy in watching the end gradually approaching, day by day, of the fortnight which he must spend apart from Odette, than he was when kept waiting ten minutes while his coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to her, minutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy, in which he recaptured a thousand times over, to lavish on it all the wealth of his affection, that idea of his meeting with Odette, which, by so abrupt a repercussion, at a moment when he supposed it so remote, was once more present and on the very surface of his consciousness. The fact was that this idea no longer found, as an obstacle in its course, the desire to contrive without further delay to resist its coming, which had ceased to have any place in Swann's mind since, having proved to himself\u2014or so, at least, he believed\u2014that he was so easily capable of resisting it, he no longer saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of separation which he was now certain of being able to put into operation whenever he would. Furthermore, this idea of seeing her again came back to him adorned with a novelty, a seductiveness, armed with a virulence, all of which long habit had enfeebled, but which had acquired new vigour during this privation, not of three days but of a fortnight (for a period of abstinence may be calculated, by anticipation, as having lasted already until the final date assigned to it), and had converted what had been, until then, a pleasure in store, which could easily be sacrificed, into an unlooked-for happiness which he was powerless to resist. Finally, the idea returned to him with its beauty enhanced by his own ignorance of what Odette might have thought, might, perhaps, have done on finding that he shewed no sign of life, with the result that he was going now to meet with the entrancing revelation of an Odette almost unknown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she, just as she had supposed that his refusal to send her money was only a feint, saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came, now, to ask her, about the repainting of her carriage, or the purchase of stock. For she could not reconstruct the several phases of these crises through which he passed, and in the general idea which she formed of them she made no attempt to understand their mechanism, looking only to what she knew beforehand, their necessary, never-failing and always identical termination. An imperfect idea (though possibly all the more profound in consequence), if one were to judge it from the point of view of Swann, who would doubtless have considered that Odette failed to understand him, just as a morphinomaniac or a consumptive, each persuaded that he has been thrown back, one by some outside event, at the moment when he was just going to shake himself free from his inveterate habit, the other by an accidental indisposition at the moment when he was just going to be finally cured, feels himself to be misunderstood by the doctor who does not attach the same importance to these pretended contingencies, mere disguises, according to him, assumed, so as to be perceptible by his patients, by the vice of one and the morbid state of the other, which in reality have never ceased to weigh heavily and incurably upon them while they were nursing their dreams of normality and health. And, as a matter of fact, Swann's love had reached that stage at which the physician and (in the case of certain affections) the boldest of surgeons ask themselves whether to deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is still reasonable, or indeed possible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, of the extent of this love Swann had no direct knowledge. When he sought to measure it, it happened sometimes that he found it diminished, shrunken almost to nothing; for instance, the very moderate liking, amounting almost to dislike, which, in the days before he was in love with Odette, he had felt for her expressive features, her faded complexion, returned on certain days. \"Really, I am making distinct headway,\" he would tell himself on the morrow, \"when I come to think it over carefully, I find out that I got hardly any pleasure, last night, out of being in bed with her; it's an odd thing, but I actually thought her ugly.\" And certainly he was sincere, but his love extended a long way beyond the province of physical desire. Odette's person, indeed, no longer held any great place in it. When his eyes fell upon the photograph of Odette on his table, or when she came to see him, he had difficulty in identifying her face, either in the flesh or on the pasteboard, with the painful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his mind. He would say to himself, almost with astonishment, \"It is she!\" as when suddenly some one shews us in a detached, externalised form one of our own maladies, and we find in it no resemblance to what we are suffering. \"She?\"\u2014he tried to ask himself what that meant; for it is something like love, like death (rather than like those vague conceptions of maladies), a thing which one repeatedly calls in question, in order to make oneself probe further into it, in the fear that the question will find no answer, that the substance will escape our grasp\u2014the mystery of personality. And this malady, which was Swann's love, had so far multiplied, was so closely interwoven with all his habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his sleep, his life, even with what he hoped for after his death, was so entirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it away without almost entirely destroying him; as surgeons say, his case was past operation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests that when by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion, reminding himself that his social relations, like a beautifully wrought setting (although she would not have been able to form any very exact estimate of its worth), might, still, add a little to his own value in Odette's eyes (as indeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his love itself, which for Odette depreciated everything that it touched by seeming to denounce such things as less precious than itself), he would feel there, simultaneously with his distress at being in places and among people that she did not know, the same detached sense of pleasure as he would have derived from a novel or a painting in which were depicted the amusements of a leisured class; just as, at home, he used to enjoy the thought of the smooth efficiency of his household, the smartness of his own wardrobe and of his servants' liveries, the soundness of his investments, with the same relish as when he read in Saint-Simon, who was one of his favourite authors, of the machinery of daily life at Versailles, what Mme. de Maintenon ate and drank, or the shrewd avarice and great pomp of Lulli. And in the small extent to which this detachment was not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure which Swann was tasting was that he could emigrate for a moment into those few and distant parts of himself which had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain. In this respect the personality, with which my great-aunt endowed him, of 'young Swann,' as distinct from the more individual personality of Charles Swann, was that in which he now most delighted. Once when, because it was the birthday of the Princesse de Parme (and because she could often be of use, indirectly, to Odette, by letting her have seats for galas and jubilees and all that sort of thing), he had decided to send her a basket of fruit, and was not quite sure where or how to order it, he had entrusted the task to a cousin of his mother who, delighted to be doing a commission for him, had written to him, laying stress on the fact that she had not chosen all the fruit at the same place, but the grapes from Crapote, whose speciality they were, the straw berries from Jauret, the pears from Chevet, who always had the best, am soon, \"every fruit visited and examined, one by one, by myself.\" And ii the sequel, by the cordiality with which the Princess thanked him, hi had been able to judge of the flavour of the strawberries and of the ripe ness of the pears. But, most of all, that \"every fruit visited and examinee one by one, by myself\" had brought balm to his sufferings by carrying hi mind off to a region which he rarely visited, although it was his by right, as the heir of a rich and respectable middle-class family in which had been handed down from generation to generation the knowledge of the 'right places' and the art of ordering things from shops\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of a truth, he had too long forgotten that he was 'young Swann' not to feel, when he assumed that part again for a moment, a keener pleasure than he was capable of feeling at other times\u2014when, indeed, he was grown sick of pleasure; and if the friendliness of the middle-class people, for whom he had never been anything else than 'young Swann,' was less animated than that of the aristocrats (though more flattering, for all that, since in the middle-class mind friendship is inseparable from respect), no letter from a Royal Personage, offering him some princely entertainment, could ever be so attractive to Swann as the letter which asked him to be a witness, or merely to be present at a wedding in the family of some old friends of his parents; some of whom had 'kept up' with him, like my grandfather, who, the year before these events, had invited him to my mother's wedding, while others barely knew him by sight, but were, they thought, in duty bound to shew civility to the son, to the worthy successor of the late M. Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, by virtue of his intimacy, already time-honoured, with so many of them, the people of fashion, in a certain sense, were also a part of his house, his service, and his family. He felt, when his mind dwelt upon his brilliant connections, the same external support, the same solid comfort as when he looked at the fine estate, the fine silver, the fine table-linen which had come down to him from his forebears. And the thought that, if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the house, the people whom his valet would instinctively run to find would be the Duc de Chartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg and the Baron de Charlus, brought him the same consolation as our old Fran\u00e7oise derived from the knowledge that she would, one day, be buried in her own fine clothes, marked with her name, not darned at all (or so exquisitely darned that it merely enhanced one's idea of the skill and patience of the seamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which in her mind's eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually of wealth and prosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. But most of all,\u2014since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference to Odette, Swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed feeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome to her than anyone, even the most wearisome of the Verdurins' 'faithful,'\u2014when he betook himself to a world in which he was the paramount example of taste, a man whom no pains were spared to attract, whom people were genuinely sorry not to see, he began once again to believe in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite for it, as an invalid may feel who has been in bed for months and on a strict diet, when he picks up a newspaper and reads the account of an official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise round Sicily\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not paying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her that he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He still paid them (asking himself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps exhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her, it would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each visit he found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some information which she required, M. de Charlus, whom he had met actually going to her house, and who had insisted upon Swann's accompanying him. And, failing any excuse, he would beg M. de Charlus to go to her at once, and to tell her, as though spontaneously, in the course of conversation, that he had just remembered something that he had to say to Swann, and would she please send a message to Swann's house asking him to come to her then and there; but as a rule Swann waited at home in vain, and M. de Charlus informed him, later in the evening, that his device had not proved successful. With the result that, if she was now frequently away from Paris, even when she was there he scarcely saw her; that she who, when she was in love with him, used to say, \"I am always free\" and \"What can it matter to me, what other people think?\" now, whenever he wanted to see her, appealed to the proprieties or pleaded some engagement. When he spoke of going to a charity entertainment, or a private view, or a first-night at which she was to be present, she would expostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public, that he was treating her like a woman off the streets. Things came to such a pitch that, in an effort to save himself from being altogether forbidden to meet her anywhere, Swann, remembering that she knew and was deeply attached to my great-uncle Adolphe, whose friend he himself also had been, went one day to see him in his little flat in the Rue de Bellechasse, to ask him to use his influence with Odette. As it happened, she invariably adopted, when she spoke to Swann about my uncle, a poetical tone, saying: \"Ah, he! He is not in the least like you; it is an exquisite thing, a great, a beautiful thing, his friendship for me. He's not the sort of man who would have so little consideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in public.\" This was embarrassing for Swann, who did not know quite to what rhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of Odette to my uncle. He began by alluding to her excellence, a priori, the axiom of her seraphic super-humanity, the revelation of her inexpressible virtues, no conception of which could possibly be formed. \"I should like to speak to you about her,\" he went on, \"you, who know what a woman supreme above all women, what an adorable being, what an angel Odette is. But you know, also, what life is in Paris. Everyone doesn't see Odette in the light in which you and I have been Privileged to see her. And so there are people who think that I am behaving rather foolishly; she won't even allow me to meet her out of doors, at the theatre. Now you, in whom she has such enormous confidence, couldn't you say a few words for me to her, just to assure her that she exaggerate the harm which my bowing to her in the street might do her?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My uncle advised Swann not to see Odette for some days, after which she would love him all the more; he advised Odette to let Swann meet her everywhere, and as often as he pleased. A few days later Odette told Swann that she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that my uncle was the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault. She calmed Swann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my uncle to a duel, but he refused to shake hands with him when they met again. He regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped, if he had met my uncle Adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk things over with him in strict confidence, to be able to get him to throw a light on certain rumours with regard to the life that Odette had led, in the old days, at Nice. For my uncle Adolphe used to spend the winter there, and Swann thought that it might indeed have been there, perhaps, that he had first known Odette. The few words which some one had let fall, in his hearing, about a man who, it appeared, had been Odette's lover, had left Swann dumbfounded. But the very things which he would, before knowing them, have regarded as the most terrible to learn and the most impossible to believe, were, once he knew them, incorporated for all time in the general mass of his sorrow; he admitted them, he could no longer have understood their not existing. Only, each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line, altering the picture that he had formed of his mistress. At one time indeed he felt that he could understand that this moral 'lightness,' of which he would never have suspected Odette, was perfectly well known, and that at Baden or Nice, when she had gone, in the past, to spend several months in one or the other place, she had enjoyed a sort of amorous notoriety. He attempted, in order to question them, to get into touch again with certain men of that stamp; but these were aware that he knew Odette, and, besides, he was afraid of putting the thought of her into their heads, of setting them once more upon her track. But he, to whom, up till then, nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that pertained to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or of Nice, now that he learned that Odette had, perhaps, led a 'gay' life once in those pleasure-cities, although he could never find out whether it had been solely to satisfy a want of money which, thanks to himself, she no longer felt, or from some capricious instinct which might, at any moment, revive in her, he would lean, in impotent anguish, blinded and dizzy, over the bottomless abyss into which had passed, in which had been engulfed those years of his own, early in MacMahon's Septennat, in which one spent the winter on the Promenade des Anglais, the summer beneath the limes of Baden, and would find in those years a sad but splendid profundity, such as a poet might have lent to them; and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant details that made up the daily round on the C\u00f4te d'Azur in those days, if it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled him in the smile or in the eyes of Odette, more enthusiasm than does the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenth-century Florence, so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the Primavera, the fair Vanna or the Venus of Botticelli. He would sit, often, without saying a word to her, only gazing at her and dreaming; and she would comment: \"You do look sad!\" It was not very long since, from the idea that she was an excellent creature, comparable to the best women that he had known, he had passed to that of her being 'kept'; and yet already, by an inverse process, he had returned from the Odette de Cr\u00e9cy, perhaps too well known to the holiday-makers, to the 'ladies' men' of Nice and Baden, to this face, the expression on which was so often gentle, to this nature so eminently human. He would ask himself: \"What does it mean, after all, to say that everyone at Nice knows who Odette de Cr\u00e9cy is? Reputations of that sort, even when they're true, are always based upon other people's ideas\"; he would reflect that this legend\u2014even if it were authentic\u2014was something external to Odette, was not inherent in her like a mischievous and ineradicable personality; that the creature who might have been led astray was a woman with frank eyes, a heart full of pity for the sufferings of others, a docile body which he had pressed tightly in his arms and explored with his fingers, a woman of whom he might one day come into absolute possession if he succeeded in making himself indispensable to her. There she was, often tired, her face left blank for the nonce by that eager, feverish preoccupation with the unknown things which made Swann suffer; she would push back her hair with both hands; her forehead, her whole face would seem to grow larger; then, suddenly, some ordinary human thought, some worthy sentiment such as is to be found in all creatures when, in a moment of rest or meditation, they are free to express themselves, would flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold. And immediately the whole of her face would light up like a grey landscape, swathed in clouds which, suddenly, are swept away and the dull scene transfigured, at the moment of the sun's setting. The life which occupied Odette at such times, even the future which she seemed to be dreamily regarding, Swann could have shared with her. No evil disturbance seemed to have left any effect on them. Rare as they became, those moments did not occur in vain. By the process of memory, Swann joined the fragments together, abolished the intervals between them, cast, as in molten gold, the image of an Odette compact of kindness and tranquillity, for whom he was to make, later on (as we shall see in the second part of this story) sacrifices which the other Odette would never have won from him. But how rare those moments were, and how seldom he now saw her! Even in regard to their evening meetings, she would never tell him until the last minute whether she would be able to see him, for, reckoning on his being always free, she wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come to her. She would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which was of the very greatest importance, and if, even after she had made Swann come to her house, any of her friends asked her, half-way through the evening, to join them at some theatre, or at supper afterwards, she would jump for joy and dress herself with all speed. As her toilet progressed, every movement that she made brought Swann nearer to the moment when he would have to part from her, when she would fly off with irresistible force; and when at length she was ready, and, Plunging into her mirror a last glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look well, smeared a little salve on her lips, fixed a stray loci of hair over her brow, and called for her cloak of sky-blue silk with golden tassels, Swann would be looking so wretched that she would be unable to restrain a gesture of impatience as she flung at him: \"So that is how you thank me for keeping you here till the last minute! And I thought I was being so nice to you. Well, I shall know better another time!\" Sometime... at the risk of annoying her, he made up his mind that he would find out where she had gone, and even dreamed of a defensive alliance with Forcheville, who might perhaps have been able to tell him. But anyhow, when he knew with whom she was spending the evening, it was very seldom that he could not discover, among all his innumerable acquaintance, some one who knew\u2014if only indirectly\u2014the man with whom she had gone out, and could easily obtain this or that piece of information about him. And while he was writing to one of his friends, asking him to try to get a little light thrown upon some point or other, he would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex himself with questions to which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the strain of interrogation. It is true that Swann was little the wiser for such information as he did receive. To know a thing does not enable us, always, to prevent its happening, but after all the things that we know we do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our minds, where we can dispose of them as we choose, which gives us the illusion of a sort of power to control them. He was quite happy whenever M. de Charlus was with Odette. He knew that between M. de Charlus and her nothing untoward could ever happen, that when M. de Charlus went anywhere with her, it was out of friendship for himself, and that he would make no difficulty about telling him everything that she had done. Sometimes she had declared so emphatically to Swann that it was impossible for him to see her on a particular evening, she seemed to be looking forward so keenly to some outing, that Swann attached a very real importance to the fact that M. de Charlus was free to accompany her. Next day, without daring to put many questions to M. de Charlus, he would force him, by appearing not quite to understand his first answers, to give him more, after each of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved, for he very soon learned that Odette had spent her evening in the most innocent of dissipations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But what do you mean, my dear M\u00e9m\u00e9, I don't quite understand.... You didn't go straight from her house to the Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin? Surely you went somewhere else first? No? That is very odd! You don't know how amusing you are, my dear M\u00e9m\u00e9. But what an odd idea of hers to go on to the Chat Noir afterwards; it was her idea, I suppose? No? Yours? That's strange. After all, it wasn't a bad idea; she must have known dozens of people there? No? She never spoke to a soul? How extraordinary! Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves? I can picture you, sitting there! You are a worthy fellow, my dear M\u00e9m\u00e9; I'm exceedingly fond of you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was now quite at ease. To him, who had so often happened, when talking to friends who knew nothing of his love, friends to whom he hardly listened, to hear certain detached sentences (as, for instance, \"I saw Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy yesterday; she was with a man I didn't know.\"), sentences which dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid state, grew hard as stalagmites, and seared and tore him as they lay there irremovable,\u2014how charming, by way of contrast, were the words: \"She didn't know a soul; she never spoke to a soul.\" How freely they coursed through him, how fluid they were, how vaporous, how easy to breathe! And yet, a moment later, he was telling himself that Odette must find him very dull if those were the pleasures that she preferred to his company. And their very insignificance, though it reassured him, pained him as if her enjoyment of them had been an act of treachery\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even when he could not discover where she had gone, it would have sufficed to alleviate the anguish that he then felt, for which Odette's presence, the charm of her company, was the sole specific (a specific which in the long run served, like many other remedies, to aggravate the disease, but at least brought temporary relief to his sufferings), it would have sufficed, had Odette only permitted him to remain in her house while she was out, to wait there until that hour of her return, into whose stillness and peace would flow, to be mingled and lost there, all memory of those intervening hours which some sorcery, some cursed spell had made him imagine as, somehow, different from the rest. But she would not; he must return home; he forced himself, on the way, to form various plans, ceased to think of Odette; he even reached the stage, while he undressed, of turning over all sorts of happy ideas in his mind: it was with a light heart, buoyed with the anticipation of going to see some favourite work of art on the morrow, that he jumped into bed and turned out the light; but no sooner had he made himself ready to sleep, relaxing a self-control of which he was not even conscious, so habitual had it become, than an icy shudder convulsed his body and he burst into sobs. He did not wish to know why, but dried his eyes, saying with a smile: \"This is delightful; I'm becoming neurasthenic.\" After which he could not save himself from utter exhaustion at the thought that, next day, he must begin afresh his attempt to find out what Odette had been doing, must use all his influence to contrive to see her. This compulsion to an activity without respite, without variety, without result, was so cruel a scourge that one day, noticing a swelling over his stomach, he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had, perhaps, a tumour which would prove fatal, that he need not concern himself with anything further, that it was his malady which was going to govern his life, to make a plaything of him, until the not-distant end. If indeed, at this period, it often happened that, though without admitting it even to himself, he longed for death, it was in order to escape not so much from the keenness of his sufferings as from the monotony of his struggle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet he would have wished to live until the time came when he no longer loved her, when she would have no reason for lying to him, when at length he might learn from her whether, on the day when he had gone to see her in the afternoon, she had or had not been in the arms of Forcheville. Often for several days on end the suspicion that she was in love with some one else would distract his mind from the question of Forcheville, making it almost immaterial to him, like those new developments of a continuous state of ill-health which seem for a little time to have delivered us from their predecessors. There were even days when he was not tormented by any suspicion. He fancied that he was cured. But next morning, when he awoke, he felt in the same place the same pain, a sensation which, the day before, he had, as it were, diluted in the torrent of different impressions. But it had not stirred from its place. Indeed, it was the sharpness of this pain that had awakened him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important matters which took up so much of her time every day (albeit he had lived long enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything else than pleasures) he could not sustain for any length of time the effort to imagine them; his brain would become a void; then he would pass a finger over his tired eyelids, in the same way as he might have wiped his eyeglass, and would cease altogether to think. There emerged, however, from this unexplored tract, certain occupations which reappeared from time to time, vaguely connected by Odette with some obligation towards distant relatives or old friends who, inasmuch as they were the only people whom she was in the habit of mentioning as preventing her from seeing him, seemed to Swann to compose the necessary, unalterable setting of her life. Because of the tone in which she referred, from time to time, to \"the day when I go with my friend to the Hippodrome,\" if, when he felt unwell and had thought, \"Perhaps Odette would be kind and come to see me,\" he remembered, suddenly, that it was one of those very days, he would correct himself with an \"Oh, no! It's not worth while asking her to come; I should have thought of it before, this is the day when she goes with her friend to the Hippodrome. We must confine ourselves to what is possible; no use wasting our time in proposing things that can't be accepted and are declined in advance.\" And this duty that was incumbent upon Odette, of going to the Hippodrome, to which Swann thus gave way, seemed to him to be not merely ineluctable in itself; but the mark of necessity which stamped it seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even remotely connected with it. If, when Odette, in the street, had acknowledged the salute of a passer-by, which had aroused Swann's jealousy, she replied to his questions by associating the stranger with any of the two or three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to him; if, for instance, she said: \"That's a gentleman who was in my friend's box the other day; the one I go to the Hippodrome with,\" that explanation would set Swann's suspicions at rest; it was, after all, inevitable that this friend should have other guests than Odette in her box at the Hippodrome, but he had never sought to form or succeeded in forming any coherent impression of them. Oh! how he would have loved to know her, that friend who went to the Hippodrome, how he would have loved her to invite him there with Odette. How readily he would have sacrificed all his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of seeing Odette, were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop. He would have taken more trouble, incurred more expense for them than for queens. Would they not have supplied him, out of what was contained in their knowledge of the life of Odette, with the one potent anodyne for his pain? With what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with one or other of those humble folk with whom Odette kept up friendly relations, either with some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity of nature. How willingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the attics of some sordid but enviable house, where Odette went but never took him, and where, if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker, whose lover he would readily have pretended to be, he would have been visited by Odette almost daily. In those regions, that were almost slums, what a modest existence, abject, if you please, but delightful, nourished by tranquillity and happiness, he would have consented to lead indefinitely\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It sometimes happened, again, that, when, after meeting Swann, she saw some man approaching whom he did not know, he could distinguish upon Odette's face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he had come to her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for, on the days when, in spite of all that she had to do, and of her dread of what people would think, she did actually manage to see Swann, the predominant quality in her attitude, now, was self-assurance; a striking contrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge for, perhaps a natural reaction from the timorous emotion which, in the early days of their friendship, she had felt in his presence, and even in his absence, when she began a letter to him with the words: \"My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write.\" (So, at least, she pretended, and a little of that emotion must have been sincere, or she would not have been anxious to enlarge and emphasise it.) So Swann had been pleasing to her then. Our hands do not tremble except for ourselves, or for those whom we love. When they have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful, how easy, how bold do we become in their presence! In speaking to him, in writing to him now, she no longer employed those words by which she had sought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her, creating opportunities for saying \"my\" and \"mine\" when she referred to him: \"You are all that I have in the world; it is the perfume of our friendship, I shall keep it,\" nor spoke to him of the future, of death itself, as of a single adventure which they would have to share. In those early days, whatever he might say to her, she would answer admiringly: \"You know, you will never be like other people!\"\u2014she would gaze at his long, slightly bald head, of which people who know only of his successes used to think: \"He's not regularly good-looking, if you like, but he is smart; that tuft, that eyeglass, that smile!\" and, with more curiosity perhaps to know him as he really was than desire to become his mistress, she would sigh:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I do wish I could find out what there is in that head of yours!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, now, whatever he might say, she would answer, in a tone sometimes of irritation, sometimes indulgent: \"Ah! so you never will be like other people!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She would gaze at his head, which was hardly aged at all by his recent anxieties (though people now thought of it, by the same mental process which enables one to discover the meaning of a piece of symphonic music of which one has read the programme, or the 'likenesses' in a child whose family one has known: \"He's not positively ugly, if you like, but he is really rather absurd; that eyeglass, that tuft, that smile!\" realising in their imagination, fed by suggestion, the invisible boundary which divides, at a few months' interval, the head of an ardent lover from a cuckold's), and would say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I do wish I could change you; put some sense into that head of yours.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Always ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped, if it was only Odette's way of behaving to him that left room for doubt, he would fling himself greedily upon her words: \"You can if you like,\" he would tell her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he tried to explain to her that to comfort him, to control him, to make him work would be a noble task, to which numbers of other women asked for nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves, though it is only fair to add that in those other women's hands the noble task would have seemed to Swann nothing more than an indiscreet and intolerable usurpation of his freedom of action. \"If she didn't love me, just a little,\" he told himself, \"she would not wish to have me altered. To alter me, she will have to see me more often.\" And so he was able to trace, in these faults which she found in him, a proof at least of her interest, perhaps even of her love; and, in fact, she gave him so little, now, of the last, that he was obliged to regard as proofs of her interest in him the various things which, every now and then, she forbade him to do. One day she announced that she did not care for his coachman, who, she thought, was perhaps setting Swann against her, and, anyhow, did not shew that promptness and deference to Swann's orders which she would have liked to see. She felt that he wanted to hear her say: \"Don't have him again when you come to me,\" just as he might have wanted her to kiss him. So, being in a good temper, she said it; and he was deeply moved. That evening, when talking to M. de Charlus, with whom he had the satisfaction of being able to speak of her openly (for the most trivial remarks that he uttered now, even to people who had never heard of her, had always some sort of reference to Odette), he said to him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I believe, all the same, that she loves me; she is so nice to me now, and she certainly takes an interest in what I do.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if, when he was starting off for her house, getting into his carriage with a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way, his friend said: \"Hullo! that isn't Loredan on the box?\" with what melancholy joy would Swann answer him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! Good heavens, no! I can tell you, I daren't take Loredan when I go to the Rue La P\u00e9rouse; Odette doesn't like me to have Loredan, she thinks he doesn't suit me. What on earth is one to do? Women, you know, women. My dear fellow, she would be furious. Oh, lord, yes; I've only to take R\u00e9mi there; I should never hear the last of it!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These new manners, indifferent, listless, irritable, which Odette now adopted with Swann, undoubtedly made him suffer; but he did not realise how much he suffered; since it had been with a regular progression, day after day, that Odette had chilled towards him, it was only by directly contrasting what she was to-day with what she had been at first that he could have measured the extent of the change that had taken place. Now this change was his deep, his secret wound, which pained him day and night, and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it, he would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made to suffer too keenly. He might say to himself in a vague way: \"There was a time when Odette loved me more,\" but he never formed any definite picture of that time. Just as he had in his study a cupboard at which he contrived never to look, which he turned aside to avoid passing whenever he entered or left the room, because in one of its drawers he had locked away the chrysanthemum which she had given him on one of those first evenings when he had taken her home in his carriage, and the letters in which she said: \"Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back,\" and \"At whatever hour of the day or night you may need me, just send me a word, and dispose of me as you please,\" so there was a place in his heart to which he would never allow his thoughts to trespass too near, forcing them, if need be, to evade it by a long course of reasoning so that they should not have to pass within reach of it; the place in which lingered his memories of happy days\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone out to a party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was at the Marquise de Saint-Euverte's, on the last, for that season, of the evenings on which she invited people to listen to the musicians who would serve, later on, for her charity concerts. Swann, who had intended to go to each of the previous evenings in turn, but had never been able to make up his mind, received, while he was dressing for this party, a visit from the Baron de Charlus, who came with an offer to go with him to the Marquise's, if his company could be of any use in helping Swann not to feel quite so bored when he got there, to be a little less unhappy. But Swann had thanked him with:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You can't conceive how glad I should be of your company. But the greatest pleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead to see Odette. You know what a splendid influence you have over her. I don't suppose she'll be going anywhere this evening, unless she goes to see her old dressmaker, and I'm sure she would be delighted if you went with her there. In any case, you'll find her at home before then. Try to keep her amused, and also to give her a little sound advice. If you could arrange something for to-morrow which would please her, something that we could all three do together. Try to put out a feeler, too, for the summer; see if there's anything she wants to do, a cruise that we might all three take; anything you can think of. I don't count upon seeing her to-night, myself; still if she would like me to come, or if you find a loophole, you've only to send me a line at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's up till midnight; after that I shall be here. Ever so many thanks for all you are doing for me\u2014you know what I feel about you!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His friend promised to go and do as Swann wished as soon as he had deposited him at the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where he arrived soothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to everything that did not involve Odette, and in particular to the details of fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is to be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire, appears to us in its own guise. On alighting from his carriage, in the foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which hostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions, and in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and setting, Swann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of Balzac's 'tigers'\u2014now 'grooms'\u2014. who normally followed their mistress when she walked abroad, but now, hatted and booted, were posted out of doors, in front of the house on the gravelled drive, or outside the stables, as gardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of their several flower-beds. The peculiar tendency which he had always had to look for analogies between living people and the portraits in galleries reasserted itself here, but in a more positive and more general form; it was society as a whole, now that he was detached from it, which presented itself to him in a series of pictures. In the cloak-room, into which, in the old days, when he was still a man of fashion, he would have gone in his overcoat, to emerge from it in evening dress, but without any impression of what had occurred there, his mind having been, during the minute or two that he had spent in it, either still at the party which he had just left, or already at the party into which he was just about to be ushered, he now noticed, for the first time, roused by the unexpected arrival of so belated a guest, the scattered pack of splendid effortless animals, the enormous footmen who were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests, until, pointing their noble greyhound profiles, they towered upon their feet and gathered in a circle round about him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of them, of a particularly ferocious aspect, and not unlike the headsman in certain Renaissance pictures which represent executions, tortures, and the like, advanced upon him with an implacable air to take his 'things.' But the harshness of his steely glare was compensated by the softness of his cotton gloves, so effectively that, as he approached Swann, he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his person and the most tender regard for his hat. He took it with a care to which the precision of his movements imparted something that was almost over-fastidious, and with a delicacy that was rendered almost touching by the evidence of his splendid strength. Then he passed it to one of his satellites, a novice and timid, who was expressing the panic that overpowered him by casting furious glances in every direction, and displayed all the dumb agitation of a wild animal in the first hours of its captivity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few feet away, a strapping great lad in livery stood musing, motionless, statuesque, useless, like that purely decorative warrior whom one sees in the most tumultuous of Mantegna's paintings, lost in dreams, leaning upon his shield, while all around him are fighting and bloodshed and death; detached from the group of his companions who were thronging about Swann, he seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in the scene, which he followed vaguely with his cruel, greenish eyes, as if it had been the Massacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint James. He seemed precisely to have sprung from that vanished race\u2014if, indeed, it ever existed, save in the reredos of San Zeno and the frescoes of the Eremitani, where Swann had come in contact with it, and where it still dreams\u2014fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue by some one of the Master's Paduan models, or of Albert Duerer's Saxons. And the locks of his reddish hair, crinkled by nature, but glued to his head by brilliantine, were treated broadly as they are in that Greek sculpture which the Mantuan painter never ceased to study, and which, if in its creator's purpose it represents but man, manages at least to extract from man's simple outlines such a variety of richness, borrowed, as it were, from the whole of animated nature, that a head of hair, by the glossy undulation and beak-like points of its curls, or in the overlaying of the florid triple diadem of its brushed tresses, can suggest at once a bunch of seaweed, a brood of fledgling doves, a bed of hyacinths and a serpent's writhing back. Others again, no less colossal, were disposed upon the steps of a monumental staircase which, by their decorative presence and marmorean immobility, was made worthy to be named, like that god-crowned ascent in the Palace of the Doges, the 'Staircase of the Giants,' and on which Swann now set foot, saddened by the thought that Odette had never climbed it. Ah, with what joy would he, on the other hand, have raced up the dark, evil-smelling, breakneck flights to the little dressmaker's, in whose attic he would so gladly have paid the price of a weekly stage-box at the Opera for the right to spend the evening there when Odette came, and other days too, for the privilege of talking about her, of living among people whom she was in the habit of seeing when he was not there, and who, on that account, seemed to keep secret among themselves some part of the life of his mistress more real, more inaccessible and more mysterious than anything that he knew. Whereas upon that pestilential, enviable staircase to the old dressmaker's, since there was no other, no service stair in the building, one saw in the evening outside every door an empty, unwashed milk-can set out, in readiness for the morning round, upon the door-mat; on the despicable, enormous staircase which Swann was at that moment climbing, on either side of him, at different levels, before each anfractuosity made in its walls by the window of the porter's lodge or the entrance to a set of rooms, representing the departments of indoor service which they controlled, and doing homage for them to the guests, a gate-keeper, a major-domo, a steward (worthy men who spent the rest of the week in semi-independence in their own domains, dined there by themselves like small shopkeepers, and might to-morrow lapse to the plebeian service of some successful doctor or industrial magnate), scrupulous in carrying out to the letter all the instructions that had been heaped upon them before they were allowed to don the brilliant livery which they wore only at long intervals, and in which they did not feel altogether at their ease, stood each in the arcade of his doorway, their splendid pomp tempered by a democratic good-fellowship, like saints in their niches, and a gigantic usher, dressed Swiss Guard fashion, like the beadle in a church, struck the pavement with his staff as each fresh arrival passed him. Coming to the top of the staircase, up which he had been followed by a servant with a pallid countenance and a small pigtail clubbed at the back of his head, like one of Goya's sacristans or a tabellion in an old play, Swann passed by an office in which the lackeys, seated like notaries before their massive registers, rose solemnly to their feet and inscribed his name. He next crossed a little hall which\u2014just as certain rooms are arranged by their owners to serve as the setting for a single work of art (from which they take their name), and, in their studied bareness, contain nothing else besides\u2014displayed to him as he entered it, like some priceless effigy by Benvenuto Cellini of an armed watchman, a young footman, his body slightly bent forward, rearing above his crimson gorget an even more crimson face, from which seemed to burst forth torrents of fire, timidity and zeal, who, as he pierced the Aubusson tapestries that screened the door of the room in which the music was being given with his impetuous, vigilant, desperate gaze, appeared, with a soldierly impassibility or a supernatural faith\u2014an allegory of alarums, incarnation of alertness, commemoration of a riot\u2014to be looking out, angel or sentinel, from the tower of dungeon or cathedral, for the approach of the enemy or for the hour of Judgment. Swann had now only to enter the concert-room, the doors of which were thrown open to him by an usher loaded with chains, who bowed low before him as though tendering to him the keys of a conquered city. But he thought of the house in which at that very moment he might have been, if Odette had but permitted, and the remembered glimpse of an empty milk-can upon a door-mat wrung his heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male when, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of the servants gave place to that of the guests. But even this ugliness of faces, which of course were mostly familiar to him, seemed something new and uncanny, now that their features,\u2014instead of being to him symbols of practical utility in the identification of this or that man, who until then had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after, boredoms to be avoided, or courtesies to be acknowledged\u2014were at rest, measurable by aesthetic co-ordinates alone, in the autonomy of their curves and angles. And in these men, in the thick of whom Swann now found himself packed, there was nothing (even to the monocle which many of them wore, and which, previously, would, at the most, have enabled Swann to say that so-and-so wore a monocle) which, no longer restricted to the general connotation of a habit, the same in all of them, did not now strike him with a sense of individuality in each. Perhaps because he did not regard General de Froberville and the Marquis de Br\u00e9aute, who were talking together just inside the door, as anything more than two figures in a picture, whereas they were the old and useful friends who had put him up for the Jockey Club and had supported him in duels, the General's monocle, stuck like a shell-splinter in his common, scarred, victorious, overbearing face, in the middle of a forehead which it left half-blinded, like the single-eyed flashing front of the Cyclops, appeared to Swann as a monstrous wound which it might have been glorious to receive but which it was certainly not decent to expose, while that which M. de Br\u00e9aute wore, as a festive badge, with his pearl-grey gloves, his crush hat and white tie, substituting it for the familiar pair of glasses (as Swann himself did) when he went out to places, bore, glued to its other side, like a specimen prepared on a slide for the microscope, an infinitesimal gaze that swarmed with friendly feeling and never ceased to twinkle at the loftiness of ceilings, the delightfulness of parties, the interestingness of programmes and the excellence of refreshments\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hallo! you here! why, it's ages since I've seen you,\" the General greeted Swann and, noticing the look of strain on his face and concluding that it was perhaps a serious illness that had kept him away, went on, \"You're looking well, old man!\" while M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 turned with, \"My dear fellow, what on earth are you doing here?\" to a 'society novelist' who had just fitted into the angle of eyebrow and cheek his own monocle, the sole instrument that he used in his psychological investigations and remorseless analyses of character, and who now replied, with an air of mystery and importance, rolling the 'r':\u2014\"I am observing!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Marquis de Forestelle's monocle was minute and rimless, and, by enforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it was incrusted like a superfluous cartilage, the presence of which there was inexplicable and its substance unimaginable, it gave to his face a melancholy refinement, and led women to suppose him capable of suffering terribly when in love. But that of M. de Saint-Cand\u00e9, girdled, like Saturn, with an enormous ring, was the centre of gravity of a face which composed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass, while his thrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their grimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled in the polished disk, and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing eyes in the world by the smart, depraved young women whom it set dreaming of artificial charms and a refinement of sensual bliss; and then, behind him, M. de Palancy, who with his huge carp's head and goggling eyes moved slowly up and down the stream of festive gatherings, unlocking his great mandibles at every moment as though in search of his orientation, had the air of carrying about upon his person only an accidental and perhaps purely symbolical fragment of the glass wall of his aquarium, a part intended to suggest the whole which recalled to Swann, a fervent admirer of Giotto's Vices and Virtues at Padua, that Injustice by whose side a leafy bough evokes the idea of the forests that enshroud his secret lair\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann had gone forward into the room, under pressure from Mme. de Saint-Euverte and in order to listen to an aria from Orfeo which was being rendered on the flute, and had taken up a position in a corner from which, unfortunately, his horizon was bounded by two ladies of 'uncertain' age, seated side by side, the Marquise de Cambremer and the Vicomtesse de Franquetot, who, because they were cousins, used to spend their time at parties in wandering through the rooms, each clutching her bag and followed by her daughter, hunting for one another like people at a railway station, and could never be at rest until they had reserved, by marking them with their fans or handkerchiefs, two adjacent chairs; Mme. de Cambremer, since she knew scarcely anyone, being all the more glad of a companion, while Mme. de Franquetot, who, on the contrary, was extremely popular, thought it effective and original to shew all her fine friends that she preferred to their company that of an obscure country cousin with whom she had childish memories in common. Filled with ironical melancholy, Swann watched them as they listened to the pianoforte intermezzo (Liszt's 'Saint Francis preaching to the birds') which came after the flute, and followed the virtuoso in his dizzy flight; Mme. de Franquetot anxiously, her eyes starting from her head, as though the keys over which his fingers skipped with such agility were a series of trapezes, from any one of which he might come crashing, a hundred feet, to the ground, stealing now and then a glance of astonishment and unbelief at her companion, as who should say: \"It isn't possible, I would never have believed that a human being could do all that!\"; Mme. de Cambremer, as a woman who had received a sound musical education, beating time with her head\u2014transformed for the nonce into the pendulum of a metronome, the sweep and rapidity of whose movements from one shoulder to the other (performed with that look of wild abandonment in her eye which a sufferer shews who is no longer able to analyse his pain, nor anxious to master it, and says merely \"I can't help it\") so increased that at every moment her diamond earrings caught in the trimming of her bodice, and she was obliged to put straight the bunch of black grapes which she had in her hair, though without any interruption of her constantly accelerated motion. On the other side (and a little way in front) of Mme. de Franquetot, was the Marquise de Gallardon, absorbed in her favourite meditation, namely upon her own kinship with the Guermantes family, from which she derived both publicly and in private a good deal of glory not unmingled with shame, the most brilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her, perhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman, or because she was a scandalous old woman, or because she came of an inferior branch of the family, or very possibly for no reason at all. When she found herself seated next to some one whom she did not know, as she was at this moment next to Mme. de Franquetot, she suffered acutely from the feeling that her own consciousness of her Guermantes connection could not be made externally manifest in visible character like those which, in the mosaics in Byzantine churches, placed one beneath another, inscribe in a vertical column by the side of some Sacred Personage the words which he is supposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact that she had never received an invitation, or even call, from her young cousin the Princesse des Laumes, during the six years that had already elapsed since the latter's marriage. The thought filled her with anger\u2014and with pride; for, by virtue of having told everyone who expressed surprise at never seeing her at Mme. des Laumes's, that it was because of the risk of meeting the Princesse Mathilde there\u2014a degradation which her own family, the truest and bluest of Legitimists, would never have forgiven her, she had come gradually to believe that this actually was the reason for her not visiting her young cousin. She remembered, it is true, that she had several times inquired of Mme. des Laumes how they might contrive to meet, but she remembered it only in a confused way, and besides did more than neutralise this slightly humiliating reminiscence by murmuring, \"After all, it isn't for me to take the first step; I am at least twenty years older than she is.\" And fortified by these unspoken words she flung her shoulders proudly back until they seemed to part company with her bust, while her head, which lay almost horizontally upon them, made one think of the 'stuck-on' head of a pheasant which is brought to the table regally adorned with its feathers. Not that she in the least degree resembled a pheasant, having been endowed by nature with a short and squat and masculine figure; but successive mortifications had given her a backward tilt, such as one may observe in trees which have taken root on the very edge of a precipice and are forced to grow backwards to preserve their balance. Since she was obliged, in order to console herself for not being quite on a level with the rest of the Guermantes, to repeat to herself incessantly that it was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her principles and pride that she saw so little of them, the constant iteration had gradually remoulded her body, and had given her a sort of 'bearing' which was accepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding, and even kindled, at times, a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old gentlemen in clubs. Had anyone subjected Mme. de Gallardon's conversation to that form of analysis which by noting the relative frequency of its several terms would furnish him with the key to a ciphered message, he would at once have remarked that no expression, not even the commonest forms of speech, occurred in it nearly so often as \"at my cousins the Guermantes's,\" \"at my aunt Guermantes's,\" \"Elz\u00e9ar de Guermantes's health,\" \"my cousin Guermantes's box.\" If anyone spoke to her of a distinguished personage, she would reply that, although she was not personally acquainted with him, she had seen him hundreds of times at her aunt Guermantes's, but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone, with such a hollow sound, that it was at once quite clear that if she did not know the celebrity personally that was because of all the obstinate, ineradicable principles against which her arching shoulders were stretched back to rest, as on one of those ladders on which gymnastic instructors make us 'extend' so as to develop the expansion of our chests\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this moment the Princesse des Laumes, who had not been expected to appear at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that evening, did in fact arrive. To shew that she did not wish any special attention, in a house to which she had come by an act of condescension, to be paid to her superior rank, she had entered the room with her arms pressed close to her sides, even when there was no crowd to be squeezed through, no one attempting to get past her; staying purposely at the back, with the air of being in her proper place, like a king who stands in the waiting procession at the doors of a theatre where the management have not been warned of his coming; and strictly limiting her field of vision\u2014so as not to seem to be advertising her presence and claiming the consideration that was her due\u2014to the study of a pattern in the carpet or of her own skirt, she stood there on the spot which had struck her as the most modest (and from which, as she very well knew, a cry of rapture from Mme. de Saint-Euverte would extricate her as soon as her presence there was noticed), next to Mme. de Cambremer, whom, however, she did not know. She observed the dumb-show by which her neighbour was expressing her passion for music, but she refrained from copying it. This was not to say that, for once that she had consented to spend a few minutes in Mme. de Saint-Euverte's house, the Princesse des Laumes would not have wished (so that the act of politeness to her hostess which she had performed by coming might, so to speak, 'count double') to shew herself as friendly and obliging as possible. But she had a natural horror of what she called 'exaggerating,' and always made a point of letting people see that she 'simply must not' indulge in any display of emotion that was not in keeping with the tone of the circle in which she moved, although such displays never failed to make an impression upon her, by virtue of that spirit of imitation, akin to timidity, which is developed in the most self-confident persons, by contact with an unfamiliar environment, even though it be inferior to their own. She began to ask herself whether these gesticulations might not, perhaps, be a necessary concomitant of the piece of music that was being played, a piece which, it might be, was in a different category from all the music that she had ever heard before; and whether to abstain from them was not a sign of her own inability to understand the music, and of discourtesy towards the lady of the house; with the result that, in order to express by a compromise both of her contradictory inclinations in turn, at one moment she would merely straighten her shoulder-straps or feel in her golden hair for the little balls of coral or of pink enamel, frosted with tiny diamonds, which formed its simple but effective ornament, studying, with a cold interest, her impassioned neighbour, while at another she would beat time for a few bars with her fan, but, so as not to forfeit her independence, she would beat a different time from the pianist's. When he had finished the Liszt Intermezzo and had begun a Prelude by Chopin, Mme. de Cambremer turned to Mme. de Franquetot with a tender smile, full of intimate reminiscence, as well as of satisfaction (that of a competent judge) with the performance. She had been taught in her girlhood to fondle and cherish those long-necked, sinuous creatures, the phrases of Chopin, so free, so flexible, so tactile, which begin by seeking their ultimate resting-place somewhere beyond and far wide of the direction in which they started, the point which one might have expected them to reach, phrases which divert themselves in those fantastic bypaths only to return more deliberately\u2014with a more premeditated reaction, with more precision, as on a crystal bowl which, if you strike it, will ring and throb until you cry aloud in anguish\u2014to clutch at one's heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Brought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors, hardly ever invited to a ball, she had fuddled her mind, in the solitude of her old manor-house, over setting the pace, now crawling-slow, now passionate, whirling, breathless, for all those imaginary waltzing couples, gathering them like flowers, leaving the ball-room for a moment to listen, where the wind sighed among the pine-trees, on the shore of the lake, and seeing of a sudden advancing towards her, more different from anything one had ever dreamed of than earthly lovers are, a slender young man, whose voice was resonant and strange and false, in white gloves. But nowadays the old-fashioned beauty of this music seemed to have become a trifle stale. Having forfeited, some years back, the esteem of 'really musical' people, it had lost its distinction and its charm, and even those whose taste was frankly bad had ceased to find in it more than a moderate pleasure to which they hardly liked to confess. Mme. de Cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her. She knew that her young daughter-in-law (full of respect for her new and noble family, except in such matters as related to the intellect, upon which, having 'got as far' as Harmony and the Greek alphabet, she was specially enlightened) despised Chopin, and fell quite ill when she heard him played. But finding herself free from the scrutiny of this Wagnerian, who was sitting, at some distance, in a group of her own contemporaries, Mme. de Cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of exquisite memories and sensations. The Princesse des Laumes was touched also. Though without any natural gift for music, she had received, some fifteen years earlier, the instruction which a music-mistress of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who had been, towards the end of her life, reduced to penury, had started, at seventy, to give to the daughters and granddaughters of her old pupils. This lady was now dead. But her method, an echo of her charming touch, came to life now and then in the fingers of her pupils, even of those who had been in other respects quite mediocre, had given up music, and hardly ever opened a piano. And so Mme. des Laumes could let her head sway to and fro, fully aware of the cause, with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which the pianist was rendering this Prelude, since she knew it by heart. The closing notes of the phrase that he had begun sounded already on her lips. And she murmured \"How charming it is!\" with a stress on the opening consonants of the adjective, a token of her refinement by which she felt her lips so romantically compressed, like the petals of a beautiful, budding flower, that she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony, illuminating them for a moment with a vague and sentimental gaze. Meanwhile Mme. de Gallardon had arrived at the point of saying to herself how annoying it was that she had so few opportunities of meeting the Princesse des Laumes, for she meant to teach her a lesson by not acknowledging her bow. She did not know that her cousin was in the room. A movement of Mme. Franquetot's head disclosed the Princess. At once Mme. de Gallardon dashed towards her, upsetting all her neighbours; although determined to preserve a distant and glacial manner which should remind everyone present that she had no desire to remain on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself, any day, cheek by jowl with the Princesse Mathilde, and to whom it was not her duty to make advances since she was not 'of her generation,' she felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by some non-committal remark which would justify her overture and would force the Princess to engage in conversation; and so, when she reached her cousin, Mme. de Gallardon, with a stern countenance and one hand thrust out as though she were trying to 'force' a card, began with: \"How is your husband?\" in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the Prince had been seriously ill. The Princess, breaking into a laugh which was one of her characteristics, and was intended at once to shew the rest of an assembly that she was making fun of some one and also to enhance her own beauty by concentrating her features around her animated lips and sparkling eyes, answered: \"Why; he's never been better in his life!\" And she went on laughing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Gallardon then drew herself up and, chilling her expression still further, perhaps because she was still uneasy about the Prince's health, said to her cousin:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oriane,\" (at once Mme. des Laumes looked with amused astonishment towards an invisible third, whom she seemed to call to witness that she had never authorised Mme. de Gallardon to use her Christian name) \"I should be so pleased if you would look in, just for a minute, to-morrow evening, to hear a quintet, with the clarinet, by Mozart. I should like to have your opinion of it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She seemed not so much to be issuing an invitation as to be asking favour, and to want the Princess's opinion of the Mozart quintet just though it had been a dish invented by a new cook, whose talent it was most important that an epicure should come to judge\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I know that quintet quite well. I can tell you now\u2014that I adore it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, my husband isn't at all well; it's his liver. He would like so much to see you,\" Mme. de Gallardon resumed, making it now a corporal work of charity for the Princess to appear at her party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Princess never liked to tell people that she would not go to their houses. Every day she would write to express her regret at having been kept away\u2014by the sudden arrival of her husband's mother, by an invitation from his brother, by the Opera, by some excursion to the country\u2014from some party to which she had never for a moment dreamed of going. In this way she gave many people the satisfaction of feeling that she was on intimate terms with them, that she would gladly have come to their houses, and that she had been prevented from doing so only by some princely occurrence which they were flattered to find competing with their own humble entertainment. And then, as she belonged to that witty 'Guermantes set'\u2014in which there survived something of the alert mentality, stripped of all commonplace phrases and conventional sentiments, which dated from M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, and found its final expression in the plays of Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy\u2014she adapted its formula so as to suit even her social engagements, transposed it into the courtesy which was always struggling to be positive and precise, to approximate itself to the plain truth. She would never develop at any length to a hostess the expression of her anxiety to be present at her party; she found it more pleasant to disclose to her all the various little incidents on which it would depend whether it was or was not possible for her to come\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Listen, and I'll explain,\" she began to Mme. de Gallardon. \"To-morrow evening I must go to a friend of mine, who has been pestering me to fix a day for ages. If she takes us to the theatre afterwards, then I can't possibly come to you, much as I should love to; but if we just stay in the house, I know there won't be anyone else there, so I can slip away.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tell me, have you seen your friend M. Swann?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No! my precious Charles! I never knew he was here. Where is he? I must catch his eye.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's a funny thing that he should come to old Saint-Euverte's,\" Mme. de Gallardon went on. \"Oh, I know he's very clever,\" meaning by that 'very cunning,' \"but that makes no difference; fancy a Jew here, and she the sister and sister-in-law of two Archbishops.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am ashamed to confess that I am not in the least shocked,\" said the Princesse des Laumes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know he's a converted Jew, and all that, and his parents and grandparents before him. But they do say that the converted ones are worse about their religion than the practising ones, that it's all just a pretence; is that true, d'you think?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I can throw no light at all on the matter.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The pianist, who was 'down' to play two pieces by Chopin, after finishing the Prelude had at once attacked a Polonaise. But once Mme. de Gallardon had informed her cousin that Swann was in the room, Chopin himself might have risen from the grave and played all his works in turn without Mme. des Laumes's paying him the slightest attention. She belonged to that one of the two divisions of the human race in which the untiring curiosity which the other half feels about the people whom it does not know is replaced by an unfailing interest in the people whom it does. As with many women of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence, in any room in which she might find herself, of another member of her set, even although she had nothing in particular to say to him, would occupy her mind to the exclusion of every other consideration. From that moment, in the hope that Swann would catch sight of her, the Princess could do nothing but (like a tame white mouse when a lump of sugar is put down before its nose and then taken away) turn her face, in which were crowded a thousand signs of intimate connivance, none of them with the least relevance to the sentiment underlying Chopin's music, in the direction where Swann was, and, if he moved, divert accordingly the course of her magnetic smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oriane, don't be angry with me,\" resumed Mme. de Gallardon, who could never restrain herself from sacrificing her highest social ambitions, and the hope that she might one day emerge into a light that would dazzle the world, to the immediate and secret satisfaction of saying something disagreeable, \"people do say about your M. Swann that he's the sort of man one can't have in the house; is that true?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, you, of all people, ought to know that it's true,\" replied the Princesse des Laumes, \"for you must have asked him a hundred times, and he's never been to your house once.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And leaving her cousin mortified afresh, she broke out again into a laugh which scandalised everyone who was trying to listen to the music, but attracted the attention of Mme. de Saint-Euverte, who had stayed, out of politeness, near the piano, and caught sight of the Princess now for the first time. Mme. de Saint-Euverte was all the more delighted to see Mme. des Laumes, as she imagined her to be still at Guermantes, looking after her father-in-law, who was ill\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dear Princess, you here?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I tucked myself away in a corner, and I've been hearing such lovely things.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What, you've been in the room quite a time?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, yes, quite a long time, which seemed very short; it was only long because I couldn't see you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Saint-Euverte offered her own chair to the Princess, who declined it with:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, please, no! Why should you? It doesn't matter in the least where I sit.\" And deliberately picking out, so as the better to display the simplicity of a really great lady, a low seat without a back: \"There now, that hassock, that's all I want. It will make me keep my back straight. Oh! Good heavens, I'm making a noise again; they'll be telling you to have me 'chucked out'.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, the pianist having doubled his speed, the emotion of the music-lovers was reaching its climax, a servant was handing refreshments about on a salver, and was making the spoons rattle, and, as on every other 'party-night', Mme. de Saint-Euverte was making signs to him, which he never saw, to leave the room. A recent bride, who had been told that a young woman ought never to appear bored, was smiling vigorously, trying to catch her hostess's eye so as to flash a token of her gratitude for the other's having 'thought of her' in connection with so delightful an entertainment. And yet, although she remained more calm than Mme. de Franquetot, it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the flying fingers; what alarmed her being not the pianist's fate but the piano's, on which a lighted candle, jumping at each fortissimo, threatened, if not to set its shade on fire, at least to spill wax upon the ebony. At last she could contain herself no longer, and, running up the two steps of the platform on which the piano stood, flung herself on the candle to adjust its sconce. But scarcely had her hand come within reach of it when, on a final chord, the piece finished, and the pianist rose to his feet. Nevertheless the bold initiative shewn by this young woman and the moment of blushing confusion between her and the pianist which resulted from it, produced an impression that was favourable on the whole\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you see what that girl did just now, Princess?\" asked General de Froberville, who had come up to Mme. des Laumes as her hostess left her for a moment. \"Odd, wasn't it? Is she one of the performers?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, she's a little Mme. de Cambremer,\" replied the Princess carelessly, and then, with more animation: \"I am only repeating what I heard just now, myself; I haven't the faintest notion who said it, it was some one behind me who said that they were neighbours of Mme. de Saint-Euverte in the country, but I don't believe anyone knows them, really. They must be 'country cousins'! By the way, I don't know whether you're particularly 'well-up' in the brilliant society which we see before us, because I've no idea who all these astonishing people can be. What do you suppose they do with themselves when they're not at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's parties? She must have ordered them in with the musicians and the chairs and the food. 'Universal providers,' you know. You must admit, they're rather splendid, General. But can she really have the courage to hire the same 'supers' every week? It isn't possible!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but Cambremer is quite a good name; old, too,\" protested the General\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I see no objection to its being old,\" the Princess answered dryly, \"but whatever else it is it's not euphonious,\" she went on, isolating the word euphonious as though between inverted commas, a little affectation to which the Guermantes set were addicted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You think not, eh! She's a regular little peach, though,\" said the General, whose eyes never strayed from Mme. de Cambremer. \"Don't you agree with me, Princess?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She thrusts herself forward too much; I think, in so young a woman, that's not very nice\u2014for I don't suppose she's my generation,\" replied Mme. des Laumes (the last word being common, it appeared, to Gallardon and Guermantes). And then, seeing that M. de Froberville was still gazing at Mme. de Cambremer, she added, half out of malice towards the lady, half wishing to oblige the General: \"Not very nice... for her husband! I am sorry that I do not know her, since she seems to attract you so much; I might have introduced you to her,\" said the Princess, who, if she had known the young woman, would most probably have done nothing of the sort. \"And now I must say good night, because one of my friends is having a birthday party, and I must go and wish her many happy returns,\" she explained, modestly and with truth, reducing the fashionable gathering to which she was going to the simple proportions of a ceremony which would be boring in the extreme, but at which she was obliged to be present, and there would be something touching about her appearance. \"Besides, I must pick up Basin. While I've been here, he's gone to see those friends of his\u2014you know them too, I'm sure,\u2014who are called after a bridge\u2014oh, yes, the I\u00e9nas.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It was a battle before it was a bridge, Princess; it was a victory!\" said the General. \"I mean to say, to an old soldier like me,\" he went on, wiping his monocle and replacing it, as though he were laying a fresh dressing on the raw wound underneath, while the Princess instinctively looked away, \"that Empire nobility, well, of course, it's not the same thing, but, after all, taking it as it is, it's very fine of its kind; they were people who really did fight like heroes.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I have the deepest respect for heroes,\" the Princess assented, though with a faint trace of irony. \"If I don't go with Basin to see this Princesse d'I\u00e9na, it isn't for that, at all; it's simply because I don't know them. Basin knows them; he worships them. Oh, no, it's not what you think; he's not in love with her. I've nothing to set my face against! Besides, what good has it ever done when I have set my face against them?\" she queried sadly, for the whole world knew that, ever since the day upon which the Prince des Laumes had married his fascinating cousin, he had been consistently unfaithful to her. \"Anyhow, it isn't that at all. They're people he has known for ever so long, they do him very well, and that suits me down to the ground. But I must tell you what he's told me about their house; it's quite enough. Can you imagine it, all their furniture is 'Empire'!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, my dear Princess, that's only natural; it belonged to their grandparents.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't quite say it didn't, but that doesn't make it any less ugly. I quite understand that people can't always have nice things, but at least they needn't have things that are merely grotesque. What do you say? I can think of nothing more devastating, more utterly smug than that hideous style\u2014cabinets covered all over with swans' heads, like bath-taps!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I believe, all the same, that they've got some lovely things; why, they must have that famous mosaic table on which the Treaty of...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I don't deny, they may have things that are interesting enough from the historic point of view. But things like that can't, ever, be beautiful ... because they're simply horrible! I've got things like that myself, that came to Basin from the Montesquious. Only, they're up in the attics at Guermantes, where nobody ever sees them. But, after all, that's not the point, I would fly to see them, with Basin; I would even go to see them among all their sphinxes and brasses, if I knew them, but\u2014I don't know them! D'you know, I was always taught, when I was a little girl, that it was not polite to call on people one didn't know.\" She assumed a tone of childish gravity. \"And so I am just doing what I was taught to do. Can't you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house? Why, I might get a most hostile reception.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she coquettishly enhanced the charm of the smile which the idea had brought to her lips, by giving to her blue eyes, which were fixed on the General, a gentle, dreamy expression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dear Princess, you know that they'd be simply wild with joy.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, why?\" she inquired, with the utmost vivacity, either so as to seem unaware that it would be because she was one of the first ladies in France, or so as to have the pleasure of hearing the General tell her so. \"Why? How can you tell? Perhaps they would think it the most unpleasant thing that could possibly happen. I know nothing about them, but if they're anything like me, I find it quite boring enough to see the people I do know; I'm sure if I had to see people I didn't know as well, even if they had 'fought like heroes,' I should go stark mad. Besides, except when it's an old friend like you, whom one knows quite apart from that, I'm not sure that 'heroism' takes one very far in society. It's often quite boring enough to have to give a dinner-party, but if one had to offer one's arm to Spartacus, to let him take one down...! Really, no; it would never be Vercingetorix I should send for, to make a fourteenth. I feel sure, I should keep him for really big 'crushes.' And as I never give any...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah! Princess, it's easy to see you're not a Guermantes for nothing. You have your share of it, all right, the 'wit of the Guermantes'!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But people always talk about the wit of the Guermantes; I never could make out why. Do you really know any others who have it?\" she rallied him, with a rippling flow of laughter, her features concentrated, yoked to the service of her animation, her eyes sparkling, blazing with a radiant sunshine of gaiety which could be kindled only by such speeches\u2014even if the Princess had to make them herself\u2014as were in praise of h wit or of her beauty. \"Look, there's Swann talking to your Cambremer woman; over there, beside old Saint-Euverte, don't you see him? Ask him to introduce you. But hurry up, he seems to be just going!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you notice how dreadfully ill he's looking?\" asked the General\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My precious Charles? Ah, he's coming at last; I was beginning to think he didn't want to see me!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was extremely fond of the Princesse des Laumes, and the sight of her recalled to him Guermantes, a property close to Combray, and all that country which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit, so as not to be separated from Odette. Slipping into the manner, half-artistic, half-amorous\u2014with which he could always manage to amuse the Princess\u2014a manner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment into the old social atmosphere, and wishing also to express in words, for his own satisfaction, the longing that he felt for the country:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, or rather intoned, in such a way as to be audible at once to Mme. de Saint-Euverte, to whom he spoke, and to Mme. des Laumes, for whom he was speaking, \"Behold our charming Princess! See, she has come up on purpose from Guermantes to hear Saint Francis preach to the birds, and has only just had time, like a dear little tit-mouse, to go and pick a few little hips and haws and put them in her hair; there are even some drops of dew upon them still, a little of the hoar-frost which must be making the Duchess, down there, shiver. It is very pretty indeed, my dear Princess.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What! The Princess came up on purpose from Guermantes? But that's too wonderful! I never knew; I'm quite bewildered,\" Mme. de Saint-Euverte protested with quaint simplicity, being but little accustomed to Swann's way of speaking. And then, examining the Princess's headdress, \"Why, you're quite right; it is copied from... what shall I say, not chestnuts, no,\u2014oh, it's a delightful idea, but how can the Princess have known what was going to be on my programme? The musicians didn't tell me, even.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann, who was accustomed, when he was with a woman whom he had kept up the habit of addressing in terms of gallantry, to pay her delicate compliments which most other people would not and need not understand, did not condescend to explain to Mme. de Saint-Euverte that he had been speaking metaphorically. As for the Princess, she was in fits of laughter, both because Swann's wit was highly appreciated by her set, and because she could never hear a compliment addressed to herself without finding it exquisitely subtle and irresistibly amusing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Indeed! I'm delighted, Charles, if my little hips and haws meet with your approval. But tell me, why did you bow to that Cambremer person, are you also her neighbour in the country?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Saint-Euverte, seeing that the Princess seemed quite happy talking to Swann, had drifted away\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But you are, yourself, Princess!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I! Why, they must have 'countries' everywhere, those creatures! Don't I wish I had!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, not the Cambremers; her own people. She was a Legrandin, and used to come to Combray. I don't know whether you are aware that you are Comtesse de Combray, and that the Chapter owes you a due.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't know what the Chapter owes me, but I do know that I'm 'touched' for a hundred francs, every year, by the Cur\u00e9, which is a due that I could very well do without. But surely these Cambremers have rather a startling name. It ends just in time, but it ends badly!\" she said with a laugh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It begins no better.\" Swann took the point\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes; that double abbreviation!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Some one very angry and very proper who didn't dare to finish the first word.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But since he couldn't stop himself beginning the second, he'd have done better to finish the first and be done with it. We are indulging in the most refined form of humour, my dear Charles, in the very best of taste\u2014but how tiresome it is that I never see you now,\" she went on in a coaxing tone, \"I do so love talking to you. Just imagine, I could not make that idiot Froberville see that there was anything funny about the name Cambremer. Do agree that life is a dreadful business. It's only when I see you that I stop feeling bored.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which was probably not true. But Swann and the Princess had the same way of looking at the little things of life\u2014the effect, if not the cause of which was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of pronunciation. This similarity was not striking because no two things could have been more unlike than their voices. But if one took the trouble to imagine Swann's utterances divested of the sonority that enwrapped them, of the moustache from under which they emerged, one found that they were the same phrases, the same inflexions, that they had the 'tone' of the Guermantes set. On important matters, Swann and the Princess had not an idea in common. But since Swann had become so melancholy, and was always in that trembling condition which precedes a flood of tears, he had the same need to speak about his grief that a murderer has to tell some one about his crime. And when he heard the Princess say that life was a dreadful business, he felt as much comforted as if she had spoken to him of Odette\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, life is a dreadful business! We must meet more often, my dear friend. What is so nice about you is that you are not cheerful. We could spend a most pleasant evening together.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sure we could; why not come down to Guermantes? My mother-in-law would be wild with joy. It's supposed to be very ugly down there, but I must say, I find the neighborhood not at all unattractive; I have a horror of 'picturesque spots'.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know it well, it's delightful!\" replied Swann. \"It's almost too beautiful, too much alive for me just at present; it's a country to be happy in. It's perhaps because I have lived there, but things there speak to me so. As soon as a breath of wind gets up, and the cornfields begin to stir, I feel that some one is going to appear suddenly, that I am going to hear some news; and those little houses by the water's edge... I should be quite wretched!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! my dearest Charles, do take care; there's that appalling Rampillon woman; she's seen me; hide me somewhere, do tell me again, quickly, what it was that happened to her; I get so mixed up; she's just married off her daughter, or her lover (I never can remember),\u2014perhaps both\u2014to each other! Oh, no, I remember now, she's been dropped by her Prince... Pretend to be talking, so that the poor old Berenice sha'n't come and invite me to dinner. Anyhow, I'm going. Listen, my dearest Charles, now that I have seen you, once in a blue moon, won't you let me carry you off and take you to the Princesse de Parme's, who would be so pleased to see you (you know), and Basin too, for that matter; he's meeting me there. If one didn't get news of you, sometimes, from M\u00e9m\u00e9... Remember, I never see you at all now!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann declined. Having told M. de Charlus that, on leaving Mme. de Saint-Euverte's, he would go straight home, he did not care to run the risk, by going on now to the Princesse de Parme's, of missing a message which he had, all the time, been hoping to see brought in to him by one of the footmen, during the party, and which he was perhaps going to find left with his own porter, at home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Poor Swann,\" said Mme. des Laumes that night to her husband; \"he is always charming, but he does look so dreadfully unhappy. You will see for yourself, for he has promised to dine with us one of these days. I do feel that it's really absurd that a man of his intelligence should let himself be made to suffer by a creature of that kind, who isn't even interesting, for they tell me, she's an absolute idiot!\" she concluded with the wisdom invariably shewn by people who, not being in love themselves, feel that a clever man ought to be unhappy only about such persons as are worth his while; which is rather like being astonished that anyone should condescend to die of cholera at the bidding of so insignificant a creature as the common bacillus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann now wished to go home, but, just as he was making his escape, General de Froberville caught him and asked for an introduction to Mme. de Cambremer, and he was obliged to go back into the room to look for her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I say, Swann, I'd rather be married to that little woman than killed by savages, what do you say?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The words 'killed by savages' pierced Swann's aching heart; and at once he felt the need of continuing the conversation. \"Ah!\" he began, \"some fine lives have been lost in that way... There was, you remember, that explorer whose remains Dumont d'Urville brought back, La P\u00e9rouse...\" (and he was at once happy again, as though he had named Odette). \"He was a fine character, and interests me very much, does La P\u00e9rouse,\" he ended sadly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, yes, of course, La P\u00e9rouse,\" said the General. \"It's quite a well-known name. There's a street called that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you know anyone in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse?\" asked Swann excitedly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Only Mme. de Chanlivault, the sister of that good fellow Chaussepierre. She gave a most amusing theatre-party the other evening. That's a house that will be really smart some day, you'll see!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, so she lives in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse. It's attractive; I like that street; it's so sombre.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Indeed it isn't. You can't have been in it for a long time; it's not at all sombre now; they're beginning to build all round there.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Swann did finally introduce M. de Froberville to the young Mme. de Cambremer, since it was the first time that she had heard the General's name, she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise with which she would have greeted him if she had never, in the whole of her life, heard anything else; for, as she did not yet know all the friends of her new family, whenever anyone was presented to her, she assumed that he must be one of them, and thinking that she would shew her tact by appearing to have heard 'such a lot about him' since her marriage, she would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which was meant as a proof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to overcome and of the spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame it. And so her parents-in-law, whom she still regarded as the most eminent pair in France, declared that she was an angel; all the more that they preferred to appear, in marrying her to their son, to have yielded to the attraction rather of her natural charm than of her considerable fortune\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's easy to see that you're a musician heart and soul, Madame,\" said the General, alluding to the incident of the candle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the concert had begun again, and Swann saw that he could not now go before the end of the new number. He suffered greatly from being shut up among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded him all the more cruelly since, being ignorant of his love, incapable, had they known of it, of taking any interest, or of doing more than smile at it as at some childish joke, or deplore it as an act of insanity, they made it appear to him in the aspect of a subjective state which existed for himself alone, whose reality there was nothing external to confirm; he suffered overwhelmingly, to the point at which even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry, from having to prolong his exile in this place to which Odette would never come, in which no one, nothing was aware of her existence, from which she was entirely absent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition tore him with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart. What had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes, on which it rested as though expecting something, an expectancy which it prolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes, in the exaltation with which it already saw the expected object approaching, and with a desperate effort to continue until its arrival, to welcome it before itself expired, to keep the way open for a moment longer, with all its remaining strength, that the stranger might enter in, as one holds a door open that would otherwise automatically close. And before Swann had had time to understand what was happening, to think: \"It is the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. I mustn't listen!\", all his memories of the days when Odette had been in love with him, which he had succeeded, up till that evening, in keeping invisible in the depths of his being, deceived by this sudden reflection of a season of love, whose sun, they supposed, had dawned again, had awakened from their slumber, had taken wing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears, without pity for his present desolation, the forgotten strains of happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In place of the abstract expressions \"the time when I was happy,\" \"the time when I was loved,\" which he had often used until then, and without much suffering, for his intelligence had not embodied in them anything of the past save fictitious extracts which preserved none of the reality, he now recovered everything that had fixed unalterably the peculiar, volatile essence of that lost happiness; he could see it all; the snowy, curled petals of the chrysanthemum which she had tossed after him into his carriage, which he had kept pressed to his lips, the address 'Maison Dor\u00e9e,' embossed on the note-paper on which he had read \"My hand trembles so as I write to you,\" the frowning contraction of her eyebrows when she said pleadingly: \"You won't let it be very long before you send for me?\"; he could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he used to have in to singe his hair while Loredan went to fetch the little working girl; could feel the torrents of rain which fell so often that spring, the ice-cold homeward drive in his victoria, by moonlight; all the network of mental habits, of seasonable impressions, of sensory reactions, which had extended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes, by which his body now found itself inextricably held. At that time he had been satisfying a sensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures of those people who lived for love alone. He had supposed that he could stop there, that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows also; how small a thing the actual charm of Odette was now in comparison with that formidable terror which extended it like a cloudy halo all around her, that enormous anguish of not knowing at every hour of the day and night what she had been doing, of not possessing her wholly, at all times and in all places! Alas, he recalled the accents in which she had exclaimed: \"But I can see you at any time; I am always free!\"\u2014she, who was never free now; the interest, the curiosity that she had shewn in his life, her passionate desire that he should do her the favour\u2014of which it was he who, then, had felt suspicious, as of a possibly tedious waste of his time and disturbance of his arrangements\u2014of granting her access to his study; how she had been obliged to beg that he would let her take him to the Verdurins'; and, when he did allow her to come to him once a month, how she had first, before he would let himself be swayed, had to repeat what a joy it would be to her, that custom of their seeing each other daily, for which she had longed at a time when to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction, for which, since that time, she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken herself of it, while it had become for him so insatiable, so dolorous a need. Little had he suspected how truly he spoke when, on their third meeting, as she repeated: \"But why don't you let me come to you oftener?\" he had told her, laughing, and in a vein of gallantry, that it was for fear of forming a hopeless passion. Now, alas, it still happened at times that she wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel, on paper which bore a printed address, but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart. \"Written from the H\u00f4tel Vouillemont. What on earth can she have gone there for? With whom? What happened there?\" He remembered the gas-jets that were being extinguished along the Boulevard des Italiens when he had met her, when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that night which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now (that night of a period when he had not even to ask himself whether he would be annoying her by looking for her and by finding her, so certain was he that she knew no greater happiness than to see him and to let him take her home) belonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may return again once its doors are closed. And Swann could distinguish, standing, motionless, before that scene of happiness in which it lived again, a wretched figure which filled him with such pity, because he did not at first recognise who it was, that he must lower his head, lest anyone should observe that his eyes were filled with tears. It was himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he had realised this, his pity ceased; he was jealous, now, of that other self whom she had loved, he was jealous of those men of whom he had so often said, without much suffering: \"Perhaps she's in love with them,\" now that he had exchanged the vague idea of loving, in which there is no love, for the petals of the chrysanthemum and the 'letter-heading' of the Maison d'Or; for they were full of love. And then, his anguish becoming too keen, he passed his hand over his forehead, let the monocle drop from his eye, and wiped its glass. And doubtless, if he had caught sight of himself at that moment, he would have added to the collection of the monocles which he had already identified, this one which he removed, like an importunate, worrying thought, from his head, while from its misty surface, with his handkerchief, he sought to obliterate his cares\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are in the music of the violin\u2014if one does not see the instrument itself, and so cannot relate what one hears to its form, which modifies the fullness of the sound\u2014accents which are so closely akin to those of certain contralto voices, that one has the illusion that a singer has taken her place amid the orchestra. One raises one's eyes; one sees only the wooden case, magical as a Chinese box; but, at moments, one is still tricked by the deceiving appeal of the Siren; at times, too, one believes that one is listening to a captive spirit, struggling in the darkness of its masterful box, a box quivering with enchantment, like a devil immersed in a stoup of holy water; sometimes, again, it is in the air, at large, like a pure and supernatural creature that reveals to the ear, as it passes, its invisible message\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As though the musicians were not nearly so much playing the little phrase as performing the rites on which it insisted before it would consent to appear, as proceeding to utter the incantations necessary to procure, and to prolong for a few moments, the miracle of its apparition, Swann, who was no more able now to see it than if it had belonged to a world of ultra-violet light, who experienced something like the refreshing sense of a metamorphosis in the momentary blindness with which he had been struck as he approached it, Swann felt that it was present, like a protective goddess, a confidant of his love, who, so as to be able to come to him through the crowd, and to draw him aside to speak to him, had disguised herself in this sweeping cloak of sound. And as she passed him, light, soothing, as softly murmured as the perfume of a flower, telling him what she had to say, every word of which he closely scanned, sorry to see them fly away so fast, he made involuntarily with his lips the motion of kissing, as it went by him, the harmonious, fleeting form\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she, who addressed herself to him, spoke to him in a whisper of Odette. For he had no longer, as of old, the impression that Odette and he were not known to the little phrase. Had it not often been the witness of their joys? True that, as often, it had warned him of their frailty. And indeed, whereas, in that distant time, he had divined an element of suffering in its smile, in its limpid and disillusioned intonation, to-night he found there rather the charm of a resignation that was almost gay. Of those sorrows, of which the little phrase had spoken to him then, which he had seen it\u2014without his being touched by them himself\u2014carry past him, smiling, on its sinuous and rapid course, of those sorrows which were now become his own, without his having any hope of being, ever, delivered from them, it seemed to say to him, as once it had said of his happiness: \"What does all that matter; it is all nothing.\" And Swann's thoughts were borne for the first time on a wave of pity and tenderness towards that Vinteuil, towards that unknown, exalted brother who also must have suffered so greatly; what could his life have been? From the depths of what well of sorrow could he have drawn that god-like strength, that unlimited power of creation?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When it was the little phrase that spoke to him of the vanity of his sufferings, Swann found a sweetness in that very wisdom which, but a little while back, had seemed to him intolerable when he thought that he could read it on the faces of indifferent strangers, who would regard his love as a digression that was without importance. 'Twas because the little phrase, unlike them, whatever opinion it might hold on the short duration of these states of the soul, saw in them something not, as everyone else saw, less serious than the events of everyday life, but, on the contrary, so far superior to everyday life as to be alone worthy of the trouble of expressing it. Those graces of an intimate sorrow, 'twas them that the phrase endeavoured to imitate, to create anew; and even their essence, for all that it consists in being incommunicable and in appearing trivial to everyone save him who has experience of them, the little phrase had captured, had rendered visible. So much so that it made their value be confessed, their divine sweetness be tasted by all those same onlookers\u2014provided only that they were in any sense musical\u2014who, the next moment, would ignore, would disown them in real life, in every individual love that came into being beneath their eyes. Doubtless the form in which it had codified those graces could not be analysed into any logical elements. But ever since, more than a year before, discovering to him many of the riches of his own soul, the love of music had been born, and for a time at least had dwelt in him, Swann had regarded musical motifs as actual ideas, of another world, of another order, ideas veiled in shadows, unknown, impenetrable by the human mind, which none the less were perfectly distinct one from another, unequal among themselves in value and in significance. When, after that first evening at the Verdurins', he had had the little phrase played over to him again, and had sought to disentangle from his confused impressions how it was that, like a perfume or a caress, it swept over and enveloped him, he had observed that it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes which composed it and to the constant repetition of two of them that was due that impression of a frigid, a contracted sweetness; but in reality he knew that he was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but merely upon certain equivalents, substituted (for his mind's convenience) for the mysterious entity of which he had become aware, before ever he knew the Verdurins, at that earlier party, when for the first time he had heard the sonata played. He knew that his memory of the piano falsified still further the perspective in which he saw the music, that the field open to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes, but an immeasurable keyboard (still, almost all of it, unknown), on which, here and there only, separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored tracts, some few among the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of passion, of courage, of serenity, which compose it, each one differing from all the rest as one universe differs from another, have been discovered by certain great artists who do us the service, when they awaken in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which they have found, of shewing us what richness, what variety lies hidden, unknown to us, in that great black impenetrable night, discouraging exploration, of our soul, which we have been content to regard as valueless and waste and void. Vinteuil had been one of those musicians. In his little phrase, albeit it presented to the mind's eye a clouded surface, there was contained, one felt, a matter so consistent, so explicit, to which the phrase gave so new, so original a force, that those who had once heard it preserved the memory of it in the treasure-chamber of their minds. Swann would repair to it as to a conception of love and happiness, of which at once he knew as well in what respects it was peculiar as he would know of the Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves, or of Ren\u00e9, should either of those titles occur to him. Even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it existed, latent, in his mind, in the same way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent, such as our notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of bodily desire, the rich possessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified and adorned. Perhaps we shall lose them, perhaps they will be obliterated, if we return to nothing in the dust. But so long as we are alive, we can no more bring ourselves to a state in which we shall not have known them than we can with regard to any material object, than we can, for example, doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted, in view of the changed aspect of everything in the room, from which has vanished even the memory of the darkness. In that way Vinteuil's phrase, like some theme, say, in Tristan, which represents to us also a certain acquisition of sentiment, has espoused our mortal state, had endued a vesture of humanity that was affecting enough. Its destiny was linked, for the future, with that of the human soul, of which it was one of the special, the most distinctive ornaments. Perhaps it is not-being that is the true state, and all our dream of life is without existence; but, if so, we feel that it must be that these phrases of music, these conceptions which exist in relation to our dream, are nothing either. We shall perish, but we have for our hostages these divine captives who shall follow and share our fate. And death in their company is something less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps even less certain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So Swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata did, really, exist. Human as it was from this point of view, it belonged, none the less, to an order of supernatural creatures whom we have never seen, but whom, in spite of that, we recognise and acclaim with rapture when some explorer of the unseen contrives to coax one forth, to bring it down from that divine world to which he has access to shine for a brief moment in the firmament of ours. This was what Vinteuil had done for the little phrase. Swann felt that the composer had been content (with the musical instruments at his disposal) to draw aside its veil, to make it visible, following and respecting its outlines with a hand so loving, so prudent, so delicate and so sure, that the sound altered at every moment, blunting itself to indicate a shadow, springing back into life when it must follow the curve of some more bold projection. And one proof that Swann was not mistaken when he believed in the real existence of this phrase, was that anyone with an ear at all delicate for music would at once have detected the imposture had Vinteuil, endowed with less power to see and to render its forms, sought to dissemble (by adding a line, here and there, of his own invention) the dimness of his vision or the feebleness of his hand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The phrase had disappeared. Swann knew that it would come again at the end of the last movement, after a long passage which Mme. Verdurin's pianist always 'skipped.' There were in this passage some admirable ideas which Swann had not distinguished on first hearing the sonata, and which he now perceived, as if they had, in the cloakroom of his memory, divested themselves of their uniform disguise of novelty. Swann listened to all the scattered themes which entered into the composition of the phrase, as its premises enter into the inevitable conclusion of a syllogism; he was assisting at the mystery of its birth. \"Audacity,\" he exclaimed to himself, \"as inspired, perhaps, as a Lavoisier's or an Ampere's, the audacity of a Vinteuil making experiment, discovering the secret laws that govern an unknown force, driving across a region unexplored towards the one possible goal the invisible team in which he has placed his trust and which he never may discern!\" How charming the dialogue which Swann now heard between piano and violin, at the beginning of the last passage. The suppression of human speech, so far from letting fancy reign there uncontrolled (as one might have thought), had eliminated it altogether. Never was spoken language of such inflexible necessity, never had it known questions so pertinent, such obvious replies. At first the piano complained alone, like a bird deserted by its mate; the violin heard and answered it, as from a neighbouring tree. It was as at the first beginning of the world, as if there were not yet but these twain upon the earth, or rather in this world closed against all the rest, so fashioned by the logic of its creator that in it there should never be any but themselves; the world of this sonata. Was it a bird, was it the soul, not yet made perfect, of the little phrase, was it a fairy, invisibly somewhere lamenting, whose plaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated? Its cries were so sudden that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch them as they came. Marvellous bird! The violinist seemed to wish to charm, to tame, to woo, to win it. Already it had passed into his soul, already the little phrase which it evoked shook like a medium's the body of the violinist, 'possessed' indeed. Swann knew that the phrase was going to speak to him once again. And his personality was now so divided that the strain of waiting for the imminent moment when he would find himself face to face, once more, with the phrase, convulsed him in one of those sobs which a fine line of poetry or a piece of alarming news will wring from us, not when we are alone, but when we repeat one or the other to a friend, in whom we see ourselves reflected, like a third person, whose probable emotion softens him. It reappeared, but this time to remain poised in the air, and to sport there for a moment only, as though immobile, and shortly to expire. And so Swann lost nothing of the precious time for which it lingered. It was still there, like an iridescent bubble that floats for a while unbroken. As a rainbow, when its brightness fades, seems to subside, then soars again and, before it is extinguished, is glorified with greater splendour than it has ever shewn; so to the two colours which the phrase had hitherto allowed to appear it added others now, chords shot with every hue in the prism, and made them sing. Swann dared not move, and would have liked to compel all the other people in the room to remain still also, as if the slightest movement might embarrass the magic presence, supernatural, delicious, frail, that would so easily vanish. But no one, as it happened, dreamed of speaking. The ineffable utterance of one solitary man, absent, perhaps dead (Swann did not know whether Vinteuil were still alive), breathed out above the rites of those two hierophants, sufficed to arrest the attention of three hundred minds, and made of that stage on which a soul was thus called into being one of the noblest altars on which a supernatural ceremony could be performed. It followed that, when the phrase at last was finished, and only its fragmentary echoes floated among the subsequent themes which had already taken its place, if Swann at first was annoyed to see the Comtesse de Monteriender, famed for her imbecilities, lean over towards him to confide in him her impressions, before even the sonata had come to an end; he could not refrain from smiling, and perhaps also found an underlying sense, which she was incapable of perceiving, in the words that she used. Dazzled by the virtuosity of the performers, the Comtesse exclaimed to Swann: \"It's astonishing! I have never seen anything to beat it...\" But a scrupulous regard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion, she added the reservation: \"anything to beat it... since the table-turning!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From that evening, Swann understood that the feeling which Odette had once had for him would never revive, that his hopes of happiness would not be realised now. And the days on which, by a lucky chance, she had once more shewn herself kind and loving to him, or if she had paid him any attention, he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of a slight movement on her part towards him with the same tender and sceptical solicitude, the desperate joy that people reveal who, when they are nursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady, relate, as significant facts of infinite value: \"Yesterday he went through his accounts himself, and actually corrected a mistake that we had made in adding them up; he ate an egg to-day and seemed quite to enjoy it, if he digests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet to-morrow,\"\u2014although they themselves know that these things are meaningless on the eve of an inevitable death. No doubt Swann was assured that if he had now been living at a distance from Odette he would gradually have lost all interest in her, so that he would have been glad to learn that she was leaving Paris for ever; he would have had the courage to remain there; but he had not the courage to go\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had often thought of going. Now that he was once again at work upon his essay on Vermeer, he wanted to return, for a few days at least, to The Hague, to Dresden, to Brunswick. He was certain that a 'Toilet of Diana' which had been acquired by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt sale as a Nicholas Maes was in reality a Vermeer. And he would have liked to be able to examine the picture on the spot, so as to strengthen his conviction. But to leave Paris while Odette was there, and even when she was not there\u2014for in strange places where our sensations have not been numbed by habit, we refresh, we revive an old pain\u2014was for him so cruel a project that he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it incessantly in his mind only because he knew himself to be resolute in his determination never to put it into effect. But it would happen that, while he was asleep, the intention to travel would reawaken in him (without his remembering that this particular tour was impossible) and would be realised. One night he dreamed that he was going away for a year; leaning from the window of the train towards a young man on the platform who wept as he bade him farewell, he was seeking to persuade this young man to come away also. The train began to move; he awoke in alarm, and remembered that he was not going away, that he would see Odette that evening, and next day and almost every day. And then, being still deeply moved by his dream, he would thank heaven for those special circumstances which made him independent, thanks to which he could remain in Odette's vicinity, and could even succeed in making her allow him to see her sometimes; and, counting over the list of his advantages: his social position\u2014his fortune, from which she stood too often in need of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture (having even, so people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her)\u2014his friendship with M. de Charlus, which, it must be confessed, had never won him any very great favour from Odette, but which gave him the pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things said about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an esteem\u2014and even his own intelligence, the whole of which he employed in weaving, every day, a fresh plot which would make his presence, if not agreeable, at any rate necessary to Odette\u2014he thought of what might have happened to him if all these advantages had been lacking, he thought that, if he had been, like so many other men, poor and humble, without resources, forced to undertake any task that might be offered to him, or tied down by parents or by a wife, he might have been obliged to part from Odette, that that dream, the terror of which was still so recent, might well have been true; and he said to himself: \"People don't know when they are happy. They're never so unhappy as they think they are.\" But he reflected that this existence had lasted already for several years, that all that he could now hope for was that it should last for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his friends, in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a meeting which, when it occurred, would bring him no happiness; and he asked himself whether he was not mistaken, whether the circumstances that had favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had not done a disservice to his career, whether the outcome to be desired was not that as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in dreams\u2014his own departure; and he said to himself that people did not know when they were unhappy, that they were never so happy as they supposed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes he hoped that she would die, painlessly, in some accident, she who was out of doors in the streets, crossing busy thoroughfares, from morning to night. And as she always returned safe and sound, he marvelled at the strength, at the suppleness of the human body, which was able continually to hold in check, to outwit all the perils that environed it (which to Swann seemed innumerable, since his own secret desire had strewn them in her path), and so allowed its occupant, the soul, to abandon itself, day after day, and almost with impunity, to its career of mendacity, to the pursuit of pleasure. And Swann felt a very cordial sympathy with that Mahomet II whose portrait by Bellini he admired, who, on finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives, stabbed her, in order, as his Venetian biographer artlessly relates, to recover his spiritual freedom. Then he would be ashamed of thinking thus only of himself, and his own sufferings would seem to deserve no pity now that he himself was disposing so cheaply of Odette's very life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent return, if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations his grief would ultimately have been assuaged, and his love would, perhaps, have died. And from the moment when she did not wish to leave Paris for ever he had hoped that she would never go. As he knew that her one prolonged absence, every year, was in August and September, he had abundant opportunity, several months in advance, to dissociate from it the grim picture of her absence throughout Eternity which was lodged in him by anticipation, and which, consisting of days closely akin to the days through which he was then passing, floated in a cold transparency in his mind, which it saddened and depressed, though without causing him any intolerable pain. But that conception of the future, that flowing stream, colourless and unconfined, a single word from Odette sufficed to penetrate through all Swann's defences, and like a block of ice immobilised it, congealed its fluidity, made it freeze altogether; and Swann felt himself suddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass which pressed on the inner walls of his consciousness until he was fain to burst asunder; for Odette had said casually, watching him with a malicious smile: \"Forcheville is going for a fine trip at Whitsuntide. He's going to Egypt!\" and Swann had at once understood that this meant: \"I am going to Egypt at Whitsuntide with Forcheville.\" And, in fact, if, a few days later, Swann began: \"About that trip that you told me you were going to take with Forcheville,\" she would answer carelessly: \"Yes, my dear boy, we're starting on the 19th; we'll send you a 'view' of the Pyramids.\" Then he was determined to know whether she was Forcheville's mistress, to ask her point-blank, to insist upon her telling him. He knew that there were some perjuries which, being so superstitious, she would not commit, and besides, the fear, which had hitherto restrained his curiosity, of making Odette angry if he questioned her, of making himself odious, had ceased to exist now that he had lost all hope of ever being loved by her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day he received an anonymous letter which told him that Odette had been the mistress of countless men (several of whom it named, among them Forcheville, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 and the painter) and women, and that she frequented houses of ill-fame. He was tormented by the discovery that there was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of sending him such a letter (for certain details betrayed in the writer a familiarity with his private life). He wondered who it could be. But he had never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other people, those which had no visible connection with what they said. And when he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent character of M. de Charlus, or of M. des Laumes, or of M. d'Orsan that he must place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might have had its birth; as none of these men had ever, in conversation with Swann, suggested that he approved of anonymous letters, and as everything that they had ever said to him implied that they strongly disapproved, he saw no further reason for associating this infamy with the character of any one of them more than with the rest. M. de Charlus was somewhat inclined to eccentricity, but he was fundamentally good and kind; M. des Laumes was a trifle dry, but wholesome and straight. As for M. d'Orsan, Swann had never met anyone who, even in the most depressing circumstances, would come to him with a more heartfelt utterance, would act more properly or with more discretion. So much so that he was unable to understand the rather indelicate part commonly attributed to M. d'Orsan in his relations with a certain wealthy woman, and that whenever he thought of him he was obliged to set that evil reputation on one side, as irreconcilable with so many unmistakable proofs of his genuine sincerity and refinement. For a moment Swann felt that his mind was becoming clouded, and he thought of something else so as to recover a little light; until he had the courage to return to those other reflections. But then, after not having been able to suspect anyone, he was forced to suspect everyone that he knew. After all, M. de Charlus might be most fond of him, might be most good-natured; but he was a neuropath; to-morrow, perhaps, he would burst into tears on hearing that Swann was ill; and to-day, from jealousy, or in anger, or carried away by some sudden idea, he might have wished to do him a deliberate injury. Really, that kind of man was the worst of all. The Prince des Laumes was, certainly, far less devoted to Swann than was M. de Charlus. But for that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with regard to him; and besides, his was a nature which, though, no doubt, it was cold, was as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action. Swann regretted that he had formed no attachments in his life except to such people. Then he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their neighbours is fellow-feeling, that he could not, in the last resort, answer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own, as was, so far as the heart went, that of M. de Charlus. The mere thought of causing Swann so much distress would have been revolting to him. But with a man who was insensible, of another order of humanity, as was the Prince des Laumes, how was one to foresee the actions to which he might be led by the promptings of a different nature? To have a good heart was everything, and M. de Charlus had one. But M. d'Orsan was not lacking in that either, and his relations with Swann\u2014cordial, but scarcely intimate, arising from the pleasure which, as they held the same views about everything, they found in talking together\u2014were more quiescent than the enthusiastic affection of M. de Charlus, who was apt to be led into passionate activity, good or evil. If there was anyone by whom Swann felt that he had always been understood, and (with delicacy) loved, it was M. d'Orsan. Yes, but the life he led; it could hardly be called honourable. Swann regretted that he had never taken any notice of those rumours, that he himself had admitted, jestingly, that he had never felt so keen a sense of sympathy, or of respect, as when he was in thoroughly 'detrimental' society. \"It is not for nothing,\" he now assured himself, \"that when people pass judgment upon their neighbour, their finding is based upon his actions. It is those alone that are significant, and not at all what we say or what we think. Charlus and des Laumes may have this or that fault, but they are men of honour. Orsan, perhaps, has not the same faults, but he is not a man of honour. He may have acted dishonourably once again.\" Then he suspected R\u00e9mi, who, it was true, could only have inspired the letter, but he now felt himself, for a moment, to be on the right track. To begin with, Loredan had his own reasons for wishing harm to Odette. And then, how were we not to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to our own, adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and vices for which they at once envied and despised us, should not find themselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own class? He also suspected my grandfather. On every occasion when Swann had asked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined? Besides, with his ideas of middle-class respectability, he might have thought that he was acting for Swann's good. He suspected, in turn, Bergotte, the painter, the Verdurins; paused for a moment to admire once again the wisdom of people in society, who refused to mix in the artistic circles in which such things were possible, were, perhaps, even openly avowed, as excellent jokes; but then he recalled the marks of honesty that were to be observed in those Bohemians, and contrasted them with the life of expedients, often bordering on fraudulence, to which the want of money, the craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of their pleasures often drove members of the aristocracy. In a word, this anonymous letter proved that he himself knew a human being capable of the most infamous conduct, but he could see no reason why that infamy should lurk in the depths\u2014which no strange eye might explore\u2014of the warm heart rather than the cold, the artist's rather than the business-man's, the noble's rather than the flunkey's. What criterion ought one to adopt, in order to judge one's fellows? After all, there was not a single one of the people whom he knew who might not, in certain circumstances, prove capable of a shameful action. Must he then cease to see them all? His mind grew clouded; he passed his hands two or three times across his brow, wiped his glasses with his handkerchief, and remembering that, after all, men who were as good as himself frequented the society of M. de Charlus, the Prince des Laumes and the rest, he persuaded himself that this meant, if not that they were incapable of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity in human life, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of people who were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. And he continued to shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely formal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to drive him to despair. As for the actual contents of the letter, they did not disturb him; for in not one of the charges which it formulated against Odette could he see the least vestige of fact. Like many other men, Swann had a naturally lazy mind, and was slow in invention. He knew quite well as a general truth, that human life is full of contrasts, but in the case of any one human being he imagined all that part of his or her life with which he was not familiar as being identical with the part with which he was. He imagined what was kept secret from him in the light of what was revealed. At such times as he spent with Odette, if their conversation turned upon an indelicate act committed, or an indelicate sentiment expressed by some third person, she would ruthlessly condemn the culprit by virtue of the same moral principles which Swann had always heard expressed by his own parents, and to which he himself had remained loyal; and then, she would arrange her flowers, would sip her tea, would shew an interest in his work. So Swann extended those habits to fill the rest of her life, he reconstructed those actions when he wished to form a picture of the moments in which he and she were apart. If anyone had portrayed her to him as she was, or rather as she had been for so long with himself, but had substituted some other man, he would have been distressed, for such a portrait would have struck him as lifelike. But to suppose that she went to bad houses, that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women, that she led the crapulous existence of the most abject, the most contemptible of mortals\u2014would be an insane wandering of the mind, for the realisation of which, thank heaven, the chrysanthemums that he could imagine, the daily cups of tea, the virtuous indignation left neither time nor place. Only, now and again, he gave Odette to understand that people maliciously kept him informed of everything that she did; and making opportune use of some detail\u2014insignificant but true\u2014which he had accidentally learned, as though it were the sole fragment which he would allow, in spite of himself, to pass his lips, out of the numberless other fragments of that complete reconstruction of her daily life which he carried secretly in his mind, he led her to suppose that he was perfectly informed upon matters, which, in reality, he neither knew nor suspected, for if he often adjured Odette never to swerve from or make alteration of the truth, that was only, whether he realised it or no, in order that Odette should tell him everything that she did. No doubt, as he used to assure Odette, he loved sincerity, but only as he might love a pander who could keep him in touch with the daily life of his mistress. Moreover, his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had not improved his character. The truth which he cherished was that which Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order to extract that truth from her, was not afraid to have recourse to falsehood, that very falsehood which he never ceased to depict to Odette as leading every human creature down to utter degradation. In a word, he lied as much as did Odette, because, while more unhappy than she, he was no less egotistical. And she, when she heard him repeating thus to her the things that she had done, would stare at him with a look of distrust and, at all hazards, of indignation, so as not to appear to be humiliated, and to be blushing for her actions. One day, after the longest period of calm through which he had yet been able to exist without being overtaken by an attack of jealousy, he had accepted an invitation to spend the evening at the theatre with the Princesse des Laumes. Having opened his newspaper to find out what was being played, the sight of the title\u2014Les Filles de Marbre, by Th\u00e9odore Barri\u00e8re,\u2014struck him so cruel a blow that he recoiled instinctively from it and turned his head away. Illuminated, as though by a row of footlights, in the new surroundings in which it now appeared, that word 'marble,' which he had lost the power to distinguish, so often had it passed, in print, beneath his eyes, had suddenly become visible once again, and had at once brought back to his mind the story which Odette had told him, long ago, of a visit which she had paid to the Salon at the Palais d'Industrie with Mme. Verdurin, who had said to her, \"Take care, now! I know how to melt you, all right. You're not made of marble.\" Odette had assured him that it was only a joke, and he had not attached any importance to it at the time. But he had had more confidence in her then than he had now. And the anonymous letter referred explicitly to relations of that sort. Without daring to lift his eyes to the newspaper, he opened it, turned the page so as not to see again the words, Filles de Marbre, and began to read mechanically the news from the provinces. There had been a storm in the Channel, and damage was reported from Dieppe, Cabourg, Beuzeval.... Suddenly he recoiled again in horror\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The name of Beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the same district, Beuzeville, which carried also, bound to it by a hyphen, a second name, to wit Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, which he had often seen on maps, but without ever previously remarking that it was the same name as that borne by his friend M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, whom the anonymous letter accused of having been Odette's lover. After all, when it came to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, there was nothing improbable in the charge; but so far as Mme. Verdurin was concerned, it was a sheer impossibility. From the fact that Odette did occasionally tell a lie, it was not fair to conclude that she never, by any chance, told the truth, and in these bantering conversations with Mme. Verdurin which she herself had repeated to Swann, he could recognize those meaningless and dangerous pleasantries which, in their inexperience of life and ignorance of vice, women often utter (thereby certifying their own innocence), who\u2014as, for instance, Odette,\u2014would be the last people in the world to feel any undue affection for one another. Whereas, on the other hand, the indignation with which she had scattered the suspicions which she had unintentionally brought into being, for a moment, in his mind by her story, fitted in with everything that he knew of the tastes, the temperament of his mistress. But at that moment, by an inspiration of jealousy, analogous to the inspiration which reveals to a poet or a philosopher, who has nothing, so far, but an odd pair of rhymes or a detached observation, the idea or the natural law which will give power, mastery to his work, Swann recalled for the first time a remark which Odette had made to him, at least two years before: \"Oh, Mme. Verdurin, she won't hear of anything just now but me. I'm a 'love,' if you please, and she kisses me, and wants me to go with her everywhere, and call her by her Christian name.\" So far from seeing in these expressions any connection with the absurd insinuations, intended to create an atmosphere of vice, which Odette had since repeated to him, he had welcomed them as a proof of Mme. Verdurin's warm-hearted and generous friendship. But now this old memory of her affection for Odette had coalesced suddenly with his more recent memory of her unseemly conversation. He could no longer separate them in his mind, and he saw them blended in reality, the affection imparting a certain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which, in return, spoiled the affection of its innocence. He went to see Odette. He sat down, keeping at a distance from her. He did not dare to embrace her, not knowing whether in her, in himself, it would be affection or anger that a kiss would provoke. He sat there silent, watching their love expire. Suddenly he made up his mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Odette, my darling,\" he began, \"I know, I am being simply odious, but I must ask you a few questions. You remember what I once thought about you and Mme. Verdurin? Tell me, was it true? Have you, with her or anyone else, ever?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She shook her head, pursing her lips together; a sign which people commonly employ to signify that they are not going, because it would bore them to go, when some one has asked, \"Are you coming to watch the procession go by?\", or \"Will you be at the review?\". But this shake of the head, which is thus commonly used to decline participation in an event that has yet to come, imparts for that reason an element of uncertainty to the denial of participation in an event that is past. Furthermore, it suggests reasons of personal convenience, rather than any definite repudiation, any moral impossibility. When he saw Odette thus make him a sign that the insinuation was false, he realised that it was quite possibly true\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I have told you, I never did; you know quite well,\" she added, seeming angry and uncomfortable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I know all that; but are you quite sure? Don't say to me, 'You know quite well'; say, 'I have never done anything of that sort with any woman.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote, and as though she hoped, thereby, to be rid of him: \"I have never done anything of that sort with any woman.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Can you swear it to me on your Laghetto medal?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann knew that Odette would never perjure herself on that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, you do make me so miserable,\" she cried, with a jerk of her body as though to shake herself free of the constraint of his question. \"Have you nearly done? What is the matter with you to-day? You seem to have made up your mind that I am to be forced to hate you, to curse you! Look, I was anxious to be friends with you again, for us to have a nice time together, like the old days; and this is all the thanks I get!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, he would not let her go, but sat there like a surgeon who waits for a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but need not make him abandon it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You are quite wrong in supposing that I bear you the least ill-will in the world, Odette,\" he began with a persuasive and deceitful gentleness. \"I never speak to you except of what I already know, and I always know a great deal more than I say. But you alone can mollify by your confession what makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by other people. My anger with you is never due to your actions\u2014I can and do forgive you everything because I love you\u2014but to your untruthfulness, the ridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in denying things which I know to be true. How can you expect that I shall continue to love you, when I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know to be false? Odette, do not prolong this moment which is torturing us both. If you are willing to end it at once, you shall be free of it for ever. Tell me, upon your medal, yes or no, whether you have ever done those things.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How on earth can I tell?\" she was furious. \"Perhaps I have, ever so long ago, when I didn't know what I was doing, perhaps two or three times.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann had prepared himself for all possibilities. Reality must, therefore, be something which bears no relation to possibilities, any more than the stab of a knife in one's body bears to the gradual movement of the clouds overhead, since those words \"two or three times\" carved, as it were, a cross upon the living tissues of his heart. A strange thing, indeed, that those words, \"two or three times,\" nothing more than a few words, words uttered in the air, at a distance, could so lacerate a man's heart, as if they had actually pierced it, could sicken a man, like a poison that he had drunk. Instinctively Swann thought of the remark that he had heard at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's: \"I have never seen anything to beat it since the table-turning.\" The agony that he now suffered in no way resembled what he had supposed. Not only because, in the hours when he most entirely mistrusted her, he had rarely imagined such a culmination of evil, but because, even when he did imagine that offence, it remained vague, uncertain, was not clothed in the particular horror which had escaped with the words \"perhaps two or three times,\" was not armed with that specific cruelty, as different from anything that he had known as a new malady by which one is attacked for the first time. And yet this Odette, from whom all this evil sprang, was no less dear to him, was, on the contrary, more precious, as if, in proportion as his sufferings increased, there increased at the same time the price of the sedative, of the antidote which this woman alone possessed. He wished to pay her more attention, as one attends to a disease which one discovers, suddenly, to have grown more serious. He wished that the horrible thing which, she had told him, she had done \"two or three times\" might be prevented from occurring again. To ensure that, he must watch over Odette. People often say that, by pointing out to a man the faults of his mistress, you succeed only in strengthening his attachment to her, because he does not believe you; yet how much more so if he does! But, Swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect her? He might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any one woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how insane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins') to desire the possession\u2014as if that were ever possible\u2014of another person. Happily for Swann, beneath the mass of suffering which had invaded his soul like a conquering horde of barbarians, there lay a natural foundation, older, more placid, and silently laborious, like the cells of an injured organ which at once set to work to repair the damaged tissues, or the muscles of a paralysed limb which tend to recover their former movements. These older, these autochthonous in-dwellers in his soul absorbed all Swann's strength, for a while, in that obscure task of reparation which gives one an illusory sense of repose during convalescence, or after an operation. This time it was not so much\u2014as it ordinarily was\u2014in Swann's brain that the slackening of tension due to exhaustion took effect, it was rather in his heart. But all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur, and, like a dying animal that is once more stirred by the throes of a convulsion which was, apparently, ended, upon Swann's heart, spared for a moment only, the same agony returned of its own accord to trace the same cross again. He remembered those moonlit evenings, when, leaning back in the victoria that was taking him to the Rue La P\u00e9rouse, he would cultivate with voluptuous enjoyment the emotions of a man in love, ignorant of the poisoned fruit that such emotions must inevitably bear. But all those thoughts lasted for no more than a second, the time that it took him to raise his hand to his heart, to draw breath again and to contrive to smile, so as to dissemble his torment. Already he had begun to put further questions. For his jealousy, which had taken an amount of trouble, such as no enemy would have incurred, to strike him this mortal blow, to make him forcibly acquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known, his jealousy was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough, and sought to expose his bosom to an even deeper wound. Like an evil deity, his jealousy was inspiring Swann, was thrusting him on towards destruction. It was not his fault, but Odette's alone, if at first his punishment was not more severe\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My darling,\" he began again, \"it's all over now; was it with anyone I know?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, I swear it wasn't; besides, I think I exaggerated, I never really went as far as that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He smiled, and resumed with: \"Just as you like. It doesn't really matter, but it's unfortunate that you can't give me any name. If I were able to form an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking of her again. I say it for your own sake, because then I shouldn't bother you any more about it. It's so soothing to be able to form a clear picture of things in one's mind. What is really terrible is what one cannot imagine. But you've been so sweet to me; I don't want to tire you. I do thank you, with all my heart, for all the good that you have done me. I've quite finished now. Only one word more: how many times?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, Charles! can't you see, you're killing me? It's all ever so long ago. I've never given it a thought. Anyone would say that you were positively trying to put those ideas into my head again. And then you'd be a lot better off!\" she concluded, with unconscious stupidity but with intentional malice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I only wished to know whether it had been since I knew you. It's only natural. Did it happen here, ever? You can't give me any particular evening, so that I can remind myself what I was doing at the time? You understand, surely, that it's not possible that you don't remember with whom, Odette, my love.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I don't know; really, I don't. I think it was in the Bois, one evening when you came to meet us on the Island. You had been dining with the Princesse des Laumes,\" she added, happy to be able to furnish him with an exact detail, which testified to her veracity. \"At the next table there was a woman whom I hadn't seen for ever so long. She said to me, 'Come along round behind the rock, there, and look at the moonlight on the water!' At first I just yawned, and said, 'No, I'm too tired, and I'm quite happy where I am, thank you.' She swore there'd never been anything like it in the way of moonlight. 'I've heard that tale before,' I said to her; you see, I knew quite well what she was after.\" Odette narrated this episode almost as if it were a joke, either because it appeared to her to be quite natural, or because she thought that she was thereby minimising its importance, or else so as not to appear ashamed. But, catching sight of Swann's face, she changed her tone, and:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You are a fiend!\" she flung at him, \"you enjoy tormenting me, making me tell you lies, just so that you'll leave me in peace.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This second blow struck at Swann was even more excruciating than the first. Never had he supposed it to have been so recent an affair, hidden from his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it, not in a past which he had never known, but in evenings which he so well remembered, which he had lived through with Odette, of which he had supposed himself to have such an intimate, such an exhaustive knowledge, and which now assumed, retrospectively, an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty. In the midst of them parted, suddenly, a gaping chasm, that moment on the Island in the Bois de Boulogne. Without being intelligent, Odette had the charm of being natural. She had recounted, she had acted the little scene with so much simplicity that Swann, as he gasped for breath, could vividly see it: Odette yawning, the \"rock there,\"... He could hear her answer\u2014alas, how lightheartedly\u2014\"I've heard that tale before!\" He felt that she would tell him nothing more that evening, that no further revelation was to be expected for the present. He was silent for a time, then said to her:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My poor darling, you must forgive me; I know, I am hurting you dreadfully, but it's all over now; I shall never think of it again.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she saw that his eyes remained fixed upon the things that he did not know, and on that past era of their love, monotonous and soothing in his memory because it was vague, and now rent, as with a sword-wound, by the news of that minute on the Island in the Bois, by moonlight, while he was dining with the Princesse des Laumes. But he had so far acquired the habit of finding life interesting\u2014of marvelling at the strange discoveries that there were to be made in it\u2014that even while he was suffering so acutely that he did not believe it possible to endure such agony for any length of time, he was saying to himself: \"Life is indeed astonishing, and holds some fine surprises; it appears that vice is far more common than one has been led to believe. Here is a woman in whom I had absolute confidence, who looks so simple, so honest, who, in any case, even allowing that her morals are not strict, seemed quite normal and healthy in her tastes and inclinations. I receive a most improbable accusation, I question her, and the little that she admits reveals far more than I could ever have suspected.\" But he could not confine himself to these detached observations. He sought to form an exact estimate of the importance of what she had just told him, so as to know whether he might conclude that she had done these things often, and was likely to do them again. He repeated her words to himself: \"I knew quite well what she was after.\" \"Two or three times.\" \"I've heard that tale before.\" But they did not reappear in his memory unarmed; each of them held a knife with which it stabbed him afresh. For a long time, like a sick man who cannot restrain himself from attempting, every minute, to make the movement that, he knows, will hurt him, he kept on murmuring to himself: \"I'm quite happy where I am, thank you,\" \"I've heard that tale before,\" but the pain was so intense that he was obliged to stop. He was amazed to find that actions which he had always, hitherto, judged so lightly, had dismissed, indeed, with a laugh, should have become as serious to him as a disease which might easily prove fatal. He knew any number of women whom he could ask to keep an eye on Odette, but how was he to expect them to adjust themselves to his new point of view, and not to remain at that which for so long had been his own, which had always guided him in his voluptuous existence; not to say to him with a smile: \"You jealous monster, wanting to rob other people of their pleasure!\" By what trap-door, suddenly lowered, had he (who had never found, in the old days, in his love for Odette, any but the most refined of pleasures) been precipitated into this new circle of hell from which he could not see how he was ever to escape. Poor Odette! He wished her no harm. She was but half to blame. Had he not been told that it was her own mother who had sold her, when she was still little more than a child, at Nice, to a wealthy Englishman? But what an agonising truth was now contained for him in those lines of Alfred de Vigny's Journal d'un Po\u00e8te which he had previously read without emotion: \"When one feels oneself smitten by love for a woman, one ought to say to oneself, 'What are 'her surroundings? What has been her life?' All one's future happiness lies in the answer.\" Swann was astonished that such simple phrases, spelt over in his mind as, \"I've heard that tale before,\" or \"I knew quite well what she was after,\" could cause him so much pain. But he realised that what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed parts of the panoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that he had felt while Odette was telling her story. For it was the same anguish that he now was feeling afresh. It was no good, his knowing now,\u2014indeed, it was no good, as time went on, his having partly forgotten and altogether forgiven the offence\u2014whenever he repeated her words his old anguish refashioned him as he had been before Odette began to speak: ignorant, trustful; his merciless jealousy placed him once again, so that he might be effectively wounded by Odette's admission, in the position of a man who does not yet know the truth; and after several months this old story would still dumbfounder him, like a sudden revelation. He marvelled at the terrible recreative power of his memory. It was only by the weakening of that generative force, whose fecundity diminishes as age creeps over one, that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments. But, as soon as the power that any one of Odette's sentences had to make Swann suffer seemed to be nearly exhausted, lo and behold another, one of those to which he had hitherto paid least attention, almost a new sentence, came to relieve the first, and to strike at him with undiminished force. The memory of the evening on which he had dined with the Princesse des Laumes was painful to him, but it was no more than the centre, the core of his pain. That radiated vaguely round about it, overflowing into all the preceding and following days. And on whatever point in it he might intend his memory to rest, it was the whole of that season, during which the Verdurins had so often gone to dine upon the Island in the Bois, that sprang back to hurt him. So violently, that by slow degrees the curiosity which his jealousy was ever exciting in him was neutralised by his fear of the fresh tortures which he would be inflicting upon himself were he to satisfy it. He recognised that all the period of Odette's life which had elapsed before she first met him, a period of which he had never sought to form any picture in his mind, was not the featureless abstraction which he could vaguely see, but had consisted of so many definite, dated years, each crowded with concrete incidents. But were he to learn more of them, he feared lest her past, now colourless, fluid and supportable, might assume a tangible, an obscene form, with individual and diabolical features. And he continued to refrain from seeking a conception of it, not any longer now from laziness of mind, but from fear of suffering. He hoped that, some day, he might be able to hear the Island in the Bois, or the Princesse des Laumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old rending pain; meanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke Odette into furnishing him with fresh sentences, with the names of more places and people and of different events, which, when his malady was still scarcely healed, would make it break out again in another form\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, often enough, the things that he did not know, that he dreaded, now, to learn, it was Odette herself who, spontaneously and without thought of what she did, revealed them to him; for the gap which her vices made between her actual life and the comparatively innocent life which Swann had believed, and often still believed his mistress to lead, was far wider than she knew. A vicious person, always affecting the same air of virtue before people whom he is anxious to keep from having any suspicion of his vices, has no register, no gauge at hand from which he may ascertain how far those vices (their continuous growth being imperceptible by himself) have gradually segregated him from the normal ways of life. In the course of their cohabitation, in Odette's mind, with the memory of those of her actions which she concealed from Swann, her other, her innocuous actions were gradually coloured, infected by these, without her being able to detect anything strange in them, without their causing any explosion in the particular region of herself in which she made them live, but when she related them to Swann, he was overwhelmed by the revelation of the duplicity to which they pointed. One day, he was trying\u2014without hurting Odette\u2014to discover from her whether she had ever had any dealings with procuresses. He was, as a matter of fact, convinced that she had not; the anonymous letter had put the idea into his mind, but in a purely mechanical way; it had been received there with no credulity, but it had, for all that, remained there, and Swann, wishing to be rid of the burden\u2014a dead weight, but none the less disturbing\u2014of this suspicion, hoped that Odette would now extirpate it for ever\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh dear, no! Not that they don't simply persecute me to go to them,\" her smile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it was impossible should appear legitimate to Swann. \"There was one of them waited more than two hours for me yesterday, said she would give me any money I asked. It seems, there's an Ambassador who said to her, 'I'll kill myself if you don't bring her to me'\u2014meaning me! They told her I'd gone out, but she waited and waited, and in the end I had to go myself and speak to her, before she'd go away. I do wish you could have seen the way I tackled her; my maid was in the next room, listening, and told me I shouted fit to bring the house down:\u2014'But when you hear me say that I don't want to! The idea of such a thing, I don't like it at all! I should hope I'm still free to do as I please and when I please and where I please! If I needed the money, I could understand...' The porter has orders not to let her in again; he will tell her that I am out of town. Oh, I do wish I could have had you hidden somewhere in the room while I was talking to her. I know, you'd have been pleased, my dear. There's some good in your little Odette, you see, after all, though people do say such dreadful things about her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides, her very admissions\u2014when she made any\u2014of faults which she supposed him to have discovered, rather served Swann as a starting-point for fresh doubts than they put an end to the old. For her admissions never exactly coincided with his doubts. In vain might Odette expurgate her confession of all its essential part, there would remain in the accessories something which Swann had never yet imagined, which crushed him anew, and was to enable him to alter the terms of the problem of his jealousy. And these admissions he could never forget. His spirit carried them along, cast them aside, then cradled them again in its bosom, like corpses in a river. And they poisoned it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She spoke to him once of a visit that Forcheville had paid her on the day of the Paris-Murcie F\u00eate. \"What! you knew him as long ago as that? Oh, yes, of course you did,\" he corrected himself, so as not to shew that he had been ignorant of the fact. And suddenly he began to tremble at the thought that, on the day of the Paris-Murcie F\u00eate, when he had received that letter which he had so carefully preserved, she had been having luncheon, perhaps, with Forcheville at the Maison d'Or. She swore that she had not. \"Still, the Maison d'Or reminds me of something or other which, I knew at the time, wasn't true,\" he pursued, hoping to frighten her. \"Yes that I hadn't been there at all that evening when I told you I had just come from there, and you had been looking for me at Pr\u00e9vost's,\" she replied (judging by his manner that he knew) with a firmness that was based not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity, a fear of crossing Swann, which her own self-respect made her anxious to conceal, and a desire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if she chose. And so she struck him with all the sharpness and force of a headsman wielding his axe, and yet could not be charged with cruelty, since she was quite unconscious of hurting him; she even began to laugh, though this may perhaps, it is true, have been chiefly to keep him from thinking that she was ashamed, at all, or confused. \"It's quite true, I hadn't been to the Maison Dor\u00e9e. I was coming away from Forcheville's. I had, really, been to Pr\u00e9vost's\u2014that wasn't a story\u2014and he met me there and asked me to come in and look at his prints. But some one else came to see him. I told you that I was coming from the Maison d'Or because I was afraid you might be angry with me. It was rather nice of me, really, don't you see? I admit, I did wrong, but at least I'm telling you all about it now, a'n't I? What have I to gain by not telling you, straight, that I lunched with him on the day of the Paris-Murcie F\u00eate, if it were true? Especially as at that time we didn't know one another quite so well as we do now, did we, dear?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He smiled back at her with the sudden, craven weakness of the utterly spiritless creature which these crushing words had made of him. And so, even in the months of which he had never dared to think again, because they had been too happy, in those months when she had loved him, she was already lying to him! Besides that moment (that first evening on which they had \"done a cattleya\") when she had told him that she was coming from the Maison Dor\u00e9e, how many others must there have been, each of them covering a falsehood of which Swann had had no suspicion. He recalled how she had said to him once: \"I need only tell Mme. Verdurin that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.\" From himself too, probably, many times when she had glibly uttered such words as explain a delay or justify an alteration of the hour fixed for a meeting, those moments must have hidden, without his having the least inkling of it at the time, an engagement that she had had with some other man, some man to whom she had said: \"I need only tell Swann that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.\" And beneath all his most pleasant memories, beneath the simplest words that Odette had ever spoken to him in those old days, words which he had believed as though they were the words of a Gospel, beneath her daily actions which she had recounted to him, beneath the most ordinary places, her dressmaker's flat, the Avenue du Bois, the Hippodrome, he could feel (dissembled there, by virtue of that temporal superfluity which, after the most detailed account of how a day has been spent, always leaves something over, that may serve as a hiding place for certain unconfessed actions), he could feel the insinuation of a possible undercurrent of falsehood which debased for him all that had remained most precious, his happiest evenings, the Rue La P\u00e9rouse itself, which Odette must constantly have been leaving at other hours than those of which she told him; extending the power of the dark horror that had gripped him when he had heard her admission with regard to the Maison Dor\u00e9e, and, like the obscene creatures in the 'Desolation of Nineveh,' shattering, stone by stone, the whole edifice of his past.... If, now, he turned aside whenever his memory repeated the cruel name of the Maison Dor\u00e9e it was because that name recalled to him, no longer, as, such a little time since, at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's party, the good fortune which he long had lost, but a misfortune of which he was now first aware. Then it befell the Maison Dor\u00e9e, as it had befallen the Island in the Bois, that gradually its name ceased to trouble him. For what we suppose to be our love, our jealousy are, neither of them, single, continuous and individual passions. They are composed of an infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, each of which is ephemeral, although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the impression of continuity, the illusion of unity. The life of Swann's love, the fidelity of his jealousy, were formed out of death, of infidelity, of innumerable desires, innumerable doubts, all of which had Odette for their object. If he had remained for any length of time without seeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by others. But the presence of Odette continued to sow in Swann's heart alternate seeds of love and suspicion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of which she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage, under penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come; he must instantly accompany her home, to \"do a cattleya,\" and the desire which she pretended to have for him was so sudden, so inexplicable, so imperious, the kisses which she lavished on him were so demonstrative and so unfamiliar, that this brutal and unnatural fondness made Swann just as unhappy as any lie or unkind action. One evening when he had thus, in obedience to her command, gone home with her, and while she was interspersing her kisses with passionate words, in strange contrast to her habitual coldness, he thought suddenly that he heard a sound; he rose, searched everywhere and found nobody, but he had not the courage to return to his place by her side; whereupon she, in a towering rage, broke a vase, with \"I never can do anything right with you, you impossible person!\" And he was left uncertain whether she had not actually had some man concealed in the room, whose jealousy she had wished to wound, or else to inflame his senses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes he repaired to 'gay' houses, hoping to learn something about Odette, although he dared not mention her name. \"I have a little thing here, you're sure to like,\" the 'manageress' would greet him, and he would stay for an hour or so, talking dolefully to some poor girl who sat there astonished that he went no further. One of them, who was still quite young and attractive, said to him once, \"Of course, what I should like would be to find a real friend, then he might be quite certain, I should never go with any other men again.\" \"Indeed, do you think it possible for a woman really to be touched by a man's being in love with her, and never to be unfaithful to him?\" asked Swann anxiously. \"Why, surely! It all depends on their characters!\" Swann could not help making the same remarks to these girls as would have delighted the Princesse des Laumes. To the one who was in search of a friend he said, with a smile: \"But how nice of you, you've put on blue eyes, to go with your sash.\" \"And you too, you've got blue cuffs on.\" \"What a charming conversation we are having, for a place of this sort! I'm not boring you, am I; or keeping you?\" \"No, I've nothing to do, thank you. If you bored me I should say so. But I love hearing you talk.\" \"I am highly flattered.... Aren't we behaving prettily?\" he asked the 'manageress,' who had just looked in. \"Why, yes, that's just what I was saying to myself, how sensibly they're behaving! But that's how it is! People come to my house now, just to talk. The Prince was telling me, only the other day, that he's far more comfortable here than with his wife. It seems that, nowadays, all the society ladies are like that; a perfect scandal, I call it. But I'll leave you in peace now, I know when I'm not wanted,\" she ended discreetly, and left Swann with the girl who had the blue eyes. But presently he rose and said good-bye to her. She had ceased to interest him. She did not know Odette\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The painter having been ill, Dr. Cottard recommended a sea-voyage; several of the 'faithful' spoke of accompanying him; the Verdurins could not face the prospect of being left alone in Paris, so first of all hired, and finally purchased a yacht; thus Odette was constantly going on a cruise. Whenever she had been away for any length of time, Swann would feel that he was beginning to detach himself from her, but, as though this moral distance were proportionate to the physical distance between them, whenever he heard that Odette had returned to Paris, he could not rest without seeing her. Once, when they had gone away, as everyone thought, for a month only, either they succumbed to a series of temptations, or else M. Verdurin had cunningly arranged everything beforehand, to please his wife, and disclosed his plans to the 'faithful' only as time went on; anyhow, from Algiers they flitted to Tunis; then to Italy, Greece, Constantinople, Asia Minor. They had been absent for nearly a year, and Swann felt perfectly at ease and almost happy. Albeit M. Verdurin had endeavoured to persuade the pianist and Dr. Cottard that their respective aunt and patients had no need of them, and that, in any event, it was most rash to allow Mme. Cottard to return to Paris, where, Mme. Verdurin assured him, a revolution had just broken out, he was obliged to grant them their liberty at Constantinople. And the painter came home with them. One day, shortly after the return of these four travellers, Swann, seeing an omnibus approach him, labelled 'Luxembourg,' and having some business there, had jumped on to it and had found himself sitting opposite Mme. Cottard, who was paying a round of visits to people whose 'day' it was, in full review order, with a plume in her hat, a silk dress, a muff, an umbrella (which do for a parasol if the rain kept off), a card-case, and a pair of white gloves fresh from the cleaners. Wearing these badges of rank, she would, in fine weather, go on foot from one house to another in the same neighbourhood, but when she had to proceed to another district, would make use of a transfer-ticket on the omnibus. For the first minute or two, until the natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched surface of the doctor's-wife, not being certain, either, whether she ought to mention the Verdurins before Swann, she produced, quite naturally, in her slow and awkward, but not unattractive voice, which, every now and then, was completely drowned by the rattling of the omnibus, topics selected from those which she had picked up and would repeat in each of the score of houses up the stairs of which she clambered in the course of an afternoon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I needn't ask you, M. Swann, whether a man so much in the movement as yourself has been to the Mirlitons, to see the portrait by Machard that the whole of Paris is running after. Well, and what do you think of it? Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse? It's the same in every house in Paris now, no one will speak of anything else but Machard's portrait; you aren't smart, you aren't really cultured, you aren't up-to-date unless you give an opinion on Machard's portrait.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann having replied that he had not seen this portrait, Mme. Cottard was afraid that she might have hurt his feelings by obliging him to confess the omission\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, that's quite all right! At least you have the courage to be quite frank about it. You don't consider yourself disgraced because you haven't seen Machard's portrait. I do think that so nice of you. Well now, I have seen it; opinion is divided, you know, there are some people who find it rather laboured, like whipped cream, they say; but I think it's just ideal. Of course, she's not a bit like the blue and yellow ladies that our friend Biche paints. That's quite clear. But I must tell you, perfectly frankly (you'll think me dreadfully old-fashioned, but I always say just what I think), that I don't understand his work. I can quite see the good points there are in his portrait of my husband; oh, dear me, yes; and it's certainly less odd than most of what he does, but even then he had to give the poor man a blue moustache! But Machard! Just listen to this now, the husband of my friend, I am on my way to see at this very moment (which has given me the very great pleasure of your company), has promised her that, if he is elected to the Academy (he is one of the Doctor's colleagues), he will get Machard to paint her portrait. So she's got something to look forward to! I have another friend who insists that she'd rather have Leloir. I'm only a wretched Philistine, and I've no doubt Leloir has perhaps more knowledge of painting even than Machard. But I do think that the most important thing about a portrait, especially when it's going to cost ten thousand francs, is that it should be like, and a pleasant likeness, if you know what I mean.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having exhausted this topic, to which she had been inspired by the loftiness of her plume, the monogram on her card-case, the little number inked inside each of her gloves by the cleaner, and the difficulty of speaking to Swann about the Verdurins, Mme. Cottard, seeing that they had still a long way to go before they would reach the corner of the Rue Bonaparte, where the conductor was to set her down, listened to the promptings of her heart, which counselled other words than these\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Your ears must have been burning,\" she ventured, \"while we were on the yacht with Mme. Verdurin. We were talking about you all the time.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was genuinely astonished, for he supposed that his name was never uttered in the Verdurins' presence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You see,\" Mme. Cottard went on, \"Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy was there; need I say more? When Odette is anywhere it's never long before she begins talking about you. And you know quite well, it isn't nasty things she says. What! you don't believe me!\" she went on, noticing that Svrann looked sceptical. And, carried away by the sincerity of her conviction, without putting any evil meaning into the word, which she used purely in the sense in which one employs it to speak of the affection that unites a pair of friends: \"Why, she adores you! No, indeed; I'm sure it would never do to say anything against you when she was about; one would soon be taught one's place! Whatever we might be doing, if we were looking at a picture, for instance, she would say, 'If only we had him here, he's the man who could tell us whether it's genuine or not. There's no one like him for that.' And all day long she would be saying, 'What can he be doing just now? I do hope, he's doing a little work! It's too dreadful that a fellow with such gifts as he has should be so lazy.' (Forgive me, won't you.) 'I can see him this very moment; he's thinking of us, he's wondering where we are.' Indeed, she used an expression which I thought very pretty at the time. M. Verdurin asked her, 'How in the world can you see what he's doing, when he's a thousand miles away?' And Odette answered, 'Nothing is impossible to the eye of a friend.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, I assure you, I'm not saying it just to flatter you; you have a true friend in her, such as one doesn't often find. I can tell you, besides, in case you don't know it, that you're the only one. Mme. Verdurin told me as much herself on our last day with them (one talks more freely, don't you know, before a parting), 'I don't say that Odette isn't fond of us, but anything that we may say to her counts for very little beside what Swann might say.' Oh, mercy, there's the conductor stopping for me; here have I been chatting away to you, and would have gone right past the Rue Bonaparte, and never noticed... Will you be so very kind as to tell me whether my plume is straight?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Mme. Cottard withdrew from her muff, to offer it to Swann, a white-gloved hand from which there floated, with a transier-ticket, an atmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus, blended with the harsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid. And Swann felt himself overflowing with gratitude to her, as well as to Mme. Verdurin (and almost to Odette, for the feeling that he now entertained for her was no longer tinged with pain, was scarcely even to be described, now, as love), while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with loving eyes, as she gallantly threaded her way along the Rue Bonaparte, her plume erect, her skirt held up in one hand, while in the other she clasped her umbrella and her card-case, so that its monogram could be seen, her muff dancing in the air before her as she went\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To compete with and so to stimulate the moribund feelings that Swann had for Odette, Mme. Cottard, a wiser physician, in this case, than ever her husband would have been, had grafted among them others more normal, feelings of gratitude, of friendship, which in Swann's mind were to make Odette seem again more human (more like other women, since other women could inspire the same feelings in him), were to hasten her final transformation back into that Odette, loved with an undisturbed affection, who had taken him home one evening after a revel at the painter's, to drink orangeade with Forcheville, that Odette with whom Swann had calculated that he might live in happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In former times, having often thought with terror that a day must come when he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had determined to keep a sharp look-out, and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to escape him, to cling tightly to it and to hold it back. But now, to the faintness of his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in his desire to remain her lover. For a man cannot change, that is to say become another person, while he continues to obey the dictates of the self which he has ceased to be. Occasionally the name, if it caught his eye in a newspaper, of one of the men whom he supposed to have been Odette's lovers, reawakened his jealousy. But it was very slight, and, inasmuch as it proved to him that he had not completely emerged from that period in which he had so keenly suffered\u2014though in it he had also known a way of feeling so intensely happy\u2014and that the accidents of his course might still enable him to catch an occasional glimpse, stealthily and at a distance, of its beauties, this jealousy gave him, if anything, an agreeable thrill, as to the sad Parisian, when he has left Venice behind him and must return to France, a last mosquito proves that Italy and summer are still not too remote. But, as a rule, with this particular period of his life from which he was emerging, when he made an effort, if not to remain in it, at least to obtain, while still he might, an uninterrupted view of it, he discovered that already it was too late; he would have looked back to distinguish, as it might be a landscape that was about to disappear, that love from which he had departed, but it is so difficult to enter into a state of complete duality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle of a feeling which one has ceased to possess, that very soon, the clouds gathering in his brain, he could see nothing, he would abandon the attempt, would take the glasses from his nose and wipe them; and he told himself that he would do better to rest for a little, that there would be time enough later on, and settled back into his corner with as little curiosity, with as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap down over his eyes so as to get some sleep in the railway-carriage that is drawing him, he feels, faster and faster, out of the country in which he has lived for so long, and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip away from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell. Indeed, like the same traveller, if he does not awake until he has crossed the frontier and is again in France, when Swann happened to alight, close at hand, upon something which proved that Forcheville had been Odette's lover, he discovered that it caused him no pain, that love was now utterly remote, and he regretted that he had had no warning of the moment in which he had emerged from it for ever. And just as, before kissing Odette for the first time, he had sought to imprint upon his memory the face that for so long had been familiar, before it was altered by the additional memory of their kiss, so he could have wished\u2014in thought at least\u2014to have been in a position to bid farewell, while she still existed, to that Odette who had inspired love in him and jealousy, to that Odette who had caused him so to suffer, and whom now he would never see again. He was mistaken. He was destined to see her once again, a few weeks later. It was while he was asleep, in the twilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme. Verdurin, Dr. Cottard, a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify, the painter, Odette, Napoleon III and my grandfather, along a path which followed the line of the coast, and overhung the sea, now at a great height, now by a few feet only, so that they were continually going up and down; those of the party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to those who were still climbing; what little daylight yet remained was failing, and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on them. Now and then the waves dashed against the cliff, and Swann could feel on his cheek a shower of freezing spray. Odette told him to wipe this off, but he could not, and felt confused and helpless in her company, as well as because he was in his nightshirt. He hoped that, in the darkness, this might pass unnoticed; Mme. Verdurin, however, fixed her astonished gaze upon him for an endless moment, in which he saw her face change its shape, her nose grow longer, while beneath it there sprouted a heavy moustache. He turned away to examine Odette; her cheeks were pale, with little fiery spots, her features drawn and ringed with shadows; but she looked back at him with eyes welling with affection, ready to detach themselves like tears and to fall upon his face, and he felt that he loved her so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him at once. Suddenly Odette turned her wrist, glanced at a tiny watch, and said: \"I must go.\" She took leave of everyone, in the same formal manner, without taking Swann aside, without telling him where they were to meet that evening, or next day. He dared not ask, he would have liked to follow her, he was obliged, without turning back in her direction, to answer with a smile some question by Mme. Verdurin; but his heart was frantically beating, he felt that he now hated Odette, he would gladly have crushed those eyes which, a moment ago, he had loved so dearly, have torn the blood into those lifeless cheeks. He continued to climb with Mme. Verdurin, that is to say that each step took him farther from Odette, who was going downhill, and in the other direction. A second passed and it was many hours since she had left him. The painter remarked to Swann that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. \"They had obviously arranged it between them,\" he added; \"they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn't say good-bye together; it might have looked odd. She is his mistress.\" The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavoured to console him. \"After all, she is quite right,\" he said to the young man, drying his eyes for him and taking off the fez to make him feel more at ease. \"I've advised her to do that, myself, a dozen times. Why be so distressed? He was obviously the man to understand her.\" So Swann reasoned with himself, for the young man whom he had failed, at first, to identify, was himself also; like certain novelists, he had distributed his own personality between two characters, him who was the 'first person' in the dream, and another whom he saw before him, capped with a fez\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association of ideas, then a certain modification of the Baron's usual physiognomy, and lastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honour across his breast, had made Swann give that name; but actually, and in everything that the person who appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him, it was indeed Forcheville. For, from an incomplete and changing set of images, Swann in his sleep drew false deductions, enjoying, at the same time, such creative power that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple act of division, like certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he felt in his own palm he modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought that he was clasping, and out of feelings and impressions of which he was not yet conscious, he brought about sudden vicissitudes which, by a chain of logical sequences, would produce, at definite points in his dream, the person required to receive his love or to startle him awake. In an instant night grew black about him; an alarum rang, the inhabitants ran past him, escaping from their blazing houses; he could hear the thunder of the surging waves, and also of his own heart, which, with equal violence, was anxiously beating in his breast. Suddenly the speed of these palpitations redoubled, he felt a pain, a nausea that were inexplicable; a peasant, dreadfully burned, flung at him as he passed: \"Come and ask Charlus where Odette spent the night with her friend. He used to go about with her, and she tells him everything. It was they that started the fire.\" It was his valet, come to awaken him, and saying:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sir, it is eight o'clock, and the barber is here. I have told him to call again in an hour.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But these words, as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which Swann was submerged, did not reach his consciousness without undergoing that refraction which turns a ray of light, at the bottom of a bowl of water, into another sun; just as, a moment earlier, the sound of the door-bell, swelling in the depths of his abyss of sleep into the clangour of an alarum, had engendered the episode of the fire. Meanwhile the scenery of his dream-stage scattered in dust, he opened his eyes, heard for the last time the boom of a wave in the sea, grown very distant. He touched his cheek. It was dry. And yet he could feel the sting of the cold spray, and the taste of salt on his lips. He rose, and dressed himself. He had made the barber come early because he had written, the day before, to my grandfather, to say that he was going, that afternoon, to Combray, having learned that Mme. de Cambremer\u2014Mlle. Legrandin that had been\u2014was spending a few days there. The association in his memory of her young and charming face with a place in the country which he had not visited for so long, offered him a combined attraction which had made him decide at last to leave Paris for a while. As the different changes and chances that bring us into the company of certain other people in this life do not coincide with the periods in which we are in love with those people, but, overlapping them, may occur before love has begun, and may be repeated after love is ended, the earliest appearances, in our life, of a creature who is destined to afford us pleasure later on, assume retrospectively in our eyes a certain value as an indication, a warning, a presage. It was in this fashion that Swann had often carried back his mind to the image of Odette, encountered in the theatre, on that first evening when he had no thought of ever seeing her again\u2014and that he now recalled the party at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's, at which he had introduced General de Frober-ville to Mme. de Cambremer. So manifold are our interests in life that it is not uncommon that, on a single occasion, the foundations of a happiness which does not yet exist are laid down simultaneously with aggravations of a grief from which we are still suffering. And, no doubt, that might have occurred to Swann elsewhere than at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's. Who, indeed, can say whether, in the event of his having gone, that evening, somewhere else, other happinesses, other griefs would not have come to him, which, later, would have appeared to have been inevitable? But what did seem to him to have been inevitable was what had indeed taken place, and he was not far short of seeing something providential in the fact that he had at last decided to go to Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that evening, because his mind, anxious to admire the richness of invention that life shews, and incapable of facing a difficult problem for any length of time, such as to discover what, actually, had been most to be wished for, came to the conclusion that the sufferings through which he had passed that evening, and the pleasures, at that time unsuspected, which were already being brought to birth,\u2014the exact balance between which was too difficult to establish\u2014were linked by a sort of concatenation of necessity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But while, an hour after his awakening, he was giving instructions to the barber, so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become disarranged on the journey, he thought once again of his dream; he saw once again, as he had felt them close beside him, Odette's pallid complexion, her too thin cheeks, her drawn features, her tired eyes, all the things which\u2014in the course of those successive bursts of affection which had made of his enduring love for Odette a long oblivion of the first impression that he had formed of her\u2014he had ceased to observe after the first few days of their intimacy, days to which, doubtless, while he slept, his memory had returned to seek the exact sensation of those things. And with that old, intermittent fatuity, which reappeared in him now that he was no longer unhappy, and lowered, at the same time, the average level of his morality, he cried out in his heart: \"To think that I have wasted years of my life, that I have longed for death, that the greatest love that I have ever known has been for a woman who did not please me, who was not in my style!\"1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1547776", "artist_names": "Melanie Martinez", "full_title": "Too Close (The Voice Performance) by\u00a0Melanie\u00a0Martinez", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/75f305273bd16df4c8705045cad66fa0.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/75f305273bd16df4c8705045cad66fa0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1547776, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 6572542, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1625588747, "path": "/Melanie-martinez-too-close-the-voice-performance-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 2, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Melanie-martinez-too-close-the-voice-performance-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2012, "month": 11, "day": 26}, "release_date_for_display": "November 26, 2012", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Nov. 26, 2012", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/75f305273bd16df4c8705045cad66fa0.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/75f305273bd16df4c8705045cad66fa0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false}, "title": "Too Close (The Voice Performance)", "title_with_featured": "Too Close (The Voice Performance)", "updated_by_human_at": 1662988836, "url": "https://genius.com/Melanie-martinez-too-close-the-voice-performance-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/153995", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/329437dcf2fc275bc718307892201ae0.353x92x1.png", "id": 153995, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e039f925c6b822507f0a26bcc54c9e7d.734x734x1.jpg", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": true, "name": "Melanie Martinez", "slug": "Melanie-martinez", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Melanie-martinez", "iq": 245}, "artist": "Melanie Martinez", "lyrics": "Too Close (The Voice Performance) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou know I'm not one to break promises\nI don't want to hurt you but I need to breathe\nAt the end of it all, you're still my best friend\nBut there's something inside that I need to release\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhich way is right?

door with you, the air was cold\nBut something 'bout it felt like home somehow\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing \u2018round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well, yeah\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $299You might also like[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again\nJust to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\nToo well\n\n[Verse 4]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow, you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Outro]\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well146Embed"}, {"_type":

broke up last night\nI threw my phone across the room, at you\nI was expecting some dramatic turn away\nBut you stayed\nThis morning, I said we should talk about it\n'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved\nThat's when you came in wearing a football helmet\nAnd said, \"Okay, let's talk\"\nAnd I said\n[Chorus]\nStay, stay, stay\nI've been loving you for quite some time, time, time\nYou think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad\nBut I think that it's best if we both stay\n\n[Verse 2]\nBefore you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers\nWho took all of their problems out on me\nBut you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing\nAnd I love you because you have given me\nNo choice but to\n\n[Chorus]\nStay, stay, stay\nI've been loving you for quite some time, time,

just like hanging out with you all the time\nAll those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me\nI'd like to hang out with you for my whole life\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low

mad\nEveryone in the world is mad\nIt's a mad crazy world\n\n[Hook]\nI see diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\n[Verse 1]\nWith a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure\nPulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword\nWrites a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door\nJust the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord\nListen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause\nA seduction of his senses by the devils he adores\nThe unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war\nFollow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward\nShun him while in public disallow him from your stores\nHave no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours\nMake scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores\nBut we must still pray that his color will be cured\n\n[Hook]\nI see diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\n[Verse 2]\nWith her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain\nHe looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains\nHow she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged\nHer becoming must be halted to reverse what she became\nFrom the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims\nTo do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane\nYou must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain\nYou torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame\nBlank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name\nPerfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints\nMay God bless the scientific cure for the insane\nKnew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI see diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\n[Verse 3]\nWith his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine\nPut his Bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind\nTold him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine\nNow the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time\nWith no life inside his body now he finally think he\u2019s safe\nBut they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face\nHe take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states\nNow he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped\nWith the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens\nDoesn\u2019t mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins\nHe forgives them in advance says that he will do again\n[John F. Kennedy]\nMy fellow Americans...\n\n[Hook]\nI see diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through31Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/82848", "artist_names": "50 Cent (Ft.

Lupe Fiasco and Chill]\n\n[Verse 1]\nFirst off, say \"Peace\" to Pine Ridge\nShame at all the damage that the white man wine did\nGhost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year\nAnd all that other crime did\nMore peace to the teachers of blind kids\nTo rebels in small cells keeping their mind big\nSay everything's hostile\nSuicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models\nWith cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils, they got to\nJust to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you\nStraight hair, high heels and a handbag\nCrucifixes, racism and a land grab\nKatrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags\nA peace sign and a pants sag\nA money toss cause a nine stripper mad dash\nA friend request following a hash tag\nNow everybody want it like the last laugh\nA Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask\nPurple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class\nStable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad\nBut corporate jets really had to have that gas bad\nWar and they hope they all fall from the ratatat\nCause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillacs\n[Hook]\nLive from the other side what you see\nA bunch of nonsense on my TV\nHeaven on Earth is what I need\nBut I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe\nReporting live from the other side what you hear\nA bunch of nonsense all in my ear\nRich man, poor man, we all gotta pay\nCause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd we marvel at the state of Ottoman\nThen turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can\nAmerica's a big motherfuckin' garbageman\nIf you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem\nYou say no you ain't, and I say yes you is\nSoon as you find out what planned obsolescence is\nYou say no they didn't, and I say yes they did\nThe definition of unnecessary-ness\nManifested\nSay that we should protest just to get arrested\nThat goes against all my hustling ethics\nA bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective\nDepart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip\nInsert Baldwin to similar the separate\nTo me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit\nOr finding really fast internet to have some sex with\nIt's all one song short of a set list\nCouple croissants shy of a continental breakfast\nOr blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish\nSo absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace\nDown at the Lakota Sioux Casino\nA whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno\nI go as left as a heart in the chest\nCause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death\nYou might also like[Hook]\nLive from the other side what you see\nA bunch of nonsense on my TV\nHeaven on Earth is what I need\nBut I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe\nReporting live from the other side what you hear\nA bunch of nonsense all in my ear\nRich man, poor man, we all gotta pay\nCause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way\n\n[Verse 3]\nAn all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler\nHope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar\nSouth Central an example of God's gifts\nSo shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6\nThe projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns\nMonopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound\nIt\u2019s parts of Manila like the video for \"Thriller\"\nBut the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa\nIf poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla\nThen what\u2019s the flavor of the Sunday preacher\u2019s pedophilia?\nCash rules everything around these niggas\nAs classrooms everywhere around me wither\nHither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers\nThe tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the middle\nOf the extremes of America\u2019s dream\nFreud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now\u2026\n[Hook]\nLive from the other side what you see\nA bunch of nonsense on my TV\nHeaven on Earth is what I need\nBut I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe\nReporting live from the other side what you hear\nA bunch of nonsense all in my ear\nRich man, poor man, we all gotta pay\nCause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way\n\n[Outro]\nGreat American rap resurrect...\nLupe on the check\nWestside till I die!52Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

pound of flesh\nBut I like to keep some things to myself\nI like to keep my issues drawn\nIt's always darkest before the dawn\n[MERCEDES]\nAnd I've been a fool and I've been blind\nI can never leave the past behind\nI can see no way, I can see no way\n\n[MERCEDES & TINA]\nI'm always dragging that horse around\nOur love is pastured, such a mournful sound\n\n[MERCEDES]\nTonight I'm gonna bury that

back\n\n[MERCEDES]\nAnd given half the chance, would I take any of it back?\n\n[TINA]\nIt's a fine romance but it's left me so undone\n[MERCEDES, SANTANA & TINA]\nIt's always darkest before the dawn\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n\n[SANTANA (& TINA)]\nAnd I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't\n(So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope)\n\n[SANTANA (& MERCEDES)]\nAnd I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope\n(It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat, 'cause)\n\n[MERCEDES]\nLooking for heaven\n\n[MERCEDES with SANTANA]\nFound the devil in me\nLooking for

However, many of these artists are religious, as proclaimed by the rappers themselves in their music. Often times, the religious, church-friendly ways don\u2019t match with anti-biblical devices used in rap. Several elements of lyricism and culture constantly repeat and can be heard across radio waves. Let\u2019s dive in to these contradictions \u2014 staples of the game.EXHIBIT A: AMENMany of us know of the hit single released by [Meek Mill](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Meek-mill) called \u201c[Amen](http://rapgenius.com/Meek-mill-amen-lyrics)\u201d featuring [Drake](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Drake) and [Jeremih](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Jeremih), off of Meek\u2019s 2012 album [Dreams and Nightmares](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Meek-mill/Dreams-and-nightmares). This song is a perfect example of what I\u2019m referring to as a \u201creligious contradiction.\u201d For God\u2019s sake, the song\u2019s hook is like a diss track to the church:[There\u2019s a lot of bad bitches in the building, Amen!](http://rapgenius.com/1570068)No preacher, no church approve of any rap music [\u2026] \u2018cause rap music period, there\u2019s a lot of bad stuff that\u2019s being said. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s real life.Is it real life, though? Many rappers [spit about lifestyles](http://rapgenius.com/Dj-khaled-bitches-and-bottles-lets-get-it-started-lyrics) that the average person cannot relate to, much less claim to be normal. These upper echelon lifestyles are the basis of much of the \u201cbad stuff\u201d in hip hop, and as [Biggie](http://rapgenius.com/artists/The-notorious-b-i-g) said, \u201c[Mo' Money Mo' Problems](http://rapgenius.com/The-notorious-big-mo-money-mo-problems-lyrics).\u201d However, that isn\u2019t to discount the other end of the spectrum, either; many of these rappers share thoughts about things that went on in their bad neighborhoods growing up. Religious imagery can simply be a way to represent the pain and contrast, where God lived and died with bullet holes.EXHIBIT B: JESUS WALKSChi-Town native [Kanye West](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Kanye-west) does a number with this smash single from [The College Dropout](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Kanye-west/The-college-dropout), \u201c[Jesus Walks](http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-jesus-walks-lyrics).\u201d This song is by far one of my favorite rap songs of all time. Filled to the brim with biblical references, prayers via rap, and general mentions of [Jesus Christ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus~E95Echrist), West\u2019s work is a buffet of imagery.[God show me the way/\n\nBecause the Devil\u2019s trying to break me down](http://rapgenius.com/1184500)PAUSE. Isn\u2019t this the same dude that did \u201c[H.A.M.](http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-ham-lyrics)\u201d with [Jay-Z](/artists/Jay-z)? And \u201c[Birthday Song](/2-chainz-birthday-song-lyrics)\u201d with [2 Chainz](/artists/2-chainz)? Or \u201c[Cold](http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-cold-lyrics),\u201d where he said:\n\n\u201c[To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid/\n\nAnd if you can do it better than me, then you do it!](http://rapgenius.com/680192)\u201d\nCome on, \u2018Ye! Don\u2019t you know that pride is one of the [seven deadly sins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven~E95Edeadly~E95Esins)? At any rate, Kanye is ironically speaking in this song about the same subject. Still, West randomly turns to a preaching tone often:[To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers/\n\n(Jesus walks for them)](http://rapgenius.com/18072)No matter what sins you\u2019ve committed, what your vices are, or how troubled your past may be, Jesus still walks with you. Kanye also touches on a very important part of the subject, commercial media\u2019s fears of being labeled \u201creligious\u201d[So here go my single dog radio needs this/\n\nThey say you can rap about anything except for Jesus/\n\nThat means guns, sex, lies, videotape/\n\nBut if I talk about God my record won\u2019t get played, huh?](http://rapgenius.com/18073)Preach, Kanye! Why is it that we love religion only when it\u2019s convenient? Ye seems to have a grip on how, even with a successful song, religion is not welcome. Let\u2019s move on\u2026EXHIBIT C: JESUS PIECEAhh, the famous chains\u2026In late 2012, rapper [Game](/artists/Game) released his fifth studio album, [Jesus Piece](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Game/Jesus-piece)*.\n\n[Jesus pieces](http://jesus-piece.urbanup.com/2839982) serve as fantastic symbolizations of the point I\u2019m trying to get at. Their intent is to symbolize religion, but they end up being a symbol of wealth and materialism. Remember, after all, that greed is another [deadly sin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven~E95Edeadly~E95Esins). It is more than ironic that a device used to symbolize religion has become the antithesis of religion in rap. Now THAT\u2019S a contradiction.Back to Game\u2019s album: Jesus pieces have been a hot topic in rap for years ([The Notorious B.I.G.](/artists/The-notorious-b-i-g), [Kanye West](/artists/Kanye-west), and [Ghostface Killah](/artists/Ghostface-killah) all rocked one). It was inevitable that somebody was going to drop an album with that name. But really?! GAME?! Of all people?! The known violent man? Isn\u2019t this the dude we saw on World Star in a fight with [40 Glocc](http://rapgenius.com/artists/40-glocc)?\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m not trying to say that you shouldn\u2019t spread your religion if you\u2019ve been caught sinning. As the [Bible](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Holy-bible-kjv) says, there are no perfect people (this goes for the aforementioned Kanye West). But come on, Game, you got Jesus wearing a Blood Gang-colored bandana over his face on your album cover. THAT\u2019S outrageous.EXHIBIT D: 4Eva N A DayArguably one of the most descriptive cover artworks to come out in quite some time, [Big K.R.I.T.](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Big-krit) hits the nail on the head with this mixtape. [4Eva N A Day](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Big-krit/4eva-n-a-day), released in 2012, is Big K.R.I.T.\u2019s 10th mixtape. Without referencing any music on the tape, let me just say this about the album art: it is exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Church on the left, strip club on the right. Bible on the left, booze on the right. This artwork completely exemplifies the sinner on Saturday, saint on Sunday point-of-view that hip hop generally holds. I give mad props.OTHER EXAMPLES:RocNation, [Jay-Z](/artists/Jay-z)\u2019s handcrafted imprint, signee [J.Cole](http://rapgenius.com/artists/J-cole)\u2019s next album will be titled [Born Sinner](http://rapgenius.com/albums/J-cole/Born-sinner). On his EP [Truly Yours](http://rapgenius.com/albums/J-cole/Truly-yours), Cole spits this line:[I was sent from Heaven with a set of horns, they\u2019d better warn y\u2019all](http://rapgenius.com/1497865)On [Macklemore](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Macklemore) and Ryan Lewis' album [The Heist](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Macklemore-and-ryan-lewis/The-heist) (reviewed [here](http://rapgenius.com/discussions/20755-Review-of-the-heist-by-macklemore-and-ryan-lewis)), Macklemore penned [Neon Cathedral](http://rapgenius.com/Macklemore-and-ryan-lewis-neon-cathedral-lyrics), where he describes his main vice: alcohol addiction. The title of the song alludes to the same motif seen on Big K.R.I.T.\u2019s album cover, a juxtaposition of evil and holy.\n\n[Rick Ross](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Rick-ross)\u2018 fifth album is titled [God Forgives, I Don\u2019t](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Rick-ross/God-forgives-i-don-t).\n\nOn [T.I.](http://rapgenius.com/artists/T-i)\u2019s 8th studio album, titled [Trouble Man: Heavy is the Head](http://rapgenius.com/albums/T-i/Trouble-man-heavy-is-the-head), the song \u201c[Hallelujah](http://rapgenius.com/Ti-hallelujah-lyrics)\u201d describes T.I.\u2019s faith in god. This is the same man who wrote the song \u201c[Trap Back Jumpin'](http://rapgenius.com/Ti-trap-back-jumping-lyrics),\u201d an undeniably unholy anthem.\n\nFinally, as alluded to in the title, [Kendrick Lamar](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Kendrick-lamar) takes the cake with his song on [Section.80](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Kendrick-lamar/Section-80), \u201c[Kush and Corinthians](http://rapgenius.com/Kendrick-lamar-kush-and-corinthians-his-pain-lyrics).\u201d As the song describes, our daily temptations are what keeps us from our closeness to our god, and sometimes, the two overlap.[So I\u2019m smoking my kush reading Corinthians\n\nSmoking my kush reading Corinthians](http://rapgenius.com/285192)CONCLUSION: NEW GOD FLOWWhat am I getting at with all of these examples of religious contradictions? Well, to some extent, I just found them interesting. But, I also note that such opposition is not seen to such a degree in other genres, if at all. This poses the question: is hip hop a religion in its own right? Rap, after all, coincides with a lot of things in the bible, but goes against so much of it at the same time.\n\nKanye West asks this very question in his song \u201c[Gorgeous](http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-gorgeous-lyrics)\u201d[Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?](http://rapgenius.com/52901)These contradictory ways of hip-hop aren\u2019t likely to change anytime soon.

of the story\nEverything we had, everything we did\nIs buried in dust, and this dust is all that's left of us\nAnd only a few ever worried\nWhile the signs were clear, they had no idea\nYou just get use to livin' in fear\nOr give up, when you can't even picture your future\nWe walk the plank with our eyes wide open\n[Chorus]\nWe walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\u2014\n(Walk the plank, with our eyes wide open, we\u2014)\nYeah, we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\u2014\n(Walk the plank, with our eyes wide open, we\u2014)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd some people offered up answers (answers)\nWe made out we like we heard they were only words\nThey didn't add up, to a change in the way we were living\nAnd the saddest thing, is all of it could've been avoided\nBut it was like to stop consuming, to stop being human\nAnd why'd I make a change if you won't\nWe're all in the same, boat, stayin' afloat for the moment\n\n[Chorus]\nWe walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\u2014\n(Walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\u2014)\nYeah, we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\u2014\n(We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\u2014)\nWe walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\u2014\nWe walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\u2014\nWe walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\u2014\n\n[Outro]\nWith our eyes wide open, we\u2014\nWalk the plank, we walk the plank\nWith our eyes wide open, we\u2014\nWalk the plank, we walk the plank, we walk the plank\nWith our eyes wide open, we\u2014\nWalk the plank, we walk the plank\nWith our eyes wide

Solo Cup Lyrics[FINN]\nTwo, one, two, three!\n\n[SAM & (MIKE)]\nNow, red solo cup is the best receptacle\nFor barbecues, tailgates, fairs and festivals\nAnd you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles\nIf you prefer drinkin' from glass (That's true!)\nHey, red solo cup is cheap and disposable\nAnd in fourteen years they are decomposable\nAnd unlike my home, they are not foreclosable\nFreddie Mac can kiss my ass, woo!\nRed solo cup, uh huh, I fill you up\nLet's have a party, let's have a party\nI love you, red solo cup, I lift you up\nProceed to party, proceed to party\n\nNow, I really love how you're easy to stack\nBut I really hate how you're easy to crack\n'Cause when beer runs down the front of my back\nWell, that, my friends, is quite yucky\n\nBut I have to admit that the ladies get smitten\nAdmirin' how sharply my first name is written\nOn you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'\nOn them to help me get lucky\n\nRed solo cup, I fill you up\nLet's have a party, let's have a party\nI love you, red solo cup, I lift you up\nProceed to party, proceed to party\n\nNow, I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow\nBut only you, red, will do for this fellow\n'Cause you are the Abbott into my Costello\nAnd you are the Fruit to my Loom\n\nRed solo cup, you're more than just plastic\nYou're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic\nBelieve me when I'm not the least bit sarcastic\nWhen I look at you and say:\nYou might also like[SAM & (QUINN), {FINN}]\n\"Red solo cup...\nYou're not just a cup (Mm, mm)\n{God no!}\nYou're my...
