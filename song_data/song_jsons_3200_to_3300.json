degrees\"\n[Refrain]\nYou hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet\nBurned me up and down, no way to cool it\nBut every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey\nLike a bottle of Jack straight

loud\nYou gave me that look, you licked them lips\nI said, \"Hang on baby, better pull over for this\"\nI don't wanna get DWK, driving while kissing they'll put you away\n\n[Refrain]\nYou hit me like

though your friends tell me you're doin' fine\nAre you somewhere feeling lonely, even though he's right beside you?\nWhen he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Calum]\nSometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?\nIf what we had was real, how could you be fine?\n'Cause I'm not fine at all\n[Chorus: All, Luke]\nI remember the day you told me you were leavin'\nI remember the make-up running down your face\nAnd the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them\nLike every single wish we ever made\nI wish that I could wake up with

Luke]\nThe pictures that you sent me, they're still livin' in my phone\nI'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone\nAnd all my friends keep asking why I'm not around\nIt hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you moved on\nIt's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Calum]\nIt's like we never happened, was it just a lie?\nIf what we had was real, how could you be fine?\n'Cause I'm not fine at all\n\n[Chorus: All]\nI remember the day you told me you were leavin'\nI remember the make-up running down your face\nAnd the dreams you left

beer and a bunch of girls\nSure enough going to be a good time\n[Chorus: Brantley Gilbert & Thomas Rhett]\nIt's a small town throwdown\nIt's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down\nAnd man, it's

full of daisy dukes\nRound here we know how to grow them\nRocking little body and long tan legs\nSure ain't scared to show 'em, now\nShow a little something, girl\nSomebody said them city boys\nRiding around looking for some trouble\nIf they bring it across that county line\nYou know there's gonna be a rumble\n\n[Chorus: Brantley Gilbert & Justin Moore]\nIt's a small town throwdown\nIt's time to

come down\nI'll try anything to drown out the pain\nThey all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane\n[Verse 2]\nWe had this date marked on the calendar forever\nWe'd take that new wed limo airport ride

you\nI'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through\n\n[Verse 1]\nTwo feet in the red dirt, school skirt\nSugar cane, back lanes\nThree jobs, took years to save\nBut I got a ticket on that plane\nPeople got a lot to say\nBut don't know shit about where I was made\nOr how many floors that I had to scrub\nJust to make it past where I am from\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNo money, no family\n16 in the middle of Miami\nNo money, no family\n16 in the middle of Miami\nNo money, no family\n16 in the middle of Miami\n16 in the middle of Miami\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been up all night, tryna get that rich\nI've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit\nMilked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live\nI've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nWorkin' on my shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou can hate it or love it\nHustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting\nThoroughbred in a mud brick before the budget\nWhite chick on that Pac shit\nMy passion was ironic\nAnd my dreams were uncommon\nGuess I gone crazy, first deal changed me\nRobbed blind, basically raped me\nRose through the bullshit like a matador\nJust made me madder and adamant to go at 'em\nAnd even the score\nSo, I went harder\nStudied the Carters till a deal was offered\nSlept cold on the floor recording\nAt four in the morning\nAnd now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer\nImmigrant, art ignorant\nYa ill intent was insurance for my benefit\nHate to be inconsiderate\nBut the industry took my innocence\nToo late, now I'm in this bitch!\nYou might also likeYou don't know the half\nThis shit get real\nValley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins\nWhat you call that?\nHead over heels\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNo money, no family\n16 in the middle of Miami\nNo money, no family\n16 in the middle of Miami\nNo money, no family\n16 in the middle of Miami\n16 in the middle of Miami\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been up all night, tryna get that rich\nI've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit\nMilked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live\nI've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nWorkin' on my shit\n[Verse 3]\nPledge allegiance to the struggle\nAin't been easy\nBut cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle\nBags is all we had\nDo anything for my Mama, I love you\nOne day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice\nThat ya managed to muscle\nSixteen, you sent me through customs so\nAll aboard my spaceship to Mercury\nTurn first at the light that's in front me\n'Cause every night I'ma do it like it's my last\nThis dream is all that I need\n'Cause it's all that I ever had\n\n[Outro]\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nWorkin' on my shit\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nWorkin' on my shit278Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

side\nI've been sat with you\nFor most of the night\nIgnorin' everybody here\nWe wish they would disappear\nSo maybe we could get down now\nI don't wanna know\nIf you're gettin' ahead of the program\nI want you to be mine, lady\nTo hold your body close\nTake another step into the no-man's land\nAnd for the longest time, lady\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI need you, darling\nCome on, set the tone\nIf you feel you're fallin'\nWon\u2019t you let me know?\nOh-oh, ooh-ooh\nOh-oh, ooh-ooh\nIf you love me\nCome on, get involved\nFeel it rushin' through you\nFrom your head to toe\nOh-oh, ooh-ooh\nOh-oh,

2]\nThis love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage\nAnd the fire brigade comes in a couple of days\nUntil then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know\nBut somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke\nLet it go until our roads are changed\nSingin' \"We Found Love\" in a local rave\nNo, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say\nBut I can just figure it out, then hope and pray\nI told her my name, then said \"It's nice to meet you\"\nThen she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila\nI already know if she's a keeper\nJust from this one small act of kindness, I'm in\nDeep **** if anybody finds out\nI meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now\nNot soberin' up, we just sit on the couch\nOne thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI need you, darling\nCome on, set the tone\nIf you feel you're fallin'\nWon\u2019t you let me know?\nOh-oh, ooh-ooh\nOh-oh, ooh-ooh\nIf you love me\nCome on, get involved\nFeel it

you feel it?\nFound you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?\nBefore the beat kicks in again\nCan you feel it?\nCan you feel it?\n[Chorus]\nSing!\n(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I need you,

Genius analytics can truly determine who made the biggest impact in a calendar year. So with that in mind, we decided to breakdown lyric driven trends in 2014.Most viewed songs in 20142014 really felt like the year of the \"single\". While we missed major label offerings from the game's hottest MC's, we had an abundance of outstanding singles, features and breakthrough artists. The likes of Bobby Shmurda, Rich Gang, and Rae Sremmurd dropped meme-generating songs quicker than you could understand what Young Thug was saying.  And although Thugger and Rae Sremmurd   may appear more times on the list, Bobby Shmurda took the crown with his single \u201cHot Nigga\u201d, which  has snagged more than 3,000,000 page views since July last year.\n\nEven with the Young Thugs and Shmurdas in the rap game, fans found themselves furiously searching content from 2012 and 2013. Just under half the songs you'll find below were not from 2014. Most notably, 2013's two rap biggest songs - \u201cDrunk In Love\u201d & \u201cRap God\u201d sit at the top of our view count. In an even bigger twist, Kendrick Lamar flexed his influence with \u201cm.A.A.d city\u201d - the 8th track from his modern classic good kid, m.A.A.d city broke into the top 10.1.

Charlie Wilson - \u201cBound 2\u201dMost viewed artists in 2014Song views may rule the roost when it comes to who had the hottest meme of the minute, but an artist is the total package. In 2014, only six of the most viewed artists on Genius released full albums. The most surprising addition to the top ten is Childish Gambino -  seeing his name there with raps heavyweights shows how far he's come from that infamous 1.6.\nDrake took 2014's crown as the most viewed artist on Genius - is this a surprise? Yes, for two reasons. The list doesn't include features, and Drake only released a handful of tracks in 2014, meaning he relied heavily on 2013's Nothing Was The Same. It looks like Yeezy was right all along, Drake really is the most popular man in rap.1. Drake\n2. Eminem\n3. Beyonce\n4. Kanye West\n5. Kendrick Lamar\n6. Childish Gambino\n7. Jay Z\n8. Lil Wayne\n9.

A$AP RockyBonus: The Carters Beyonce & Jay Z appear in the top ten artists, but only on records featuring each other in the \"most viewed\" songs list. This cements their \"power couple\" brand, but raises more questions about their individual status. Have the \"Beyonce & Jay Z\" brands been replaced by \"The Carters?\"\n\n\n\n\nWhat lyrics did you search for this year, surprised not to see something on the list?

out\nI shoulda never let you in\n'Cause you got me face down\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nAnd don't take this personal\nBut you're the worst\nYou know what you've done to me\nAnd although it hurts, I know\nI just can't keep runnin' away\n(I can't keep runnin' away\nI can't keep runnin' away\nI can't keep runnin' away)\n[Chorus]\nI don't need you, I don't need you\nI don't need you, I don't need you\nBut I want you\nI don't mean to, I don't mean to\nI don't mean to, I don't mean to\nBut I love you\n\n[Verse 2]\nTell me whatcha say now\nTell me whatcha say?\nYou said that you would come again\nYou said that we would remain friends but\nYou know that I do not depend on\nNothing or no one\nSo why would you show up?\nSo uninvited then\nJust change my mind like that\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nPlease don't take this personal\nBut you ain't shit\nAnd you weren't special\n'Til I made you so\nYou better act like you know\nThat I've been through worse than you\nI just can't keep runnin' away\n(I can't keep runnin' away\nI can't keep runnin' away\nI can't keep runnin' away)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n(But I don't need you)\nI don't need you, I don't need you\nI don't need you, I don't need you\n(But I) But I want you\nI don't mean to, I don't mean to\nI don't mean to, I don't mean to\nBut I love you (It's lost in hope, aye-aye)\n\n[Verse 3]\nEverybody's like \"He's no item\"\n\"Please don't like him\"\n\"He don't wife 'em\"\n\"He one nights 'em\"\nI never listen, no\nI should have figured though\nAll that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal\nBut it was you, so I was with it\nThen tell you the truth, wish we never did it\n'Cause I usually do stick to the business\nBut you came out the blue and then you just flipped it\n(God damn) God damn, baby, my mind's blown\nBe forgettin' you live in a different time zone\nI think I know what this is\nIt's just the time's wrong\nAnd, yeah, I know what you did\nBut, baby, I'm grown\nAnd my love is patient\nAnd kind of shit\nIf this is real we can build\nThrough different types of shit\nIf you was really the realest\nWouldn't be fightin' it\nI think your pride is just\n[Bridge]\nIn the way\nFunny how everything changed\nOnce you got all that you wanted\nNothing was ever the same\n\n[Outro]\nAnd though I don't need you, I don't need you\nI don't need you, I don't need you\nI still want you (Oh)\nI don't mean to, I don't mean to\nI don't mean to, I don't mean to\nBut I, but I love you\nI don't need you, I don't need you\nI don't need you, I don't need you\nBut I want you\nI don't mean to, I don't mean to\nI don't mean to, I

it\" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)\n\"Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what.\u00a0\nIf that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble;\u00a0\nAnd if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances\"\n\"You are just what the doc ordered\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nThey said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot\n[Verse 1]\nBut for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes\nI got a laptop in my back pocket\nMy pen'll go off when I half-cock it\nGot a fat knot from that rap profit\nMade a livin' and a killin' off it\nEver since Bill Clinton was still in office\nWith Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack\nI'm an MC still as honest\nBut as rude and as indecent as all hell\nSyllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)\nThis flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop\nYou don't really wanna get into a pissin' match\nWith this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'\nBackpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack\nAnd at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that\nI'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table\nOver the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half\nOnly realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact\nHow could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs\nFeel my wrath of attack\nRappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad\nIt's actually disastrously bad for the wack\nWhile I'm masterfully constructing this masterpi\u00e8ce\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nLet me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard\nEverybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like \u0399 have got\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nWell, to be truthful the blueprint's\nSimply rage and youthful exuberance\nEverybody loves to root for a nuisance\nHit the Earth like an asteroid\nDid nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)\nMCs get taken to school with this music\n'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\"\nNow I lead a new school full of students\nMe? I'm a product of Rakim\nLakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren\nYella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim\nInspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position\nTo meet Run\u2013D.M.C., and induct them\nInto the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\nEven though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames\nOnly Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame\nOn the wall of shame\nYou fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames\nOff a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?\nLittle gay-lookin' boy\nSo gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)\nYou're witnessin' a mass-occur\nLike you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy\n\"Oy vey, that boy's gay!\"\u2014that's all they say, lookin' boy\nYou get a thumbs up, pat on the back\nAnd a \"way to go\" from your label every day, lookin' boy\nHey, lookin' boy!

Fuck being normal!\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad\nSingin' to a man while he played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, \"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!\"\nLyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)\nUh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\n\"Oh, he's too mainstream.\"\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n\"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,\"\u2014'cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it\n\"I don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use.\"\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!\nUgh, school flunky, pill junkie\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel\nI'ma sleep in the front seat\nBumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\"\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here's what they want from me\nThey're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred\nI have, then you may be a little patient\nAnd more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?\nDon't mistake him for Satan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard\u2014be a king? Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a god?6.7KEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/179197", "artist_names": "Florida Georgia Line", "full_title": "Stay

take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch\nI'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back\nThat's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag\nJust like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it\nLike a magician, critics I turn to crickets\nGot 'em still on the fence whether to picket\nBut quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, \"Stick it!\"\nSo sick, I'm looking pale\u2014wait, that's my pigment\n'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick\nLet's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!\nThe art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren\nAnd I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch\nBeen Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch\n[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]\nKick your shoes off, let your hair down\n(And go berserk) All night long\nGrow your beard out, just weird out\n(And go berserk) All night long\n\n[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]\nWe're gonna rock this house until we knock it down\nSo turn the volume loud\n'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M\nSo, baby, make just like K-Fed\nAnd let yourself go, let yourself go\nSay, \"Fuck it!\" before we kick the bucket\nLife's too short to not go for broke\nSo everybody, everybody (Go berserk)\nGrab your vial, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nGuess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?\nKhakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced\nSo I guess it ain't that aftershave\nOr cologne that made 'em just faint\nPlus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint\nSo if love is a chess game, check mate\nBut girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang\nYes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang\nSo come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang\nPow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow\nGot your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve\nAin't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel\nDumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how\nAt least I know that I don't know\nQuestion is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?\nHope so, now ho\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]\nKick your shoes off, let your hair down\n(And go berserk) All night long\nGrow your beard out, just weird out\n(And go berserk) All night

yourself go, let yourself go\nSay, \"Fuck it!\" before we kick the bucket\nLife's too short to not go for broke\nSo everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)\nGet your vinyls\n\n[Scratch]\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAnd they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam\nAll I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo\nWith the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh\nSorry, yo\u2014we done both set the bar low\nFar as hard drugs are though, that's the past\nBut I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow\nAnd girl, I ain't got no money to borrow\nBut I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note\nOh, Marshall Mathers\nShithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered\nKangol's and Carheartless Cargos\nGirl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke\nDon't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby\nI ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)\nWord, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)\nBut don't get discouraged, girl\nThis is your jam, unless you got toe jam\n[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]\nKick your shoes off, let your hair down\n(And go berserk) All night long\nGrow

Cole]\nThey tell me I should fix my grill \u2018cause I got money now\nI ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it\nA perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how\nMy shit is crooked\u2014look at how far I done got without it!\nI keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real\nWe ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still\nI got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still\nAnd they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell\nLove yourself, girl, or nobody will\nThough you a woman I don't know how you deal\nWith all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels\nI feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you\nYou wake up, put makeup on\nStare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can\u2019t face what\u2019s wrong\nNo need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on\nYour roommate yelling, \"Why you gotta take so long?!\"\nWhat it's like to have a crooked smile\n[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J.

Eyebrows, fingernails, hair\nIs it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care\n\u2018Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see\nThat the hands can\u2019t touch, that them broads can\u2019t be\nAnd that\u2019s you, never let 'em see your frown\nAnd if you need a friend to pick you up, I\u2019ll be around\nAnd we can ride with the windows down, the music loud\nI can tell you ain\u2019t laughed in a while\nBut I wanna see that crooked smile\nYou might also like[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]\nEven though I\u2014\nOn my way, on my way, on my way down\nOn my way, on my way, on my way down\nYou were the one that was tryna keep me way down\nBut like the sun, know you know I find my way back round\n\n[Post-Chorus: J.

ain't nobody watchin'\nBut girl you know I'm watchin'\n\n[Hook]\nDon't lie, you've got it all figured out\nThat smile has got me spinnin' around\nDon't even try actin' like it ain't no thing\nCause I can see you move a little closer, closer\nGirl I gotta get to get to know ya, know ya\nEverything about ya makes me want ya, want ya\nKnow what you're doin baby don't ya, don't ya\n[Verse 2]\nYou've been lookin' over here all night\nAnd When I look, you look away\nOh I love the little games you play\nYea I bet you didn't mean to brush my hand when you walked by me\nLike you didn't mean to drive me crazy\n\n[Hook]\nDon't lie, you've got it all figured out\nThat smile has got me spinnin' around\nDon't even try actin' like it ain't no thing\nCause I can see you move a little closer, closer\nGirl I gotta get to get to know ya, know ya\nEverything about ya makes me want ya, want ya\nKnow what you're doin baby don't ya, don't ya\n\n[Bridge]\nWanna get outta here and let me show ya\nHow good it would feel to hold ya\nPut your pretty little head on my shoulder\nOh yea\n\n[Hook]\nDon't lie, you've got it all figured out\nThat smile has got me spinnin' around\nDon't even try actin' like it ain't no thing\nCause I can see you move a little closer, closer\nGirl I gotta get to get to know ya, know ya\nEverything about ya makes me want ya, want ya\nKnow what you're doin baby
