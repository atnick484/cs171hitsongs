the furnace, she wasn't burnin'\nWent out and hopped in my old Ford\nHit the engine but she ain't turnin'\nWe've given each other some hard lessons lately\nBut we ain't learnin'\nWe're the same sad story, that's a fact\nOne step up and two steps back\n\n[Verse 2]\nBird on a wire outside my motel room\nBut he ain't singin'\nGirl in white outside a church in June\nBut the church bells, they ain't

[001]\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\"The ancient War of the Magi... When its flames at last receded, only the charred husk of a world remained. Even the power of magic was lost... In the thousand years that followed, iron, gunpowder, and steam engines took the place of magic and life slowly returned to the barren land. Yet there now stands one who would reawaken the magic of ages past and use its dreaded power as a means by wfhich to conquer all the world. Could anyone truly be foolish enough to repeat that mistake?\"\n\n\nWedge: \tThere's the city.\nBiggs:\tHard to believe an esper's been found frozen there a thousand years after the War of the Magi.\nBiggs: \tBah! Probably just another wild goose chase.\nWedge:\tI don't know. They wouldn't have let us use her unless they were confident that the information was good.\nBiggs:\tAh, yes...our witch. I hear she fried fifty of our Magitek armored soldiers in three minutes... Kinda makes your skin crawl, don't it?\nWedge: \tRelax. With that thing on her head, she's a mindless puppet. The girl won't even breathe unless we tell her to.\nWedge: \tWe'll approach from the east! Move out!\n[Wedge, Biggs, and Terra make their way toward Narshe.]\n\nWedge:\tThe girl takes point. And don't waste time on the riffraff! Remember what we're here for. Let's move!\n\nGuard:\tImperial Magitek armor!? Not even Narshe is safe anymore!\n\nGuard:\tFor Narshe!\n\nGuard:\tWe've got 'em trapped now!\n\nGuard:\tDefend the mines!\n\n[Wedge, Biggs, and Terra arrive as the Narshe Mines.]\n\nWedge: \tAccording to our source, they unearthed the frozen esper in a new mine shaft they were digging. This must be it.\n\n[The group arrives at a gate blocking their path.]\n\nBiggs: \tI'll handle this. Stand back!\n\nGuard:\tWe're not handing over the esper! Ymir! Get them!\n\n[The group enters into a battle with Ymir.]\n\n\nBiggs:\tHold it! This thing's a...! They must have trained it to guard the mines!\nWedge:\tWhat are you talking about? You know what this is?\nBiggs:\tEver heard of a lightning whelk? It's a monster that absorbs lightning.\nWedge:\t...and stores the energy in its shell!\nBiggs:\tRight. So whatever you do, don't attack the shell!\nWedge:\tGot it!\n[The group defeats Ymir and make their way toward the esper.]\n\n\nBiggs:\tSo...this is the frozen esper?\nWedge: \tThis thing's giving me the creeps. Something's not right...!\nGirl:\t...\n\n[The frozen creature begins emitting an eerie light...]\n\nWedge: \tWh-where's that light coming from!? Uwaaagh!\nBiggs:\tWh-what was that!? ...Wedge? Wedge, where are you? H-hey! What's going on!?\nGirl:\t... ... ...\n\n[The girl awakens inside of a home in Narshe.]\n\n\nGirl:\t  Where...am I?\nOld Man:  My, my! And I just removed the crown!\nGirl:\t  My head...hurts...\nOld Man:  Easy, there! This is a slave crown. The others were using it to  control you. It was robbing you of your thoughts -- making it so   you'd do whatever they told you.\nGirl:\t  I can't remember a thing...\nOld Man:  Don't worry. It'll all come back to you... In time, that is.\nGirl:\t  ...\n\n\"A mysterious young woman, born with the gift of magic, and enslaved by the Gesthalian Empire...\"\n\nGirl:\t  My name is...Terra...\nOld Man:  Impressive! I've never heard of anyone recovering so fast. You must be made of tougher stuff than most...\n\n[Outside, dogs and guards come up to the house where Terra is staying.]\n\nGuard: \t  Open up! We're here for the Magitek armor pilot!\nGuard:\t  Open this door right now, and hand over that girl! She's an agent of  the Empire!\n\nTerra:\t  Empire...? Magitek armor...?\nOld Man:  There's no time to explain! You need to get out of here! These fools  aren't going to listen to reason. This way! Quickly!\nOld Man:  Make your way out of town through the mines! I'll try to buy you some time!\n\n[Terra uses the backdoor of the home to make her escape through the bridge  above the city.]\n\nGuard: \t  Up there!\n\n[Terra enters into the mines, appearing to have escaped their grasp.]\n\nGuard: \t  There she is!\n\n[Terra, now cornered, falls into a hole and passes out, dreaming about her  past.]\n\nKefka:\t  My sweet little magic user... Uwee-hee-hee! With this slave crown, \t  you'll be all mine!\n\n[Flashback shows Terra facing off against Imperial soldiers.]\n\nKefka:\t  Uwee-hee-hee! Good, good! Burn them all to a crisp!\n\n[Flashback scene now switches to the Empire, where a speech is being given.]\n\nGesthal:  Soldiers of the Empire! We stand at the dawn of a new age!\nGesthal:  The lost power of magic has returned to us! We are the chosen ones!\nGesthal:  The time has come for us to claim our rightful dominion over the  world!\nGesthal:  Nothing shall stand in our way!\n\n\"Hurrah!\"\n\"Long live Emperor Gesthal!\"\n\n\n[Flashback scene ends showing a still unconscious Terra. Then goes back to the house of the old man.]\n\n\nOld Man:  Took you long enough! Busy with all that robbing and plundering, I \t  presume?\n\n\n\"A treasure hunter and trail-worn traveler, searching the world over \t for relics of the past...\"\n\nLocke:\t  I prefer the term \"treasure hunting\"!\nOld Man:  Ha! Semantic nonsense!\nLocke:\t  There's a huge difference!\nLocke:\t  Anyway, is there something you need me to do?\nOld Man:  There is indeed. ...I met the girl.\nLocke:\t  ...!? You don't mean...?\nOld Man:  The city guard is pursuing her as we speak. This city has the  strength to stand up to the Empire, but it won't use it. The people   are just too stubbornly independent to join an underground resistance   group like the Returners. I tried to explain that the Empire was   controlling the girl, but they wouldn't even listen...\nLocke:\t  All right... So, you want me to get her out of Narshe?\nOld Man:  That would be the idea. Make your way to Figaro for the time being...\n\n[Locke finds Terra at the spot where she passed out, still unconscious.]\n\nGuard: \t  Now we've got her!\n\nLocke: \t  Wonderful... There's a whole bunch of 'em....\n\nKupo...\n\nLocke: \t  Moogles... Are you saying you want to help?\n\nKupo!!!\n\n\n[Locke and the Moogles battle the guards to protect Terra.]\n\nLocke: \t  Thanks, moogles! We're in your debt!\n\n[Locke makes his escape from the mines with Terra.]\n\n\nLocke:\t  This switch oughta...\n\nLocke:\t  Eh? You back with us now?\nTerra:\t  You... saved me?\nLocke:\t  Save your thanks for the moogles!\nTerra:\t  Ugh... I can't remember a thing... It's like my mind's trapped in a   fog...\nLocke:\t  You lost your memory!?\nTerra:    A man said it would eventually come back...eventually...\nLocke: \t  So, you've got amnesia. Don't worry! I won't leave your side until\t  until your memory returns!\nTerra: \t  ...?\nLocke:\t  I'm not gonna up and abandon someone just because they lost their  memory! I'll keep you safe! I promise!\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFigaro Castle [002]\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nHalt! ...Oh, it's you. Proceed.\n\nKing: \t  You mean, this young woman is...?\nTerra:\t  Who are you?\nKing:\t  Oh...my apologies!\nKing:\t  How rude of me to turn my back to a lady on our very first meeting!\n\n\n\"The young king of Figaro Castle, Imperial ally, and champion of the\t technological revolution...\"\n\n\nEdgar:\t  I am Edgar, the king of Figaro.\nLocke: \t  Heh... Surprised that someone like me knows a king?\nLocke: \t  Well, I'll catch you two later!\nEdgar:\t  So, you're an Imperial soldier, right? Don't worry. Figaro and the \t  Empire are allies. Feel free to rest here for as long as you'd like.\t  It's not in my blood to harm a lady!\nTerra:\t  Why are you being so kind to me? Is it because of my...abilities?\nEdgar:\t  I'll give you three reasons. First of all, your beauty has captivated  me! Second...I'm dying to know if I'm your type! I guess your...  abilities...would rank a distant third.\nTerra:\t  ...? What's the matter?\nEdgar:\t  Guess my technique's getting a bit rusty...\nTerra: \t  Hmm... I suppose a normal girl would have felt something from those words. But...not me...\n\n[Terra explores Figaro Castle, eventually running into the High Priestess.]\n\nH.Priestess:   Edgar has a twin brother, you know. He was such a nice boy,      always thinking of his family...\n\n[Flashback scene occurs with Edgar sitting at a table.]\n\nYouth:\t  Edgar, what's wrong with Dad? Why's everyone talking about a  successor?\nEdgar:\t  Are you blind? Haven't you see how thin his face has become?\nYouth:\t  ...? ...What do you mean?\nYouth:\t  Edgar!\nYouth:\t  Are you...crying?\n\n\"Edgar's twin brother, who traded the throne for his own freedom...\"\n\nH.Priestess:   Ah, yes...Sabin. I'm sure he's a fine young man by now. He was just a boy when he left -- even smaller than his brother. I often wonder where he is now, and what he's doing...\n\n[Terra goes back to the throne room to find Edgar.]\n\nEdgar:\t  Well? How do you like my castle?\n\nKing Edgar! There's someone from the Empire to you see you, sire!\n\nEdgar: Kefka, no doubt!\n\n[Kefka is seen crossing the desert with two Imperial soldiers.]\n\nKefka:\t  Phooey! Emperor Gesthal's stupid orders!\nKefka:\t  Edgar, you pinhead! Why do you have to live out in the middle of a  stinking desert? These recon jobs are the pits!\nKefka:\t  Ahem! There's SAND on my boots!\nSoldiers: All gone, sir!\nKefka:\t  How pathetic!\n\nSir Kefka!? What in the world brings you--\n\nKefka:\t  Out of my way!\n\n[Edgar arrives to meet Kefka and the Imperial troops.]\n\n\nEdgar:\t  You wouldn't be thinking of invading my kingdom next, would you? We  have an alliance...\nSoldier:  An alliance? With this miserable sandpit? Don't make laugh!\nEdgar:\t  I hear you've been busy down south, taking over a country or three!  Just what is the Empire up to?\nSoldier:  That's none of your concern.\nEdgar:\t  What brings Emperor Gesthal's own court mage, Kefka, to my humble \t  castle?\nKefka:\t  A girl of no importance recently escaped from us. We heard she found\t  refuge here.\nEdgar:\t  This wouldn't have to do with that \"witch\" everyone's been whispering  about, would it?\nKefka:\t  Lies! She merely stole something of minor value! Is she here?\nEdgar:\t  That's a tough one...\nEdgar:\t  There are more girls in here than grains of sand in the desert. A man  couldn't possibly keep track of them all!\nKefka:\t  Oh, Edgar... You know you only stand to lose from trying to hide her\t  from us! Hee-hee-hee...\nKefka:\t  I truly hope nothing happens to your precious Figaro!\n\n[Kefka leaves and Edgar heads back to the throne room, running into Locke along the way.]\n\n\nLocke:\t  I didn't like the sound of that...\nEdgar:\t  Where's Terra?\nEdgar:\t  Take her to her room...\nEdgar:\t  I'd love to stay and chat, but the chancellor and I need to do some\t planning now. Being a king's not all tea and crumpets. If you'll  excuse me...\n\n[Edgar leaves and Locke leads Terra to her room.]\n\nLocke:\t  Follow me.\nLocke:\t  Sorry, I didn't mean to drag you around like this without giving you  a chance to rest. I'm--\nTerra:\t  Locke, right? ...Edgar told me about you. Is it true that you're a\t  thief?\nLocke:\t  I'm a TREASURE HUNTER!\nLocke:\t  On the surface, Edgar pretends to support the Empire. Truth is, he's\t  collaborating with an underground resistance group called the \t  Returners. I serve as their go-between.\nLocke:\t  The old man you met in Narshe is one of us, too.\nTerra:\t  The Empire... But, I'm an Imperial soldier!\nLocke:\t  Not anymore. They were using you. That's all! Things are different\t  now.\nTerra:\t  It's just... I don't know what I should do. Whenever I try to think,\t  it just makes my head hurt even worse...\nLocke:\t  All that matters is that you make your own decisions from now on. You don't have to think too hard right now. You'll know what you want to do when the time comes.\nTerra:\t  But how will I know which choice is right...?\n\n[The scene switches to Edgar, who is awakened by something...]\n\n\nEdgar: \t  ...? What in the--\nEdgar:\t  What's going on?\nSoldier:  It's the Empire! Kefka, he--\n\n[Kefka enters into the scene, with Figaro castle burning in flames.]\n\n\nEdgar:\t  What do you think you're doing!?\nKefka:\t  Bring me the girl. Now!\nEdgar:\t  I have no idea what you're talking about!\nKefka:\t  Oh? Then...enjoy the barbecue! Hee-hee-hee!\n\n[Edgar goes to talk to a soldier.]\n\nEdgar:\t  Get her ready...\nSoldier:  Yes, sire!\n\nKefka:\t  Had a change of heart?\nEdgar:\t  It seems I have no choice...\n\n\n[Edgar leaps off of the castle onto some chocobos below.]\n\n\nEdgar:\t  ...Or perhaps I do!\nKefka:\t  Oh, my! The brave and noble king abandons his people to save his own  skin! How utterly delightful! Hee-hee-hee!\nEdgar:\t  Jump!\n\n\n[Terra and Locke, waiting at a crossing on the castle roof, leap onto the other chocobos.]\n\nEdgar:\t  All right! Sink her into the sand!\nLocke:\t  Yahoo!\n\n\n[The Figaro soldiers begin to sink the castle into the sand.]\n\n\nSoldier:  Figaro Dive Mode engaged!\n\nChancellor:  Witness the glory of Figaro!\n\nKefka:\t  Go! KILL THEM!!!\n\n\n[Two Magitek Armors come chasing after the group and a battle ensues.]\n\n\nLocke:\t  What's the matter, Edgar? What made you jump like that all of a  sudden?\nEdgar:\t  D-d-did y-y-you just see what I saw? You did, right? Right!?\nLocke:    Yeah, this kid's really something, huh?\nEdgar:\t  REally...something!? That was magic! MA-GIC!\nLocke:\t  M-M-M-M-MAGIC!? She used magic!?\n*whisper, whisper*...*whisper, whisper*\nEdgar:\t  Terra...Your name was Terra, right? What...what exactly was that just  now?\nTerra:\t  I'm sorry, I...\nLocke:\t  No, we should be apologizing. I didn't mean to make such a big deal  out of it.\nEdgar:\t  Nor did I, it just...surprised me. I mean I've never actually seen  magic before! Where did you...?\nTerra:\t  ...\nLocke:\t  It doesn't matter, does it, Edgar? Terra can use magic and we can't.  That's all there is to it. The fact is...her magic could really help us right now.\nTerra:\t  Thank you, Locke! Thank you, Edgar!\n\nAhhh...\n\nEdgar:\t  Bravo, Figaro!\n\nKefka:\t  Son of a submariner! You'll pay for this!\n\n[Terra, Locke, and Edgar continue forward through the desert.]\n\nLocke:\t  That was great!\nTerra:\t  Were those bad people? I...I'm scared...\nEdgar:\t  Terra, there's someone we'd like you to meet...\nLocke:\t  Like I told you before, we're members of the Returners...\nEdgar:\t  Would you be willing to meet our leader? Magic is going to be the key  to winning this war.\nTerra:\t  Magic...\nEdgar:\t  That esper reacted to your magical powers. There's got to be a   relationship...\nTerra:\t  I don't know any more than you do. These powers just come naturally  to me.\nEdgar:\t  But no human is born with the powers you have!\nEdgar:\t  Forgive me.\nTerra:\t  ...What should I do?\nEdgar:\t  The Empire will be coming after us. They want your powers for their  own. And if they get them, the world is done for. Terra, you want to  understand your own powers, don't you?\nEdgar:\t  Then I think you should meet with Banon. He may be able to help you  find out more about why you have them.\nTerra:\t  ...\nLocke:\t  Please... Edgar's right.\nEdgar:\t  There's a cave just south of here that leads to South Figaro. Let's  head in that direction.\n\n[Edgar, Terra, and Locke head toward South Figaro.]\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nSouth Figaro Cave [003]\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nSoldier:  King Edgar! Where are you headed, sire?\nEdgar:\t  Through the cave, and eastward to South Figaro. We'll then make for  the Returner headquarters in the north. Return to the castle and pass  the word along.\nSoldier:  Understood, sire! Take care!\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nSouth Figaro [004]\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n[The group arrives in South Figaro, encountering a strange individual.]\n\n...\n\nLocke: \t  Right, ignore us and maybe we'll just disappear...\nEdgar:\t  Back off, Locke. That guy looks familiar... Yeah, that's him, all   right...\n\n\n\"He comes and goes like the wind, swearing allegiance to no one. Hidden\t behind his wintry gaze lies a face known to none who live...\"\n\n\nEdgar:\t  That's Shadow... He's an assassin. He'd kill his own best friend for  the right price...\nLocke:\t  Guess we'd better steer clear of him.\nShadow:\t  Leave us. The dog eats strangers...\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nDuncan's House [005]\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEdgar:\t  Hmm...? What's that smell...?\nEdgar:\t  These flowers... He always liked these...\nEdgar:\t  These dishes... They're just like the ones he always used!\nEdgar:\t  This tea... It was his favorite.\nEdgar:\t  Could Sabin be living here?\n\nEdgar:\t  Hey...\nEdgar:\t  Do you happen to know where I could find the man who lives here?\nMan:\t  Sure do! Left a couple of days ago, soon as he heard Master Duncan  had been killed. Headed up into the mountains! They say Duncan's son\t  Vargas is missing, too... I don't like it one bit!\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nMt. Kolts [006]\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nVargas:   Sabin sent you, didn't he?\nLocke:\t  Who're you?\nEdgar:\t  Sabin? Is he here?\nLocke:\t  You were the one sneaking around us the whole way up here, weren't\t  you?\nVargas:\t  And if I was?\nVargas:\t  Hmph. Well, it doesn't really matter who you are. I've got no plans  to surrender. Woe is the day you met me...it'll be the last of your  lives!\n\n[Party enters battle with Vargas.]\n\nVargas:   come on! What's the matter?\nVargas:   Enough of this! I'll send you to the great beyond!\n\nThat's enough, Vargas!\n\nVargas:\t  Ah, if it isn't Sabin!\nSabin:\t  Why, Vargas? Why did you kill Master Duncan? How could you kill your  own father!?\nVargas:   The fool snubbed me, his only son! He chose you as his successor!\nSabin:\t  That's not true! Our master--\nVargas:\t  It's true and you know it! It's written in that ugly sneer across   your face!\nSabin:    He wanted you to be his successor, not me! He knew you had the most  potential...\nVargas:\t  I'm sick of listening to your lies! I've got far more than just  potential! Why don't you see for yourself?\n\nBlizzard Fist!\n\nVargas:\t  Ah, Sabin! My father was right to see so much in you!\nSabin:\t  I guess there's no avoiding this...\nVargas:   Fate made us train together, and now fate will send you to your doom!\nVargas:   Now... Get ready to join your beloved master!\n\nVargas:\t  Uaaagh! You...already learned...that technique!?\nSabin:\t  Vargas... If only you hadn't been so consumed by pride...\n\n[Sabin defeats Vargas.]\n\n\nEdgar:\t  Sabin!\nSabin:\t  Brother?\nLocke:\t  ...Brother? You're his twin brother!?\nTerra:    His...brother? At first, I thought you were another one of Vargas's  bears...\nSabin:\t  You thought I was a...bear?\nSabin:\t  I guess I'll, uh...take that as a compliment!\nSabin:\t  Anyway... Edgar, what are you doing here?\nEdgar:\t  We're on our way to the Sabre Mountains.\nSabin:\t  To the Returner hideout, no doubt?\nSabin:\t  So, the wheels are finally turning... I've been watching from a  distance, hoping the world would come to its senses. The way things   were going, I was afraid Figaro would end up as a puppet state.\nEdgar:\t  A means of striking back has presented itself. There will be no more  playing lapdog to the Empire... I'm through with that act.\nSabin:\t  Think a \"bear\" like me could be of any help?\nEdgar:\t  You'd join us? Sabin...!\nSabin:\t  I think Duncan would rest easier knowing his training helped bring  peace to the world.\nLocke: \t  Well then, let's get going!\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nReturner Hideout [007]\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nKing Edgar! This way, please!\n\nEdgar:\t  Banon! We brought her with us.\nBanon:\t  So, this is the girl... The one whom the esper responded.\nTerra:\t  Esper...?\nEdgar:\t  It seems the Empire had complete control over her.\nBanon:    Carrier pigeons have kept me informed. I also heard that she wipedout fifty Imperial soldiers in mere minutes...\nTerra:\t  No, that's not...!\nLocke:\t  Terra!\nEdgar:\t  For heaven's sake, Banon! This girl doesn't remember anything!\nBanon:\t  Hiding from the truth won't change it!\nBanon:    Perhaps you've heard this story before? Once, when people were still pure and innocent, there was a box they were told never to open. But someone went and opened it anyway, unleashing all the evils of the world. Pride...envy...greed...wrath...gluttony... The only thing\nthat remained in the box was a single ray of light: hope.\nTerra:\t  ...\nBanon:\t  Your power is a gift, not a curse. No matter what happens, you must remember that. You are this world's last ray of light...our final hope.\nEdgar:\t  Banon!\nBanon:\t  I've grown weary with the hour... Allow me to rest for a while.\n\n[Banon leaves, and Locke and Terra converse in another room.]\n\nLocke:\t  The Empire stole someone important from me. I've hated it ever since. If no one stands up to the Empire, more people will be left like me. That's why I joined the Returners.\nTerra:\t  But, there's no one important in my life. I have no family...no friends...\nLocke:\t  That's not true! And besides, I'm sure there are people who feel you're important to them. Those people are counting on you, too...\n\n[Terra leaves the room to find Banon.]\n\nSabin: \t  I don't know what to tell you... But I do know that I trust my brother completely. He's always thought of my needs before his own, ever since we were little. I think you should trust him, too. But don't tell him I said that! He'll turn as red as a tomato!\n\nEdgar:\t  It's not easy asking so much of you... And if we force our ideas on you, we're no different than the Empire. So...we want you to decide for yourself.\n\nBanon? He went outside just a moment ago.\n\nBanon: \t  Have you made your decision? Will you become our last ray of hope?\nTerra:\t  Yes.\nBanon:\t  Really? You will?\nTerra:\t  But... I'm scared...\nBanon:\t  The uncertainty you're feeling is only natural.\nBanon:\t  Terra... I want you to have this.\nTerra:\t  What is it?\nBanon:\t  A charm to help you keep safe. Take it!\nBanon:\t  I have a plan. Would you please gather everyone together?\n\n\n[Everyone gathers around the table to hear Banon's plan.]\n\n\nBanon: \t  Well then...\nBanon:    We all know that the Gesthalian Empire is using its Magitek power to wage war. The question is, where did they get that power?\nEdgar:\t  I had Locke dig around for information. It seems the Empire has been gathering scholars from around the world to study espers.\nLocke:\t  Narshe's esper was also the reason for the Imperial assault there.\nTerra:\t  Are you saying there's some kind of connection between espers and Magitek?\nBanon:\t  Espers and Magitek... Only one possible link comes to mind.\nEdgar:\t  You don't mean...\nBanon:    The War of the Magi.\n\"No!\"\n\"That's impossible...!\"\nLocke:\t  My grandma used to tell me bedtime stories about magical machines... ...Those stories were true?\nEdgar:\t  You're saying we're on the verge of a second War of the Magi?\nBanon:\t  It's only a guess. The war took place a thousand years ago, and every historian has a different theory. But one theory says that energy drained from espers was used to power machines...and that ordinary humans were also infused with the same energy.\nTerra:\t  So that's what Magitek power is...\nEdgar:\t  If we're going to fight Magitek enemies, we need Magitek weapons of our own.\nBanon:\t No! That would bring about another War of the Magi!\nEdgar:\t  Then what do you propose?\nBanon:\t  I was wondering if we might able to have a chat with an esper...\nEdgar:\t  ...With an esper!?\nBanon:\t  It's risky, but that esper reacted to Terra before... If we could get it to react to her again, we might just be able to wake it up.\nEdgar:\t  Do you really think that would work?\nBanon:\t  I can't say for sure, but I believe it's our best shot... Of course, we can't do anything without Terra's help.\nLocke:\t  Terra...\nTerra:\t  I'll do it.\nSabin:\t  I'm not entirely sure I understand the plan...but what the hey! This sounds like it'll be fun!\n\n[Sound heard from the entrance.]\n\nBanon:\t  What was that? That noise just now...?\nSoldier: Banon, sir...! S-South...Figaro...\nBanon:\t  What's wrong? What's happened!?\nSoldier:Th-the Empire's...t-taken South Figaro... They're headed...this way..\nBanon:\t  So they've found us... We haven't a moment to lose!\nEdgar:\t  Locke!\nLocke:\t  I know... \"Someone\" has to sneak into South Figaro to slow down the enemy, right?\nEdgar:\t  This is right up your alley. We're counting on you.\nLocke:\t  Terra... Wait for me... I won't be gone long. ...And watch out for a certain lecherous young king who shall remain nameless. The guy moves in like a hawk!\nEdgar:\t  Locke!\nSabin:\t  Edgar... Old habits die hard, eh?\nBanon:\t  What about us?\nEdgar: We can escape down the Lethe River and make our way to Narshe. I'm curious about that esper they found in the mines...\nBanon:\t  Very well. I'll ready the raft by the back entrance. It's risky, but we don't have much of a choice at this point.\nEdgar:\t  It's not safe here. Come with us to Narshe... It could be a chance for you to gain a better understanding of your abilities.\nBanon:\t  We've no time to dilly-dally. Let's make for Narshe!\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nLete River [008]\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nHere we go! This raft will carry us to Narshe!\n\n[The party whilst rafting down the river runs into an octopus.]\n\nHey, what've we got here?\n\nUltros:\t  Gwee-hee-hee... You're up the creek without a paddle. And I'm not gonna let you through! ...Does that make me a bad octopus?\nUltros:\t  Oh, that one's a tasty morsel! I'd love to get my tentacles around her... *sluuuuuurup*!\nUltros:\t  Oh, that one's a tasty morsel! I'd love to get my tentacles around her... *sluuuuuurup*!\nUltros: Yeowch! Seafood soup!\nUltros:\t  Muscle-heads? Hate 'em!\n\nSabin:\t  I guess it got the point...?\nEdgar:I wouldn't bet on it...It's probably just hiding down there.\nTerra:\t  Ewww!!! Something's stuck to my leg!\nEdgar:\t  Terra! Get away from there!\nBanon:\t  We should be all right now.\nSabin:\t  Eight-armed freak... I'm gonna smash it with a blitz!\nEdgar:\t  No! Sabin!!!\nSabin:\t  Out of my way, Edgar!\n\n\n[Sabin jumps into the river after Ultros.]\n\n\nEdgar:\t  Well, he's always been a bit rash...\nTerra:\t  Sabin...\nBanon:\t  Oh, he'll be fine!\nEdgar:\t  Are you sure, Banon? ...Sir?\nBanon:\t  You're his brother! You should know better than any of us. Any second now he'll flop back up onto the raft, right as rain!\n\n[Sabin shoots up out of the river, but way over the raft.]\n\nSabin: \t  Waaaaaa!\nBanon:\t  ... ...\nEdgar:\t  Think he missed the \"onto the raft\" part. Ha-ha...\nTerra:\t  Sabin!!!\nEdgar:\t  Sabin! You're on your own now!\n\nSabin!\n\nMog: \"Edgar and Terra race toward Narshe while protecting Banon...

Everyone's saying that the Empire had Dad poisoned...and the only thing any of you can think about is who'll\tbe the next king! No one's even sad!\nSabin:\t   None of you probably cared when Mom died after we were born, either.\nPriestess: That's not--\nSabin:\t   You're just as bad as the rest of them!\nEdgar:\t   Sabin...\nSabin: Empire of murderers...! They won't get away with this!\nEdgar:\t   Priestess... Leave us.\n\nSabin:\t   Let's leave this place! Let's forget this crazy kingdom, and live  our lives how we want to!\nSabin:\t   You said you didn't want to be a king, right?\nEdgar:\t   A life of freedom, huh...?\nEdgar:\t   ...What do you think would happen to Figaro if both of us left?   There'd be no one to take the throne. Dad was counting on us to take\t   care of the kingdom...\nEdgar:\t   Sabin... Let's settle this with the toss of a coin. Dad gave me this   one.\nEdgar:\t   If it's heads, you win. Tails, I win. The winner chooses whichever  path he wants...no regrets, not hard feelings. Okay?\nEdgar:\t   Here we go...!\n\nEdgar:\t   And...you chose your freedom.\nEdgar:\t   It's already been ten years... That little shrimp has grown into a\t   whopping lobster!\nSabin:\t   And you're a king crab!\nEdgar:\t   Sabin... Do you think Dad would be proud of me?\nSabin:\t   Don't you ever doubt that! I'm sure he's beaming with pride,   wherever he is.\nEdgar:     Ten years...\nSabin:\t   Where has the time gone...?\nEdgar: \t   Here's to a couple of confused grownups!

I couldn't protect her...\n\nRachel:    Locke! What are we off to find today?\nLocke:\t   It's almost your...\nLocke:\t   There's supposed to be an amazing treasure hidden somewhere in this   mountain. We're gonna find it!\nRachel:\t   Locke! Look out!\nLocke:\t   RACHEL!!!\n\nLocke:\t   Rachel! Are you awake?\nRachel:\t   ... ...? I... I can't remember anything...\n\nFather:\t   Get out of my house! It's your fault Rachel lost her memory!\nLocke:\t   Wait! Just let me talk to her...!\nRachel:\t   Please, just go away! I don't know who you are, but my parents get  upset whenever you come here!\n\nRachel would be better off without you hanging around, Locke. She's   going to have to make a start of it. With you here, she can't even\t   do that...\n\n\n[Flashback ends.]\n\n\nLocke:\t   A year went by... When I finally returned, I found out that Rachel   had been killed in an Imperial attack. Her memory had returned just  before she died. The last thing she said was...my name. I never  should have left her side. I... I failed her...\n\n\n[The group enters into another house, with a dead Rachel in the basement.]\n\n\nOh, Locke! It's been a while! Ages even!\nOh, that? Worry not, worry not! Your treasure's quite safe! Hee-hee\t   hee...\n\nIt's a good thing I'd just happened to have finished that herbal concoction back then! Now she'll never age a day!   Hee-hee-hee... Had to use my herbs, I did! Couldn't very well refuse with you begging me like that...\n\n\n[Flashback sequence occurs.]\n\n\nLocke:\t   Rachel...\nLocke:\t   You're sure the stuff will work?\nOf course, of course! The love of your life will sleep here just\t   like this forever...and ever...and ever! Hee-hee-hee...\nLocke:\t   If there were a way to...call her spirit back...\nA way to call her back, eh? ...You mean like that legendary\t   treasure? Hee-hee-hee... Oh yes, I suppose if you had that...you  might be able to bring her around! Gwee-hee-hee-hee!\n\n\n[Another flashback ends.]\n\n\nLocke:\t   I...failed her...\n\nCeles:\t   Locke...\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nZozo [022]\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nWhat brings you here on this fine day? Do you need to get through   here? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be in your way!\nI'm not very strong in a fight and I'd hate for there to be any\t  trouble, so why don't I just let you pass?\n\n\n[The party enters into battle with a strange man.]\n\n\nTerra:\t  Uhrrr... Grrr...\nTerra?\nTerra?\nRamuh:\t  She's frightened.\nWho are you?\nRamuh:\t  This girl is you friend, I presume?\nTerra... Is she all right?\nRamuh:\t  So, her name is Terra... ...Terra, you say? Interesting...!\n\n\n[Terra starts going crazy again.]\n\n\nRamuh:\t  Her life is in no danger. She simply used a power she didn't know she  had, and it overwhelmed her. Now her body won't listen to what she's       telling it to do. As for myself, I am Ramuh -- the esper, Ramuh.\nYou're an esper!?\t  Don't espers live in another world?\nRamuh:\t  That doesn't mean there's anything stopping us from living in this\t  one. Espers come in a variety of forms. My appearance is similar to\t  your own, so I can live here as one of you without fear of anyone\t  discovering the truth.\nWhy hide the fact that you're an esper?\nRamuh:\t  Humans and espers are incompatible creatures.\nLocke:\t  But my grandma told me that humans and espers once lived side by      side... Of course, that was only a bedtime story...\nRamuh:\t  No, that was no fairy tale. That was the truth. Humans and espers  used to live together in harmony. At least...until the War of the\t  Magi.\nUntil the War of the Magi...?\nRamuh:\t  It took place long ago... Espers fought humans who had been infused\t  with magical powers extracted from other espers.\n\n\n[A flashback scene occurs.]\n\n\nRamuh:\t  After the meaningless war had ended, the espers fashioned a new \t  realm to which they exiled themselves. They feared that if they remained it would only be a matter of time before their powers were  targeted again. But then one day, about twenty years ago, humans   stumbled upon the entrance to that hidden realm... Humans who knew\t  of espers and the secrets of our powers. And thus began the hunt.\t  For Gesthal, the leader of the men, knew that he could use the powers  \t extracted from us to create an invincible army. As soon as we  realized what was happening, we erected a massive gate and forced\t  humans out.\n\n\n[Flashback scenes end.]\n\n\nRamuh:\t  Those who were captured are now in the Empire's Magitek Research        Facility, being drained of their powers. I narrowly escaped that same  fate, and now I am here with you.\n\n\n[Locke puts Terra back into the bed.]\n\n\nRamuh:\t  She seems to have calmed down a bit...\nRamuh:\t  I called Terra here to me when I sensed that she had lost control.  She responded to that call.\nSo Terra's...an esper?\nRamuh:\t  No, she's a bit different from us...\nShe looks like she's in pain...\nRamuh:\tShe is afraid of what she is, and that is a painful thing.\nWhat can we do to help her?\nRamuh:\t  Once she understands her true nature, the fear and doubt should  subside.\nIs there nothing we can do?\nRamuh:\t  The others of my kind who are trapped in Gesthal's Magitek Research. Facility may be able to help her.\nAnd if we can get inside that facility, you're sure we'll find them?\nCeles:\t  ...The Magitek Research Facility? Your people are in there?\nRamuh:\t  I escaped alone, abandoning my friends and hiding here like a coward.  But I fear that I can remain here no longer.\nWhat do you mean?\nRamuh:\t  Gesthal's methods are mistaken. You can't drain an esper's powers by  force -- that weakens them. Only when we become magicite can our\t  powers be transferred in full.\nWhat are you saying?\nRamuh:\t  I am going to turn myself into magicite so that I may lend you my  strength.\nMagicite...?\nRamuh:\t  Magicite is an esper's power in its purest form. When an esper dies, magicite is all that is left behind...  But...!\n\n\n[Espers turned into magicite fall from the ceiling.]\n\n\nRamuh:\t  These are my companions who fell as we fled the Empire... And I will  give you my power as well...\n\n\n[Ramuh turns himself into magicite.]\n\n\nOld man... You're really gone, aren't you...?\nHe turned himself to magicite... He gave up his life to help us...  Why would you do such a thing?\n\nRamuh:\t   If our power is used for destruction, the skies will darken and life   will fade from the earth... You must stop them. There must not be a   second War of the Magi...\n\nTerra...wait for us. We'll be back for you!\n\n\n[The party gets ready to leave, but the others from Narshe have arrived.]\nEveryone's here? I was just thinking...\nEdgar: \t   Let's talk on the way back down!\n\nEdgar:\t   So, the Empire's been draining magic from espers...\nSabin:\t   Celes, was all of that true?\nCeles:\t   I was alseep when they performed my infusion, I don't know for sure.\t   But...I've heard rumors to that effect.\nCyan:\t   Then I suppose we must find a way to slip into the Empire...\nEdgar:\t   We'd best split up again. We still need to beef our defenses in    Narshe.\nCyan:\t   That would indeed be wise.\nCeles:\t   I'll go to the Empire. I know it inside and out.\nSabin:\t   But alone...?\nLocke:\t   Don't worry. I'll go with her.\nCeles:\t   Locke!\nCyan:\t   It may not hurt to have a few more people along.\n\nLocke:\t   Wait for us back in Narshe. Don't worry, we'll be fine! If we need   to change party members, I guess we'll just head back to Narshe...\nCeles:\t   So...how are we going to get there? The Empire's on the southern   continent... They've closed down all the harbors, so there aren't    even any ships sailing there anymore.\nLocke:\t   The town of Jidoor is to the south is full of wealthy aristocrats...\t   One of them might know a way in. \"Where there's a gil...\"\nCeles:\t   Locke.\nLocke:\t   Yeah?\nCeles:\t   Why are you coming with me?\nLocke:\t   Hmm? Well...there's the rumor about that legendary treasure being\t   there and all... I just wanted to have a look around.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nJidoor [023]\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nImpresario:  Maria!?\nCeles:\t     ...M-me?\nImpresario:  Sorry, I mistook you for someone else. Wow, you could pass for    Maria in a heartbeat! ...Oh dear, we're really in trouble this     time...\nCeles looks like Maria...?\nThat man must've dropped this...\nMaestro:     That man is the director of the troupe that performs at the opera\t     house. Everyone just calls him \"Impresario.\" He's been in a tizzy     ever since that letter arrived.\n\n\"Dearest Maria,\nI've decided to take you as my wife, so I'll be coming to kidnap    you.\nThe Wandering Gamble\"\n\nLocke:\t     Who's this \"Wandering What's-His-Face\"?\nMaestro:     Were you born on a farm, son?\n\n\n\"A gambling vagabond who finds freedom from society's narrow views of morality aboard his airship, the Blackjack...\"\n\n\nMaestro: That would be Setzer, owner of the world's only airship!\nCeles:\t     If we had that airship, we'd have our way into the Empire...\nLocke:\t     Let's set up a meeting with this Setzer.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nOpera House [024]\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nImpresario:  Ah! It's you again!\nLocke:\t     We read that letter. So, Setzer is coming to snatch Maria away...\nImpresario:  He'll probably appear rihgt at the climax of the first act. He     loves to make an entrance... *sigh*...\nLocke:\t     All right! When he shows up, we'll jump out and nab him!\nImpresario:  Dear me, no! You'll ruin the performance! I'll lose my job!\nCeles:\t     But if you don't do anything...!\nImpresario:  Oh, this is simply horrible! I want the performance to be success...but I don't want Maria to be abducted!\nLocke:\t     Let him grab her.\nLocke:\t     We'll use a decoy. Once he's got her, we'll follow him right back    to his airship. And if all goes well, we should be able to     commandeer it!\nImpresario:  Are you mad!? If anything should happen to Maria...\nLocke:\t     That's why we use the decoy! We can hide Maria someplace safe!\nImpresario:  Come again?\nLocke:\t     You said Celes looks like Maria, right?\nCeles:\t     Now just a minute...\nLocke:\t     She can our Maria! We'll let Setzer kidnap her and lead us to his    airship!\nImpresario:  Brilliant!\nCeles:\t     H-hold on here! I'm a former general, not some opera floozy!\n\n\n[Celes rushes into the room just ahead, where singing can be heard.]\n\n\nMi... Mi...\nDo, re, mi...\nFaaa...*hack* *cough*...\nMaaa...riii...aaaaaa!\nLocke:\t     That's the spirit!\n\nUltros:\t     Mwa-ha-ha! I gots my own little surprise planned for y'all, just\t     like Setzer! It'll be TONS of fun!\n\n\n[Ultros throws a letter just behind the group.]\n\n\nLocke:\t     Better get to work! We've gotta make a star out of you, Celes!\n\nUltros:\t     Gaaaah! Isn't anyone gonna read it!?\n\n\n[The group sits down to watch the beginning of the opera.]\n\n\nThe war between the East and the West was growing ever more     violent by the day... Draco, a soldier from the West, thinks of\t     his love, Maria, back at home...\n\n\n\"O Maria!\nO Maria!\nMy beloved, do you hear\nMy words whispered in your ear\nAs if I were by your side?\"\n\n\nLocke:   I'm going to go check on things in the dressing room.\nImpresario:  Oh, I hope this works...\n\n\n[Locke goes to check up on Celes.]\n\n\nLocke:\t     Have you...always been that pretty?\nCeles:\t  Locke... Why did you stand up for me when you did?\nLocke:\t     ...Because I'm tired of standing by and doing nothing while I lose     the girls I like.\nCeles:\t     Am I just a replacement...for her?\nLocke:\t     ...That ribbon looks nice on you.\nCeles:\t     I have to go on stage soon. This next scene's an important one.\n\nMaria starts to worry that something's happened to Draco, and     pours her feelings into song.\n\nLocke:\t     Shouldn't you check the score one last time?\n\nThe Western armies were defeated, and Maria's castle fell into\t     the hands of the East. Forced to wed the Eastern Prince Ralse,   Maria still thinks only Draco as she gazes at the stars each \t     night...\n\n\"O my hero, my beloved,\nShall we still be made to part,\nThough promises of perennial love\nYet sing here in my heart?\nI'm the darkness,\nYou're the starlight\nShining brightly from afar.\nThrough hours of despair,\nI offer this prayer\nTo you, my evening star.\nMust my final vows exchanged\nBe with him and not you?\nWere you only here\nTo quiet my fear...\nO speak!

He'll help      you get up there!\nLocke:\t        Leave it to us!\n\n\n[The group goes to see the stagehand.]\n\n\nStagehand:\tThe impresario sent you? You need to get up to the catwalk!

Oh, rats!\n\n\n[Ultros and the party fall onto the middle of the stage.]\n\n\nImpresario:\tOh no, this'll never do! With those two flattened, there's no        one to win the girl! How can the story possibly continue!?\nLocke:\t        Neither Draco nor Ralse will win Celes's hand!\nLocke:\t        It is I, Locke, the world's premier adventurer, who shall take        her as my wife!\nImpresario:\tOh, dear...

Just as we think Maria is to       become Locke's new bride, she's dragged off by Setzer instead!\tWhat fate lies in store for her now? Be sure to come back and       see Part Two!\n\n\n[Scene switches to Setzer's ship.]\n\n\nSetzer:\tDon't worry, I'll give you plenty of attention later.\n\nLocke:  What a performance! You're a great fake actress, Celes.\nCeles:\t        Enough!\nLocke:\t     But the real show starts now. It's time for Act Two!\nLocke:\t\tWhere's Setzer?\nCeles:\t\tHe should be right back.\n\nSetzer:\tWh-what are you doing here? Y-you're not Maria, are you!?\nCeles:\t\tSetzer, we need your help. We need to get to Vector. Your ship is the only--\nSetzer:\tIf you're not Maria, then we have nothing to talk about.\nCeles:\tWait! We heard that your ship is the finest vessel in the world\nLocke:\tAnd that you were the world's greatest gambler...\nEdgar:\tI'm the king of Figaro. If you help us, you'll be well       rewarded...\nSetzer:\t\tCome with me.\nCeles:\t\tThen you'll...?\nSetzer:\tDon't misunderstand. I still haven't said I'll help you.\n\n\n[The group goes with Setzer to a different part of the airship.]\n\n\nSetzer:\t\tHmm... Business has been awfully slow lately, thanks to the Empire...\nCeles:\t\tYou're not the only one suffering. The Empire has been toppling\ttowns and villages left and right...\nLocke:\t\tThey're abusing their Magitek power and trying to take over\tthe world.\nEdgar:\t\tMy kingdom was allied with the Empire...until recently.\nSabin:\t\tMaybe you want to be a slave to the Empire, but I sure don't.\nSetzer:\t\t...Hmm.\nCeles:\t\tWe're at least together in hating the Empire, right? So, \tplease...\nSetzer:\t\tYou know, I think you may be even cuter than Maria.\nCeles:\t\tHuh?\nSetzer:\t\tAll right! If you... If Celes becomes my wife, I'll help you.\t\tOtherwise...\nLocke:\t\tWHAT!? Are you crazy!?\nCeles:\t\t...Fine.\nSetzer:\t\tGreat! It's settled!\nCeles:\t\tBut I have some conditions... We flip this coin. If it's heads,\tyou help us. If it's tails, I'm yours. Well, Mr. Gambler?\nSetzer:\t\tHa! I like it! I accept.\nLocke:\t\tCeles... Are you serious...? If you marry that guy...\nCeles:\t\tReady?\n\n\n[Celes flips the coin into the air.]\n\n\nCeles:\t\tHeads... I win. Now it's time for you to hold up your end of\tthe bargain.\nSetzer:\t\t...A valuable trinket indeed. I've never seen a double-headed coin before.\nSabin:\t\tThat coin...!? Edgar! Don't tell me...!\nCeles:\tI'm afraid you've been hustled, Mr. Gambler. But that's part of\t\tthe game, now, isn't it?\nSetzer:\t\tHa! How low can you stoop? ...I love it! All right, I'll help\tyou. Gambling against the Empire, with nothing to lose but my\tlife... I haven't felt so excited in years! My life is a chip \tin your pile! Ante up!\n\n[The group is on top of the airship deck.]\n\nLocke:\tI can't believe this clunky old thing can fly... You sure it'll \tstay in the air?\nSetzer:\tWhen things fall, they fall... Life's a game of chance. You\tplay your cards, and Fate plays hers...\nLocke:\tThey'll spot us in the air from miles away if we try to fly this thing into the Empire. We'd better land a safe distance \taway.\nSetzer:\tThat sounds like a good idea. I'll stay on board and keep the \tship ready to take off at a moment's notice.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2291687", "artist_names": "Hipsway", "full_title":

Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'\nThe prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a\nstiletto and in the empty black void we:\n\nCUT TO\n\nOpening Montage - Documentary Footage:\n2 THE DISEMBARKATION\nfrom the harbor in Mariel, Cuba.

We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we\nencompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --\nmuscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and\non the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.\nHe is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken\ncardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from\nprison.\n\nOver this:\n\nVOICE #1 (o.s.)\nOkay so what do you call yourself?\n\nVOICE #2 (o.s.)\nComo se llama?\n\nMONTANA\nTony Montana...you?\n\nVOICE #1\nWhere'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?\n\nMONTANA\nMy old man -- he was American.

I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?\n\nSilence.\nThere's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but\nit falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.\n\nMAN #l\nCarter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?\n\nMAN #3\n(walking out)\nI... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him.

He takes the Baby Ruth out\nof Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then\nreturns the empty wrapper to Manny,\n\nTONY\nSo what'd you tell them?\n\nMANNY\nI told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.\n\nTONY\nI didn't tell you sanitation.

TONY'S TENT - FREEDOMTOWN - NIGHT (SIX MONTHS LATER) 8\n\nA movie projector...\n...the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid. We're watching a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra-Madre. It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking to himself just before the bandits get him....\n\nThe rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,\nthe camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,\neyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.\n\nBOGART\nWhat a thing.\nConscience. Conscience.\nIf you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you?

Hunh? Like me....\n\nHe hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,\nimitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with\nzig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,\nTony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a\npop button pinned to his shirt that says \"Fuck Off and Die.\"\nAnd his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence\nmore pronounced.\n\nTONY\n. . . don't trust nobody.\n\nMANNY\nYeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.\n\nTONY\nNever happen to me, Chico.

FREEDOMTOWN GROUNDS - NIGHT 10\nTony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in, trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.\n\nTony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone\nnumber written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he\nfinishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see\na young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,\nstanding together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in\nshadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with\nhandling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone\nrings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have\nnot yet seen in Tony.\n\nSomeone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His\nexpression alters to uncertainty.\n\nVOICE\nYes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?\n\nTony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those\nin line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony\nignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his\npants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.\n\nHe walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes\nsomebody in another phone booth and goes over.\n\nAngel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on\nthe phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a\nworn phone book in his hand.\n\nTONY\nAngel, how ya doin'?\n\nANGEL\nYou know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of 'em to find my brother!\n\nTONY\n(in passing)\nDon't waste your dime, Chico.

Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh?\n\nTony winks and walks off.\n\nThe radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.\n\nTONY\n(in awful imitation)\n'Oh yeah America!

Out of which Scarface now appears -- in his killing wrath.\n\nTONY\nRebenga!\n\nRebenga snaps to the sound of the voice.\n\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nFrom the friends you fucked!\n\nThe work is fast.

You wanna score one of these chicks, watch me.

You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.\n\nDoes it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head\npeeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.\n\nTONY\nWhat the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin'.\n\nMANNY\nYou think so hunh? Well you don't know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.\n\nDoes it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window.\n\nMANNY\n(doing it again)\nTakes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it....\n\nTONY\nOooh... cono!

When he catches\nher eyes, he flicks his tongue.\n\nShe looks at him, confused, then back into the window.\nManny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.\n\nTony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber\nchild, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his\nown version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at\nhim puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now\nsmiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles\nand moves along.\n\nMeanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face\nand walks away.\n\nTony walks over to him, mocking.\n\nTONY\nPobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up.\nThis country first you gotta get the money, then you get\nthe power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls.

It combines the social functions of a family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night watering hole for various beasts of prey.\n\nThe waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths\nto the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The\ncamera following past the pots and the pans and the steam\nand the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of\nthis dungeon....\n\n. . . To reveal Tony Montana stubbing grease off the pots and\nManny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and\nexhausted. A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes\nto the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.\n\nTONY\nYour big shot friend better come up with something soon. I didn't come to America to break my fucking back, querido.\n\nMANNY\n(equally irritated)\nHey he's coming okay! What do you want?\n\nCUT TO\n\n29 INT./EXT.

PARKING LOT OUTSIDE LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nOmar Suarez (El Mono -- \"The Monkey\") is so named cause he\nlooks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish\nintelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing\nbetween words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor... with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.\n\nMANNY\n(leaning in the window)\nHey Omar, Waldo, coma esta... my friend I told you about. Tony Montana... Omar Suarez, Waldo Rojas....\n\nWaldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly.

You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.\n\nSilence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.\n\nTONY\nOkay, this is it. Pull over across the street.\nThe motel is coming closer in silence.\n\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nMoney stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?\n\nANGEL\nSure thing.\n\nAs Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10\nmachine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches\nof kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it\ncan be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:\n\nTONY\nLet's go....\n\nCUT TO\n\n33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nTony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior\ncorridor to a room marked \"9\". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.\nPause.\n\n34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, \"The Toad\". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.\n\nTOAD\nHey, oye amigo....\n\nSpreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.\n\n35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nTony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and\nblue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.\n\nTONY\n(as he steps in)\nHow you doing amigo...?\n\nThe other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark\nColombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, \"The Lizard\"; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.\n\nThe Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.\n\nTONY\n(checking out the room)\nMind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?\n\nToad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,\nthe conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.\n\nTOAD\nSure, no problem... This is Marta.\n\nTONY\nHello, Marta.\nShe nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the\ntelevision set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists\nintermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.\n\nTOAD\nI'm Hector...\n\nPause.\n\nTONY\nYeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.\n\nTOAD\nYeah, Omar's okay.\n\nTONY\nYou know Omar.\n\nTOAD\nOmar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.\n\nTONY\nOkay...\n\nTOAD\nOkay... so you got the money?\n\nTONY\nYeah, you got the stuff?\n\nTOAD\nSure I got the stuff, but I don't\ngot it right here with me. I got it\nclose by.\n\nTONY\nYeah well I don't got it either, I\ngot it close by, too.\n\nTOAD\nWhere, in the parking lot?\n\nTONY\nNo. How far's your stuff?\n\nTony paces back towards, the door casually, to check Angel\nout... The Lizard staring at him...\n\nTOAD\nNot far.\n\nPause. Everything seems okay.\n\nTONY\nSo what do we do, walk in and start over?\n\nTOAD\n(changes subject)\nWhere you from?\n\nTony's eyes check out the bathroom.\n\nTONY\nWhat fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?\n\nTOAD\nI like to get to know who I do business with.\n\nIt's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a\nmove somewhere off-center and is now sitting on the bed,\ncoiled and always watching.\n\nTONY\nYou get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.\n\nTOAD\nHey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't...\n\nTONY\nOkay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?\n\n36 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThere's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then\ncommotion.\n\nANGEL\nTony!\n\nTony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening\nfemale shriek, like a bird.\n\nLIZARD\n(slang Spanish)\nDon't! Get up! Now shithead!\n\nShe's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to shoot.\n\nThe Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony. Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more\nColumbians, \"The Kids\".\n\nThey slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang.\n\nAs Toad strips the handgun from Tony:\n\nTONY\nFrog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead.\n\nToad shrugs, he couldn't care less.\n\nTOAD\nYeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?\n\nTONY\nTry sticking your head up your ass.\nSee if it fits.\n\nToad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto\ntaped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something\nin hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel\ninto the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.\nEven more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now\npulls out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begins\nassembling it as Lizard, still covering Tony with her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, ironically not in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n37 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\n\nChi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across\nthe street. Manny paces outside the car, glances.\n\n38 EXT.

TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nAngel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the bathtub. Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.\n\nTony, covered by the two kids, watches from the lip of the\nbathroom. He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their\npistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.\nAngel looks at Tony; the eyes between them steady. They're\ndead and they know it.\n\nToad, well-prepared, connects a voltage adapter and extension cord.\n\nTOAD\n(to Tony)\nYou watch what happens to your friend okay? If you don't want this to happen to you, you get the money.\n\nLizard reenters the room, shakes her head at the Toad who\nnods and turns on the whirring machine.\n\nThe Toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly\ntowards Angel.\n\nThe two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at his\nbrains... Off-camera, we know what's happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.\n\nLizard has no expression on her face. The machine cuts off.\n\nThe Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his shirt, examining his first cut like a butcher. He glances at Tony.\n\nTOAD\nNow the leg, hunh?\n\nA brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.\n\nCUT TO\n\n41 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with\nChi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel. They\nsignal and separate.\n\nCUT TO\n\n42 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.\n\nTony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.\n\nTOAD\nOkay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me.\n\nHe nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel\nlying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of\nhis blood, piss dead.\n\nCUT TO\n\n43 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny moves crouched down the exterior corridor, Ingram\npistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to\nnotice.\n\nAt the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens...\n\nCUT TO\n\n44 INT.

TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nand the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and\nshoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She crashes backwards into the room, wounded. Everything happens very fast now.\n\nManny is at the lip of the bathroom, he fires and hits kid\none, who is turning, in the neck.\n\nTony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling across the bathroom.\n\nThe Toad, chainsaw in hand, slashes at Manny.\n\nManny fires a burst into him and the Toad crashes backwards.\n\nManny now spins into a wall, hit in the side.\n\nThe Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at\nhim. In the background, the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.\n\nIn sharp foreground, the Lizard crumples forward on her knees, foaming blood.\n\nTony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram.\n\nIn the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical, gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.\n\nChi-Chi, climbing through the window, fires at him.\n\nMeanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces\na knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol.\n\nHe blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.\n\nTony, yelling, whirls after the Toad.\n\nTONY\nI got him!\n\nManny, holding his side, empties his pistol on kid one, who is still twitching.\n\nChi-Chi sees Angel, gags.\n\nCUT TO\n46 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY 46\nThe senior citizens, playing Mahjong on the porch, mutter\nin astonishment, as the Toad staggers out into the parking lot, blood flying, chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.\n\nTheir eyes follow.\n\nAs Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.\nThere's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all\nthat counts. He stands behind the Toad.\n\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nYour turn, cabron!\n\nThe Toad whips around to the voice, eyes stark with terror.\n\nTony empties the clip into the Toad, blowing him apart.\n\nThe bystanders just stare, stunned by the ferocity. Then\nan old lady faints.\n\nThe Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony\nturns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his\naudience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance\nand the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identification.\n\nCUT TO\n\n47 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nTony intersects Manny holding his side, with Chi-Chi.\n\nTONY\nManny, you okay?\n\nManny nods.\n\nTONY\nChi-Chi, get the car. Fast!\n\nCHI-CHI\nSi!\n\n48 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM\nTony strides into the shambles of Room 9, past the bodies\nand busted furniture to the suitcase on the bed from which\nthe Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in the corner.\n\nInside are several kilo-sized stacks of cocaine.\n\nHe shuts the suitcase, exits, stops, looks in the bathroom at the corpse of Angel off-camera. He goes, stoops, brings Angel's Change charm into our view, fingers it, tosses it back in the tub. He goes.\n\nCUT TO\n49 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\n\nChi-Chi has the sedan waiting in the parking lot. Tony\nhurries out, jumps in, the car speeding off. (Pisalo hasta la tabla -- Step on it.)\n\nPast the senior citizens who are retreating inside their\nrooms.\n\nThe camera swinging to hold on the blue and black Monte Carlo disappearing into the traffic of the Strip as two cop cars\ncome screaming past them from the opposite direction.\n\nCUT TO\n50 EXT.

LOPEZ CONDO - NIGHT 52\nA deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.\n\nThe boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor, dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Manny, with a phony effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.\n\nLOPEZ\nHow ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet you. How 'bout a drink?\n\nTONY\nMr. Lopez... real pleasure.\n\nLOPEZ\nCall me Frank, Tony. Everybody calls me Frank. My Little League team, even the prosecutors 'round town, they all call me Frank.\n\nTONY\nOkay Frank.\n\nFrank shakes hands with Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\nHowya doing?\n\nMANNY\n(awed)\n...Fine yeah.\n\nTONY\nManny Ray, he was with us on the job.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Manny)\nI hear you caught one?\n\nManny shrugs, works his arm, showing us the wound doesn't bother him too much.\n\nMANNY\nJust the flesh. Went right through.\n\nLOPEZ\n(heading for the bar)\nYeah, Omar here tells me good things about you boys.\n\nTONY\n(glances at Omar)\nYeah. Omar's terrific.\n\nLOPEZ\nNot to mention of course the nice job you guys did for me on that Commie sonufabitch Emilio Rebenga.\n\nTONY\nYou don't have to mention it. That was fun.\n\nLOPEZ\n(smiles, likes the kid's balls)\nScotch? Gin? Rum?\n\nTONY\nGin's fine.\n\nLOPEZ\n(pouring)\nYeah, I need a guy with steel in his balls. I need him close to me, a guy like you Tony -- and your compadre here.\n\nTONY\nYeah... well.\n\nStill a little overwhelmed by the opulence of the place, his clothes feeling narrow and cheap on him, Tony steps forward and puts the suitcase up on the bar with the gin, which Lopez passes to him, eyeing the suitcase.\n\nTONY\n...that's it. That's the two keys. Angel died 'cause of this shit. And here's the money.\n(produces the money)\nIt's my gift to you -- from me.\n\nPause. Lopez shakes his head, sighs.\n\nLOPEZ\nIt's too bad about your friend, Tony, if people'd do business the right way, there'd be no fuckups like this....\n\nHe glances hard at Omar who squirms.\n\nWithout opening it, Lopez signals the bodyguard who takes\nthe suitcase and the money from under Tony's nose.\n\nLOPEZ\nDon't think I don't appreciate this gesture, Tony. You find in this business, you stay loyal you move up and you move up fast. Salud!\n\nThey drink the toast. With their eyes.\n\nLOPEZ\nThen you find out your biggest head ache's not bringing in the stuff but figuring out what to do with all the goddamn cash.\n(drinks)\n\nTONY\nYeah, I hope I have that problem someday.\n\nLopez looks, distracted., down the corridor from which he came, to Ernie, the bodyguard.\n\nLOPEZ\nWhere the hell's Elvira? Go get her, will you, Ernie?\n\nThe big bodyguard exits smoothly.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to the others)\nThe broad spends half her life dressing, the other half undressing.\n\nTONY\nI guess you gotta catch her in the middle, hunh?\n\nLopez laughs.\n\nLOPEZ\nYeah. When she's not looking. What do you say guys, to a little food?\n(finishes his drink at his impatient pace)\n\nTONY\nYeah sure, I could eat a horse.\n\nERNIE\nHere she comes, Mr. Lopez.\n\nTONY looks up, his eyes tumbling on the most beautiful blonde he's ever seen. The lady, is coming down the glassed-in elevator, adjusting her $10,000 Yves St. Laurent burgundy dinner dress.\n\nLOPEZ\nOooh sweetheart, you look like a million bucks.\n\nShe doesn't answer, her eyes flicking disinterestedly over to Tony and Manny, knowing what the evening's going to be and not too happy about it.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE**\nLOPEZ\nWhere you been baby, it's ten o'clock, I'm hungry.\n\nELVIRA\nYou're always hungry, you should try starving.\n\nLopez laughs.\n\nLOPEZ\nI want you to meet a friend of mine.\nTony Montana...

I got nothing but friends.\n\nELVIRA\nYou never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.\n\nNeatly avoiding his intended smooch, she slips by him towards the door, her throat flashing a $20,000 strip of jewelry.\n\nELVIRA\nCome on, Frank, let's go.\n\nTracking a cool, polished hauteur, she exits the apartment.\n\nLopez, after a pause, snaps at his men.\n\nLOPEZ\nOkay, let's go.\n\nCUT TO\n54 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nWe know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them\nout of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Corniches in a long snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.\n\n55 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nThe interior is built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games, computers and a restaurant. It's a lavish fun spot that will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of South America.\n\nThe crowd, a combination of Caucasian and Latin, is mostly\nyoung, rich and happy and a lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses, trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they dance to a black American music beat, \"Celebrating\" or \"Partying Down Tonight\".\n\nThe waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel\nhats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose\nand high heels.\n\nRich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their\nnecks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.\n\nDown at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and\ntough-looking tank tops with \"Motherfuckah\" and \"Fuck Me\"\nwritten on them. Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to pick one of them up.\n\nMANNY\nSo whaddaya say, hunh?\n\nHe flashes his tongue. She looks at him, amused.\n\nCHICK\nYou got a buck?\n\nMANNY\nSure I got a buck, whaddaya think I am, poor?\n\nCHICK\n(indicates the machine)\nPut it in, let's play.\n\nMANNY\nI had other things in mind.\n\nCHICK\nYou check out on this and we'll talk about other things.\n\nMANNY\n(looks off, concerned, then confronts the complex machine)\nFuck, how do you play this thing?\n\nCUT TO\n56 INT. BABYLON CLUB 56\nFrank Lopez, intoxicated, takes his heart pill with a slug\nof champagne. He sits next to Tony, who is agog at all this wealth. Omar and Ernie look on. Elvira is in conversation with a girl friend who has stopped by. They're sitting at the best table in the place, finishing up a giant meal. The empty spot belongs to Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nOver there that's Ronnie Echeverria.\nHim and his brother Miguel, they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson....\n\nTheir point of view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent looking man in conversation with a party of people.\n\nLOPEZ\nThat guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar Gomez. Bad news. Stone killer there ever was one. Stay away.\n\nTheir point of view -- Gaspar Gomez at a table with another\nguy and gorgeous woman.\n\nLOPEZ\n...the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho Contreras -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know it to look at him but he's got more cash than anybody in here. A real haza....\n\nTheir point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.\n\nLOPEZ\n. ..you know what a haza is, Tony?\n\nTONY\n'Haza'? No Frank, what's a haza?\n\nLOPEZ\nIt's Yiddish for pig. It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it! Lesson number one -- don't underestimate the other guy's greed.\n\nELVIRA\nLesson number two -- don't get high on your own supply.\n\nThe girl friend has departed and Elvira turns her attention back to them, bored.\n\nLOPEZ\nThat's right. Course not everybody follows the rules.\n(eyeing Elvira)\n\nHEAD WAITER\nThere you go, Mr. Lopez.\n\nHe's popped the champagne cork and pours Dom Perignon for Lopez.\n\nLOPEZ\nGive it to everybody and bring another, willya Jack?\n\nHead Waiter nods.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nFive hundred fifty dollars for this bottle Tony, what do you think of that, hunh? For a bunch of fucking grapes -- isn't that something?\n\nELVIRA\n(to Tony)\nIn France, it cost $100 but don't tell anybody in Miami.\n\nTony catches her eye. She looks away, interested.\n\n57 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nA Man passes the table. Lopez calls out.\n\nLOPEZ\nHey, George -- buddy.\n\nMAN\nHey, Frank.. -how's the case coming?\n\nThe Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.\n\nLOPEZ\nOy, I shoulda come to you 'stead of that putz, Neufeld.\n\nSHEFFIELD\nJack's a good lawyer. I taught him everything he knows.\n\nLOPEZ\nYeah, almost everything.\n\nSHEFFIELD\n(to Elvira)\nElvira, you look terrific...\n(to all)\nEnjoy yourselves.\n\nHe ambles off.\n\nLOPEZ\n. . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami. Cost a brick to pick up a phone.\n\nTony looking off at him, remembering it.\n\nLOPEZ\n(raising his champagne glass)\nSo... here's to old friends...and new friends.\n\nThey toast, Tony tasting it like it was Holy Water.\n\nLOPEZ\nWell, Tony?\n\nTONY\nHey, yeah, you're not kidding, this is good stuff, Frank.\n\nLopez laughs, likes the kid, tweaks him on the cheek.\n\nLOPEZ\n(checking Tony's threads)\nYeah, get you some new clothes, some $500 suits, you'll look real sharp. I'd like you and your boys to handle some stuff for me, Tony, work with Omar here. We're doing something big next month. Running a string of mules out of Columbia. You do good on that, there'll be other things.\n\nOmar doesn't like it but glances away.\n\nTONY\nHey, that sounds like fun, Frank. Thanks.\n\nThe music shifts to slow dancing.\n\nELVIRA\n(waving away cigar smoke)\nSo, you want to dance, Frank or you want to sit here and have a heart attack?\n\nLOPEZ\nDance? I'd rather have a heart attack.\n\nELVIRA\n(rising)\nDon't foam into the Dom Perignon.\n\nGlancing at Omar, sitting there obediently. Her eyes say forget it.\n\nELVIRA\n(to Tony)\nHow about you?\n\nTony nods sure, looks at his boss.\n\nLOPEZ\n(waves)\nGo on!\n\nThey go.\n\n58 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nIt's interesting to watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It's not so much an act of walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes forward. It's not that he doesn't see the people he bumps off, it's that he couldn't care less.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Omar)\nWhat do you think?\n\nOMAR\nI think he's a fucking peasant.\n\nLOPEZ\nYeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for you.\n\nCUT TO\n59 INT.

I'm getting a headache.\n\nTONY\nJust trying to be friendly.\n\nELVIRA\nI've got enough friends -- and I don't need another one, 'specially one who just got off the banana boat.\n\nHe makes a point of looking at her.\n\nTONY\nHey, I didn't come over on no banana boat. I'm a political refugee here.\n\nELVIRA\nOh, part of the Cuban crime wave?\n\nTony, pissed, bangs once more into the elderly couple.\nThe man stops dancing, looks at him exasperated but Tony\ndoesn't see.\n\nTONY\nWhatta you talking crazy for, whatsa matter with you?\n\nELVIRA\n(interrupting)\nI'm sorry. I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.\n\nTONY\nWhy you got this beef against the world? You got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you got this look in your eyes like you haven't been fucked good in a year.

DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER\nThe new Miami is rising ubiquitously-above Biscayne Bay,\nthe camera moving past blossoming Skyscrapers, workmen,\nhuge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white clouds... past a giant billboard:\n\nHOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?\nCOME TALK TO US...\nAT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...\nTODAY!\n\nPast banks of glass (Caribank, Ranco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...\n\nInsert a car sticker going by with the image of the\nAmerican flag and the reminder: \"Will the last American\nleaving Miami please bring the flag?\"\n\nTony and Manny, on a shopping spree, bop along an incredibly luxurious shopping mall lined with the latest stores, fashions, escalators, music, tropical plants, etc -- a warm womb-like plastic heaven.\n\nTONY\nI shoulda been here 10 years age man. This town's like a big pussy dyin' to be fucked, Paradise, rr.an, paradise.I coulda been a millionaire by now. Get my own golf course, a boat...\n\nMANNY\nI want a line of bluejeans with my name on the\nchicks' asses.\n\nTONY\nYeah, we gotta make some moves on our own Manny,\nWe never gonna score the big money working for Frank.\n\nMANNY\nFrank's okay.\n\nTONY\nYeah -- cause he buys you a suit?

MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY.\n\nTony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arms and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit.\n\nTONY\nCome on!\n\nManny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a\ncar screeching to a halt in front of him.\n\nTONY\n(points)\nOkay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.\n\nThe blonde has paused to look in a shop window.\n\nManny stops alongside, -pretends to look. When he catches\nher eyes, he flicks his tongue.\n\nShe looks at him, confused, then back into the window.\nManny looks back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.\n\nTony, exiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber\nchild, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his\nown version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at\nhim puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now\nsmiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles and moves along.\n\nMeanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde socks him across the face and walks away.\n\nTony walks up to him, mocking.\n\nTONY\nI'm telling you man you got it- all mixed up.\nThis country first, you gotta get the money; then you get the power, and when you got the power, then you get the women -- then, chico, you got the world by the balls.

TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - SOUTHWEST MIAMI - LATE DAY\nThe house, bathed by a torpid setting sun amicable to lizards and Spanish moss, sits undistinguished and without shielding trees in the midst of a lower middle class neighborhood with look-alike yards and streets without people.\n\n66 INT. TONY'S CADILLAC SEDAN - SIMULTANEOUS DAY\nFrom his battered Monte Carlo across the curb, Tony, spruced\nup and nervous in a new suit, gets out carrying a bag of\ngifts.

TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nThe interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled\nwith religious objects from macumba and waist-high black\nJesus statues in various corners. The floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.\n\nStepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his nineteen-year-old sister Gina. Their eyes lock.\n\nTONY\n(moved)\nHi Gina...\n\nGINA\nTony?\n\nShe looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,\ncurly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and\nlarge-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.\n(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in\nTony's possession.)\n\nTONY\n(covering his unwanted emotion)\nYeah, look at you, you're beautiful... what's it been seven years? Last time I saw you, you looked like a boy. Now look at you, you got great big eyes just like me!

It's a beautiful diamond locket to wear around her neck. Her eyes open wide.\n\nTONY\n...Yeah for you...and look -- here.\nWhat I got written on it....\n\"To Gina From Tony. Always.\"\n\nGINA\nIt's beautiful Tony, it's just beautiful....\n\nThe mother is amazed at the cost of the gift. Tony pulls\nout another present, for her.\n\nTONY\n...for you too Mama, look....\n\nMoving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an\nexquisite pearl necklace. She stares at it, doesn't take it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.\n\nGINA\nIt's beautiful... Mama,\n(offers it, an unspoken 'why don't you take it?')\n\nMama doesn't. Gina puts it away with her own.\n\nTONY\n(holding Gina by the shoulder, making light of it)\nWell anyway, here we are hunh? The three musketeers! We made it to America hunh? Let's toast!\n\nTossing the empty package aside, he pulls the last gift -- a\nbottle of champagne.\n\nTONY\nOye ! To America!\n(singing)\n'America. America....'\n\nCUT TO\n69 INT.

Mama stops working,\nlooks.\n\nTONY\n(to Mama as he counts)\nYeah, your son's made it Mama, he's a success. I wanted to surprise\nyou. That's how come I didn't show my face around before. I wanted you to see what a good boy I been.\n\nPushes a thousand dollar stack towards her.\n\nTONY\nThat's a thousand dollars right there, Mama -- for you.\n\nShe approaches it cautiously, her fingers riffling the\nbills, then looks back at her son.\n\nMAMA\nWho'd you kill for this Tony?\n\nGINA\n(aghast)\nMama!\n\nTONY\nI didn't kill nobody Mama,\n(lying)\n\nMAMA\nNo?

He was a bum then and he's a\nbum now!\n(to Tony, she's worked up like a madwoman now)\nWho do you think you are, we haven't heard a word from you in five years and you suddenly show up here and throw some money around and you think you can get my respect? You think you can buy me with jewelry?\nYou think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes and your gutter manners and make fun of....\n\nTONY\nHey Mama, come on, you don't know what you're talking about.....\n\nMAMA\n(continuing)\nNo, no, that's not the way I am Tony and that's not the way I --\n(emphasizing it)\nI raised Gina to be.

So leave us alone... go on, get out! And take this lousy\nmoney with you, it stinks!\n\nShe casts the bundle of bills back across the table at him\nlike dead lettuce.\n\nA silence. Tony sits there livid, soothing his scar, about to explode, but doesn't. Gina mutters something in the silence.\n\nGINA\nOh Mama... why do you got to spoil it for everybody.\n(to Tony)\nI'm sorry Tony, I....\n\nTony nods his head at his mother.\n\nTONY\n(gently)\nOkay, Mama, okay....\nCUT TO\n\n70 EXT.

He was a bum!\n\nGINA\n(continuing)\n. . . she's got a lot of hate in her Tony, she's proud, you got to understand that?\n\nTONY\n(making light of it now)\nHey it's okay, it's Mama, what do you want, she's Old World.\n\nGINA\nTony, I know you did some bad things\nback then. The Army, I know you got into some trouble.\n\nTONY\nCommunists you know, they're always trying to tell you what to do.\n\nGINA\nMama, she doesn't understand-- but I just want you to know, y'know, I don't care. Five years, ten years, it doesn't matter how long you been away, you're my blood. Always.\n\nPause. She stares intently at him, emphasizing it.\n\nTONY\nHey I know...

Help Mama out, but don't tell her I gave you this, okay?\n\nShe hesitates... He nudges her on the cheek and slaps the whole wad into her palm.\n\nTONY\nGo on! Go out and have some fun, what the hell?

COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93\nSubtitle appears:\n\nCOCHABAMBA, BOLIVA\nAlejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy\nhair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a\ncasual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.\n\nOn his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with \"Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money.\n\nAccompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense\nvenomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the\nlook of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in\nproximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person\nor persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte\nposition, his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who\nmight glance at him. He is a continual source of tension\nunderplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar\nwho is insecure to begin with.\n\nSosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing\nlab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with massive iron\nkettles bubbling with coca paste... across to a row of ovens\nwhere the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians\nworking there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey\" as he passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard.\n\nSOSA\nSo this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200\nkilos refined every month of the year. Problem is, I have no steady\nmarket. Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way ---\n\nOMAR\nI know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month...\n\nSosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his\nskinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his\nnervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.\n\nTony, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to\nlook at a sample of the dried coke.\nThe Shadow stops, eyeballs him.\n\nTony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then\nsamples the coke off his thumb into his nose.\nPause. His expression says I like it. He moves on.\nThe Shadow moves with him.\n\nSOSA\n(meanwhile)\n...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like -- say 150 kilos a month.\n\nOMAR\nThat's a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It's too bad Frank's not here. Something like that you should talk to him.\n\nSOSA\nYes, it would've been nice if he could have come.\n\nTONY\n(cutting in)\nand he'd like meeting you too Mr. Sosa. But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand?\n\nSOSA\n(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic)\nSo he sent you?\n\nTONY\nYeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit.\n\nLooking over the laboratory like it was his.\nOmar glances at him, annoyed.\n\nSOSA\nWe'll talk at my house. Shall we go...\n\nCUT TO\n94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94\nThe camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains\nto a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings\nfrom the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.\nAt the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.\nHe eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).\n\nSOSA\n(to Omar)\n...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.\n\nOMAR\nWell, we do that, we gotta take the\nrisk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You\nknow what that means?\n\nTONY\nThat means we gotta go to war with\n`em.\nlooks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make\nSosa\nof this guy.\nSOSA\nWhen we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.\n\nTONY\nSplit the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama.\n\nSOSA\nPanama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.\n\nTONY\n13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You\nknow what that's like these days?\nThey got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it.\n\nOmar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.\n\nSOSA\nWhat do you suggest is a fair...?\nExcuse me.\n\nInterrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly\nappears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves\nhim in.\n\nThe black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man\nwith academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair\non a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.\n\nSosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.\nA beat.\nHe whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.\nThen he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.\nSosa glances at his gold Rolex.\n\nOMAR\n(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)\nShaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here!\n\nTony shrugs.\n\nSOSA\nWhere were we?\n\nTONY\nPanama. You're looking for a partner, right?\n\nOmar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.\n\nSOSA\n...something like that.\n(chuckles)\n\nOMAR\nLook Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we...\n\nTONY\nHey Omar, why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.\n\nOMAR\nHey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!\n\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nFrank'll love it. Don't worry about it.\n\nOMAR\nThat's up to Frank -- not you.\n\nHe looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing\n-- also an advantage in the split.\n\nOMAR\nI'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...\n\nSOSA\nIt's all right. Maybe your partner's right. Maybe you should talk to\nFrank.\n\nOMAR\n(a beat)\nOkay. I don't think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.\n\nSOSA\n(without hesitation)\nGood. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that'll have you in Miami in five hours.\nYou can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.\n\nOmar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.\n\nOMAR\nYeah. I guess so....\n\nTONY\nGreat.\n\nSOSA\n(glancing at Tony, to Omar)\n...leave your friend here. While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.\n\nOMAR\n(doesn't get it)\nI don't think that...\n\nTONY\n(lighting a cigar)\nHey, it's okay. You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him...\n\nSosa laughs. Omar scowls.\n\nCUT TO\n\n95 EXT. SOSA VILLA - DAY 95\n\nThe helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with the Shadow. They both stare at:\nOmar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.\n\nThe chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the\npolo players exercising in the distance... a woman on a\nhorse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.\n\nSosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.\n\nTONY\nYou know why they say Cubans are all screwed up?\n\nSOSA\nWhy?\n\nTONY\nCause the island's in the Caribbean, the government's in Russia, the Army's in Angola, and the people live in Miami.\n\nSosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.\n\nTONY\n(overlapping the joke)\nThey got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.\n\nSOSA\nMaybe he'll move to Miami too...\nGabriella, my rose -- how was the ride?\n\nSosa changes his personality completely with her, dewy-eyed and loving. They peck each other's cheek lightly.\n\nGABRIELLA\n(distracted)\nLovely... but the sheep in the north pasture, they're destroying the grass, it's turning yellow. You must move them darling.\n\nSOSA\nI'll take care of it myself.\n\nGABRIELLA\n(turning to him)\n...and don't forget we have the Rinaldi's at eight.\n\nSOSA\nOf course not. Uh -- an associate of mine. From Miami. Tony Montana...\n(to Tony)\nMy fiance, Gabriella Montini.\n\nTONY\nHello....\nShe nods to him in that somewhat uninterested, rude, upperclass Latin way.\n\nGABRIELLA\nIt's a pleasure.\n\nShe withdraws. Tony watches her go.\n\nTONY\nI gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.\n\nSosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.\n\nSOSA\n(focusing the binoculars)\nI like you Tony. There's no lying in you... Unfortunately I don't feel\nthe same way about the rest of your organization.\n\nTony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.\n\nTONY\nIn-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?\n\nSOSA\nI mean Omar Suarez.\n\nTony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.\n\nSosa passes him the binoculars.\n\nSOSA\nThis garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.\nFrom several years ago, in New York. He was an informer for the police....\n\nTony, astonished, looks up.\n\n96 THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - OMAR 96\nterrified, being positioned at the door of the chopper by\nthe Shadow and the Skull, his hands tied to his back and a\nlength of thick rope looped around his neck. He is struggling backwards in vain.\n\nSOSA\nHe put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life. My associate used to work up there.\n\nThrough the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of the\nchopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.\nA silence.\n\n\n97 TONY 97\nshaken, lowers the binoculars.\nSosa watches him closely for his reaction.\nTony looks back at him, contemplative.\nSosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.\n\nSOSA\nSo how do I know you're not a 'chivato' too Tony?\n\nTONY\n(awry, stalks up to him)\nHey Sosa -- get this straight right now ! I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him okay! All I got's my two balls-- and my word -- and I don't break 'em. For nobody.\nThat piece of shit up there I never liked, I never trusted..\nFor all I know he's the guy who set me up and got my buddy Angel Fernandez killed.\nBut that's history. I'm here. He's not. You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!\n\nSOSA\n(moves away)\nI think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this\nLopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judgment stinks. So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organization...hunh? You tell me Tony.\n\nTONY\nHey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal. It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you.\n(then)\nYou got my word on that.\n\nSosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him,\nmakes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony\nfollowing the pantomime, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.\n\nSOSA\nYou speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together. Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me.\n\nTheir eyes locked together.\n\nCUT TO\nAERIAL VIEW - MIAMI - TWILIGHT 98\nIn all its Caribbean splendor with the long curving beach\nand rich white buildings, bathed in a lovely violet light.\nMusic theme continuing over.\n\nREVERSE WIPE TO\n\n99 EXT. LOPEZ MOTORS AUTO DEALERSHIP - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY 99\nIn long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands and acting like everybody's favorite uncle... 'till we see him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny\noutside his office.\nHe jerks his head. Inside. They go.\n\nCUT TO\n100 INT.

He's gonna send hit squads up here that's what. There's gonna be war in the streets.\n\nTONY\nFrank...

And' you bought that line?\n(pause, eyeing Tony)\nMaybe I made a mistake sending you down there? Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know?\n\nTONY\nYou saying I'm not being straight with you Frank?\n\nLopez's bodyguard shifts. Manny slips his hand closer to his belt.\n\nLOPEZ\n(carefully)\nLet's just say I want things to stay the way they are. For now. Stall\nyour deal with Sosa.\n\nLong pause. Tony's eyes meeting Lopez's. He gave Sosa his word.\n\nTONY\n(finally)\n...have it your way boss.\n\nHe turns to leave, nods to Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\nMontana... just remember I am the boss.\n\nTONY\nSure you're the boss.\n\nGets to the door, Manny joining him.\n\nLOPEZ\nY'know I told you when you started Tony, the guys who last in this business are guys who fly straight, real low key, real quiet.. -the guys who want it all, the chicks and the champagne and the flash -- they don't last.\n\nTony saying nothing, goes out the door with Manny.\n\n101 EXT.

He doesn't get up from\nhis desk. His hair is flaming red. We saw him before, at the\nMutiny Club.\n\nSHEFFIELD\nWhat can I do for you Montana?\n\nTONY\n(indicates Manny)\nMy partner. Manny Ray.\n\nManny, standing in the background, nods...

So he's got this father thing for you, protect you...\n\nGINA\nAgainst what?\n\nMANNY\n'Gainst assholes -- like the sleazeball in the red suit.\n\nHe says it like it's personal.\n\nGINA\n(picks up on it)\nI like Fernando, he's a nice guy, he knows how to treat a woman.\n\nMANNY\n(a face)\nWhat future's he got?

Cause you don't know what you're missing....\n\nShe leans across the front seat and lightly lays a challenging kiss on his cheek. The ladykiller is rigid in his terror.\n\nShe gets out of the car, crosses in front of his headlights, towards the house, looking at him. He watches.\n\nCUT BACK TO\n113 INT. BABYLON CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT 113\nThe Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting to Sinatra's \"Strangers In The Night'.\n\nOWNER\nAll right, you coneheads, another exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?\nNow I want you to check out this next hombre. I found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia' !\n\nLights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as\nsad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-\nlight drawing immediate laughter.\n\nHe is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo\nmask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.\nWith a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to \"Saturday Night Fever\" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.\n\nTony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.\nMore laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.\nWhen the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome\nface of a young clown in white paint with the large\nblackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing\naudience.\n\nTony is hooked by the image, looks on.\nThe clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and\npulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,\nbouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry...\n\n...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the\nsharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to\nits close, a haunting figure of mockery....\n\nTony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time. His\nantennae warn him. Out of the side of his eye, he sees....\n\nThe two hitters moving on him.\nHe sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,\nsmashing the mirrors...\nScreams, crowd diving for cover...\n\nTony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Beretta out of\nhis ankle, firing...\nHits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings...\n\nTony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing...\nThe second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more\nmirrors, and more screaming.\n\nTony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the\ndoor, his clothes ripped with blood and glass.\n\nThe clown, Octavia, lies dead on the silent dance floor.\n\nCUT TO\n114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114\nTony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.\n\nExchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot, he runs out of ammunition.\nHe jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.\n\nThe second hitter, wounded, running out of the club towards him.\nThe third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.\n\nTony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.\n\nCarhops scattering, the hitters seeking cover.\nHitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head exploding like squashed watermelon.\n\nTony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap\nacross the shattered windows.\nHe guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off\nthe armor plating, whining against the shutters.\n\nTony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the\ngear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile in reverse, accelerates, climbing to top speed...\nAs hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of\nthere, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.\n\nCUT TO\n\n115 INT. SAFEHOUSE - THAT NIGHT 115\nTony, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who\nreveals to us an ugly wound on his rib cage. Tony looks at\nit, doesn't express a reaction.\n\nDOCTOR\nIt's going to be sore for a few months.\n\nTONY\nSomebody else gonna be a lot sorer...\n(to Chi-Chi)\nFind out where Lopez is....\n\nCUT TO\n116 INT.

We're going to Sarasota for the State Championship... Hunh!\n\nMUFFLED VOICE\nCongratulations.

What'd you do -- fix the umpire?\n\nLopez, his nose in a glass of scotch, almost muffs it right\nthere and then, but manages to recover.\n\nLOPEZ\nTony...? Uh, I'll call you back -- yeah.\n\nHangs the phone up and rocks forward at his desk.\nLopez's bodyguard, Ernie, gets the message from Chi-chi\nsliding along the wall next to him, Manny covering the\nother side of the room.\n\nLOPEZ\nTony... what happened to you, hunh?\n\nTONY\nYeah, lookit. They spoiled one of\nmy $800 suits.\n\nLOPEZ\nJesus! Who?\n\nin his ripped suit, shoulder in a sling, face cut, Tony, shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.\n\nTONY\nHitters. Somebody musta brought 'em.\nNever seen 'em before...Hiya\nii:;. Is there an answer to this too?\n\nBERNSTEIN\n(uneasy)\nAlways is Montana, always is...\n\nLOPEZ\nJesus, Tony, maybe it was the Diaz Brothers, they got a deep beef going back to the 'Sun Ray' thing.\n\nTONY\nHey, you might be right.\n\nLOPEZ\nAnyway I'm glad you made it Tony, we'll return the favor for you. In spades.\n\nTONY\n(sits at the edge of Lopez's desk)\nNah, I'm gonna take care of this myself.\n\nPause.\n\nLOPEZ\n(awkward)\nWell... What are the guns for Tony?\n\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nWhat for? I'm paranoid I guess.\n\nThe phone rings.\nLopez lets the phone ring.\n\nTONY\nWhy don't you answer it Frank?\n\nLOPEZ\nMust be Elvira. You know women.\nAfter we left that joint she....\n\nThe phone rings again.\n\nTONY\n(reaches for it)\nI'll tell her you're not here.\n\nLOPEZ\n(grabs the phone first)\nWait a minute! I'll talk to her... Hello?...\n(anxious)\nYeah... all right honey, don't worry... I'll be home in an hour.\n\nHe hangs up. Pause.\n\nTONY\nFrank, you're a piece of shit.\n\nLOPEZ\nWhatcha talking 'bout Tony?\n\nTony, angry now, grabs Lopez by the shirt and hauls him\nforward across his desk so his gut lies flat across it.\n\nTONY\nYou know what I'm talking about you fuckin' cockroach!\n\nLOPEZ\nTony, no! Lissen!\n\nTONY\nYou remember what a 'haza' is Frank?\nIt's a pig that don't fly straight. Neither do you, Frank.\n\nLOPEZ\n(nervous)\nWhy would I hurt you, Tony, I brought you in! So we had a few differences, no big deal. I gave you your start Tony, I believed in you !\n\nTONY\nYeah and I stayed loyal to you, Frank. I made what I could on the\nside but I never turned you Frank, never -- but you -- a man ain't got no word, he's a cockroach!\n\nHe squashes an imaginary cockroach right in front of Frank's eyes, then pulls him further across the desk, flailing.\n\nLOPEZ\nMel! Mel! Do something, please!\n\nMel sits there impassively.\n\nMEL\nIt's your tree Frank, you're sitting in it.\n\nLOPEZ\nPlease Tony okay all right! Gimme a second chance! Ten million.

I never hurt nobody!\n\nTONY\nYeah you're right Frank, you always had somebody else do it for you.\n\nHe turns to Manny.\n\nTONY\nManny, you mind shooting this piece of shit for me?\n\nTony steps aside.\n\nLOPEZ\nNo! No! Tony!\n\nManny shoots him with the silencer. Three times.\nLopez crashes backwards, draped over his desk like Marat in\nhis bathtub, amid his patriot flag and his Kennedy photographs.\n\nTONY\n...Every dog has his day.\n\nHe fixes his eyes on Mel Bernstein.\n\nBERNSTEIN\n(remaining calmly in his chair)\nI told him it didn't make sense -- killing you when he coulda had you working for us instead. But he got hot tonight, y'know, about the broad. He fucked up.\n\nTONY\nYeah, so did you, Bernstein.\n\nHis eyes... Bernstein, reading them, gets worried.\n\nBERNSTEIN\nNow wait a minute, Montana, don't go too far.\n\nTONY\nI'm not Mel. You are.\n\nHe produces his Beretta from his sling and holds it in his\nleft hand pointed at the big man.\n\nBERNSTEIN\n(rising from his chair)\nHey, c'mon, what is this?\nYou can't shoot a cop, Tony.\n\nTONY\nWhoever said you were one?\n\nHe fires.\n\nBernstein takes it in the gut, hits the floor, looks up astonished.\n\nBERNSTEIN\nI... lemme go, Tony, I can fix things up...\n\nTONY\nSure you can Chico. Maybe you can handle one of them first-class tickets -- to the Resurrection. So long, Mel, have a good trip.\n\nHe fires several times into him until we can imagine he is\nno longer of the living. Tony turns towards the door.\n\nMANNY\n(indicates bodyguard)\nWhat about him?\n\nTony notices.\nThe bodyguard, Ernie, the middle-aged Cuban, waits stoically.\n\nTONY\nYou want a job Ernie?\n\nERNIE\nSure, Tony.\n\nTONY\nCome see me tomorrow.\n\nERNIE\nThanks, Tony.\n\nTony walks out alone into the darkened showroom, past the\nhulks of the used Cadillacs, as we see the shadows of Manny\nand Chi-Chi moving in a stream of light.\n\nMANNY\n(Offscreen)\nOkay, torch it!\n\nCUT TO\n124 INT.

How's married life? Say hello to the princess for me -- okay. She's beautiful.\nSee you. Take care.\n\nGoing.\n\nTony watches, raging inside.

He drinks\ncoffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who\nlook the part.\n\nIt's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties, it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the amounts.\nAt all times all four men, thoroughly aware of the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of coffee.\n\nLUIS\n. I . yeah back then I worked in pictures\nI was in that picture down in Columbia.\nBurn, y'ever see it? ...with Marlon Brando.\nWe're good friends.

SOSA VILLA LIVING ROOM - DAY - VIDEOTAPE - 168\nMATOS STUDY\nA \"Phil Donahue-type\" setting. A segment now in progress\nwith the \"Donahue-type\" interviewing Dr. Orlando Gutierrez.\nGutierrez is a young charismatic man, very well dressed and\npolished in a South American manner who exudes a sense of\nenormous passion.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nMore than 10,000 of our people are being tortured and held without trial. In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? It\nsells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!\n\nINTERVIEWER\nI've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nThe irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,\nJim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.\n\nINTERVIEWER\nSo what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine... that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?\n\nGUTIERREZ\n(laughs)\nLet me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --\n\nGutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TV\nscreen, dour, ruthless.\n\nGUTIERREZ\n. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country. Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.\nNow if he's supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register?\n\nLaughter.\n\n169 TONY 169\nwatching, touching his nose a lot, blowing it, hyped from\nthe coke usage.\n\nSOSA\nA Communist -- financed by Moscow.\n\n170 GUTIERREZ 170\nholds up another photograph -- insert the face on the\nTV screen.\n\nGUTIERREZ\n...this is Alejandro Sosa. Interesting character. A wealthy landowner. Educated in England. Good family. The business brain and drug overlord of an empire stretching across the Andes. Not your ordinary drug dealer....\n\nINTERVIEWER\nWhat are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?\n\nGUTIERREZ\n(passionate)\nThe United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.\n\n171 TONY 171\nstaring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nYou Americans have no idea how important your country is as a\nsymbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....\n\nSosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He's alone with Tony.\n\nSOSA\n...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. He's embarrassing, Tony...\nThat's our problem.\n\nTONY\nYeah.\n\nSosa looks up.\n\nThe Shadow (seen before at the disposal of Omar) comes into\nthe room, thin and quiet, his venomous eyes flicking over\nTony. The Skull leads him in.\n\nSOSA\nYou've met Alberto before?...\n\nTONY\n(remains seated)\nSure. How could I forget?\n\nSOSA\nAlberto, you know Tony Montana -- my partner from Florida.\n\nAlberto nods icily, remains standing adjacent.\n\nSOSA\n(to Tony)\nSo you see Alberto here is going to help fix our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business -- but he doesn't know his way around the States too well, he doesn't speak English, and he needs a little help...\n(*en)\nIs that a problem, Tony?\n\nTony looks around the faces, then:\n\nTONY\nThat's no problem, Alex....\n\nAlex nods, pleased.\nHold on Tony. He blows his nose again.\n\nCUT TO\n\n175 INT. THE RESTAURANT - MIAMI - NIGHT\nA millionaire's place, like \"The Forge\" on Arthur Godfrey\nRoad.

Tony, a little loaded, intersects a group of people at another table and stops, putting his hand on a heavyset man's shoulder.\n\nTONY\nHey, Vic, I watch your show everyday.\n\nVic -- who we saw before editorializing on television.--\ncranes his leonine white head of hair around with a\npatrician annoyance reserved for bores in restaurants.\n\nVIC\nOh, is that so?\n\nTONY\nYeah. Hey, you know that two hundred kilo DEA bust you was congratulating the cops for on the toob the other night?\n\nVIC\nAren't you... Tony Montana?\n\nTONY\n(beaming now, ignoring Manny who comes to retrieve him)\nYeah, that's me.\n\nThe half-dozen rich people in the dinner party are intrigued.\n\nTONY\n(waves to them)\nHi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vic, check it out. I heard like it was 220 kilos went down. That means twenty is missing, right? Ask your friends, the cops, about that -- and keep up the good work, Vie, but don't believe everything you hear, y'know what I mean? Okay, have a good dinner, nice to meet you people.\n\nWaves farewell to them, pats Vic once more on the shoulder, and leaves them murmuring.\n\nMANNY\n(reproving)\nHey, Tony, that's not cool, he's got a lotta friends in....\n\nTONY\nI don't give a fuck. He's an ass-hole! Never fucking tells the truth on TV! That's the trouble in this country. Nobody fucking tells the truth!\n\nNot caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip\nof an anguish he does not understand.\n\nCUT TO\n\n173 TONY\nsits with Manny and Elvira, who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap. Another huge meal is being consumed, the best roast beef, bottles of red and white wine, cigars....\n\nMANNY\nSo what's the big mystery, what happened down there with Sosa?\n\nTONY\nLot of bullshit, that's what. Politics.\nThe whole world's turning into politics.\n\nHe pulls out his own vial under the table between eating and drinking.\n\nMANNY\nThe one thing we always stayed out of was politics, Tony.\n\nTONY\nYeah, so what do you think Emilio Rebenga was? Politics or what?\n\nManny remembers.\n\nTONY\nNo free rides in this world, kid.\n\nMANNY\nSo who's this guy you brought back with you, the guy who don't blink?\n\nELVIRA\nWhat guy?\n\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nYou stay out of it. Run things down here. I'll be up in New York next week.\n\nHe takes a hit, unnoticed.\n\nELVIRA\n(unheard)\nWhat guy?\n\nMANNY\n(to Tony)\nI don't like it.\n\nTONY\nYou don't like it! It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!\n\nWhat's Seidelbaum got to do with this?\nTony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the\ntable with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to\nElvira's untouched plate.\n\nTONY\nWhy don't you eat your food, what's\nwrong with it?\n\nELVIRA\nI'm not hungry.\n\nShe quickly does one nostril with a quick, practiced move-\nment of her hand.\n\nTONY\nSo what'd you order it for?\n\nELVIRA\nI lost my appetite.\n\nShe does the other nostril. Tony looking at her. One beat.\nTwo beats. He passes a silent burp.\n\nMANNY\n(trying to shift the mood)\nSo what about the trial? I heard Sheffield thinks he can get a new postponement....\n\nTony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues to look at Elvira, then away, encompassing the restaurant.\n\nTONY\n(ignoring the question)\nIs this it? Is that what it's all about, Manny?\nEating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what?\nYou're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?\nIs that what it's all about?\n\nMANNY\nIt's not so bad Tony, could be worse....\n\nTONY\n(doesn't hear)\n. . . is that what I worked 'for? With these hands? Is that what I killed for? For this?\n(turns his gaze stonily on Elvira)\nA junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for a wife? Who never eats nothing, who wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps all day with black shades on, who won't fuck me cause she's in a coma!\n\nMANNY\n(gently)\nTony, you're drunk.\n\nTONY\n...is this how it ends? And I thought I was a winner? Fuck it\nman, I can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby!\n\nElvira reacts -- wanting to kill. She gets up and dumps\nher plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.\n\nELVIRA\nYou sonufabitch! You fuck!\n\nThey got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping\naround to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food\noff himself.\n\nELVIRA\nHow dare you talk to me like that!\nYou call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?\nOh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming!\n\nThe audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over\nthe faces of Vie and his rich friends.\n\nTony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.\n\nTONY\nSit down before I kill you.\n\nELVIRA\n. . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons\naround all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that?\n(in a softer tone)\nOh Tony don't you see? Don't you see what we've become? We're losers, honey, we're not winners, we're losers...\n\nSilence. Tony's fury has passed. So has Elvira's. There's\nthis awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot\ntheir lines.\n\nTONY\n(softly)\nGo on, get a cab home, you're stoned.\n(to Manny)\nManny.\n\nELVIRA\nNo, I'm not stoned Tony. You're stoned. You're so stoned you don't\neven know it.\n\nTONY\nAll right I'm stoned.\n\nMANNY\n(rising, trying to put his arm on Elvira)\nCome on, baby.\n\nELVIRA\nNo, no you stay right there Manny, I'm not going home with you... I'm not going home with anybody. I'm going home alone...\n(staring at Tony)\nI'm leaving you. I don't need this shit anymore.\n\nPause. She starts wobbling out.\nPast the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. Manny rises to follow.\n\nTONY\nLet her go! ...Another Quaalude and she'll love me again.\n\nStumbling once, Elvira disappears out the door.\nTony's eyes follow her. Pause.\n\nThe whole room is watching him sitting there covered with\nfood, the silence cathedral. He stands, wiping at the food\nand throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,\nthen looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.\n\nTONY\nYou're all assholes. You know why?\nCause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be.\n\nHe wobbles against the table. Manny tries to help. Tony\nshakes him loose.\n\nTONY\nYou need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!' So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth -- even when I lie.\n\nHe starts out, staggers.\n\nTONY\nSo say good night to the bad guy...\nYou're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.\n\nHe walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room\nis empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without\nits star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror\nand delight.\n\nCUT TO\n174 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT\nA quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers\nstroll past with their dog. A moment of silence.

With subtly inexorable music, the\ncamera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,\ntaped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of\nthe Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an\naxle of the car.\n\n177 ERNIE\nsignals.\n\n178 TONY\nsees it.\n\nA cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,\ntowards us.\n\nGround level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.\nTony hurries to the car, bends down.\n\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nPsst!

Another Marielito is waiting\nfor them at the door.\n\nErnie and Chi-Chi are almost carrying Gina, who is numb with shock.\n\nCHI-CHI\nWhat do we do with her Tony?\n\nTONY\nDo what? Where? Put her upstairs.\nPut her in my bedroom.\n(to Gina)\nIt'll be all right, pussycat, you'll see everything'11 be okay, I'll take\ncare of you....\n\nShe looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face. Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares, upset but passive.\nThey trundle her up the stairs. Tony turns and walks away.\n\n224 INT. TONY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 224\nTony slumps on his couch. A haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.\nOblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table.\n\nErnie and Chi-Chi come in.\n\nCHI-CHI\nWe got some pills into her, she's cooling down.\n\nTony pays no attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile of coke.\nFlashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table.\nPause as he lets it sink in.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(worried)\nBoss, what we gonna do now?\n\nTONY\nDo? We're gonna war that's what we gonna do.\nWe gonna eat Sosa for breakfast. We're gonna close that\nfucker down.\n\nErnie and Chi-Chi sharing a look.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(eyeing the coke)\nHey Tony, why don't you go easy on that stuff, hunh?\n\nTony looks up at him, focuses. The eyes are uncompromising.\nErnie, a little scared of him now, turns away. Chi-Chi follows.\n\nTony starts on another trek along the coffee table.\n\nCUT TO\n225 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225\nThe Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.\nA monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.\nThe monkeys listen quietly.\nThe flamingoes flutter.\n. . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go...\n\n. . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.\n. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the\nbalustrade. He's done so much coke now he's practically\ncatatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.\n\nTONY\n(insensate)\n. . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let 'em try, I bury the cocksuckers....\n\nHis point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.\nTony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!\n\nTONY\n...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...\nWell what the hell happened, hunh?\nWhat the hell happened to us?...\n\nIn far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:\n\nThe main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures spring\nout at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.\n\nAnother monitor now reveals two more figures moving into\nthe interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.\n\nA third monitor carries another image of shadows moving\nthrough the trees on the estate.\n\nOn the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost\nincoherent.\n\nTONY\n...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would\nyou sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...\n\nAs Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:\n\nTONY\n...we still are Manny, we still are-- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy, you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines. Fan mail. Television stars, movie stars, shooting stars -- he's a star....\n\n\n226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226\nAs he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.\nTony sees her.\nShe steps forward, offering her body almost naked to her\nbrother.\n\nGINA\nIs this what you want Tony?...\n\nTony shocked.\n\nGINA\nYou can't stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.\n\nShe fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.\n\nThe bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.\n\nGINA\nI'm all yours Tony, I'm all yours now.\n\nBullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.\n\nGINA\nCome and get me Tony. Before it's too late.\n\nHe spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put\ndistance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an\nexpression like a demented angel.\n\nGINA\nCome on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!\n\nAdvancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair\nspilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony\nsquirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling\nover to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:\n\nA young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the\nhitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.\nHe doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.\n\nGina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the\nroom, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.\n\nTony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.\nThe punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.\n\nThe punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds\nat the base of the balcony.\nTony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and\nempties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.\n\nErnie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---\n\nERNIE\nGet outta here!\nTony, they're everywhere!\n\nErnie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.\n\nWe catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,\nmoving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly\nunderneath the balcony on which Tony stands.\n\nTony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back\ninto his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.\nIt takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.\n\nTONY\n(gently)\nHey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.\n\nRunning his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers.\n\nTONY tx:\nCome on Gina, get off the floor.\nYou're all dirty now, you need a bath...\nMami's gonna be angry baby\n-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..\nCome on open your eyes my baby,\nopen your eyes.. -give me a smile.\n\nThere's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.\nOne of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door\npounding it.\n\nCHI-CHI\nBoss ! Hey boss. Open up!\n\nOn the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire\ndown into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade\ngoes off, blows him up against the door.\n\nTONY\nCheeee!\n\nHe now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his\nsideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.\n\nOn the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the\nfoyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.\nThree of them are already huddled outside the door, around\nthe corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.\n\nTony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,\ntalking to himself.\n\nTONY\nSo you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.\n\nKarroooomph!\nThe rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.\nIt sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.\n\nTony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex\nof the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.\n\nTONY\nWhores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?\n\nAnother hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.\n\nTONY\nWho you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes. I take you all to fuckin' hell!\n\nAnother hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.\nA grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing\naway. Laughing like a madman.\n\nTONY\nYou need an army you hear! An army to kill me!\n\nBehind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go\nup in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white. It is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the terrace towards Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun.\n\nTONY\nHa ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces!!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!\n\nThe Skull, now inches from Tony's back, pulls the trigger and blows Tony's spine out his belly.\n\nTony crashes forward over the banister into the interior\nswimming pool below.\n\nHe floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters.\n\nAs the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is\nexpressive salsa with a dash of gaiety.\n\nThe camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters. It says:\n\"THE WORLD IS YOURS\"\nAnd so, for the brief moment, it was.\n\nOur camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool,\npanning past the dream villa, past the shambles and the\nwealth, past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing\nthat obscene word \"Chivato\" in blood on the outside walls,\npast the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like leaves in autumn, with the looters running after it across the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down Coconut\nGrove -- to the Miami skyline across Biscayne Bay\n\nTHE ENDEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2,

around\nThis is your hometown\"\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is your hometown\nThis is your hometown\nThis is your hometown\n[Verse 2]\nIn '65 tension was running high at my high school\nThere was a lot of fights 'tween the black and white\nThere was nothing you could do\nTwo cars at a light on a Saturday night\nIn the back seat there was a gun\nWords were passed, a shotgun blast\nTroubled times had come to my hometown\n\n[Chorus]\nTo my hometown\nTo my hometown\nTo my hometown\n\n[Bridge]\nNow Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores\nSeems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more\nThey're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks\nForeman says \"These jobs are going, boys\nAnd they ain't coming back\nTo your hometown\"\n\n[Chorus]\nTo your hometown\nTo your hometown\nTo your hometown\nSee Bruce Springsteen LiveGet tickets as low as $14You might also like[Verse 3]\nLast night me and Kate, we laid in bed\nTalking about getting

transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him.

Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.)

How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need.

The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father! Little father!\n\nTHE BABES AND SUCKLINGS\n\nClap clap hands till Poldy comes home,\nCakes in his pocket for Leo alone.\n\n\n(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)\n\n\nBABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.)

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!\n\n\nTHE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!\n\n\n(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.)

Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood.

I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Just like old times. Poor Bloom!\n\n(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)\n\nREUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.\n\n(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)\n\nTHE CITIZEN Thank heaven!\n\nBLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.\n\n(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)\n\nTHE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.\n\n(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in.

Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\n\nZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.\n\nFLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.\n\nSTEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end.

Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.\n\nLYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.\n\n(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss!

Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia.

Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.)

What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum.

The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo!

Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.)

A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches.

The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready.

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's.

R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!\n\n(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements.

He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks.

Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand!

(His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier.

After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers.

Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action.

What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly.

Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/5578995", "artist_names": "LIL RRAZ", "full_title": "WATCH ME

along\nI used to just get lost\nI only heard the things I wanted to hear\nIt always seemed like no one cared\nBut then you took the time\nAnd now I look and everything seems clear\n\n[Chorus]\nYou've got me understanding (-standing)\nYou've really helped me see\nI'm finally understanding (-standing)\nIt's meant so much to me\nYou've got me understanding (-standing)\nYou've given me some pride\nI'm finally understanding (-standing)\nYou're really on my side\nYou're really on my side (Yeah, yeah, ooh)\nGot me understanding\n\n[Outro]\nUnderstanding\n(You've got me understanding)\nMmm yeah, understanding, understanding\nYou've got me understanding\nFor the first time\nYou've got me understanding (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nYou've got me understanding\nYou've got me understandingYou might also

eyes a deep blue-green\nThe belle of St. Mark wore clothes that belonged to his father\nEven though he was only seventeen\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm in love\nI'm in love\nI'm in love with the belle of St. Mark\nIt tears me apart whenever I hear him cry\nI'm in love\nI'm in love\nI'm in love with the belle of St. Mark\nAnd if he doesn't love me\nI think I'll probably die\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou can tell from expressions that he makes public\nThat he suffers from a badly broken heart\nHe smiles as he feeds the afternoon pigeons\nBut he cries as he walks the night streets of St. Mark\n\nI'm in love\nI'm in love\nI'm in love with the belle of St. Mark\nIt tears me apart whenever I hear him cry\n\nI'm in love\nI'm in love\nI'm in love with the belle of St. Mark\nAnd if he doesn't love me\nI think I'll probably die\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe belle of St. Mark\nHe don't talk to strangers\nHe's so mysterious\nHis erotic persuasion provokes me like no other man\nThe fire I have for him is undoubtedly serious\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nI need to make him see that he needs love to forget\nAnd if anyone can help him\nI can\nI can help\nI can help you\n\n[Verse 3]\nHis Paris hair\nIt blows in the warm Parisian air\nThat blows whenever his Paris hair is there\nThe woman that hurt him surely must have trouble sleeping\nCause the belle of St. Mark is a beauty extraordinaire\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I'm in love\nI'm in love\nI'm in love with the belle of St. Mark\nIt tears me apart whenever I hear him cry\n\nI'm in love\nI'm in love\nI'm in love with the belle of St. Mark\nAnd if he doesn't love me\nI think I'll probably die\nOoh, I'm in love\nI'm in love\nI'm in love with the belle of St. Mark\nIt tears me apart whenever I hear him cry\n\nOoh, I'm in love\nI'm in love\nI'm in love with the belle of St. Mark\n\nAnd if he doesn't love me\nI think I'll probably die\nAnd if he doesn't love me\nI think I'll probably die\nAnd if he don't, I'll dieEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count":

keep the conversation light\nI guess I'm just frightened out of my mind\n\nBut if that's how I feel\nThen it's the best feeling I've ever known\nIt's undeniably real\nLeave a tender moment alone\nYes I know I'm in love\nBut just when I ought to relax\nI put my foot in my mouth\n'Cause I'm just avoiding the facts\n\nIf the girl gets too close\nIf I need some room to escape\nWhen the moment arrives\nI'd tell her it's all a mistake\n\nBut that's not how I feel\nNo that's not the woman I've known\nShe's undeniably real\nSo leave a tender moment alone\n\nBut it's not only me\nBreaking down when the tension gets high\nJust when I'm in a serious mood\nShe is suddenly quiet and shy\n\nLeave a tender moment\nLeave it alone\n(Leave a tender moment alone)\n\nI know the moment isn't right\nTo

forgot)\nJam on it\n(Oh)\n(Oh, Chilly B, get down, ho)\n(Uh, oh, here comes Cozmo)\n(Ho)\n(Do we get to say wikki-wikki-wikki again?)\nWikki-wikki-wikki-wikki\n(Shut up)\nWikki-wikki-wikki-wikki\n[Verse 1: Cozmo D]\nThree words to the wack \"step yourself back\"\n'Cause we're gettin' down, and ain't givin' no slack\nLike a Burger King with a sack of Big Macs\nWe're throwin' down with a rack of Bozaks\nOne time, in your mind you see\nYou gotta boogie to your best ability\nYou gotta funk it up until it knocks you down\nAnd when you've funked enough, make sure you pass it around\nCome on, let's go to work\nWe got what'll make your body jerk\nMake you throw your hands up in the air\nShake your booty and scream, oh yeah\n'Cause we are the Jam-On Crew\nAnd jammin' on it is how we do the do\nWe'll funk you up until you boogie down\nSo come on people check out the sound\nCheck out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound\nCheck out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound\n\n(Jam on it)\n\nSay, don't ya hear the sound\nJam-On is gettin' down\n\n(Jam on it)\nYou might also

and I'm sure you'll soon agree\nThat I've got no flaws 'cause I'm down by law when it comes to rockin' viciously, you see\n'Cause when I was a little baby boy, my mama gave me a brand new toy\nTwo turntables with a mic, and I learned to rock like Dolemite\nTime went by, on this God's creation, I knew someday I would rock the nation\nSo I made up my mind just what to do and I joined with the Jam-On Production Crew\nSo go crazy, go crazy, don't let your body be lazy\nI said don't stop the body rock till your eyesight starts to get hazy\nClean out your ears and you open your eyes\nIf you wanna hear the music just come alive\nAn if you don't know how get ready to learn\nCause Cozmo's takin' his turn to burn\n\n[Verse 3: Cozmo D]\nYou take a C, an O and a Z\nThen you add M-O and a freaky D\nAdd a funky beat, and then what do you see\nIt's Cozmo D, yeah, baby, that's me\nI've got the beat that's, oh, so sweet\nWithout me rockin' it's incomplete\nSo rock this y'all, rock that y'all\nRock on and don't you dare stop\nYou rock this, rock that, and that's a fact\n'Cause the Jam-On Crew will rock your body right back\nRock a steam locomotive right off the track\nAnd give the whole wide world a funk attack\nA to the beat y'all, get down\nLet me rock you to the rhythm of the funky sound\nFrom hill to hill, from sea to sea\nWhen Jam On's rockin' everybody screams (Jam on it)\nJam on it\nJam on and on, on and on it\nAnd if you're feelin' like you wanna dance all night\nThen go on ahead and flaunt it\n'Cause jammin' on is what we do best\nIt's what separates us from the rest\nAnd if you don't think our crew's down for real\nLet me tell you what happened to the man of steel\n(Say Superman had came to town to see who he could rock)\n(He blew away every crew he faced until he reached our block)\n(His speakers were three stories high, with woofers made of steel)\n(And when we brought our set outside, he said) \"Hah, be for real!\"\nHe said, I'm faster than a speedin' bullet when I'm on the set\nI don't need no fans to cool my amps, I just use my super breath\nI could fly three times around the world without missin' a beat\nI socialize with X-ray eyes, and the ladies think it's sweet\n(And then he turned his power on and the ground began to move)\n(And all the buildings for miles around were swayin' to the groove)\n(And just when he had pulled the crowd and swore he'd won the fight)\nWe rocked his butt with a 12 inch cut called \"Disco Kryptonite\"\n(Rock'em Cozmo!)\nWell, Superman looked up at me, he said, \"You rock so naturally\"\nI said now that you've learned the deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real\nI'm Cozmo D from outer space\nI came to rock the human race\nI do it right 'cause I can't do it wrong\nThat's why the whole world is singin' this song\n(Jam on it) Jam on it\nI said jam-j-j-j-jam on it\nAs day turns to night and night turns to day\nWhatever time it is I wanna hear you say\n(Jam on it) Jam on it\nI said jam-m-m-m-m, jam on it\nJam all around and upside down\nKeep jammin' to the Jam On Production sound\n\n[Chilly B]\n(Jam on it) Jam on it\nI said jam-j-j-j-jam on it\nI said Jam On is the funky beat that takes control\nWith the sure shot boogie that'll rock your soul\n(Jam on it) Jam on it\nI said jam-j-j-j-jam on it\nGet outta your seat and jam to the beat\nAnd don't you dare stop till early mornin'\n\nJam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it\nJam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it\n\n(Yeah, that's how you do it Cozmo)\n(You rocked it, that's the way you do it)\n(Yeah, like, did you see when he went in the corner)\n(And he started doin' this)\n(Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki)\n(Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki)\n\n(Ah, man, this is too funky for me)\n(I'm goin' home)\n(Hey, Mergatroid, let's go)\n(Hey, you fellas seen my sister Mergatroid?)\n(She was standin' over here just a minute ago)\n(Yeah, I think I saw her over there with Grand D)\n(He's rockin' the mic, you know)\n(Diggy dang diggy dang da dang dang da diggy diggy diggy dang dang)\n(Di-r-r-r-ggy dang diggy diggy)\n\n(The beat is getting fresh ya know)\n(Yeah fresh!)\n\nSay, don't ya hear the sound\nJam On is gettin' down6Embed"}, {"_type":

come home at all\n\nThen one day Sonny stopped comin' round\nHeard he'd gotten himself into\nA little trouble out in town\nSometime after that\nHe finally disappeared for good\nThen he pulled that ol'

night\nHer eyes had a light\nThere was something familiar about the smell of her skin\nHe held her tighter and tighter\nAs he danced inside her\nShe know from the moment that she let him in\n\nThey'd

feeling bad\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThrough the heat of the fire\nAnd the trouble that we're going through\nThere's no harm, there's no danger\nBecause our love is really tried and true\n[Chorus]\nAnd I want you here beside me, I need you\n'Cause nobody's going to love me the way that you do\nBaby, won't you come and hold me, hold me in your arms?\nDidn't tell you that I need you?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI need you by my side\nAnd although we're gonna fight sometimes\nI need you by my side\nPlease don't walk away and we'll be fine\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThrough the heat of the fire\nAnd the trouble that we're going through\nThere's no harm, there's no danger\nBecause our love is really tried and true\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I want you here beside me, I need you\n'Cause nobody's going to love me the way that you do\nBaby, won't you come and hold me, hold me in your arms?\nDidn't tell you that I need you?\n\n[Bridge]\nI, I need you, oh, oh\nI need you, yes, I do\nYou might also likeThrough the heat (Through
