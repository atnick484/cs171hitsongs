Unpleasant places to have to go down to; but very convenient, I dare say.'\n\n'Yes, I shouldn't wonder if they was convenient,' replied the gentleman, 'seeing that a few people live there, pretty snug. That's the Fair, that is.'\n\n'My friend,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'you don't really mean to say that human beings live down in those wretched dungeons?'\n'Don't I?' replied Mr. Roker, with indignant astonishment; 'why shouldn't I?'\n'Live!\u2014live down there!' exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Live down there! Yes, and die down there, too, very often!' replied Mr. Roker; 'and what of that? Who's got to say anything agin it? Live down there! Yes, and a wery good place it is to live in, ain't it?'\n\nAs Roker turned somewhat fiercely upon Mr. Pickwick in saying this, and moreover muttered in an excited fashion certain unpleasant invocations concerning his own eyes, limbs, and circulating fluids, the latter gentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the discourse no further. Mr. Roker then proceeded to mount another staircase, as dirty as that which led to the place which has just been the subject of discussion, in which ascent he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick and Sam.\n\n'There,' said Mr. Roker, pausing for breath when they reached another gallery of the same dimensions as the one below, 'this is the coffee-room flight; the one above's the third, and the one above that's the top; and the room where you're a-going to sleep to-night is the warden's room, and it's this way\u2014come on.' Having said all this in a breath, Mr. Roker mounted another flight of stairs with Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller following at his heels.\n\nThese staircases received light from sundry windows placed at some little distance above the floor, and looking into a gravelled area bounded by a high brick wall, with iron CHEVAUX-DE-FRISE at the top. This area, it appeared from Mr. Roker's statement, was the racket-ground; and it further appeared, on the testimony of the same gentleman, that there was a smaller area in that portion of the prison which was nearest Farringdon Street, denominated and called 'the Painted Ground,' from the fact of its walls having once displayed the semblance of various men-of-war in full sail, and other artistical effects achieved in bygone times by some imprisoned draughtsman in his leisure hours.\n\nHaving communicated this piece of information, apparently more for the purpose of discharging his bosom of an important fact, than with any specific view of enlightening Mr. Pickwick, the guide, having at length reached another gallery, led the way into a small passage at the extreme end, opened a door, and disclosed an apartment of an appearance by no means inviting, containing eight or nine iron bedsteads.\n'There,' said Mr. Roker, holding the door open, and looking triumphantly round at Mr. Pickwick, 'there's a room!'\n\nMr. Pickwick's face, however, betokened such a very trifling portion of satisfaction at the appearance of his lodging, that Mr. Roker looked, for a reciprocity of feeling, into the countenance of Samuel Weller, who, until now, had observed a dignified silence. 'There's a room, young man,' observed Mr. Roker.\n\n'I see it,' replied Sam, with a placid nod of the head.\n'You wouldn't think to find such a room as this in the Farringdon Hotel, would you?' said Mr. Roker, with a complacent smile.\n\nTo this Mr. Weller replied with an easy and unstudied closing of one eye; which might be considered to mean, either that he would have thought it, or that he would not have thought it, or that he had never thought anything at all about it, as the observer's imagination suggested. Having executed this feat, and reopened his eye, Mr. Weller proceeded to inquire which was the individual bedstead that Mr. Roker had so flatteringly described as an out-and-outer to sleep in.\n\n'That's it,' replied Mr. Roker, pointing to a very rusty one in a corner. 'It would make any one go to sleep, that bedstead would, whether they wanted to or not.'\n'I should think,' said Sam, eyeing the piece of furniture in question with a look of excessive disgust\u2014'I should think poppies was nothing to it.'\n'Nothing at all,' said Mr. Roker.\n\n'And I s'pose,' said Sam, with a sidelong glance at his master, as if to see whether there were any symptoms of his determination being shaken by what passed, 'I s'pose the other gen'l'men as sleeps here ARE gen'l'men.'\n'Nothing but it,' said Mr. Roker. 'One of 'em takes his twelve pints of ale a day, and never leaves off smoking even at his meals.'\n'He must be a first-rater,' said Sam.\n'A1,' replied Mr. Roker.\nNothing daunted, even by this intelligence, Mr. Pickwick smilingly announced his determination to test the powers of the narcotic bedstead for that night; and Mr. Roker, after informing him that he could retire to rest at whatever hour he thought proper, without any further notice or formality, walked off, leaving him standing with Sam in the gallery.\n\nIt was getting dark; that is to say, a few gas jets were kindled in this place which was never light, by way of compliment to the evening, which had set in outside. As it was rather warm, some of the tenants of the numerous little rooms which opened into the gallery on either hand, had set their doors ajar. Mr. Pickwick peeped into them as he passed along, with great curiosity and interest. Here, four or five great hulking fellows, just visible through a cloud of tobacco smoke, were engaged in noisy and riotous conversation over half-emptied pots of beer, or playing at all-fours with a very greasy pack of cards. In the adjoining room, some solitary tenant might be seen poring, by the light of a feeble tallow candle, over a bundle of soiled and tattered papers, yellow with dust and dropping to pieces from age, writing, for the hundredth time, some lengthened statement of his grievances, for the perusal of some great man whose eyes it would never reach, or whose heart it would never touch. In a third, a man, with his wife and a whole crowd of children, might be seen making up a scanty bed on the ground, or upon a few chairs, for the younger ones to pass the night in. And in a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth, and a seventh, the noise, and the beer, and the tobacco smoke, and the cards, all came over again in greater force than before.\n\nIn the galleries themselves, and more especially on the stair-cases, there lingered a great number of people, who came there, some because their rooms were empty and lonesome, others because their rooms were full and hot; the greater part because they were restless and uncomfortable, and not possessed of the secret of exactly knowing what to do with themselves. There were many classes of people here, from the labouring man in his fustian jacket, to the broken-down spendthrift in his shawl dressing-gown, most appropriately out at elbows; but there was the same air about them all\u2014a kind of listless, jail-bird, careless swagger, a vagabondish who's-afraid sort of bearing, which is wholly indescribable in words, but which any man can understand in one moment if he wish, by setting foot in the nearest debtors' prison, and looking at the very first group of people he sees there, with the same interest as Mr. Pickwick did.\n\n'It strikes me, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, leaning over the iron rail at the stair-head-'it strikes me, Sam, that imprisonment for debt is scarcely any punishment at all.'\n'Think not, sir?' inquired Mr. Weller.\n\n'You see how these fellows drink, and smoke, and roar,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'It's quite impossible that they can mind it much.'\n\n'Ah, that's just the wery thing, Sir,' rejoined Sam, 'they don't mind it; it's a reg'lar holiday to them\u2014all porter and skittles. It's the t'other vuns as gets done over vith this sort o' thing; them down-hearted fellers as can't svig avay at the beer, nor play at skittles neither; them as vould pay if they could, and gets low by being boxed up. I'll tell you wot it is, sir; them as is always a-idlin' in public-houses it don't damage at all, and them as is alvays a-workin' wen they can, it damages too much. \"It's unekal,\" as my father used to say wen his grog worn't made half-and-half: \"it's unekal, and that's the fault on it.\"'\n\n'I think you're right, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, after a few moments' reflection, 'quite right.'\n\n'P'raps, now and then, there's some honest people as likes it,' observed Mr. Weller, in a ruminative tone, 'but I never heerd o' one as I can call to mind, 'cept the little dirty-faced man in the brown coat; and that was force of habit.'\n'And who was he?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Wy, that's just the wery point as nobody never know'd,' replied Sam.\n'But what did he do?'\n\n'Wy, he did wot many men as has been much better know'd has done in their time, Sir,' replied Sam, 'he run a match agin the constable, and vun it.'\n'In other words, I suppose,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'he got into debt.'\n\n'Just that, Sir,' replied Sam, 'and in course o' time he come here in consekens. It warn't much\u2014execution for nine pound nothin', multiplied by five for costs; but hows'ever here he stopped for seventeen year. If he got any wrinkles in his face, they were stopped up vith the dirt, for both the dirty face and the brown coat wos just the same at the end o' that time as they wos at the beginnin'. He wos a wery peaceful, inoffendin' little creetur, and wos alvays a-bustlin' about for somebody, or playin' rackets and never vinnin'; till at last the turnkeys they got quite fond on him, and he wos in the lodge ev'ry night, a-chattering vith 'em, and tellin' stories, and all that 'ere. Vun night he wos in there as usual, along vith a wery old friend of his, as wos on the lock, ven he says all of a sudden, \"I ain't seen the market outside, Bill,\" he says (Fleet Market wos there at that time)\u2014\"I ain't seen the market outside, Bill,\" he says, \"for seventeen year.\" \"I know you ain't,\" says the turnkey, smoking his pipe. \"I should like to see it for a minit, Bill,\" he says. \"Wery probable,\" says the turnkey, smoking his pipe wery fierce, and making believe he warn't up to wot the little man wanted. \"Bill,\" says the little man, more abrupt than afore, \"I've got the fancy in my head. Let me see the public streets once more afore I die; and if I ain't struck with apoplexy, I'll be back in five minits by the clock.\" \"And wot 'ud become o' me if you WOS struck with apoplexy?\" said the turnkey. \"Wy,\" says the little creetur, \"whoever found me, 'ud bring me home, for I've got my card in my pocket, Bill,\" he says, \"No. 20, Coffee-room Flight\": and that wos true, sure enough, for wen he wanted to make the acquaintance of any new-comer, he used to pull out a little limp card vith them words on it and nothin' else; in consideration of vich, he vos alvays called Number Tventy. The turnkey takes a fixed look at him, and at last he says in a solemn manner, \"Tventy,\" he says, \"I'll trust you; you Won't get your old friend into trouble.\" \"No, my boy; I hope I've somethin' better behind here,\" says the little man; and as he said it he hit his little vesket wery hard, and then a tear started out o' each eye, which wos wery extraordinary, for it wos supposed as water never touched his face. He shook the turnkey by the hand; out he vent\u2014'\n'And never came back again,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n'Wrong for vunce, sir,' replied Mr. Weller, 'for back he come, two minits afore the time, a-bilin' with rage, sayin' how he'd been nearly run over by a hackney-coach that he warn't used to it; and he was blowed if he wouldn't write to the lord mayor. They got him pacified at last; and for five years arter that, he never even so much as peeped out o' the lodge gate.'\n\n'At the expiration of that time he died, I suppose,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n'No, he didn't, Sir,' replied Sam. 'He got a curiosity to go and taste the beer at a new public-house over the way, and it wos such a wery nice parlour, that he took it into his head to go there every night, which he did for a long time, always comin' back reg'lar about a quarter of an hour afore the gate shut, which was all wery snug and comfortable. At last he began to get so precious jolly, that he used to forget how the time vent, or care nothin' at all about it, and he went on gettin' later and later, till vun night his old friend wos just a-shuttin' the gate\u2014had turned the key in fact\u2014wen he come up. \"Hold hard, Bill,\" he says. \"Wot, ain't you come home yet, Tventy?\" says the turnkey, \"I thought you wos in, long ago.\" \"No, I wasn't,\" says the little man, with a smile. \"Well, then, I'll tell you wot it is, my friend,\" says the turnkey, openin' the gate wery slow and sulky, \"it's my 'pinion as you've got into bad company o' late, which I'm wery sorry to see. Now, I don't wish to do nothing harsh,\" he says, \"but if you can't confine yourself to steady circles, and find your vay back at reg'lar hours, as sure as you're a-standin' there, I'll shut you out altogether!\" The little man was seized vith a wiolent fit o' tremblin', and never vent outside the prison walls artervards!'\n\nAs Sam concluded, Mr. Pickwick slowly retraced his steps downstairs. After a few thoughtful turns in the Painted Ground, which, as it was now dark, was nearly deserted, he intimated to Mr. Weller that he thought it high time for him to withdraw for the night; requesting him to seek a bed in some adjacent public-house, and return early in the morning, to make arrangements for the removal of his master's wardrobe from the George and Vulture. This request Mr. Samuel Weller prepared to obey, with as good a grace as he could assume, but with a very considerable show of reluctance nevertheless. He even went so far as to essay sundry ineffectual hints regarding the expediency of stretching himself on the gravel for that night; but finding Mr. Pickwick obstinately deaf to any such suggestions, finally withdrew.\n\nThere is no disguising the fact that Mr. Pickwick felt very low-spirited and uncomfortable\u2014not for lack of society, for the prison was very full, and a bottle of wine would at once have purchased the utmost good-fellowship of a few choice spirits, without any more formal ceremony of introduction; but he was alone in the coarse, vulgar crowd, and felt the depression of spirits and sinking of heart, naturally consequent on the reflection that he was cooped and caged up, without a prospect of liberation. As to the idea of releasing himself by ministering to the sharpness of Dodson & Fogg, it never for an instant entered his thoughts.\n\nIn this frame of mind he turned again into the coffee-room gallery, and walked slowly to and fro. The place was intolerably dirty, and the smell of tobacco smoke perfectly suffocating. There was a perpetual slamming and banging of doors as the people went in and out; and the noise of their voices and footsteps echoed and re-echoed through the passages constantly. A young woman, with a child in her arms, who seemed scarcely able to crawl, from emaciation and misery, was walking up and down the passage in conversation with her husband, who had no other place to see her in. As they passed Mr. Pickwick, he could hear the female sob bitterly; and once she burst into such a passion of grief, that she was compelled to lean against the wall for support, while the man took the child in his arms, and tried to soothe her.\n\nMr. Pickwick's heart was really too full to bear it, and he went upstairs to bed.\nNow, although the warder's room was a very uncomfortable one (being, in every point of decoration and convenience, several hundred degrees inferior to the common infirmary of a county jail), it had at present the merit of being wholly deserted save by Mr. Pickwick himself. So, he sat down at the foot of his little iron bedstead, and began to wonder how much a year the warder made out of the dirty room. Having satisfied himself, by mathematical calculation, that the apartment was about equal in annual value to the freehold of a small street in the suburbs of London, he took to wondering what possible temptation could have induced a dingy-looking fly that was crawling over his pantaloons, to come into a close prison, when he had the choice of so many airy situations\u2014a course of meditation which led him to the irresistible conclusion that the insect was insane. After settling this point, he began to be conscious that he was getting sleepy; whereupon he took his nightcap out of the pocket in which he had had the precaution to stow it in the morning, and, leisurely undressing himself, got into bed and fell asleep.\n\n'Bravo! Heel over toe\u2014cut and shuffle\u2014pay away at it, Zephyr! I'm smothered if the opera house isn't your proper hemisphere. Keep it up! Hooray!' These expressions, delivered in a most boisterous tone, and accompanied with loud peals of laughter, roused Mr. Pickwick from one of those sound slumbers which, lasting in reality some half-hour, seem to the sleeper to have been protracted for three weeks or a month.\nThe voice had no sooner ceased than the room was shaken with such violence that the windows rattled in their frames, and the bedsteads trembled again. Mr. Pickwick started up, and remained for some minutes fixed in mute astonishment at the scene before him.\n\nOn the floor of the room, a man in a broad-skirted green coat, with corduroy knee-smalls and gray cotton stockings, was performing the most popular steps of a hornpipe, with a slang and burlesque caricature of grace and lightness, which, combined with the very appropriate character of his costume, was inexpressibly absurd. Another man, evidently very drunk, who had probably been tumbled into bed by his companions, was sitting up between the sheets, warbling as much as he could recollect of a comic song, with the most intensely sentimental feeling and expression; while a third, seated on one of the bedsteads, was applauding both performers with the air of a profound connoisseur, and encouraging them by such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused Mr. Pickwick from his sleep.\n\nThis last man was an admirable specimen of a class of gentry which never can be seen in full perfection but in such places\u2014they may be met with, in an imperfect state, occasionally about stable-yards and Public-houses; but they never attain their full bloom except in these hot-beds, which would almost seem to be considerately provided by the legislature for the sole purpose of rearing them.\n\nHe was a tall fellow, with an olive complexion, long dark hair, and very thick bushy whiskers meeting under his chin. He wore no neckerchief, as he had been playing rackets all day, and his Open shirt collar displayed their full luxuriance. On his head he wore one of the common eighteenpenny French skull-caps, with a gaudy tassel dangling therefrom, very happily in keeping with a common fustian coat. His legs, which, being long, were afflicted with weakness, graced a pair of Oxford-mixture trousers, made to show the full symmetry of those limbs. Being somewhat negligently braced, however, and, moreover, but imperfectly buttoned, they fell in a series of not the most graceful folds over a pair of shoes sufficiently down at heel to display a pair of very soiled white stockings. There was a rakish, vagabond smartness, and a kind of boastful rascality, about the whole man, that was worth a mine of gold.\n\nThis figure was the first to perceive that Mr. Pickwick was looking on; upon which he winked to the Zephyr, and entreated him, with mock gravity, not to wake the gentleman. 'Why, bless the gentleman's honest heart and soul!' said the Zephyr, turning round and affecting the extremity of surprise; 'the gentleman is awake. Hem, Shakespeare! How do you do, Sir? How is Mary and Sarah, sir? and the dear old lady at home, Sir? Will you have the kindness to put my compliments into the first little parcel you're sending that way, sir, and say that I would have sent 'em before, only I was afraid they might be broken in the wagon, sir?'\n\n'Don't overwhelm the gentlemen with ordinary civilities when you see he's anxious to have something to drink,' said the gentleman with the whiskers, with a jocose air. 'Why don't you ask the gentleman what he'll take?'\n\n'Dear me, I quite forgot,' replied the other. 'What will you take, sir? Will you take port wine, sir, or sherry wine, sir? I can recommend the ale, sir; or perhaps you'd like to taste the porter, sir? Allow me to have the felicity of hanging up your nightcap, Sir.'\nWith this, the speaker snatched that article of dress from Mr. Pickwick's head, and fixed it in a twinkling on that of the drunken man, who, firmly impressed with the belief that he was delighting a numerous assembly, continued to hammer away at the comic song in the most melancholy strains imaginable.\n\nTaking a man's nightcap from his brow by violent means, and adjusting it on the head of an unknown gentleman, of dirty exterior, however ingenious a witticism in itself, is unquestionably one of those which come under the denomination of practical jokes. Viewing the matter precisely in this light, Mr. Pickwick, without the slightest intimation of his purpose, sprang vigorously out of bed, struck the Zephyr so smart a blow in the chest as to deprive him of a considerable portion of the commodity which sometimes bears his name, and then, recapturing his nightcap, boldly placed himself in an attitude of defence.\n\n'Now,' said Mr. Pickwick, gasping no less from excitement than from the expenditure of so much energy, 'come on\u2014both of you\u2014both of you!' With this liberal invitation the worthy gentleman communicated a revolving motion to his clenched fists, by way of appalling his antagonists with a display of science.\n\nIt might have been Mr. Pickwick's very unexpected gallantry, or it might have been the complicated manner in which he had got himself out of bed, and fallen all in a mass upon the hornpipe man, that touched his adversaries. Touched they were; for, instead of then and there making an attempt to commit man-slaughter, as Mr. Pickwick implicitly believed they would have done, they paused, stared at each other a short time, and finally laughed outright.\n\n'Well, you're a trump, and I like you all the better for it,' said the Zephyr. 'Now jump into bed again, or you'll catch the rheumatics. No malice, I hope?' said the man, extending a hand the size of the yellow clump of fingers which sometimes swings over a glover's door.\n\n'Certainly not,' said Mr. Pickwick, with great alacrity; for, now that the excitement was over, he began to feel rather cool about the legs.\n\n'Allow me the H-onour,' said the gentleman with the whiskers, presenting his dexter hand, and aspirating the h.\n\n'With much pleasure, sir,' said Mr. Pickwick; and having executed a very long and solemn shake, he got into bed again.\n\n'My name is Smangle, sir,' said the man with the whiskers.\n'Oh,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Mine is Mivins,' said the man in the stockings.\n'I am delighted to hear it, sir,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n'Hem,' coughed Mr. Smangle.\n'Did you speak, sir?' said Mr. Pickwick.\n'No, I did not, sir,' said Mr. Smangle.\nAll this was very genteel and pleasant; and, to make matters still more comfortable, Mr. Smangle assured Mr. Pickwick a great many more times that he entertained a very high respect for the feelings of a gentleman; which sentiment, indeed, did him infinite credit, as he could be in no wise supposed to understand them.\n\n'Are you going through the court, sir?' inquired Mr. Smangle. 'Through the what?' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Through the court\u2014Portugal Street\u2014the Court for Relief of\u2014You know.'\n'Oh, no,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'No, I am not.'\n'Going out, perhaps?' suggested Mr. Mivins.\n'I fear not,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'I refuse to pay some damages, and am here in consequence.'\n\n'Ah,' said Mr. Smangle, 'paper has been my ruin.'\n'A stationer, I presume, Sir?' said Mr. Pickwick innocently.\n'Stationer! No, no; confound and curse me! Not so low as that. No trade. When I say paper, I mean bills.'\n\n'Oh, you use the word in that sense. I see,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'Damme! A gentleman must expect reverses,' said Smangle. 'What of that? Here am I in the Fleet Prison. Well; good. What then? I'm none the worse for that, am I?'\n\n'Not a bit,' replied Mr. Mivins. And he was quite right; for, so far from Mr. Smangle being any the worse for it, he was something the better, inasmuch as to qualify himself for the place, he had attained gratuitous possession of certain articles of jewellery, which, long before that, had found their way to the pawnbroker's.\n\n'Well; but come,' said Mr. Smangle; 'this is dry work. Let's rinse our mouths with a drop of burnt sherry; the last-comer shall stand it, Mivins shall fetch it, and I'll help to drink it. That's a fair and gentlemanlike division of labour, anyhow. Curse me!'\nUnwilling to hazard another quarrel, Mr. Pickwick gladly assented to the proposition, and consigned the money to Mr. Mivins, who, as it was nearly eleven o'clock, lost no time in repairing to the coffee-room on his errand.\n\n'I say,' whispered Smangle, the moment his friend had left the room; 'what did you give him?'\n'Half a sovereign,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n'He's a devilish pleasant gentlemanly dog,' said Mr. Smangle;\u2014'infernal pleasant. I don't know anybody more so; but\u2014' Here Mr. Smangle stopped short, and shook his head dubiously.\n\n'You don't think there is any probability of his appropriating the money to his own use?' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Oh, no! Mind, I don't say that; I expressly say that he's a devilish gentlemanly fellow,' said Mr. Smangle. 'But I think, perhaps, if somebody went down, just to see that he didn't dip his beak into the jug by accident, or make some confounded mistake in losing the money as he came upstairs, it would be as well. Here, you sir, just run downstairs, and look after that gentleman, will you?'\n\nThis request was addressed to a little timid-looking, nervous man, whose appearance bespoke great poverty, and who had been crouching on his bedstead all this while, apparently stupefied by the novelty of his situation.\n\n'You know where the coffee-room is,' said Smangle; 'just run down, and tell that gentleman you've come to help him up with the jug. Or\u2014stop\u2014I'll tell you what\u2014I'll tell you how we'll do him,' said Smangle, with a cunning look.\n'How?' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Send down word that he's to spend the change in cigars. Capital thought. Run and tell him that; d'ye hear? They shan't be wasted,' continued Smangle, turning to Mr. Pickwick. 'I'LL smoke 'em.'\n\nThis manoeuvring was so exceedingly ingenious and, withal, performed with such immovable composure and coolness, that Mr. Pickwick would have had no wish to disturb it, even if he had had the power. In a short time Mr. Mivins returned, bearing the sherry, which Mr. Smangle dispensed in two little cracked mugs; considerately remarking, with reference to himself, that a gentleman must not be particular under such circumstances, and that, for his part, he was not too proud to drink out of the jug. In which, to show his sincerity, he forthwith pledged the company in a draught which half emptied it.\n\nAn excellent understanding having been by these means promoted, Mr. Smangle proceeded to entertain his hearers with a relation of divers romantic adventures in which he had been from time to time engaged, involving various interesting anecdotes of a thoroughbred horse, and a magnificent Jewess, both of surpassing beauty, and much coveted by the nobility and gentry of these kingdoms.\n\nLong before these elegant extracts from the biography of a gentleman were concluded, Mr. Mivins had betaken himself to bed, and had set in snoring for the night, leaving the timid stranger and Mr. Pickwick to the full benefit of Mr. Smangle's experiences.\n\nNor were the two last-named gentlemen as much edified as they might have been by the moving passages narrated. Mr. Pickwick had been in a state of slumber for some time, when he had a faint perception of the drunken man bursting out afresh with the comic song, and receiving from Mr. Smangle a gentle intimation, through the medium of the water-jug, that his audience was not musically disposed. Mr. Pickwick then once again dropped off to sleep, with a confused consciousness that Mr. Smangle was still engaged in relating a long story, the chief point of which appeared to be that, on some occasion particularly stated and set forth, he had 'done' a bill and a gentleman at the same time.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/55067", "artist_names":

things to myself\nI like to keep my issues drawn\nIt's always darkest before the dawn\n\n[Verse 1]\nAnd I've been a fool and I've been blind\nI can never leave the past behind\nI can see no way, I can see no way\nI'm always dragging that horse around\nAll of his questions, such a mournful sound\nTonight, I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground\n'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn\nBut it's always darkest before the dawn\n[Chorus]\nShake it out, shake it out\nShake it out, shake it out, oh-woah\nShake it out, shake it out\nShake it out, shake it out, oh-woah\nAnd it's hard to dance with a devil on your back\nSo shake him off, oh-woah\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I am done with my graceless heart\nSo tonight, I'm gonna cut it out and then restart\n'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn\nIt's always

a clean soul\nIt breaks his heart seein' foreign cars filled with fuel that isn't ours\nAnd wearin' cotton we didn't grow\n\n[Chorus]\nHe's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm\nSemper Fi tattooed on his left arm\nSpend a little more at the store for a tag\nIn the back that says U-S-A\nHe won't buy nothin' that he can't fix\nWith WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench\nHe ain't prejudiced, he's just\nMade in America\n[Verse 2]\nHe loves his wife, but she's that wife that decorates on the 4th of July\nBut says, \"Every day's Independence Day\"\nShe's golden rule, teaches school, some folks say it isn't cool\nBut she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway\n\n[Chorus]\nHe's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm\nSemper Fi tattooed on his left arm\nSpend a little more in the store for a tag\nIn the back that says U-S-A\nHe won't buy nothin' that he can't fix\nWith WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench\nHe ain't prejudiced, he's just\nMade in America\n\n[Bridge]\nBorn in the heartland, raised up a family\nOf King James and Uncle Sam\n\n[Chorus]\nHe's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm\nSemper Fi tattooed on his left arm\nSpend a little more in the store for a tag\nIn the back that says U-S-A\nWon't buy nothin' that he can't fix\nWith WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench\nHe ain't prejudiced, he's just\nMade in America\nYou might also like[Outro]\nMade in America\nMade in

sunset\nHelps me to realize\nThis is just a journey, drop your worries\nYou are gonna turn out fine\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, you turn out fine\nFine, oh, you turn out fine\n\n[Chorus]\nBut you gotta keep

into skeptics\nSkeptics mess with the confidence in my eyes\nI'm seeing all the angles, thoughts get tangled\nI start to compromise my life and my purpose\nIs it all worth it?\nAm I gonna turn out

boots in the Georgia mud\nGonna watch you make me fall in love\nGet up on the hood of my daddy's tractor\nUp on the toolbox, it don't matter\nDown on the tailgate, girl I can't wait\nTo watch you do your thing\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks\nFor the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn\nFor the DJ spinnin' that country song\nCome on, come on, come on\nShake it for the birds, shake it for the bees\nShake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek\nFor the crickets and the critters and the squirrels\nShake it to the moon, shake it for me, girl, aww\n\n[Chorus]\nCountry girl, shake it for me, girl\nShake it for me, girl, shake it for me\nCountry girl, shake it for me, girl\nShake it for me, girl, shake it for me\n\n[Verse 2]\nSomebody's sweet little farmer's child\nWith a gattle in her Bud to get a little wild\nPony tail and a pretty smile\nRope me in from a country mile\nSo come on over here and get in my arms\nSpin me around this

nothing\nYou, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard\nCalling me out when I'm wounded\nYou, pickin' on the weaker man\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWell, you can take me down\nWith just one single blow\nBut you don't know what you don't know\n[Chorus]\nSomeday, I'll be livin' in a big old city\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\nSomeday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou, with your switching sides\nAnd your wildfire lies and your humiliation\nYou have pointed out my flaws again\nAs if I don't already see them\nI walk with my head down, trying to block you out\n'Cause I'll never impress you\nI just wanna feel okay again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI bet you got pushed around\nSomebody made you cold\nBut the cycle ends right now\n'Cause you can't lead me down that road\nAnd you don't know what you don't know\n\n[Chorus]\nSomeday, I'll be livin' in a big old city\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\nSomeday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $250You might also like[Bridge]\nAnd I can see you years from now in a bar\nTalking over a football game\nWith that same big, loud opinion\nBut nobody's listening\nWashed up and ranting about the same old bitter things\nDrunk and grumblin' on about how I can't sing\nBut all you are is mean\n\n[Builtup]\nAll you are is mean\nAnd a liar, and pathetic\nAnd alone in life, and mean\nAnd mean, and mean, and mean\n\n[Chorus]\nBut someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\nYeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\nSomeday, I'll be livin' in a big old city\n(Why you gotta be so mean?)\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\n(Why you gotta be so mean?)\nSomeday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\n(Why you gotta be so

need a doctor, call me a doctor\nI need a doctor, doctor\nTo bring me back to life\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI told the world, one day I would pay it back\nSay it on tape, and lay it, record it\nSo that one day I could play it back\nBut I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that\nDoubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black\nHope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision\nWhen I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack\nBut they don't know what dope is\nAnd I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this\nAll I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest\nYou picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you\nBut for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do\nBut it just dawned on me you lost a son\nDemons fightin' you, it's dark\nLet me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you\nI don't think you realize what you mean to me\nNot the slightest clue\n'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick\nYou gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic\nOr you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options\nThere's nothin' else I can do 'cause\u2014\n[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nI'm about

you struggle, you come to me with ideas\nYou say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled\n'Cause the shit I hear is crazy\nBut you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more\nSeems like your own opinions, not one you can form\nCan't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself\nSecond guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help\nLike I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor\nI can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are\nIt was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you\nDon't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth\nYou risked your career for me, I know it as well as you\nNobody wanted to fuck with the white boy\nDre, I'm cryin' in this booth\nYou saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours\nBut I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more\nBut I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me\nGet up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you\nCome back, for fuck's sake, 'cause\u2014\nYou

it was just yesterday, though\nYou walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes\nOnce you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke\nWent through friends, some of them I put on, but they

you choke\nOn the noose around your neck\nAnd I'll find strength in pain\nAnd I will change my ways\nI'll know my name as it's called again\n\n[Verse 2]\n'Cause I have other things to fill my time\nYou take what is yours and I'll take mine\nNow let me at the truth\nWhich will refresh my broken mind\nSo tie me to a post and block my ears\nI can see widows and orphans through my tears\nI know my call despite my faults\nAnd despite my growing fears\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I will hold on hope\nAnd I won't let you choke\nOn the noose around your neck\nAnd I'll find strength in pain\nAnd I will

dependence\nWhen you know the maker's land\n\n[Chorus 2]\nSo make your siren's call\nAnd sing all you want\nI will not hear what you have to say\n'Cause I need freedom now\nAnd I need to know how\nTo live my life as it's meant to be\n\n[Chorus/Outro]\nAnd I will hold on hope\nAnd I won't let you choke\nOn the noose around your neck\nAnd I'll find strength in pain\nAnd I will change my ways\nI'll

hello, but you know what it does to me to see your number on the phone\nNow tell me, what do you want? What do you want? What do you want from me?\nAre you tryin' to bring back the tears or just the memories?\nYou keep takin' me back, takin' me back where I've already been\nWhen we hang up it's almost like I'm losing you again\nCan't you see? So what do you want, what do you want from me?\n\nI get so tired of living like this\nI don't have the time, neither do my friends\nTo stay up at night, to pull me through\nAnd to find the things to keep my mind off of you\nSo, now tell me, what do you want? What do you want? What do you want from me?\nDid you call to say you've found someone and I'm a used- to- be\nYou keep takin' me back, takin' me back where I've already been\nIf you've moved on why does it feel like I'm losing you again?\nCan't you see? So what do you want? What do you want from me?\n\nWhat do you want me to say?\nThat I'm content? That I'm on the fence? That I wish you would've stayed?\nOh baby what do you want, what do you want, what do you want from me?\nTo come here and make love tonight cause you're feelin' lonely\nYou keep takin' me back, takin' me back where I've already been\nWhen we wake up and say goodbye it's like I'm losing you again\nCan't you see?

Tell me, how's your family?\nI haven't seen them in a while\nYou've been good, busier than ever\nWe small talk, work and the weather\nYour guard is up and I know why\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBecause the last time you saw me\nIs still burned in the back of your mind\nYou gave me roses and I left them there to die\n[Chorus]\nSo, this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying, \"I'm sorry for that night\"\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI go back to December all the time\n\n[Verse 2]\nThese days, I haven't been sleeping\nStaying up, playing back myself leaving\nWhen your birthday passed and I didn't call\nAnd I think about summer, all the beautiful times\nI watched you laughing from the passenger side\nAnd realized I loved you in the fall\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd then the cold came, the dark days\nWhen fear crept into my mind\nYou gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you, saying, \"I'm sorry for that night\"\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $250You might also like[Bridge]\nI miss your tan skin, your sweet smile\nSo good to me, so right\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\nMaybe this is wishful thinking\nProbably mindless dreaming\nBut if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right\nI'd go back in time and change it, but I can't\nSo, if the chain is on your door, I understand\n\n[Chorus]\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you, saying, \"I'm sorry for that night\"\nAnd I go back to

who live by the code\nPut this music shit aside get it in on the road\nA lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose\nExotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold\nFollowing fundamentals and following in the rental\nI love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu\nThat money triple up when ya get it out of state\nI need a new safe cause I'm running out of space\nElroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space\nIn my 2-seater she's the one that I would take, wee\n\n[Hook: Chrisette Michele]\nRiding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night\nBreezing down the freeway just me and my

know nothing 'bout her\nBeen to hell and back, I can show you vouchers\nI'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour\nMarried to the game but she broke her vows\nThat's why my bars are full of broken bottles\nAnd my night stands are full of open Bibles, ugh\nI think about more than I forget\nBut I don't go 'round fire expecting not to sweat\nAnd these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed\nBitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg\nMoney outweighing problems on the triple beam\nI'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes\nBe good or be good at it\nFucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic\nYeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's \"fuck what they say\"\nI'm high as a bitch: up, up and away, man, I come down in a couple of days\nOK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode\nI got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code\nIt's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode\nAll about my dough but I don't even check the peephole\nSo you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down\nNo love lost, no love found\n[Hook: Eminem and Lil Wayne]\nIt's a little too late to say that you're sorry now\nYou kicked me when I was down\nBut what you say just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)\nThat's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you\nBitch you get (no love)\nYou show me nothing but hate\nYou ran me into the ground\nBut what comes around goes around\nI don't need you (don't hurt me)\nYou (don't hurt me no more)\nThat's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you\nYou get (no love)\nBitch you get (no love)\nAnd I don't need you\nGet 'em\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life\nI can, see these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen\nI'm a little bit sicker than, most\nShit's finna get thick again\nThey say the competition is stiff\nBut I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in\nI ain't never giving in again\nCaution to the wind, complete freedom\nLook at these rappers, how I treat 'em\nSo why the fuck would I join them when I beat 'em\nThey call me a freak cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em\nMan get these whack cocksuckers off stage\nWhere the fuck is Kanye when you need him\nSnatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute\nYeah that rap was tight\nBut I'm 'bout spit the greatest verse of all time\nSo you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um\nScribble out them rhymes you were going to spit\nAnd start over from scratch and write new ones\nBut I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference\nWhen I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight\nIt's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump\nFrom the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow\nSet fire to the mic and ignite the crowd\nYou can see the sparks from hot metal\nCold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game\nMy soul started to rot, fellow\nWhen I'm not even in my harshest\nYou can still get roasted cause Marsh is not mellow\n'til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop\nI'm standing on my Monopoly board\nThat means I'm on top of my game\nAnd it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore\nWhen you're so good that you can't say it\nCause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore\nPeople just get sick cause you spit\nThese fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore\nAnd you can never break my stride\nYou'll never slow the momentum at any moment, I'm 'bout to blow\nYou'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom\nAnd the opponent is getting no mercy, mark my words\nAin't letting up, relentless, I smell blood\nI don't give a fuck: keep giving 'em hell\nWhere was you when I fell and needed help up\nYou get no love\nYou might also like[Hook]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/192240", "artist_names": "George Strait", "full_title": "The Breath You Take
