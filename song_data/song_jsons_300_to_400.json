Hey, bust a move\n\n[Chorus]\nYou want it\nYou got it\nYou want it\nBaby you got it (Just bust a move)\nYou want it\nYou got it\nYou want it\nBaby you got it, yeah\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nIn the city, ladies look pretty\nGuys tell jokes so they can seem witty\nTell a funny joke just to get some play\nThen you try to make a move and she says, \"No way\"\nGirls are fakin', goodness sakin'\nThey want a man who brings home the bacon\nGot no money and you got no car\nThen you got no woman and there you are\nSome girls are sadistic, materialistic\nLookin' for a man makes them opportunistic\nThey're lyin' on the beach perpetrating a tan\nSo that a brother with money can be their man\nSo on the beach you're strollin', real high rollin'\nEverything you have is yours and not stolen\nA girl runs up with somethin' to prove\nSo don't just stand there, bust a move\n\n[Chorus]\nYou want it\nYou got it\nYou want it\nBaby you got it (Just bust a move)\nYou want it\nYou got it\nYou want it\nBaby you got it\n[Interlude]\nBreak it down for me fellas\n\n[Verse 4]\nYour best friend Harry has a brother Larry\nIn five days from now, he's gonna marry\nHe's hopin' you can make it there if you can\n'Cause in the ceremony, you'll be the best man\nYou say, \"neat-o\", check your libido\nAnd roll to the church in your new tuxedo\nThe bride walks down just to start the wedding\nAnd there's one more girl you won't be getting\nSo you start thinkin', then you start blinking\nA bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking\nShe thinks you're kinda cute, so she winks back\nAnd now your feelin' really firm 'cause the girl is stacked\nReception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'\nLook at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'\nSays she wanna dance to a different groove\nNow you know what to do, G, bust a move\n\n[Chorus]\nYou want it\nYou got it\nYou want it\nBaby you got it (Just bust a move)\nYou want it\nYou got it\nYou want it\nBaby you got it (move it boy)\nYeah19Embed"

Rumors fly\nAnd I know you heard about me\nSo, hey, let's be friends\nI'm dying to see how this one ends\nGrab your passport and my hand\nI can make the bad guys good for a weekend\n[Chorus]\nSo it's gonna be forever\nOr it's gonna go down in flames?\nYou can tell me when it's over, mmm\nIf the high was worth the pain\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\n'Cause you know I love the players\nAnd you love the game\n'Cause we're young and we're reckless\nWe'll take this way too far\nIt'll leave you breathless, mmm\nOr with a nasty scar\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\nBut I've got a blank space, baby\nAnd I'll write your name\n\n[Verse 3]\nCherry lips, crystal skies\nI could show you incredible things\nStolen kisses, pretty lies\nYou're the king, baby, I'm your queen\nFind out what you want\nBe that girl for a month\nWait, the worst is yet to come\nOh, no\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $250You might also like[Verse 4]\nScreaming, crying, perfect storms\nI can make all the tables turn\nRose garden filled with thorns\nKeep you second guessing, like\n\"Oh my God, who is she?\"\nI get drunk on jealousy\nBut you'll come back each time you leave\n'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream\n\n[Chorus]\nSo it's gonna be forever\nOr it's gonna go down in flames?\nYou can tell me when it's over, mmm\nIf the high was worth the pain\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\n'Cause you know I love the players\nAnd you love the game\n'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)\nWe'll take this way too far\nIt'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mmm\nOr with a nasty scar\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)\nBut I've got a blank space, baby\nAnd I'll write your name\n[Bridge]\nBoys only want love if it's torture\nDon't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya\nBoys only want love if it's torture\nDon't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya\n\n[Chorus]\nSo it's gonna be forever\nOr it's gonna go down in flames?\nYou can tell me when it's over (Over), mmm\nIf the high was worth the pain\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)\n'Cause you know I love the players\nAnd you love the game (And you love the game)\n'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)\nWe'll take this way too far (Ooh)\nIt'll leave you breathless, mmm\nOr with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)\nGot a long list of ex-lovers\nThey'll tell you I'm insane\nBut I've got a blank space, baby\nAnd I'll write your name1KEmbed"

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.
