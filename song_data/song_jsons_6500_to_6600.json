LyricsA child asks his mother, do you love me\nAnd it really means, will you protect me\nHis mother answers him, I love you\nAnd it really means, you've been a good boy\n\nAnd as the years go by\nTrue love will never die\n\nAt seventeen a girl says, do you love me\nAnd it really means, will you respect me\nThe teenage boy answers, I love you\nBut it really means, can I make love to you\nAnd as the years go by\nTrue love will never die\n\nI will love you forever\nI will love you forever\n\nAt sixty-five his wife says, do you love me\nAnd it means, I'd like to hear it again\nHer husband says to her, I love you\nBut it really means, I love you till the end\n\nAnd as the years go by\nTrue love will never die\n\nNow you're asking me if I love you\nAnd it really means will I marry you\nAnd I answer, yes I love you\nBut it really means that I won't be untrue\n\nAnd as the years go by\nTrue love will never die\n\nI will love you forever\nI will love you foreverYou might also likeEmbed"},

days\nOctobers drifting into Mays;\nI set my sail as the tide comes in\nAnd I just cast my fate to the wind\n\nI shift my course along the breeze;\nWon't sail upwind on memories\nThe empty sky is my best friend\nAnd I just cast my fate to the wind\n\n(Bridge:)\nTime has such a way of changing\nA man throughout the years;\nAnd now I'm rearranging my life through all my tears\nAlone, alone\nThere never was, there couldn't be\nA place in time for men like me\nWho'd drink the dark and laugh the day\nAnd let their wildest dreams blow away\n\n(Repeat Bridge)\nSo now I'm old, I'm wise and smart;\nI'm just a man with half a heart\nI wonder how it might have been\nHad I not cast my fate to the windYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

and I squeeze 'em; they don't even know my name\n\n[Refrain]\nThey call me the wanderer\nYeah, the wanderer\nI roam around, around, around\n[Verse 2]\nOh well, there's Flo on my left arm and there's Mary on my right\nAnd Janie is the girl well that I\u2019ll be with tonight\nAnd when she asks me which one I love the best\nI tear open my shirt and I show her \"Rosie\" on my chest\n\n[Refrain]\nCause I'm the wanderer\nYeah, the wanderer\nI roam around, around, around\n\n[Bridge]\nOh well, I roam from town to town\nI go through life without a care\nAnd I'm as happy as a

find myself a-fallin' for some girl\nYeah, I hop right into that car of mine and drive around the world\n\n[Refrain]\nYeah I'm the wanderer\nYeah, the wanderer\nI roam around, around, around\nYou

darlin'\nSave the last dance for me, mmm\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, I know (Oh, I know)\nThat the music's fine\nLike sparkling wine\nGo and have your fun\n\nLaugh and sing (Yes, I know)\nBut while we're apart\nDon't give your heart\nTo anyone\n\n[Chorus]\nBut don't forget who's taking you home\nAnd in whose arms you're gonna be\nSo darlin'\nSave the last dance for me, mmm\n\n[Bridge]\nBaby, don't you know I love you so?\nCan't you feel it when we touch?\nI will never, never let you go\nI love you, oh, so much\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nYou can dance (You can dance)\nGo and carry on\nTill the night is gone\nAnd it's time to go\n\nIf he asks (You can dance)\nIf you're all alone\nCan he take you home\nYou must tell him no\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause don't forget who's taking you home\nAnd in whose arms you're gonna be\nSo darlin'\nSave the last dance for me\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause don't forget who's taking you home\nAnd in whose arms you're gonna be\nSo darlin'\nSave the last dance for me, mmm\n\n[Outro]\nSave the last dance for me, mmm\nSave the last dance for me4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 269, "api_path": "/songs/749884", "artist_names": "Genius

that had the biggest guns\nThe Bismark was the fastest ship that ever sailed the seas\nOn her deck were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees\n\nOut of the cold and foggy night came the British ship the Hood\nAnd evry British seaman, he knew and understood\nThey had to sink the Bismark, the terror of the sea\nStop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees\n\nWe'll find that German battleship thats makin' such a fuss\nWe gotta sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us\nHit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around\nWhen we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down\nThe Hood found the Bismark and on that fatal day\nThe Bismark started firin' fifteen miles away\nWe gotta sink the Bismark was the battle sound\nBut when the smoke had cleared away\nThe mighty Hood went down\n\nFor six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail\nChurchill told the people \"Put ev'ry ship a-sail\"\nCause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be\nWe gotta send the Bismark to the bottom of the sea\n\nWe'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss\nWe gotta sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us\nHit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around\nWhen we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down\n\nThe fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the mornin' sun\nTen hours away from homeland the Bismark made its' run\nThe admiral of the British fleet said \"Turn those bows around\"\nWe found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down\n\nThe British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast\nThe first shell hit the Bismark, they knew she couldn't last\nThat mighty German battleship is just a memory\n\"Sink the Bismark\" was the battle cry that shook the seven seas\nYou might also likeWe found that German battleship was makin' such a fuss\nWe had to sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us\nWe hit the decks a-runnin' and we spun those guns around\nYeah, we found the

Chesterton", "lyrics": "Lepanto LyricsWhite founts falling in the courts of the sun,\nAnd the Soldan of Byzantium is smiling as they run;\nThere is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared,\nIt stirs the forest darkness, the darkness of his beard,\nIt curls the blood-red crescent, the crescent of his lips,\nFor the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships.\nThey have dared the white republics up the capes of Italy,\nThey have dashed the Adriatic round the Lion of the Sea,\nAnd the Pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss,\nAnd called the kings of Christendom for swords about the Cross,\nThe cold queen of England is looking in the glass;\nThe shadow of the Valois is yawning at the Mass;\nFrom evening isles fantastical rings faint the Spanish gun,\nAnd the Lord upon the Golden Horn is laughing in the sun.\nDim drums throbbing, in the hills half heard,\nWhere only on a nameless throne a crownless prince has stirred,\nWhere, risen from a doubtful seat and half attainted stall,\nThe last knight of Europe takes weapons from the wall,\nThe last and lingering troubadour to whom the bird has sung,\nThat once went singing southward when all the world was young,\nIn that enormous silence, tiny and unafraid,\nComes up along a winding road the noise of the Crusade.\nStrong gongs groaning as the guns boom far,\nDon John of Austria is going to the war,\nStiff flags straining in the night-blasts cold\nIn the gloom black-purple, in the glint old-gold,\nTorchlight crimson on the copper kettle-drums,\nThen the tuckets, then the trumpets, then the cannon, and he comes.\nDon John laughing in the brave beard curled,\nSpurning of his stirrups like the thrones of all the world,\nHolding his head up for a flag of all the free.\nLove-light of Spain\u2014hurrah!\nDeath-light of Africa!\nDon John of Austria\nIs riding to the sea.\n\nMahound is in his paradise above the evening star,\n(Don John of Austria is going to the war.)\nHe moves a mighty turban on the timeless houri\u2019s knees,\nHis turban that is woven of the sunset and the seas.\nHe shakes the peacock gardens as he rises from his ease,\nAnd he strides among the tree-tops and is taller than the trees,\nAnd his voice through all the garden is a thunder sent to bring\nBlack Azrael and Ariel and Ammon on the wing.\nGiants and the Genii,\nMultiplex of wing and eye,\nWhose strong obedience broke the sky\nWhen Solomon was king.\nThey rush in red and purple from the red clouds of the morn,\nFrom temples where the yellow gods shut up their eyes in scorn;\nThey rise in green robes roaring from the green hells of the sea\nWhere fallen skies and evil hues and eyeless creatures be;\nOn them the sea-valves cluster and the grey sea-forests curl,\nSplashed with a splendid sickness, the sickness of the pearl;\nThey swell in sapphire smoke out of the blue cracks of the ground,\u2014\nThey gather and they wonder and give worship to Mahound.\nAnd he saith, \u201cBreak up the mountains where the hermit-folk can hide,\nAnd sift the red and silver sands lest bone of saint abide,\nAnd chase the Giaours flying night and day, not giving rest,\nFor that which was our trouble comes again out of the west.\nWe have set the seal of Solomon on all things under sun,\nOf knowledge and of sorrow and endurance of things done,\nBut a noise is in the mountains, in the mountains, and I know\nThe voice that shook our palaces\u2014four hundred years ago:\nIt is he that saith not \u2018Kismet\u2019; it is he that knows not Fate ;\nIt is Richard, it is Raymond, it is Godfrey in the gate!\nIt is he whose loss is laughter when he counts the wager worth,\nPut down your feet upon him, that our peace be on the earth.\u201d\nFor he heard drums groaning and he heard guns jar,\n(Don John of Austria is going to the war.)\nSudden and still\u2014hurrah!\nBolt from Iberia!\nDon John of Austria\nIs gone by Alcalar.\nSt. Michael\u2019s on his mountain in the sea-roads of the north\n(Don John of Austria is girt and going forth.)\nWhere the grey seas glitter and the sharp tides shift\nAnd the sea folk labour and the red sails lift.\nHe shakes his lance of iron and he claps his wings of stone;\nThe noise is gone through Normandy; the noise is gone alone;\nThe North is full of tangled things and texts and aching eyes\nAnd dead is all the innocence of anger and surprise,\nAnd Christian killeth Christian in a narrow dusty room,\nAnd Christian dreadeth Christ that hath a newer face of doom,\nAnd Christian hateth Mary that God kissed in Galilee,\nBut Don John of Austria is riding to the sea.\nDon John calling through the blast and the eclipse\nCrying with the trumpet, with the trumpet of his lips,\nTrumpet that sayeth ha!\n\u00a0 \u00a0      Domino gloria!\nDon John of Austria\nIs shouting to the ships.\n\nKing Philip\u2019s in his closet with the Fleece about his neck\n(Don John of Austria is armed upon the deck.)\nThe walls are hung with velvet that is black and soft as sin,\nAnd little dwarfs creep out of it and little dwarfs creep in.\nHe holds a crystal phial that has colours like the moon,\nHe touches, and it tingles, and he trembles very soon,\nAnd his face is as a fungus of a leprous white and grey\nLike plants in the high houses that are shuttered from the day,\nAnd death is in the phial, and the end of noble work,\nBut Don John of Austria has fired upon the Turk.\nDon John\u2019s hunting, and his hounds have bayed\u2014\nBooms away past Italy the rumour of his raid\nGun upon gun, ha! ha!\nGun upon gun, hurrah!\nDon John of Austria\nHas loosed the cannonade.\n\nThe Pope was in his chapel before day or battle broke,\n(Don John of Austria is hidden in the smoke.)\nThe hidden room in man\u2019s house where God sits all the year,\nThe secret window whence the world looks small and very dear.\nHe sees as in a mirror on the monstrous twilight sea\nThe crescent of his cruel ships whose name is mystery;\nThey fling great shadows foe-wards, making Cross and Castle dark,\nThey veil the plum\u00e8d lions on the galleys of St. Mark;\nAnd above the ships are palaces of brown, black-bearded chiefs,\nAnd below the ships are prisons, where with multitudinous griefs,\nChristian captives sick and sunless, all a labouring race repines\nLike a race in sunken cities, like a nation in the mines.\nThey are lost like slaves that sweat, and in the skies of morning hung\nThe stair-ways of the tallest gods when tyranny was young.\nThey are countless, voiceless, hopeless as those fallen or fleeing on\nBefore the high Kings\u2019 horses in the granite of Babylon.\nAnd many a one grows witless in his quiet room in hell\nWhere a yellow face looks inward through the lattice of his cell,\nAnd he finds his God forgotten, and he seeks no more a sign\u2014\n(But Don John of Austria has burst the battle-line!)\nDon John pounding from the slaughter-painted poop,\nPurpling all the ocean like a bloody pirate\u2019s sloop,\nScarlet running over on the silvers and the golds,\nBreaking of the hatches up and bursting of the holds,\nThronging of the thousands up that labour under sea\nWhite for bliss and blind for sun and stunned for liberty.\nVivat Hispania!\nDomino Gloria!\nDon John of Austria\nHas set his people free!\n\nCervantes on his galley sets the sword back in the sheath\n(Don John of Austria rides homeward with a wreath.)\nAnd he sees across a weary land a straggling road in Spain,\nUp which a lean and foolish knight forever rides in vain,\nAnd he smiles, but not as Sultans smile, and settles back the blade....\n(But Don John of Austria rides home from the Crusade.)Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1342916",

it\nShe's eyes caught, red dot, locked on me, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nShe wants my hands on her body\nShe wants to burn like she's made of fire\nSaid she ain't going home 'til we\nDrink every drop of Kentucky dry\nDon't even know what she'll do when she does it\nPalm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye\nShe don't take no and I love\nShe gets what she wants\nAnd I get to be what she wants tonight\nI get to be what she wants tonight\n[Verse 2]\nI get to catch all her secrets\nSequins bouncing off flashing lights\nIf she wants it, then we're leaving\nGet me home, park the truck, cut the tires\nI get to be where she goes when she's lonely\nThe last door of the night she's closing\nOh, I know she could have anything, but\n\n[Chorus]\nShe wants my hands on her body\nShe wants to burn

my weed smoke\nAnd I swear too much on the regular\nWe gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go\nIf it ain't XO, then it gotta go\nI just won a new award for a kids show\nTalkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow\nI'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice\nGoddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy\nWhip game, make a nigga understand though\nGot that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo\nHit the gas so hard make it rotate\nAll my niggas blew up like a propane\nAll these R&B niggas be so lame\nGot a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)\n[Chorus]\nYou know me (Know me, uh, na-na-na-na-na)\nYou know me (Know me, know me, oh-oh-oh)\nYou know me (Know me, know me, na-na-na-na-na)\nEvery time you try to forget who I am\nI'll be right there to remind you again\nYou know me (Pow, pow)\nYou know me (Know me)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSaid I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean\nFaded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion\nAll I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit\nIt just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit\nEverybody knows it, all these niggas know me\nPlatinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine\nPour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed\nI'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG\nAll my niggas get it, they make money all alone\nRock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home\nWhen I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show\nAnd I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know\nUsed to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor\nNow my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight\nThat good sex, we'll sweat it out\nHotel bed springs, we'll wear it out\nI ain't gotta tell you\nSee The Weeknd LiveGet tickets as low as $153You might also like[Chorus]\n'Cause you

yeah, oh yeah\nYeah\n\n[Verse 1: The Weeknd]\nEverybody 'round me sayin' I should relax, 'cause\nI've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll backward\nAll I wanna do is forget about my past, and\nSmoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic\nAny time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'\nProbably 'cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and\nNot really the type to let a nigga talk back, but\nI'mma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent\nShout-out to the ones who spend money like a habit\nEven if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'\nGot a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress\nThen I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack\nThen I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma\nThen I get 'em faded off that super fantastic\nRoll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic\nNobody can handle me, I'm gone\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nWhen the shit's too strong, the night's too long\nI took too much and I've gone too far\nAnd I might not make it (Not make it), I might not make it\nThis time I might not make it\nI might not make it, I might not make it\nThis time I might not make it\nI might not make it (Not make it), I might not make it\nThis time I might not make it, I might not\n\n[Verse 2: Belly]\nBitches know, told a ho, \"It's different strokes for different folks\"\nCame up out the north, we was playin' with a different snow\nTook my niggas from the 401 to Pacific Coast\nWe no longer put no fish scale on the fishing boat\nListen ho, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke (L-Liquor, smoke)\nI know all you bitches want is dick and dough (Dick and dough)\nTold her, \"You don't gotta make it difficult\"\nBaby, sit calm, we don't need another episode\nHippy bitches sendin' me titty pictures\nShe told me no religion was the new religion (Yeah)\nShe said she don't believe in God but her shoes is Christian (Yeah)\nI heard she servin' everybody like the soup kitchen\nGettin' hoes higher, gettin' hoes higher\nShe got work in the mornin', I'm gettin' hoes fired (Haha)\nWhy you the fuck you call it purp when you mix it pink?\nYou know I fuckin' mix the drinks when the shit's too strong\nYou might also like[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nWhen the shit's too strong, the night's too long\nI took too much and I've gone too far\nAnd I might not make it (Not make it), I might not make it\nThis time I might not make it\nI might not make it, I might not make it\nThis time I might not make it\nI might not make it (Not make it), I might not make it\nThis time I might not make it, I might not\n\n[Outro: Belly]\n('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)\nI might not make it, oh no I might not make it\n('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)\nI might not make it, oh no, I might not make it\n('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)\nI might not make it, oh no I might not make it\n('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)\nI might not make it, oh no, I
