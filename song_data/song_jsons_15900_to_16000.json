COPPOLA\n\nTHIRD DRAFT PARAMOUNT PICTURES\n1 Gulf and Western Plaza\nMarch 29, 1971 New York, New York 10019\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black\nBackground. There is a moment's hesitation, and then the\nSimple words in white lettering:\n\nTHE GODFATHER\n\nWhile this remains, we hear: \"I believe in America.\"\nSuddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a\nMan of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great\nEmotion.\n\nBONASERA\nAmerica has made my fortune.\n\nAs he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.\n\nBONASERA\nI raised my daughter in the American\nFashion; I gave her freedom, but\nTaught her never to dishonor her\nFamily. She found a boy friend,\nNot an Italian. She went to the\nMovies with him, stayed out late.\nTwo months ago he took her for a\nDrive, with another boy friend.\nThey made her drink whiskey and\nThen they tried to take advantage\nOf her. She resisted; she kept her\nHonor. So they beat her like an\nAnimal. When I went to the hospital\nHer nose was broken, her jaw was\nShattered and held together by\nWire, and she could not even weep\nBecause of the pain.\nHe can barely speak; he is weeping now.\n\nBONASERA\nI went to the Police like a good\nAmerican. These two boys were\nArrested and brought to trial. The\nJudge sentenced them to three years\nIn prison, and suspended the\nSentence. Suspended sentence!\nThey went free that very day. I\nStood in the courtroom like a fool,\nAnd those bastards, they smiled at\nMe. Then I said to my wife, for\nJustice, we must go to The Godfather.\n\nBy now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office\nIn his home.\n\nThe blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with\nPatterned shadows. We are watching BONASERA over the\nShoulder of DON CORLEONE. TOM HAGEN sits near a small\nTable, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands\nImpatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a\nGlass of wine. We can HEAR music, and the laughter and\nVoices of many people outside.\nDON CORLEONE\nBonasera, we know each other for\nYears, but this is the first time\nYou come to me for help. I don't\nRemember the last time you invited\nMe to your house for coffee...even\nThough our wives are friends.\n\nBONASERA\nWhat do you want of me? I'll give\nYou anything you want, but do what\nI ask!\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd what is that Bonasera?\n\nBONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo. You ask for too much.\n\nBONASERA\nI ask for Justice.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThe Court gave you justice.\n\nBONASERA\nAn eye for an eye!\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBut your daughter is still alive.\n\nBONASERA\nThen make them suffer as she\nSuffers. How much shall I pay you.\n\nBoth HAGEN and SONNY react.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou never think to protect yourself\nWith real friends. You think it's\nEnough to be an American. All\nRight, the Police protects you,\nThere are Courts of Law, so you\nDon't need a friend like me.\nBut now you come to me and say Don\nCorleone, you must give me justice.\nAnd you don't ask in respect or\nFriendship. And you don't think to\nCall me Godfather; instead you come\nTo my house on the day my daughter\nIs to be married and you ask me to\nDo murder...for money.\n\nBONASERA\nAmerica has been good to me...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThen take the justice from the\nJudge, the bitter with the sweet,\nBonasera. But if you come to me\nWith your friendship, your loyalty,\nThen your enemies become my enemies,\nAnd then, believe me, they would\nFear you...\n\nSlowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.\n\nBONASERA\nBe my friend.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGood. From me you'll get Justice.\n\nBONASERA\nGodfather.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nSome day, and that day may never\nCome, I would like to call upon you\nTo do me a service in return.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nA HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight. There\nAre at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard\nAnd gardens. There is music and laughing and dancing and\nCountless tables covered with food and wine.\n\nDON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a\nSon: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of\nThe wedding party. He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the\nHands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the\nChildren, and makes them all welcome. They in turn carry\nWith them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked\nBread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.\n\nThe entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,\nMAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN\nAnd his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the\nBride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI. As they move into\nThe pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhere's Michael?\n\nSONNY\nHe'll be here Pop, it's still early.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThen the picture will wait for him.\n\nEveryone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves\nBack to the house. SONNY gives a delicious smile in the\nDirection of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI. She returns\nIt. Then he moves to his wife.\n\nSONNY\nSandra, watch the kids. They're\nRunning wild.\n\nSANDRA\nYou watch yourself.\n\nHAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine\nBarrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait. TOM\nCrooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is\nNext, straightens, and follows HAGEN.\nEXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nOutside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,\nWorking together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out\nOf the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers\nDown in their notebooks. We HEAR the music and laughter\nComing from the party in the distance.\n\nA MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.\n\nBARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the\nWatchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to\nEmbrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.\n\nThe MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another\nNumber in the notebook. A shiney new Cadillac with wooden\nBumpers.\n\nPETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping\nBellies with the ladies.\n\nCLEMENZA\nPaulie...wine...WINE.\n\nHe mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.\nPAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings\nIt to him.\n\nPAULIE\nYou look terrif on the floor!\n\nCLEMENZA\nWhat are you, a dance judge? Go do\nYour job; take a walk around the\nNeighborhood... see everything is\nOkay.\n\nPAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps\nBack into the dance.\n\nThe MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another\nNumber in the notebook.\n\nTESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-\nOLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his\nEnormous brown shoes.\n\nThe MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out\nOf the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by\nCLEMENZA and PAULIE.\n\nSONNY\nBuddy, this is a private party.\n\nThe MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the\nSedan. SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.\nThe DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,\nWithout saying a word. SONNY steps back, spits on the\nGround, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,\nAnd another TWO MEN. He doesn't say a thing for most of the\nWalk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.\n\nSONNY\nGoddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the\nDark study.\n\nNAZORINE\n...a fine boy from Sicily, captured\nBy the American Army, and sent to\nNew Jersey as a prisoner of war...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNazorine, my friend, tell me what I\nCan do.\n\nNAZORINE\nNow that the war is over, Enzo,\nThis boy is being repatriated to\nItaly. And you see, Godfather...\n(he wrings his hands,\nUnable to express himself)\nHe...my daughter...they...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou want him to stay in this country.\n\nNAZORINE\nGodfather, you understand everything.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTom, what we need is an Act of\nCongress to allow Enzo to become a\nCitizen.\n\nNAZORINE\n(impressed)\nAn Act of Congress!\n\nHAGEN\n(nodding)\nIt will cost.\n\nThe DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE\nNods.\n\nNAZORINE\nIs that all? Godfather, thank\nYou...\n(backing out, enthusiastically)\nOh, wait till you see the cake I\nMade for your beautiful daughter!\n\nNAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.\nDON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.\n\nHAGEN\nWho do I give this job to?\n\nThe DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNot to one of our paisans...give it\nTo a Jew Congressman in another\nDistrict. Who else is on the list\nFor today?\n\nThe DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting\nTo see him.\n\nHAGEN\nFrancesco Nippi. His nephew has\nBeen refused parole. A bad case.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nNIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nHis father worked with you in the\nFreight yards when you were young.\n\nLUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nHe's not on the list, but Luca\nBrasi wants to see you.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe DON turns to HAGEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nIs it necessary?\n\nHAGEN\nYou understand him better than\nAnyone.\n\nThe DON nods to this. Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nMICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,\nLeads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally\nStopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,\nFollowing them.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces\nHer to his GIRL.\n\nEXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe DON's eyes peering through the blinds.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)\n\nKAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,\nBurdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine. She\nIs exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and\nThe vitality.\n\nKAY\nI've never seen anything like it.\n\nMICHAEL\nI told you I had a lot of relatives.\n\nKAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.\nWe see what she sees:\n\nHer interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine\nBarrels.\n\nKAY\n(amused)\nMichael, what are those men doing?\n\nMICHAEL\nThey're waiting to see my father.\n\nKAY\nThey're talking to themselves.\n\nMICHAEL\nThey're going to talk to my father,\nWhich means they're going to ask\nHim for something, which means they\nBetter get it right.\n\nKAY\nWhy do they bother him on a day\nLike this?\n\nMICHAEL\nBecause they know that no Sicilian\nWill refuse a request on his\nDaughter's wedding day.\n\nEXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)\n\nCONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her\nOverly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI. He\nIs bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.\nShe absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from\nHim long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white\nEnvelopes they are putting into the large white purse she\nHolds. In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one\nOf her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,\nWhere she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.\nCARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the\nBulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the\nThings hold.\n\nDiscreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.\n\nCARLO\n(whispered)\nCut it out, Connie.\n\nThe purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,\nIs fat with money.\n\nPAULIE (O.S.)\nWhat do you think? Twenty grand?\n\nA little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a\nProsciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking\nEyes from the purse.\n\nPAULIE\nWho knows? Maybe more. Twenty,\nThirty grand in small bills cash in\nThat silk purse. Holy Toledo, if\nThis was somebody else's wedding!\n\nSONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY\nMANCINI, the Maid of Honor. Every once in a while he\nGlances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with\nSome WOMEN.\n\nHe bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.\n\nSANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.\n\nWOMAN\nIs it true what they say about your\nHusband, Sandra?\n\nSANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and\nFurther apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.\nThrough her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.\nSONNY and LUCY are gone.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe empty hallway. The bathroom door opens and LUCY\nSurreptitiously steps out.\n\nShe looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,\nMotioning for her to come up.\n\nShe lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)\n\nKAY and MICHAEL.\n\nKAY\n(in a spooky low tone)\nMichael, that scarey guy...Is he a\nRelative?\n\nShe has picked out LUCA BRASI.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. His name is Luca Brasi. You\nWouldn't like him.\n\nKAY\n(Excited)\nWho is he?\n\nMICHAEL\n(Sizing her up)\nYou really want to know?\n\nKAY\nYes. Tell me.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou like spaghetti?\n\nKAY\nYou know I love spaghetti.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen eat your spaghetti and I'll\nTell you a Luca Brasi story.\n\nShe starts to eat her spaghetti.\n\nShe begins eating, looking at him eagerly.\n\nMICHAEL\nOnce upon a time, about fifteen\nYears ago some people wanted to\nTake over my father's olive oil\nBusiness. They had Al Capone send\nSome men in from Chicago to kill my\nFather, and they almost did.\n\nKAY\nAl Capone!\n\nMICHAEL\nMy Father sent Luca Brasi after\nThem. He tied the two Capone men\nHand and foot, and stuffed small\nBath towels into their mouths.\nThen he took an ax, and chopped one\nMan's feet off...\n\nKAY\nMichael...\n\nMICHAEL\nThen the legs at the knees...\n\nKAY\nMichael you're trying to scare me...\n\nMICHAEL\nThen the thighs where they joined\nThe torso.\n\nKAY\nMichael, I don't want to hear\nAnymore...\n\nMICHAEL\nThen Luca turned to the other man...\n\nKAY\nMichael, I love you.\n\nMICHAEL\n...who out of sheer terror had\nSwallowed the bath towel in his\nMouth and suffocated.\n\nThe smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a\nTall story.\n\nKAY\nI never know when you're telling me\nThe truth.\n\nMICHAEL\nI told you you wouldn't like him.\n\nKAY\nHe's coming over here!\n\nLUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near\nTheir table.\n\nMICHAEL\nTom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay\nAdams.\n\nKAY\n(having survived LUCA)\nHow do you do.\n\nMICHAEL\nMy brother, Tom Hagen.\n\nHAGEN\nHello Kay. Your father's inside,\nDoing some business.\n(privately)\nHe's been asking for you.\n\nMICHAEL\nThanks Tom.\n\nHAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously\nFollowing.\n\nKAY\nIf he's your brother, why does he\nHave a different name?\n\nMICHAEL\nMy brother Sonny found him living\nIn the streets when he was a kid,\nSo my father took him in. He's a\nGood lawyer.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE at the window. He has seen the intimacy of the\nYOUNG COUPLE.\n\nLUCA (O.S.)\nDon Corleone...\n\nTHE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves\nForward to kiss his hand. He takes the envelope from his\nJacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes\nA formal speech.\n\nLUCA\n(with difficulty)\nDon Corleone...I am honored, and\nGrateful...that you invited me to\nYour home...on the wedding day of\nYour...daughter.\nMay their first child...be a\nMasculine child. I pledge my never\nEnding loyalty.\n(he offers the envelope)\nFor your daughter's bridal purse.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThank you, Luca, my most valued\nFriend.\n\nTHE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so\nTightly we might imagine it to be painful.\n\nLUCA\nLet me leave you, Don Corleone. I\nKnow you are busy.\n\nHe turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with\nThe same formality he entered with. DON CORLEONE breathes\nMore easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI'm sure it's the most generous\nGift today.\n\nHAGEN\nThe Senator called--apologized for\nNot coming personally, but said\nYou'd understand. Also, some of\nThe Judges...they've all sent gifts.\nAnd another call from Virgil\nSollozzo.\n\nDON CORLEONE is not pleased.\n\nHAGEN\nThe action is narcotics. Sollozzo\nHas contacts in Turkey for the\nPoppy, in Sicily for the plants to\nProcess down to morphine or up to\nHeroin. Also he has access to this\nCountry. He's coming to us for\nFinancial help, and some sort of\nImmunity from the law. For that we\nGet a piece of the action, I\nCouldn't find out how much.\nSollozzo is vouched for by the\nTattaglia family, and they may have\nA piece of the action. They call\nSollozzo the Turk.\nHe's spent a lot of time in Turkey\nAnd is suppose to have a Turkish\nWife and kids. He's suppose to be\nVery quick with the knife, or was,\nWhen he was younger. Only in\nMatters of business and with some\nReasonable complaint. Also he has\nAn American wife and three children\nAnd he is a good family man.\n\nTHE DON nods.\n\nHAGEN\nHe's his own boss, and very\nCompetent.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd with prison record.\n\nHAGEN\nTwo terms; one in Italy, one in the\nUnited States. He's known to the\nGovernment as a top narcotics man.\nThat could be a plus for us; he\nCould never get immunity to testify.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhen did he call?\n\nHAGEN\nThis morning.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nOn a day like this. Consiglero, do\nYou also have in your notes the the\nTurk made his living from\nProstitution before the war, like\nThe Tattaglias do now. Write that\nDown before you forget it. The\nTurk will wait.\n\nWe now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers\nFrom outside. In Italian, with unmistakable style.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat that? It sounds like Johnny.\n\nHe moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the\nRoom with light.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nIt is Johnny. He came all the way\nFrom California to be at the wedding.\n\nHAGEN\nShould I bring him in.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo. Let the people enjoy him. You\nSee? He is a good godson.\n\nHAGEN\nIt's been two years. He's probably\nIn trouble again.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nJOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and\nExcitement of the wedding GUESTS.\n\nKAY\nI didn't know your family knew\nJohnny Fontane.\n\nMICHAEL\nSure.\n\nKAY\nI used to come down to New York\nWhenever he sang at the Capitol and\nScream my head off.\n\nMICHAEL\nHe's my father's godson; he owes\nHim his whole career.\n\nJOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.\nThey call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy Godson has come three thousand\nMiles to do us honor and no one\nThinks to wet his throat.\n\nAt once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who\nTakes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.\n\nJOHNNY\nI kept trying to call you after my\nDivorce and Tom always said you\nWere busy. When I got the Wedding\nInvitation I knew you weren't sore\nAt me anymore, Godfather.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nCan I do something for you still?\nYou're not too rich, or too famous\nThat I can't help you?\n\nJOHNNY\nI'm not rich anymore, Godfather,\nAnd...my career, I'm almost washed\nUp...\n\nHe's very disturbed. The GODFATHER indicates that he come\nWith him to the office so no one will notice. He turns to\nHAGEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTell Santino to come in with us.\nHe should hear some things.\n\nThey go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nHAGEN glances up the staircase.\n\nHAGEN\nSonny?\n\nThen he goes up.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\nSONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her\nGown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing\nAgainst the door. Her face peeks out from the layers of\nPetticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.\n\nLUCY\nSonnyeeeeeeee.\n\nHer head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his\nBody. But there is a knocking as well. They stop, freeze\nIn that position.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nSonny? Sonny, you in there?\n\nINT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)\n\nOutside, HAGEN by the door.\n\nHAGEN\nThe old man wants you; Johnny's\nHere...he's got a problem.\n\nSONNY (O.S.)\nOkay. One minute.\n\nHAGEN hesitates. We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the\nDoor again. TOM leaves.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE\nACT LIKE A MAN! By Christ in\nHeaven, is it possible you turned\nOut no better than a Hollywood\nFinocchio.\n\nBoth HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing. The DON\nSmiles. SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still\nAdjusting his clothes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAll right, Hollywood...Now tell me\nAbout this Hollywood Pezzonovanta\nWho won't let you work.\n\nJOHNNY\nHe owns the studio. Just a month\nAgo he bought the movie rights to\nThis book, a best seller. And the\nMain character is a guy just like\nMe. I wouldn't even have to act,\nJust be myself.\n\nThe DON is silent, stern.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou take care of your family?\n\nJOHNNY\nSure.\n\nHe glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as\nHe can.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou look terrible. I want you to\nEat well, to rest. And spend time\nWith your family. And then, at the\nEnd of the month, this big shot\nWill give you the part you want.\n\nJOHNNY\nIt's too late. All the contracts\nHave been signed, they're almost\nReady to shoot.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\n\nHe takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough\nTo hurt.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNow go back to the party and leave\nIt to me.\n\nHe closes the door, smiling to himself. Turns to HAGEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhen does my daughter leave with\nHer bridegroom?\n\nHAGEN\nThey'll cut the cake in a few\nMinutes...leave right after that.\nYour new son-in-law, do we give him\nSomething important?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo, give him a living. But never\nLet him know the family's business.\nWhat else, Tom?\n\nHAGEN\nI've called the hospital; they've\nNotified Consiglere Genco's family\nTo come and wait. He won't last\nOut the night.\n\nThis saddens the DON. He sighs.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGenco will wait for me. Santino,\nTell your brothers they will come\nWith me to the hospital to see\nGenco. Tell Fredo to drive the big\nCar, and ask Johnny to come with us.\n\nSONNY\nAnd Michael?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAll my sons.\n(to HAGEN)\nTom, I want you to go to California\nTonight. Make the arrangements.\nBut don't leave until I come back\nFrom the hospital and speak to you.\nUnderstood?\n\nHAGEN\nUnderstood.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nNow all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over\nThe entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels\nIn a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most\nExtravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument\nOf his gratitude. The CROWD is favorably impressed: they\nBegin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,\nIn the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and\nKiss the Groom. Louder and louder, five hundred forks\nHitting five hundred glasses.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nSilence.\n\nHIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day. The GUESTS are gone. A\nSingle black car is in the courtyard. FREDDIE is behind the\nDriver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who\nSits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWill your girl friend get back to\nThe city all right?\n\nMICHAEL\nTom said he'd take care of it.\n\nThe DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through\nThe gate of the great Corleone Mall.\n\nINT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)\n\nA long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can\nSee a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but\nAll plump and dressed in black.\n\nDON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end. But then the\nDON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder. MICHAEL\nStops and turns toward his FATHER. The two looks at one\nAnother for some time. SILENCE. DON CORLEONE then lifts\nHis hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's\nUniform.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat was this for?\n\nMICHAEL\nFor bravery.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd this?\n\nMICHAEL\nFor killing a man.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat miracles you do for strangers.\n\nMICHAEL\nI fought for my country. It was my\nChoice.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd now, what do you choose to do?\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm going to finish school.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGood. When you are finished, come\nAnd talk to me. I have hopes for\nYou.\n\nAgain they regard each other without a word. MICHAEL turns,\nAnd continues on. DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then\nFollows.\n\nINT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR\nVIEW. He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\n(whispered)\nGenco, I've brought my sons to pay\nTheir respects. And look, even\nJohnny Fontane, all the way from\nHollywood.\n\nGENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man. DON CORLEONE\nTakes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around\nHis bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.\n\nGENCO\nGodfather, Godfather, it's your\nDaughter's wedding day, you cannot\nRefuse me. Cure me, you have the\nPower.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI have no such power...but Genco,\nDon't fear death.\n\nGENCO\n(with a sly wink)\nIt's been arranged, then?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou blaspheme. Resign yourself.\n\nGENCO\nYou need your old Consigliere. Who\nWill replace me?\n(suddenly)\nStay with me Godfather. Help me\nMeet death. If he sees you, he\nWill be frightened and leave me in\nPeace. You can say a word, pull a\nFew strings, eh? We'll outwit that\nBastard as we outwitted all those\nOthers.\n(clutching his hand)\nGodfather, don't betray me.\n\nThe DON motions all the others to leave the room. They do.\nHe returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and\nWhispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.\n\nINT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nFADE IN:\n\nThe interior of a non-stop Constellation. HAGEN is one of\nThe very few passengers on this late flight. He looks like\nAny young lawyer on a business trip. He is tired from the\nDifficult preparation and duties that he has just executed\nDuring the wedding. On the seat next to him is an enormous,\nBulging briefcase. He closes his eyes.\n\nINT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE. CARLO is in his\nUndershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the\nEnvelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the\nContents. CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble\nBathroom. She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and\nTries to get his interest.\n\nINT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE in his office. LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nLuca, I am worried about this man\nSollozzo. Find out what you can,\nThrough the Tattaglias. Let them\nBelieve you could be tempted away\nFrom the Corleone Family, if the\nRight offer was made. Learn what\nHe has under his fingernails...\n\nINT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe hallway of an apartment building. SONNY enters, climbs\nTwo steps at a time. He knocks, and then whispers.\n\nSONNY\nIt's me, Sonny.\n\nThe door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling\nHim into the apartment.\n\nINT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA BRASI's tiny room. He is partly dressed. He kneels\nAnd reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked\nTrunk. He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof\nVest. He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then\nPuts on his shirt and jacket. He takes his gun, quickly\nDisassembles, checks, and reassembles it. And leaves.\n\nINT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nA CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.\n\nINT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New\nHampshire.\n\nINT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty\nSubway train.\n\nINT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nHAGEN on the Constellation. He reaches into his briefcase,\nAnd takes out several pictures and papers.\n\nOne photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm\nIn arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a\nLovely young child star to his immediate right.\n\nHAGEN considers other papers.\n\nINT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.\nHe straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nRemember my new Consigliere, a\nLawyer with his briefcase can steal\nMore than a hundred men with guns.\n\nEXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nJACK WOLTZ ESTATE. HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,\nArmed only with his briefcase. A GATEMAN opens the gate,\nAnd TOM enters.\n\nEXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)\n\nHAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal\nGardens, martinis in hand.\n\nWOLTZ\nYou should have told me your boss\nWas Corleone, Tom, I had to check\nYou out. I thought you were just\nSome third rate hustler Johnny was\nRunning in to bluff me.\n(a piece of statuary)\nFlorence, thirteenth century.\nDecorated the garden of a king.\n\nThey cross the garden and head toward the stables.\n\nWOLTZ\nI'm going to show you something\nBeautiful.\n\nThey pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a\nHuge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: \"KHARTOUM.\"\nTWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they\nRise as WOLTZ approaches.\n\nWOLTZ\nYou like horses? I like horses, I\nLove 'em. Beautiful, expensive\nRacehorses.\n\nThe animal inside is truly beautiful. WOLTZ whispers to him\nWith true love in his voice.\n\nWOLTZ\nKhartoum...Kartoum...You are\nLooking at six hundred thousand\nDollars on four hoofs. I bet even\nRussian Czars never paid that kind\nOf dough for a single horse. But\nI'm not going to race him I'm going\nTo put him out to Stud.\n\nINT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\nHAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,\nAttended by SEVERAL SERVANTS. Great paintings hang on the\nWalls. The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.\n\nHAGEN\nMr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.\nThat is very close, a very sacred\nReligious relationship.\n\nWOLTZ\nOkay, but just tell him this is one\nFavor I can't give. But he should\nTry me again on anything else.\n\nHAGEN\nHe never asks a second favor when\nHe has been refused the first.\nUnderstood?\n\nWOLTZ\nYou smooth son of a bitch, let me\nLay it on the line for you, and\nYour boss. Johnny Fontane never\nGets that movie. I don't care how\nMany Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball\nGoombahs come out of the woodwork!\n\nHAGEN\nI'm German-Irish.\n\nWOLTZ\nOkay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny\nWill never get that part because I\nHate that pinko punk and I'm going\nTo run him out of the Movies. And\nI'll tell you why. He ruined one\nOf Woltz Brothers' most valuable\nProteges. For five years I had\nThis girl under training; singing\nLessons! Acting lessons! Dancing\nLessons! We spent hundreds of\nThousands of dollars--I was going\nTo make her a star. I'll be even\nMore frank, just to show you that\nI'm not a hard-hearted man, that it\nWasn't all dollars and cents. That\nGirl was beautiful and young and\nInnocent and she was the greatest\nPiece of ass I've ever ad and I've\nHad them all over the world. Then\nJohnny comes along with that olive\nOil voice and guinea charm and she\nRuns off. She threw it all away to\nMake me look ridiculous. A MAN IN\nMY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE\nMADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!\n\nEXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)\n\nAn unimposing little building in New York City on Mott\nStreet with a large old sign: \"GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,\nINC.\" next to an open-faced fruit market.\n\nA dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we\nCannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters\nThe building. This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.\n\nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)\n\nLooking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps\nBefore he actually rises into view. He is a small man, very\nDark, with curly black hair. But wiry, and tight and hard,\nAnd obviously very dangerous. He is greeted at the head of\nThe stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,\nIntroducing himself. For a moment, there is a complex of\nHandshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful\nIntroductions. Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's\nGlass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.\nThey are very respectful of one another. Folding chairs are\nBrought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around\nIn a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,\nCLEMENZA and TESSIO. The DON is the slightest bit foolish\nWith all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no\nOne. Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear\nThat this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nMy business is heroin, I have poppy\nFields, laboratories in Narseilles\nAnd Sicily, ready to go into\nProduction. My importing methods\nAre as safe as these things can be,\nAbout five per cent loss. The risk\nIs nothing, the profits enormous.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhy do you come to me? Why do I\nDeserve your generosity?\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI need two million dollars in\nCash...more important, I need a\nFriend who has people in high\nPlaces; a friend who can guarantee\nThat if one of my employees be\nArrested, they would get only light\nSentences. Be my friend.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat percentages for my family?\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThirty per cent. In the first year\nYour share would be four million\nDollars; then it would go up.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd what is the percentage of the\nTattaglia family?\n\nSOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nMy compliments. I'll take care of\nThem from my share.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nSo. I receive 30 per cent just for\nFinance and legal protection. No\nWorries about operations, is that\nWhat you tell me?\n\nSOLLOZZO\nIf you think two million dollars in\nCash is just finance, I congratulate\nYou Don Corleone.\n\nThere is a long silence; in which each person present feels\nThe tension. The DON is about to give his answer.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI said I would see you because I've\nHeard you're a serious man, to be\nTreated with respect...\n(pause)\nBut I'll say no to you.\n\nWe feel this around the room.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI'll give you my reasons. I have\nMany, many friends in Politics.\nBut they wouldn't be so friendly if\nMy business was narcotics instead\nOf gambling. They think gambling\nIs something like liquor, a harmless\nVice...and they think narcotics is\nDirty business.\n\nSOLLOZZO takes a breath.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo...how a man makes his living is\nNone of my business. But this\nProposition of yours is too risky.\nAll the people in my family lived\nWell the last ten years, I won't\nRisk that out of greed.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nAre you worried about security for\nYour million?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThe Tattaglias will guarantee your\nInvestment also.\n\nThis startles SONNY; he blurts out.\n\nSONNY\nThe Tattaglia family guarantees our\nInvestment?\n\nSOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face\nHim. Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out\nOf line.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYoung people are greedy, and they\nHave no manners. They speak when\nThey should listen. But I have a\nSentimental weakness for my\nChildren, and I've spoiled them, as\nYou see. But Signor Sollozzo, my\nNo is final.\n\nSOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal. He\nGlances one last time at SONNY. He rises; all the others do\nAs well. He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally\nTakes his leave. When the footsteps can no longer be heard:\n\nThe DON turns to SONNY.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nSantino, never let anyone outside\nThe family know what you are\nThinking. I think your brain is\nGoing soft from all that comedy you\nPlay with that young girl.\n\nTWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display\nWith the word \"THANK YOU\" spelled out in flowers.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat is this nonsense?\n\nHAGEN\nIt's from Johnny. It was announced\nThis morning. He's going to play\nThe lead in the new Woltz Brothers\nFilm.\n\nINT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\nIt is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,\nPresumably WOLTZ, is sleeping. Soft light bathes the room\nFrom the large windows. We move closer to him until we see\nHis face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ. He turns uncomfortably;\nMutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets. Something\nWet.\n\nHe wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.\nHe looks at his hand; the wetness is blood. He is\nFrightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on\nHis sheets and pajamas. He grunts, pulls the puddle of\nBlood in his bed. He feels his own body frantically,\nMoving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face\nWith the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of\nHis bed. Just blood from the hacked neck. White reedy\nTendons show. He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle\nOf blood to see more clearly. Froth covers the muzzle, and\nThe enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered\nWith blood.\n\nWOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot. No sound comes out.\nThen, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure\nTerror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and\nKnees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.\n\nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)\n\nCLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER. Nodding.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nSend Johnny my congratulations.\n\n----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------\n\n(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)\n\nFifth Avenue in the snow. Christmas week. People are\nBundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.\n\nKAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store,\nCarrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.\n\nKAY\nWe have something for your mother,\nFor Sonny, we have the tie for\nFredo and Tom Hagen gets the\nReynolds pen...\n\nMICHAEL\nAnd what do you want for Christmas?\n\nKAY\nJust you.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nINT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music. THE VIEW PANS\nAROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nWe'll have a quiet, civil ceremony\nAt the City Hall, no big fuss, no\nFamily, just a couple of friends as\nWitnesses.\n\nThe two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on\nThe two single beds that they have pushed together.\n\nKAY\nWhat will your father say?\n\nMICHAEL\nAs long as I tell him beforehand he\nWon't object. He'll be hurt, but\nHe won't object.\n\nKAY\nWhat time do they expect us?\n\nMICHAEL\nFor dinner. Unless I call and tell\nThem we're still in New Hampshire.\n\nKAY\nMichael.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen we can have dinner, see a\nShow, and spend one more night.\n\nHe moves to the telephone.\n\nMICHAEL (CONT'D.)\nOperator. Get me\n(fill in number)\n\nKAY\nMichael, what are you doing?\n\nMICHAEL\nShhh, you be the long distance\nOperator. Here.\n\nKAY\nHello...this is Long Distance. I\nHave a call from New Hampshire. Mr.\nMichael Corleone. One moment please.\n\nShe hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.\n\nMICHAEL\nHello, Tom? Michael. Yeah...\nListen, we haven't left yet. I'm\nDriving down to the city with Kay\nTomorrow morning. There's something\nImportant I want to tell the old\nMan before Christmas. Will he be\nHome tomorrow night?\n\nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nHAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office. In the background,\nThrough the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in\nHis office. TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nSure. Anything I can do for you.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nNo. I guess I'll see you Christmas.\nEveryone's going to be out at Long\nBeach, right?\n\nHAGEN\nRight.\n\nHe smiles. MICHAEL has hung up. He looks at the piles of\nWork, and can't face it. He rises, puts on his coat and\nHat, and continues out.\n\nHe peeks into the DON's office.\n\nHAGEN\nMichael called; he's not leaving\nNew Hampshire until tomorrow\nMorning. I've got to go, I promised\nTheresa I'd pick up some toys for\nThe kids.\n\nThe DON smiles and nods.\n\nTOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.\nFREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the\nAfternoon paper. He puts aside the papers the office\nManager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE,\nRaps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the\nPaper.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTell Paulie to get the car from the\nLot; I'll be ready to go home in a\nFew minutes.\n\nFREDO\nI'll have to get it myself; Paulie\nCalled in sick this morning.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThat's the third time this month.\nI think maybe you'd better get a\nHealthier bodyguard for me. Tell\nTom.\n\nFREDO\n(going)\nPaulie's a good kid. If he's sick,\nHe's sick. I don't mind getting\nThe car.\n\nFREDDIE leaves. He slowly puts on his jacket. Looks out\nHis window.\n\nEXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)\n\nFREDDIE crosses the street.\n\nINT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nOFFICE MANAGER\nBuon Watale, Don Corleone.\n\nThe MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat. Once again, the\nDON glances out his window.\n\nThe black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMerry Christmas.\n(handing the MANAGER\nAn envelope)\n\nAnd he starts down the stairs.\n\nEXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail. When\nFREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the\nDriver's seat. The DON moves to the car, and is about to\nGet in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open\nFruit stand near the corner.\n\nThe PROPRIETOR springs to serve him. The DON walks among\nThe trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular\nPiece of fruit. As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the\nPieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag. The DON\nPays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then\nTurns back to the car.\n\nEXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)\n\nTOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift\nWrapped. He continues past the windows. As he walks,\nSomeone walks right in his way. He looks up. It is SOLLOZZO.\n\nHe takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(quietly)\nDon't be frightened. I just want\nTo talk to you.\n\nA car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(urgently)\nGet in; I want to talk to you.\n\nHAGEN pulls his arm free. He is frightened.\n\nHAGEN\nI haven't got time.\n\nTWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nGet in the car. If I wanted to\nKill you you'd be dead already.\nTrust me.\n\nHAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving\nOur VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story\nOf Hansel and Gretel. We HEAR the car doors shut, and the\nCar drive off.\n\nEXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)\n\nRADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show. KAY and\nMICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and\nShe sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex. KAY\nNostalgically hums \"The Bells of Saint Mary's,\" as they walk\nArm in arm.\n\nKAY\nWould you like me better if I were\nA nun?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo.\n\nKAY\nWould you like me better if I were\nIngrid Bergman?\n\nThey have passed a little enclosed newsstand. KAY sees\nSomething that terrifies her. She doesn't know what to do.\nMICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.\n\nKAY\n(a little voice)\nMichael?\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm thinking about it.\n\nKAY\nMichael...\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, I would not like you better if\nYou were Ingrid Bergman.\n\nShe cannot answer him. Rather she pulls him by the arm,\nBack to the newsstand, and points. His face goes grave.\n\nThe headlines read: \"VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED\nDOWN.\"\n\nMICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a\nDollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them. KAY\nKnows to remain silent.\n\nMICHAEL\n(desperately)\nThey don't say if he's dead or alive.\n\nEXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the\nCar, when TWO MEN step from the corner. Suddenly, the DON\nDrops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness\nToward the parked car.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nFredo, Fredo!\n\nThe paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins\nRolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.\n\nFive bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain,\nAnd continues toward the car.\n\nThe PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking\nOver an entire case of fruit.\n\nThe TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.\n\nTheir feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit. There are\nMore GUNSHOTS.\n\nFREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;\nHaving difficulty opening the door. He rushes out, a gun\nTrembling in his hand; his mouth open. He actually drops\nThe gun.\n\nThe gun falls amid the rolling fruit.\n\nThe GUNMEN are panicked. They fire once more at the downed\nDON CORLEONE. His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;\nAnd pools of blood are beginning to form.\n\nThe GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;\nThey disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.\n\nThe PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:\nRather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely\nFrom around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from\nWindows. But the street itself is now empty.\n\nFREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great\nPuddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and\nFace down in them.\n\nFREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying\nSomething we cannot understand. He begins to weep profusely.\n\nINT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night. He\nGets off.\n\nHe emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.\n\nEXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA walks down the late night street. He approaches an\nElegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still\nWinking this late at night. He waits and watches. Then the\nSign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.\n\nINT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless\nGlistening wooden floors. Now, at this late time, the\nChairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR\nIs waxing them. A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her\nReceipts. LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at\nThe bar. ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves\nBehind the bar.\n\nMAN\nLuca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.\n\nLUCA\nI know.\n\nLUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nDo you know who I am?\n\nLUCA Nods.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nYou've been talking to the\nTattaglias. They thought we could\nDo business.\n\nLUCA listens.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI need somebody strong to protect\nMy operation, physically. I've\nHeard you're not happy with your\nFamily, you might make a switch.\n\nLUCA\nIf the money is good enough.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nOn the first shipment, I can\nGuarantee you fifty thousand dollars.\n\nLUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.\n\nSOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,\nRather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.\nBRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter\nMagically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette. Then,\nHe does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and\nPuts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.\n\nINT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe telephone in SONNY's house is ringing. He approaches\nIt, obviously fresh from a nap.\n\nSONNY\nYeah.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nDo you recognize my voice?\n\nSONNY\nI think so. Detective squad?\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nRight. Don't say my name, just\nListen. Somebody shot your father\nOutside his place fifteen minutes\nAgo.\n\nSONNY\nIs he alive?\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nI think so, but I can't get close\nEnough. There's a lot of blood.\nI'll try to find out more.\n\nSONNY\nFind out anything you can...you got\nA Grand coming.\n(click)\n\nSONNY cradles the phone. An incredible rage builds up in\nHim, his face actually turning red. He would like to rip\nThe phone to pieces in his bare hands. Then he controls it.\nQuickly, he dials another number.\n\nSONNY\nTheresa, let me talk to Tom. Not\nYet? Have him call me as soon as\nHe gets home.\n\nHe hangs up.\n\nSANDRA (O.S.)\nSonny? Sonny, who is it?\n(she enters the room)\nWhat is it?\n\nSONNY\n(calmly)\nThey shot the old man.\n\nSANDRA\nOh God...\n\nSONNY\nHoney...don't worry. Nothing else\nIs going to happen.\n\nThere is a POUNDING on the door. A BABY starts crying.\n\nSANDRA\n(really frightened)\nSONNY?\n\nSONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and\nMoves quickly. He opens the front door quickly. It is\nCLEMENZA. He enters, SONNY closes the door. SANDRA goes to\nLook after the baby.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(excited)\nYou heard about your father?\n\nSONNY\nYeah.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThe word is out in the streets that\nHe's dead.\n\nSONNY\nWhere the hell was Paulie, why\nWasn't he with the Don?\n\nCLEMENZA\nPaulie's been a little sick all\nWinter...he was home.\n\nSONNY\nHow many times did he stay home the\nLast couple of months?\n\nCLEMENZA\nMaybe three, four times. I always\nAsked Freddie if he wanted another\nBodyguard, but he said no. Things\nHave been so smooth the last ten\nYears...\n\nSONNY\nGo get Paulie, I don't care how\nSick he is. Pick him up yourself,\nAnd bring him to my father's house.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThat's all? Don't you want me to\nSend some people over here?\n\nSONNY\nNo, just you and Paulie.\n\nCLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the\nCouch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.\n\nSONNY\nA couple of our people will come to\nStay here. Do whatever they say;\nI'm going over to the main house.\nIf you want me, use Pop's special\nPhone.\n\nThe telephone rings again. SONNY answers it.\n\nSONNY\nHello.\n\nSOLLOZZO (O.S.)\nSantino Corleone?\n\nSANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is. SONNY\nIndicates that she be quiet.\n\nSONNY\nYeah.\n\nSOLLOZZO (O.S.)\nWe have Tom Hagen. In about three\nHours he'll be released with our\nProposition. Don't do anything\nUntil you've heard what he has to\nSay. You can only cause a lot of\nTrouble. What's done is done.\n(a pause)\nDon't lose that famous temper of\nYours.\n\nSONNY\n(quietly)\nI'll wait.\n\nEXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nFULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL. It is night, but the\nCourtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the\nTops of all the houses. It is very cold. We see the figure\nOf SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)\n\nSONNY walks into the empty, darkened house. Then he calls\nOut.\n\nSONNY\nMa? Ma, where are you.\n\nThe kitchen door swings open. He moves quickly and takes\nHer by the arm. He is deliberately calm.\n\nSONNY\nMa, I just got a call. Pop's\nHurt...I don't know how bad.\n\nMAMA\n(quietly)\nSantino? Have they killed him?\n\nSONNY\n(almost in tears)\nWe don't know yet, Ma.\n\nMAMA\nI'll get dressed. In case we can\nSee him...\n\nShe moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs. SONNY\nTurns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying. He\nTakes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil,\nAnd sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his\nFather's office.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nHe switches the lights on in the DON's office. The massive\nDesk dominates the room. SONNY moves quickly to the\nTelephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk,\nAnd dials a number.\n\nSONNY\nTessio...This is Santino Corleone.\nI want fifty reliable men out here.\n\nTESSIO (O.S.)\nI heard, Sonny...but what about\nClemenza's regime?\n\nSONNY\nI don't want to use Clemenza's\nPeople right now. Understood?\n\nHe hangs up. He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the\nDial, and removes a small notebook. He takes it back to the\nDesk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.\nWe follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA\nBRASI. SONNY dials the number. There is no answer.\n\nSONNY\nLuca.\n\nINT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe interior of an abandoned building. SEVERAL MEN in suits\nAnd ties sit around in the booths.\n\nHAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI know you're not in the muscle end\nOf the family--so I don't want you\nTo be afraid. I want you to help\nThe Corleones and I want you to\nHelp me.\n\nHAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette\nIn his mouth. ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye\nTo the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered\nChina cup. HAGEN sips gratefully.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nYour boss is dead...\n\nHAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.\nSOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(pushing the bottle)\nHave some more. We got him outside\nHis office, just before I picked\nYou up. You have to make the peace\nBetween me and Santino.\n\nHAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nSonny was hot for my deal, right?\nYou know it's the smart thing to\nDo, too. I want you to talk Sonny\nInto it.\n\nHAGEN\n(pulling himself together)\nSonny will come after you with\nEverything he's got.\n\nSOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThat's going to be his first\nReaction. You have to talk some\nSense into him. The Tattaglia\nFamily stands behind me with all\nTheir people. The other New York\nFamilies will go along with anything\nThat prevents a full scale war.\n\nHe leans close to HAGEN.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThe Don was slipping; in the old\nDays I could never have gotten to\nHim. Now he's dead, nothing can\nBring him back. Talk to Sonny,\nTalk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza\nAnd Tessio...it's good business.\n\nHAGEN\nEven Sonny won't be able to call\nOff Luca Brasi.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI'll worry about Luca. You take\nCare of Sonny and the other two kids.\n\nHAGEN\nI'll try...It's what the Don would\nWant us to do.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(lifting his hands in\nAn expression of harmlessness)\nGood...then you can go...\n(he escorts him to\nThe door)\nI don't like violence. I'm a\nBusinessman, and blood is a big\nExpense.\n\nHe opens the door; they step out together.\n\nEXT NITE: BUILDING\n\nHAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.\n\nBut a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.\nHe indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to\nSOLLOZZO in private.\n\nThen SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression. He opens the\nDoor, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThe old man is still alive. Five\nBullets in his Sicilian hide and\nHe's still alive.\n(he gives a fatalistic\nShrug)\nBad luck for me, bad luck for you.\n\nEXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL driving during the night. There is a little fog in\nThe air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making\nIt difficult to see well. The wipers move across the view,\nAs the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still\nDecorated for Christmas. The courtyard is bathed with white\nFloodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look. The\nNarrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link\nChain. There are strange cars parked along the curving\nCement walk. SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and\nChain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.\n\nMAN\nWho're you?\n\nANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and\nThen turns.\n\nMAN 2\nIt's the Don's kid; take the car,\nI'll bring him inside.\n\nThe FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.\n\nINT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL\nDoesn't recognize. They pay little attention to him. Most\nOf them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas\nTree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.\n\nTHERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a\nCigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water\nGlass half filled with whiskey. On the other side of the\nSofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is\nSweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black\nWith his saliva. PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the\nOther side of the room. CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at\nHim.\n\nCLEMENZA\nYour mother's at the hospital with\nThe old man: He's gonna pull through.\n\nMICHAEL nods his relief.\n\nMICHAEL\nThanks.\n\nHe moves to THERESA.\n\nMICHAEL\n(gently)\nYou heard from Tom yet?\n\nWithout looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and\nTrembles. Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the\nRoom; everyone speaks in a whisper.\n\nMICHAEL\n(taking her hand)\nC'mon.\n\nHe leads her into his father's office without knocking.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nSONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad. They look\nUp, startled.\n\nSONNY\nDon't worry, Theresa; they just\nWant to give Tom the proposition,\nThen they're going to turn him loose.\n\nHe reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise,\nHe kisses him on the cheek.\n\nSONNY\nI was worried when we couldn't get\nIn touch with you in that hick town.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow's Mom?\n\nSONNY\nGood. She's been through it before.\nMe too. You were too young to know\nAbout it. You better wait outside;\nThere're some things you shouldn't\nHear.\n\nMICHAEL\nI can help you out...\n\nSONNY\nOh no you can't, the old man'd be\nSore as hell if I let you get mixed\nUp in this.\n\nMICHAEL\nJesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.\n\nSONNY\nTheresa.\n\nShe understands, and leaves them alone.\n\nSONNY\nAll right, Mikey...who do we have\nTo hit, Clemenza or Paulie?\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat?\n\nSONNY\nOne of them fingered the old man.\n\nMICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on\nTrial for their lives.\n\nMICHAEL\nClemenza? No, I don't believe it.\n\nSONNY\nYou're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.\nIt was Paulie.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow can you be sure?\n\nSONNY\nOn the three days Paulie was sick\nThis month, he got calls from a\nPayphone across from the old man's\nBuilding. We got people in the\nPhone company.\n(he shrugs)\nThank God it was Paulie...we'll\nNeed Clemenza bad.\n\nMICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the\nSituation.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs it going to be all-out war, like\nLast time?\n\nSONNY\nUntil the old man tells me different.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.\n\nSONNY\nSollozzo is a dead man, I don't\nCare what it costs. I don't care\nIf we have to fight all the five\nFamilies in New York. The Tattaglia\nFamily's going to eat dirt. I\nDon't care if we all go down\nTogether.\n\nMICHAEL\n(softly)\nThat's not how Pop would have\nPlayed it.\n\nSONNY\nI know I'm not the man he was. But\nI'll tell you this and he'll tell\nYou too. When it comes to real\nAction, I can operate as good as\nAnybody short range.\n\nMICHAEL\n(calmly)\nAll right, Sonny. All right.\n\nSONNY\nChrist, if I could only contact Luca.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs it like they say? Is he that\nGood?\n\nOutside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.\nThen open the door and rush out.\n\nEveryone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped\nIn a tight embrace with his WIFE.\n\nHAGEN\nIf I plead before the Supreme\nCourt, I'll never do better than I\nDid tonight with that Turk.\n\nEXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's\nStudy. It stands out against the cold, dark night.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on\nThe edge of the sofa. The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nSONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted,\nIn shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep. It is four in the\nMorning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many\nSnacks. They can barely talk anymore.\n\nHAGEN\nIs the hospital covered?\n\nSONNY\nThe cops have it locked in and I\nGot my people there visiting Pop\nAll the time. What about the hit\nList.\n\nHAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.\n\nHAGEN\nToo much, too far, too personal.\nThe Don would consider this all\nPurely a business dispute: Get rid\nOf Sollozzo, and everything falls\nIn line. YOU don't have to go\nAfter the Tattaglias.\n\nCLEMENZA nods.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat about Luca? Sollozzo didn't\nSeem worried about Luca. That\nWorries me.\n\nSONNY\nIf Luca sold out we're in real\nTrouble.\n\nHAGEN\nHas anyone been able to get in\nTouch with him?\n\nSONNY\nNo, and I've been calling all night.\nMaybe he's shacked up.\n\nHAGEN\nLuca never sleeps over with a broad.\nHe always goes home when he's\nThrough. Mike, keep ringing Luca's\nNumber.\n\nMICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the\nNumber once again. He can hear the phone ringing on the\nOther end but no one answers. Then hangs up.\n\nHAGEN\nKeep trying every fifteen minutes.\n(exhausted)\n\nSONNY\nTom, you're the Consigliere, what\nDo we do if the old man dies?\n\nHAGEN\nWithout your father's political\nContacts and personal influence,\nThe Corleone family loses half its\nStrength. Without your father, the\nOther New York families might wind\nUp supporting Sollozzo, and the\nTattaglias just to make sure there\nIsn't a long destructive war. The\nOld days are over, this is 1946;\nNobody wants bloodshed anymore. If\nYour father dies...make the deal,\nSonny.\n\nSONNY\n(angry)\nThat's easy to say; it's not your\nFather.\n\nHAGEN\n(quietly)\nI was as good a son to him as you\nOr Mike.\n\nSONNY\nOh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it\nThat way.\n\nHAGEN\nWe're all tired...\n\nSONNY\nOK, we sit tight until the old man\nCan give us the lead. But Tom, I\nWant you to stay inside the Mall.\nYou too, Mike, no chances. Tessio,\nYou hold your people in reserve,\nBut have them nosing around the\nCity. The hospital is yours; I\nWant it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours\nA day.\n\nThere is a timid knock on the door.\n\nSONNY\nWhat is it?\n\nPAULIE GATTO looks in.\n\nCLEMENZA\nI tol' you to stay put, Paulie...\n\nPAULIE\nThe guy at the gate's outside...says\nThere's a package...\n\nSONNY\nTessio, see what it is.\n\nTESSIO gets up, leaves.\n\nPAULIE\nYou want me to hang around?\n\nSONNY\nYeah. Hang around.\n\nPAULIE\nOutside?\n\nCLEMENZA\nOutside.\n\nPAULIE\nSure.\n\nHe closes the door.\n\nSONNY\nClemenza. You take care of Paulie.\nI don't ever want to see him again.\nUnderstood?\n\nCLEMENZA\nUnderstood.\n\nSONNY\nOkay, now you can move your men\nInto the Mall, replace Tessio's\nPeople. Mike, tomorrow you take a\nCouple of Clemenza's people and go\nTo Luca's apartment and wait for\nHim to show. That crazy bastard\nMight be going after Sollozzo right\nNow if he's heard the news.\n\nHAGEN\nMaybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up\nIn this so directly. You know the\nOld man doesn't want that.\n\nSONNY\nOK forget it, just stay on the phone.\n\nMICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected. He dials Luca\nBrasi's number once again. The ring repeats, but no one\nAnswers.\n\nTESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest\nIn his hand. He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped\nInside.\n\nCLEMENZA\nA Sicilian message: Luca Brasi\nSleeps with the fishes.\n\nINT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we\nRemember him. BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.\nLUCA looks up at him.\n\nThen SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.\nLUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both\nClamp down as hard as they can. Suddenly, a garrote is\nThrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight. His\nFace begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally\nPurple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a\nFar more extreme way than a normal tongue could. His eyes\nBulge.\n\nONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's\nStrength leaves him.\n\nBRUNO\n(making an ugly face)\nOh Christ...all over the floor.\n\nSOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his\nFace.\n\nLUCA falls to the floor.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThe Godfather is next.\n\n----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)\n\nMorning in a simple Brooklyn suburb. There are rows of\nPleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block. A\nDark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a\nNoticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell. This\nIs ROCCO LAMPONE. The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,\nTalks to him through the screen door, and then points to the\nSide of the house. ROCCO moves to the garage, which is\nSpecially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work\nWashing a shiny brand new Lincoln. LAMPONE admires the car.\n\nLAMPONE\nNice.\n\nCLEMENZA\nCrazy Detroit delivered it with a\nWooden bumper. They're going to\nSend me the chrome bumpers in a\nCouple months. I waited two years\nFor this car to come with wooden\nBumpers!\n\nHe scrubs and polishes with great affection.\n\nCLEMENZA\nToday you make your bones on Paulie.\nYou understand everything?\n\nLAMPONE\nSure.\n\nAs he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,\nUnwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.\n\nCLEMENZA\n.22 soft-nosed load. Accurate up\nTo five feet.\n\nLAMPONE expertly puts the gun away. GATTO's car pulls into\nThe driveway, and he sounds the horn.\n\nThe two men walk to the car. GATTO is driving, a bit\nNervous, like he doesn't know what is up. LAMPONE gets in\nThe rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of\nRecognition. He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting\nTo chide PAULIE for being late. PAULIE flinches a little\nWhen he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:\n\nPAULIE\nRocco, sit on the other side. A\nBig guy like you blocks my rearview\nMirror.\n\nCLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.\n\nCLEMENZA\nGoddamn Sonny. He's running scared.\nHe's already thinking of going to\nThe mattresses. We have to find a\nPlace on the West Side. Paulie,\nYou know a good location?\n\nPAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook\nHe was on. Also there's the money he can make by selling\nSollozzo any secret location.\n\nPAULIE\nI'll think about it.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(grunting)\nDrive while you thinking; I wanna\nGet to the City this month!\n\nThe car pulls out.\n\nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)\n\nInside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump. OUR\nVIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.\n\nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter\nLight.\n\nINT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)\n\nInside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.\nHe tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of\nHim.\n\nCLEMENZA\nPay attention!\n\nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe car is parked in the City. PAULIE comes down from an\nAvailable apartment and gets back into the car.\n\nPAULIE\nGood for ten men...\n\nCLEMENZA\nOK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm\nSuppose to call when I found\nSomethin'.\n\nThe car pulls off.\n\nEXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\nNew part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.\nCLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.\n\nCLEMENZA\nYou wait; I'll call.\n\nHe walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the\nCorner and enters the Luna Restaurant.\n\nINT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.\nThe WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some\nBread--and then a plate of veal on his table. He eats.\n\nEXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;\nHe is well fed.\n\nWe move with him around the corner, not knowing what to\nExpect has happened to Paulie.\n\nThere is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,\nLAMPONE in the rear seat. CLEMENZA steps in.\n\nCLEMENZA\nHe talked my ear off. Want us to\nGo back to Long Beach; have another\nJob for us. Rocco, you live in the\nCity, can we drop you off?\n\nLAMPONE (O.S.)\nAh, I left my car at your place.\n\nCLEMENZA\nOK, then you gotta come back.\n\nThe car pulls out. By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and\nSecure.\n\nPAULIE\nYou think we'll go for that last\nPlace?\n\nCLEMENZA\nMaybe, or you gotta know now.\n\nPAULIE\nHoly cow, I don't gotta know nothing.\n\nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.\nInside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.\n\nCLEMENZA\nPaulie, pull over. I gotta take a\nLeak.\n\nThe car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds. CLEMENZA\nSteps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.\n\nHe turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer\nSee the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting\nThe ground. We wait on this for a moment; and then there\nAre two GUNSHOTS. CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and\nTurns, moving back to the car.\n\nPAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind\nHim are shattered.\n\nCLEMENZA\nLeave the gun.\n\nLAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few\nFeet where there is another car. They get in, and drive off.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nHIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL. It is late afternoon. Many strange\nCars are parked on the nearby streets. We can see the group\nOf BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries\nWith concealed weapons.\n\nMICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.\n\nHe is bundled in a warm marine coat. He looks at the\nStrange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe. They\nLook back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the\nRespect of his position. He is like an exile Prince. He\nWanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.\n\nA rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground\nEquipment. The basketball ring now half coming off. This\nIs where he was a child. Then a shout.\n\nCLEMENZA (O.S.)\nMike. Hey Mikey; telephone.\n\nCLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window. MICHAEL\nHurries into the house.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.\nHe points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the\nHook.\n\nCLEMENZA\nSome dame.\n\nMICHAEL picks it up.\n\nMICHAEL\nHello. Kay?\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nHow is your father?\n\nMICHAEL\nHe'll be OK.\n\nKAY (O.S.)\n(pause)\nI love you.\n\nHe glances at the THUGS in the kitchen. Tries to shield the\nPhone.\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nI LOVE YOU.\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah Kay, I'm here.\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nCan you say it?\n\nMICHAEL\nHuh?\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nTell me you love me.\n\nMICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table. He curls\nUp in a corner, and in a quarter voice:\n\nMICHAEL\nI can't...\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nPlease say it.\n\nMICHAEL\nLook. I'll see you tonight, OK?\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nOK.\n(click)\n\nCLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all\nThe button men stationed around the house.\n\nCLEMENZA\nHow come you don't tell that nice\nGirl you love her...here, learn\nSomething... you may have to feed\nFifty guys some day. You start\nWith olive oil...fry some garlic,\nSee. And then fry some sausage...or meat\nBalls if you like...then you throw\nIn the tomatoes, the tomato\nPaste...some basil; and a little\nRed wine...that's my trick.\n\nSONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.\n\nSONNY\nYou take care of Paulie?\n\nCLEMENZA\nYou won't see Paulie anymore. He's\nSick for good this winter.\n\nMICHAEL starts to leave.\n\nSONNY\nWhere are you going?\n\nMICHAEL\nTo the city.\n\nSONNY\n(to Clemenza; dipping\nBread into the sauce)\nSend some bodyguards.\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't need them, Sonny. I'm just\nGoing to see Pop in the hospital.\nAlso, I got other things.\n\nCLEMENZA\nSollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.\n\nSONNY\nOK, but be careful.\n\nEXT NITE: CAR\n\nMICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven\nInto the city. THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front\nSeat.\n\nINT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY\n\nMICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying\nTo book rooms.\n\nINT NITE: HOTEL\n\nMICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel. He is\nPreoccupied, she's concerned.\n\nMICHAEL\nVisiting hour ends at eight thirty.\nI'll just sit with him; I want to\nShow respect.\n\nKAY\nCan I go to the hospital with you?\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't think so. You don't want\nTo end up on page 3 of the Daily\nNews.\n\nKAY\nMy parents don't read the Daily\nNews. All right, if you think I\nShouldn't. I can't believe the\nThings the papers are printing.\nI'm sure most of it's not true.\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't think so either.\n(silence)\nI better go.\n\nKAY\nWhen will I see you again?\n\nMICHAEL\nI want you to go back to New\nHampshire...think things over.\n\nHe leans over her; kisses her.\n\nKAY\nWhen will I see you again?\n\nMICHAEL\nGoodbye.\n\nQuietly, he moves out the door.\n\nKAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:\n\nKAY\nGoodbye.\n\nEXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)\n\nA taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with\nA neon sign \"HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY.\" MICHAEL steps out, pays\nThe fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.\n\nMICHAEL looks.\n\nHe sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted. He\nIs the only one on the street. There are gay, twinkling\nChristmas decorations all over the building. He walks,\nSlowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps. He\nHesitates, looks around. This area is empty. He checks the\nAddress on a scrap of paper. It is correct. He tries the\nDoor, it is empty.\n\nHe walks in.\n\nINT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital\nLobby. He looks to the right; there is a long, empty\nCorridor. To the left: the same.\n\nHIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated\nBuilding lit by eerie green neon lighting. All we hear are\nHis sole footsteps.\n\nHe walks up to a desk marked \"INFORMATION\". No one is there.\nHe moves quickly to a door marked \"OFFICE\"; swings into it;\nNo one is there. He looks onto the desk: There is half a\nSandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.\n\nMICHAEL\nHello? Hello?\n\nNow he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,\nAlertly. MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all\nAlone. The floors have just been mopped. They are still wet.\n\nINT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS\n\nNow he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several\nFlights.\n\nINT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR\n\nHe steps out onto the fourth floor. He looks. There are\nMerely empty corridors. He takes out his scrap of paper;\nChecks it. \"Room 4A.\" Now he hurries, trying to follow the\nCode of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker\nAnd quicker they flash by him. Now he stops, looks up \"4A--\nCorleone\".\n\nThere is a special card table set up there with some\nMagazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the\nAshtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A\n\nSlowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he\nWill find. He looks. Lit by the moonlight through the\nWindow, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the\nRoom, and under a transparent oxygen tent. All that can be\nHeard is the steady though strained breathing. Slowly\nMICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,\nSecurely asleep. Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the\nBed, and run to his nose and mouth.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nThis startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around. It is a\nNURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.\n\nNURSE\nYou're not supposed to be here now.\n\nMICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm Michael Corleone--this is my\nFather. What happened to the\nDetectives who were guarding him?\n\nNURSE\nOh your father just had too many\nVisitors. It interfered with the\nHospital service. The police came\nAnd made them all leave just ten\nMinutes ago.\n(comfortingly)\nBut don't worry. I look in on him.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou just stand here one minute...\n\nQuickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.\n\nMICHAEL\nSonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm\nDown at the hospital. I came down\nLate. There's no one here. None\nOf Tessio's people--no detectives,\nNo one. The old man is completely\nUnprotected.\n\nSONNY (O.S.)\nAll right, get him in a different\nRoom; lock the door from the inside.\nI'll have some men there inside of\nFifteen minutes. Sit tight, and\nDon't panic.\n\nMICHAEL\n(furiously, but kept inside)\nI won't panic.\n\nHe hangs up; returns to the NURSE...\n\nNURSE\nYou cannot stay here...I'm sorry.\n\nMICHAEL\n(coldly)\nYou and I are going to move my\nFather right now...to another room\nOn another floor...Can you\nDisconnect those tubes so we can\nWheel the bed out?\n\nNURSE\nAbsolutely not! We have to get\nPermission from the Doctor.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou've read about my father in the\nPapers. You've seen that no one's\nHere to guard him. Now I've just\nGotten word that men are coming to\nThis hospital to kill him. Believe\nMe and help me.\n\nNURSE\n(frightened)\nWe don't have to disconnect them,\nWe can wheel the stand with the bed.\n\nShe does so...and they perform the very difficult task of\nMoving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.\n\nINT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)\n\nThey roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently\nDown the corridor. We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.\nMICHAEL hears them, stops.\n\nMICHAEL\nHurry, into there.\n\nThey push it into the first available room. MICHAEL peeks\nOut from the door. The footsteps are louder; then they\nEmerge. It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet\nOf flowers.\n\nMICHAEL\n(stepping out)\nWho is it?\n\nENZO\nMichael...do you remember me, Enzo,\nThe baker's helper to Nazorine, now\nHis son-in-law.\n\nMICHAEL\nEnzo, get out of here. There's\nGoing to be trouble.\n\nA look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.\n\nENZO\nIf there...will be trouble...I stay\nWith you, to help. I owe it to the\nGodfather.\n\nMICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.\n\nMICHAEL\nGo outside; stand in front...I'll\nBe out in a minute.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nThey part. MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they\nPut his FATHER.\n\nNURSE\n(frightened)\nHe's awake.\n\nMICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he\nCannot speak. MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.\n\nMICHAEL\nPop...Pop, it's me Michael. Shhhh,\nDon't try to speak. There are men\nWho are coming to try to kill you.\nBut I'm with you...I'm with you\nNow...\n\nThe OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot. MICHAEL tenderly\nPuts his finger to his FATHER's lips.\n\nEXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)\n\nOutside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,\nPacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only\nWeapon. MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him. They\nBoth stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.\nThey are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,\nLights it. ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.\n\nMICHAEL\nGet rid of those and look like\nYou've got a gun in your pocket.\n\nThe windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas\nDecorations.\n\nMICHAEL\nListen...\n\nWe HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming. MICHAEL\nAnd ENZO look with fear in their eyes. Then MICHAEL takes\nThe bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.\nThey stand, hands in their pockets.\n\nA long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.\nMICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive. The car\nSeems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.\nMICHAEL and ENZO are relieved. MICHAEL looks down; the\nBAKER's hands are shaking. He looks at his own, and they\nAre not.\n\nAnother moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of\nPolice sirens. They are clearly coming toward the hospital,\nGetting louder and louder. MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.\n\nIn a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of\nThe hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed\nPOLICE and DETECTIVES. He smiles his relief and starts\nToward them. TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his\nArms while ANOTHER frisks him. A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,\nSpattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,\nWith beefy red face and white hair seems furious. This is\nMcCLUSKEY.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nI thought I got all you guinea\nHoods locked up. Who the hell are\nYou and what are you doing here?\n\nANOTHER COP standing nearby:\n\nCOP\nHe's clean, Captain.\n\nMICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.\n\nMICHAEL\n(quietly)\nWhat happened to the detectives who\nWere supposed to be guarding my\nFather?\n\nMCCLUSKEY\n(furious)\nYou punk-hood. Who the hell are\nYou to tell me my business. I\nPulled them off. I don't care how\nMany Dago gangsters kill each other.\nI wouldn't lift a finger to keep\nYour old man from getting knocked\nOff. Now get the hell out of here;\nGet off this street you punk, and\nStay away from this hospital.\n\nMICHAEL stands quiet.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll stay until you put guards\nAround my father's room.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nPhil, lock this punk up.\n\nA DETECTIVE\nThe Kid's clean, Captain...He's a\nWar hero, and he's never been mixed\nUp in the rackets...\n\nMCCLUSKEY\n(furious)\nGoddam it, I said lock him up. Put\nThe cuffs on him.\n\nMICHAEL\n(deliberately, right\nTo McCLUSKEY's face,\nAs he's being handcuffed)\nHow much is the Turk paying you to\nSet my father up, Captain?\n\nWithout any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL\nSquarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.\nMICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw. He looks at\nMcCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and\nHe falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S\nMEN arrive.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nHIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL. The gateway now has a\nLong black car blocking it. There are more BUTTON MEN\nStationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying\nRifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN\nStanding by open windows. It is clear that the war is\nEscalating. A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,\nMICHAEL and HAGEN. MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged. He\nStops and looks up at the open window. We can see MEN\nHolding rifles.\n\nMICHAEL\nChrist, Sonny really means business.\n\nThey continue walking. TESSIO joins them. The various\nBODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.\n\nCLEMENZA\nHow come all the new men?\n\nTESSIO\nWe'll need them now. After the\nHospital incident, Sonny got mad.\nWe hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock\nThis morning.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY\n\nThey enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nSONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.\n\nSONNY\nI've got a hundred button men on\nThe streets twenty-four hours a day.\nIf Sollozzo shows one hair on his\nAss he's dead.\n\nHe sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,\nKiddingly.\n\nSONNY\nMikey, you look beautiful!\n\nMICHAEL\nCut it out.\n\nSONNY\nThe Turk wants to talk! The nerve\nOf that son of a bitch! After he\nCraps out last night he wants a meet.\n\nHAGEN\nWas there a definite proposal?\n\nSONNY\nSure, he wants us to send Mike to\nMeet him to hear his proposition.\nThe promise is the deal will be so\nGood we can't refuse.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat about that Tattaglias? What\nWill they do about Bruno?\n\nSONNY\nPart of the deal: Bruno cancels out\nWhat they did to my father.\n\nHAGEN\nWe should hear what they have to say.\n\nSONNY\nNo, no Consiglere. Not this time.\nNo more meetings, no more\nDiscussions, no more Sollozzo\nTricks. Give them one message: I\nWANT SOLLOZZO. If not, it's all\nOut war. We go to the mattresses\nAnd we put all the button men out\nOn the street.\n\nHAGEN\nThe other families won't sit still\nFor all out war.\n\nSONNY\nThen THEY hand me Sollozzo.\n\nHAGEN\nCome ON Sonny, your father wouldn't\nWant to hear this. This is not a\nPersonal thing, this is Business.\n\nSONNY\nAnd when they shot me father...\n\nHAGEN\nYes, even the shooting of your\nFather was business, not personal...\n\nSONNY\nNo no, no more advice on how to\nPatch it up Tom. You just help me\nWin. Understood?\n\nHAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.\n\nHAGEN\nI found out about this Captain\nMcCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.\nHe's definitely on Sollozzo's\nPayroll, and for big money.\nMcCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's\nBodyguard. What you have to\nUnderstand is that while Sollozzo\nIs guarded like this, he's\nInvulnerable. Nobody has ever\nGunned down a New York Police\nCaptain. Never. It would be\nDisastrous. All the five families\nWould come after you Sonny; the\nCorleone family would be outcasts;\nEven the old man's political\nProtection would run for cover. So\nJust...take that into consideration.\n\nSONNY\n(still fuming)\nMcCluskey can't stay with the Turk\nForever. We'll wait.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe can't wait. No matter what\nSollozzo say about a deal, he's\nFiguring out how to kill Pop. You\nHave to get Sollozzo now.\n\nSONNY\nThe kid's right.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat about McCluskey?\n\nMICHAEL\nLet's say now that we have to kill\nMcCluskey. We'll clear that up\nThrough our Newspaper contacts later.\n\nSONNY\nGo on Mike.\n\nMICHAEL\nThey want me to go to the conference\nWith Sollozzo. Set up the meeting\nFor two days from now. Sonny, get\nOur informers to find out where the\nMeeting will be held.\nInsist it has to be a public place:\nA bar or restaurant at the height\nOf the dinner hour. So I'll feel\nSafe. They'll check me when I meet\nThem so I won't be able to carry a\nWeapon; but Clemenza, figure out a\nWay to have one planted there for\nMe.\n(pause)\nThen I'll kill them both.\n\nEveryone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.\nSilence. SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter. He points\nA finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.\n\nSONNY\nYou? You, the high-class college\nKid. You never wanted to get mixed\nUp in the family business. Now you\nWanta gun down a police Captain and\nThe Turk just because you got\nSlapped in the face. You're taking\nIt personal, it's just business and\nHe's taking it personal.\n\nNow CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps\nHis face serious.\n\nMICHAEL\n(angrily, but cold)\nSonny, it's all personal, and I\nLearned it from him, the old man,\nThe Godfather. He took my joining\nThe Marines personal. I take\nSollozzo trying to kill my father\nPersonal, and you know I'll kill\nThem Sonny.\n\nMICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.\n\nINT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLOSE on a revolver.\n\nCLEMENZA (O.S.)\nIt's as cold as they come,\nImpossible to trace.\n(he turns it upside down)\nDon't worry about prints Mike, I\nPut a special tape on the trigger\nAnd butt. Here.\n(he hands the gun to\nAnother pair of hands)\nWhatsamatter? Trigger too tight.\n(it fires: very LOUD)\nI left it noisy, so it'll scare any\nPain-in-the-neck innocent bystander\nAway.\n\nMICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.\n\nCLEMENZA\nJust let your hand drop to your\nSide, and let the gun slip out.\nEverybody will still think you got\nIt. They'll be starin' at your\nFace, see? Then walk out of the\nPlace real fast, but don't run.\nDon't look anybody directly in the\nEye, but don't look away from them\nNeither. Hey, they'll be scared\nStiff o you, believe me. Nobody's\nGonna bother with you. Don't worry\nAbout nothing; you'd be surprised\nHow good these things go. O.K.,\nPut your hat on, let's see how you\nLook. Helps with identification.\n\nThey put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.\n\nCLEMENZA\nMostly it gives witnesses an excuse\nTo change their identification when\nWe make them see the light. Then\nYou take a long vacation and we\nCatch the hell.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow bad will it be?\n\nCLEMENZA\nProbably all the other families\nWill line up against us. But, it's\nAlright. These things have to\nHappen once every ten years or\nSo...gets rid of the bad blood.\nYou gotta stop 'em at the beginning.\nLike they shoulda stopped Hitler at\nMunich, they shoulda never let him\nGet away with that, they were just\nAsking for big trouble...\n\nINT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house. A card\nTable is set up with a man playing cards with three of the\nCorleone buttonmen.\n\nHe continues into the living room. It's a mess. SONNY\nAsleep on the sofa. On the coffee table are the remains of\nA take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of\nWhisky. The radio is playing.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy don't you stop living like a\nBum and get this place cleaned up.\n\nSONNY\nWhat are you, inspecting the\nBarracks?\n(SONNY sits up with\nHis head in his hands)\nYou ready? Did Clemenza tell you\nBe sure to drop the gun right away?\n\nMICHAEL\nA million times.\n\nSONNY\nSollozzo and McCluskey are going to\nPick you up in an hour and a half\nOn Times Square, under the big\nCamels sign.\n\nHAGEN\nWe don't let Mike go until we have\nThe hostage, Sonny.\n\nCLEMENZA\nIt's okay...the hostage is outside\nPlaying pinochle with three of my\nMen.\n\nThe phone rings in the DON's office.\n\nSONNY\nThat could be a Tattaglia informer\nWith the meeting place.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nHAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS\nMove in.\n\nHAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.\n\nSONNY\nOne of Tattaglia's people?\n\nHAGEN\nNo. Our informer in McCluskey's\nPrecinct. Tonight at 8:00 he\nSigned out for Louis' Restaurant in\nThe Bronx. Anyone know it.\n\nTESSIO\nSure, I do. It's perfect for us.\nA small family place with big\nBooths where people can talk in\nPrivate. Good food. Everybody\nMinds their business. Perfect.\n(he moves to the desk\nAnd makes a crude drawing)\nThis is the entrance, Mike. When\nYou finish just walk out and turn\nLeft, then turn the corner.\nClemenza, you gotta work fast to\nPlant the gun. They got an old-\nFashioned toilet with a space\nBetween the water container and the\nWall. We can tape the gun behind\nThere.\n\nCLEMENZA\nMike, they're gonna frisk you in\nThe car. You'll be clean so they\nWon't worry 'bout nothing. In the\nRestaurant, wait and talk a while,\nAnd then ask permission to go. See?\nThen when you come out, don't waste\nTime; don't sit down...you come out\nBlasting. And don't take chances.\nIn the head, two shots apiece. And\nOut as fast as your legs can move.\n\nSONNY\nI want somebody very good, very\nSafe to plant that gun. I don't\nWant my brother coming out of that\nToilet with just his dick in his\nHand.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThe gun will be there.\n\nSONNY\n(to MICHAEL, warmly)\nYou're on, kid...I'll square it\nWith Mom your not seeing her before\nYou left. And I'll get a message\nTo your girl friend when I think\nThe time is right.\n\nCLEMENZA\nWe gotta move...\n\nMICHAEL\nO.K. How long do you think before\nI can come back?\n\nSONNY\nProbably a year...\n\nHAGEN\n(starting to crack)\nJesus, I don't know...\n\nSONNY\nCan you do it Mike?\n\nMICHAEL moves out.\n\nEXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe enormous \"CAMELS\" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands\nMICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat\nCLEMENZA had given him. A long black car pulls around the\nCorner and slows before him. The DRIVER, leaning over, open\nThe front door.\n\nDRIVER\nGet in, Mike.\n\nHe does, the car drives off.\n\nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)\n\nInside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat\nAnd shakes MIKE's hand.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we\nCan straighten everything out. All\nThis is terrible, it's not the way\nI wanted things to happen at all.\nIt should never have happened.\n\nMICHAEL\nI want to settle things tonight. I\nWant my father left alone.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nHe won't be; I swear to you be my\nChildren he won't be. Just keep an\nOpen mind when we talk. I hope\nYou're not a hothead like your\nBrother, Sonny. It's impossible to\nTalk business with him.\n\nMcCLUSKEY grunts.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nHe's a good kid. He's all right.\nTurn around, up on your knees,\nFacing me.\n\nHe gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nI'm sorry about the other night\nMike. I'm getting too old for my\nJob, too grouchy. Can't stand the\nAggravation. You know how it is.\nHe's clean.\n\nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where\nThey're heading.\n\nThe car takes the George Washington Bridge. MICHAEL is\nConcerned.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe're going to New Jersey?\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(sly)\nMaybe.\n\nMICHAEL closes his eyes.\n\nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way\nTo New Jersey. Then suddenly it hits the divider,\nTemporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the\nLanes going back to New York. It then hits it very fast, on\nThe way back to the city.\n\nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)\n\nSOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and\nThen leans to the DRIVER.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nNice work; I'll remember it.\n\nMICHAEL is relieved.\n\nEXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in\nThe Bronx: The \"LUNA AZURA\". There is no one on the street.\nMICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with\nThem. He gets out, and opens the door. SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY\nAnd MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the\nCar. They enter the restaurant.\n\nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)\n\nA very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.\nSOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small\nRound table near the center of the room. There are empty\nBooths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,\nAnd ONE or TWO WAITERS. It is very quiet.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nIs the Italian food good here?\n\nSOLLOZZO\nTry the veal; it's the finest in\nNew York.\n\nThe solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.\nThey watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three\nGlasses. Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI am going to talk Italian to Mike.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nSure, you two go right ahead; I'll\nConcentrate on my veal and my\nSpaghetti.\n\nSOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian. MICHAEL listening\nCarefully and nodding every so often. Then MICHAEL answers\nIn Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on. The WAITER occasionally\nBrings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.\nThen MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in\nItalian, accidentally lapses into English.\n\nMICHAEL\n(using English for emphasis)\nMost important...I want a sure\nGuarantee that no more attempts\nWill be made on my father's life.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nWhat guarantees can I give you? I\nAm the hunted one. I've missed my\nChance. You think too highly of\nMe, my friend...I am not so\nClever...all I want if a truce...\n\nMICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling\nHolding his open hands up as if to say: \"I have no tricks up\nMy sleeve\". Then he looks away and makes a distressed look\nOn his face.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nWhat is it?\n\nMICHAEL\nIs it all right if I go to the\nBathroom?\n\nSOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious. He studies MICHAEL with\nHis dark eyes. Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's\nThigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nI frisked him; I've frisked\nThousands of young punks; he's clean.\n\nHe looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;\nIndicating the bathroom with his eyes. The MAN nods,\nIndicating no one is there.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nDon't take too long.\n\nMICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and\nDisappears inside.\n\nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very\nHard. He actually uses the urinal. Then he washes his\nHands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.\nThen he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.\nSlowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he\nCannot feel the gun. We see behind the tank his hand is\nJust a few inches from the gun...he gropes\nSearchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.\n\nCLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him. Then he\nBreaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep\nBreath and shoves it under his waistband. For some\nUnexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately\nWashes his hands and dries them. Then he goes out.\n\nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)\n\nHe hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.\nMcCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal. SOLLOZZO\nTurns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at\nMICHAEL. MICHAEL looks back. Then he smiles and continues\nBack to the table. He sits down.\n\nMICHAEL\nNow I can talk. I feel much better.\n\nThe MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now\nHe too relaxes. SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down\nComfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton\nHis jacket. SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again\nBut MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear\nHim.\n\nThe WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to\nSpeak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away\nFrom him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts\nThe gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his\nTemple. He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's\nHead blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the\nEntire area.\n\nThe WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is\nSprayed and stained with blood.\n\nSOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he\nSeems to hang in space suspended.\n\nMICHAEL pivots, and looks:\n\nThere is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal\nSuspended in air before his gaping mouth.\n\nMICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging\nThroat. He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound. Then\nCoolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right\nThrough McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.\n\nThe air is filled with pink mist.\nMICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.\nHe does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.\nNow he carefully shows his hands to be empty.\nThe WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an\nExpression of horror on his face.\nMICHAEL looks at his two victims:\nSOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by\nThe table.\nMcCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.\nMICHAEL is wildly at a peak. He starts to move out. His\nHand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.\nHe moves, not letting the gun go.\n\nMICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.\n\nHis hand: still holding the gun.\n\nHis face: finally he closes his eyes.\n\nHis hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.\n\nHe walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.\n\nHe sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had\nBeen recreated in wax.\n\nThen he leaves.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old\nUpright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.\nANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.\n\nA little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,\nQuietly eating. They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there\nIs an occasional laugh.\n\nROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered\nWith a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.\n\nA large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.\n\nThe sentimental tune is continued over the following:\n\nINT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie\nStill together in a bullet-riddled automobile.\n\nINT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.\n\nINT DAY: MATTRESS\n\nTen mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty\nLiving room of an apartment. THREE or FOUR MEN including\nCLEMENZA, are taking naps.\n\nAn arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.\n\nThe MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and\nPouring the wine.\n\nTrash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.\n\nINT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an\nOffice building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.\nTruman.\n\nEXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)\n\nANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning\nThree steps of a front stoop.\n\nINT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\nTESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a\nCrossword puzzle.\n\nA thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.\n\nSix or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.\nCoffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.\n\nA MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of\nRuffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.\n\nEXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)\n\nA CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet\nAlley.\n\nINT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in\nA pool of blood on the tablecloth.\n\nINT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\nA neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an\nApartment. We catch a glimpse of one headline: \"Five Family\nWar...\"\n\nThe table. The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts. ONE\nHas fallen asleep on his arms at the table.\n\nSEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.\n\nThe PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse. Picks up\nAnd takes a drag from his cigarette. The OTHER MAN nods\nAppreciatively.\n\nMAN\nNice Augie...nice.\n\nEXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)\n\nSeveral cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York\nApartment building. We recognize a couple of SONNY's\nBodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards\nAgainst the curb.\n\nInside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of\nBrass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.\n\nUp one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,\nSmoking a cigarette.\n\nOne of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch,\nWhich is attached to a key chain. We HEAR the sound of a\nDoor opening; they look up.\n\nThe man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.\n\nSONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI\nWrapped around him. She doesn't want to let go of him; she\nDraws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he\nComes out alone, adjusting his clothes.\n\nHe jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard\nOn the first floor, and moves outside toward his car. The\nMen quickly take up their positions. As he gets in his car:\n\nDRIVER\nPick up your sister?\n\nSONNY\nYeah.\n\nThe car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the\nBodyguards in their cars.\n\nINT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)\n\nHe knocks on the door. No answer. Then again.\n\nCONNIE'S VOICE\nWho is it?\n\nSONNY\nIt's me, Sonny.\n\nWe hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open. SONNY\nEnters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her\nBack to him.\n\nSONNY\n(tenderly)\nConnie, what is it?\n\nHe turns her around in his arms.\n\nHer face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her\nRough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.\nAs soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red\nWith rage. She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing\nHim from running out of the apartment.\n\nCONNIE\n(desperately)\nIt was my fault! I started a fight\nWith him and I tried to hit him so\nHe hit me. He didn't even try to\nHit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.\n\nSonny listens, and calms himself. He touches her shoulder,\nThe thin silk robe.\n\nSONNY\nI'm goin' to have the doctor come\nOver and take a look at you.\n\nHe starts to leave.\n\nCONNIE\nOh Sonny, please don't do anything.\nPlease don't.\n\nHe stops, and then laughs good naturedly.\n\nSONNY\nHey. Con. What'm I goin' to do?\nMake your kid a orphan before he's\nBorn.\n\nShe laughs with him. He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.\n\nEXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET\n\nCARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.\n\"Book\" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking\nBeer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the\nCorner. The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the\nKids on the street are still playing stickball.\n\nCARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street\nSuddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block\nAnd to a halt in front of the candy store. The tires\nScream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a\nMAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast\nThe everyone is paralyzed. It is a moment before we\nRecognize that it is SONNY.\n\nHis face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on\nThe stoop and has CARLO by the throat.\n\nHe pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down\nInto the street. But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,\nAnd hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to\nHide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.\nHis shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.\n\nSALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.\n\nSONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,\nIn a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing. His\nBlows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.\n\nThe kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching\nIn fascination.\n\nCARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.\n\nSONNY beats him mercilessly.\n\nNow SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become\nSpectators.\n\nSONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into\nCARLO's face and body.\n\nCARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does\nNothing, other than hang onto the railing.\n\nSONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag\nHim off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in\nThe effort. Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;\nEven biting them. CARLO screams but he does not let go.\n\nIt's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will\nNot be moved. SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him\nMore; but he is exhausted. Totally out of breath, he\nStammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.\n\nSONNY\nYou...bastard...You...hurt my\nSister... again...and I'll\nKill...you.\n\nHe wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.\nAnd hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,\nLeaving even his bodyguards in confusion. We notice ONE MAN\nWith a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially\nInterested.\n\nCARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands. He slumps\nOnto the stoop.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nHIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall. It is a gray, rainy day.\nYoung BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of\nVarious points around the main house and compound. Things\nHave changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new\nAnd secure gate house has been built. Security measures\nThat had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made\nA permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval\nFortress. We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the\nResult of a recent bomb attempt. The house nearest the\nCrater is damaged by fire.\n\nA taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright\nYellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the\nShelter of the gate house.\n\nThey are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they\nCall the main house.\n\nKAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still\nRuns down onto her face.\n\nShe notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the\nSullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.\n\nTOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.\n\nHAGEN\nKay, we weren't expecting you. You\nShould call...\n\nKAY\nI've tried calling and writing. I\nWant to reach Michael.\n\nHAGEN\nNobody knows where he is. We know\nHe's all right, but that's all.\n\nKAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with\nRainwater.\n\nKAY\nWhat was that?\n\nHAGEN\nAn accident. No one was hurt.\n\nKAY\nListen Tom, I let my cab go; can I\nCome in to call another one?\n\nTOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has\nTo.\n\nHAGEN\nSure...I'm sorry.\n\nThey hurry through the rain and into the Main House.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nIn the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and\nTakes her rainhat off.\n\nKAY\nWill you give this to him.\n\nHAGEN\nIf I accept that letter and you\nTold a Court of Law I accepted it,\nThey would interpret it as my\nHaving knowledge of his whereabouts.\nJust wait Kay, he'll contact you.\n\nWe hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE\nEnters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.\n\nMAMA\nYou're Mikey's little girl.\n\nKAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.\n\nMAMA\nYou eat anything?\n\nKAY shakes her head.\n\nMAMA\n(to HAGEN)\nDisgrazia, you don't even give the\nPoor girl a cup of coffee?\n\nHAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves\nToward MAMA, the letter extended.\n\nKAY\nWill you give this letter to Michael.\n\nHAGEN\nMama, no.\n\nMAMA\nYou tell me what to do? Even he\nDon't tell me what to do.\n\nShe takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.\n\nKAY\nWhy did they blame Michael?\n\nMAMA\nYou listen to me, you go home to\nYour family, and you find a good\nYoung man and get married. Forget\nAbout Mikey; he's no good for you,\nAnymore.\n\nShe looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what\nThat means.\n\nEXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)\n\nA hospital in New York City. POLICE and teams of PRIVATE\nDETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area. An ambulance\nWith a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the\nHospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL\nASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying\nThe DON.\n\nTESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing\nUp the rear. HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a\nMoment they disappear behind the ambulance. Then suddenly,\nSiren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung\nCars.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe Corleone Mall.\n\nEqually impressive security stands ready at the Corleone\nMall. EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE\nDETECTIVES.\n\nIt all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.\nAll is silent. The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday\nClothes, wait.\n\nEXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)\n\nOne ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,\nPreceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a\nTeam of BUTTON MEN.\n\nSitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with\nA rifle on his lap.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nInside the Main CORLEONE House:\n\nHospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully\nUnder the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and\nVarious GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.\n\nAll the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,\nTHERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but\nBeen converted into a hospital room, with complete and\nExtensive equipment. The various CHILDREN get a turn to\nKiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then\nSONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO\nShould leave.\n\nThey do, the door is closed.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the\nSunday dinner, and set the table.\n\nCARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.\n\nCONNIE\nWhat's the matter, Carlo?\n\nCARLO\nShut up.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nAll the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with\nGrim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN. The DON\nDoes not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and\nGlances, as clearly as if they were verbalized. HAGEN is\nThe spokesman for the family.\n\nHAGEN\n...since McCluskey's killing, the\nPolice have cracked down on most of\nOur operations...on the other\nFamilies too. There's been a lot\nOf bad blood.\n\nThe OLD MAN glances at SONNY.\n\nSONNY\nPop, they hit us and we hit them\nBack.\n\nHAGEN\nWe put out a lot of material\nThrough our contacts in the\nNewspapers...about McCluskey's\nBeing tied up with Sollozzo in the\nDrug Rackets...things are starting\nTo loosen up.\n\nThe OLD MAN nods.\n\nSONNY\nFreddie's gonna go to Las\nVegas...under the protection of Don\nFrancesco of L.A. I want him to\nRest...\n\nFREDO\nI'm goin' to learn the casino\nBusiness.\n\nThe DON nods approvingly. Then he searches around the room\nFor a face he does not see. HAGEN knows who he's looking for.\n\nHAGEN\nMichael...\n(he takes a breath)\nIt was Michael who killed Sollozzo.\n\nThe DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and\nRage.\n\nHAGEN\nHe's safe now...we're already\nWorking on ways to bring him back.\n\nThe DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they\nLeave him alone.\n\nINT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nHAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is\nExpansive and optimistic.\n\nSONNY\nWe'll let the old man take it easy\nFor a couple of weeks. I want to\nGet things going good before he\nGets better. What's the matter\nWith you?\n\nHAGEN\nYou start operating, the five\nFamilies will start their raids\nAgain. We're at a stalemate Sonny,\nYour war is costing us a lot of\nMoney.\n\nSONNY\nNo more stalemate Tom, we got the\nSoldiers, we'll match them gun for\nGun if that's how they want it.\nThey know me for what I am, Tom--\nAnd they're scared of me.\n\nHAGEN\nYes. That's true, you're getting a\nHell of a reputation.\n\nSONNY\nWell it's war! We might not be in\nThis shape if we had a real war-\nTime Consiglere, a Sicilian. Pop\nHad Genco, who do I have?\n(TOM starts to leave)\nHey Tom, hey...hey. It's Sunday,\nWe're gonna have dinner. Don't be\nSore.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table\nOver Sunday dinner. SONNY is at the head of the table.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nSOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed\nMall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally\nBy the gate.\n\nONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house. A\nYoung BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.\n\n-----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------\n\nINT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)\n\nCONNIE and CARLO's apartment. She's in a slip, on the phone.\nWe HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.\n\nCONNIE\nWho is this?\n\nGIRL (O.S.)\n(giggle)\nI'm a friend of Carlo's. I just\nWanted to tell him I can't see him\nTonight; I have to go out of town.\n\nCONNIE's face turns red.\n\nCONNIE\nYou lousy tramp bitch.\n(click)\n\nShe slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the\nBathroom drying his golden body.\n\nCARLO\nWhat was that?\n\nCONNIE\nYour girl friend. She says she\nCan't make it tonight. You lousy\nBastard you have the nerve to give\nYour whores my telephone number.\nI'll kill you, you bastard!\n\nShe hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then\nShe flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy\nBelly heaving under the thin slip.\n\nCARLO\n(defending himself)\nYou're crazy. She was kidding\nAround; I don't know, some nut.\n\nHe pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue\nDressing.\n\nCONNIE\nYou're staying home. You're not\nGoing out.\n\nCARLO\nOK, OK. You gonna make me something\nTo eat at least?\n\nThat calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing\nHeavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and\nStarts her wifely duties.\n\nCARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in\nThe doorway.\n\nCONNIE\nThe food is on the table.\n\nCARLO\nI'm not hungry yet.\n\nCONNIE\nEat it, it's on the table.\n\nCARLO\nBa Fa Goulle.\n\nCONNIE\nBA FA GOULE YOU!\n\nShe turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen. A moment\nLater we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking. CARLO\nSlowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically\nSmashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy\nVeal and peppers all over the apartment floor.\n\nCARLO\nYou filthy guinea spoiled brat.\nClean it up or I'll kick your head\nIn.\n\nCONNIE\nLike hell I will.\n\nShe stands there, solid, ready to punch him again. Slowly,\nHe slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in\nHis hand.\n\nCARLO\nClean it up!\n\nHe swings the belt against her heavy hips. She moves back\nInto the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it\nReady.\n\nCARLO\nEven the female Corleones are\nMurderers.\n\nHe puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her. She\nMakes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids. He\nPulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process. She\nGets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,\nGets her; and starts to slap her in the face.\n\nShe breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.\n\nCONNIE\nThe baby! The baby!\n\nINT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nShe runs into the bedroom; he follows. She moves into a\nCorner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide\nUnder the bed.\n\nHe reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.\n\nHe slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he\nThrows her on the bed, contemptuously. He grabs part of her\nThigh, pinching it very hard.\n\nCARLO\nYou're fat as a pig.\n\nThen he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving\nHer in tears. She is crying; she pulls herself to the\nBedroom phone, and in a whisper:\n\nCONNIE\nMama...mama, it's Connie. Mama, I\nCan't talk any louder. No, I don't\nWant to talk to Sonny.\n\nWe can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)\n\nIn the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the\nWhispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.\n\nSONNY\nYeah Connie.\n\nCONNIE (O.S.)\nSonny, just send a car to bring me\nHome. I'll tell you then, it's\nNothing Sonny, don't you come.\nSend TOM, please Sonny, it's\nNothing; I just want to come home.\n\nSONNY's face is turning red.\n\nSONNY\n(in a controlled voice)\nYou wait there. You just wait there.\n\nHe hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.\n\nSONNY\n(quietly)\nThat sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...\n\nHAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he\nCannot interfere.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL\n\nSONNY leaves the house. HAGEN moves to the outside mall\nJust as SONNY's car is driving off. He moves to a group of\nBUTTON MEN.\n\nHAGEN\nGo after him.\n\nEXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)\n\nSONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.\nAfter a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is\nTrailing.\n\nSONNY is driving; he is very angry.\n\nEXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)\n\nSONNY in his car; driving back. Still breathing hard and\nStill furious. Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.\nHe starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a\nToll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the\nCOLLECTOR.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT\n\nThe serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nThis is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for\nDon Corleone, at his request.\n\nBONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.\nBONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.\n\nBONASERA\nYes, I understand. I'm listening.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nYou owe the Don a service. In one\nHour, not before, perhaps later, he\nWill be at your funeral parlor to\nAsk for your help. Be there to\nGreet him. If you have any\nObjections speak now, and I'll\nInform him.\n\nSilence. BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.\n\nBONASERA\nAnything...Anything the Godfather\nWishes.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nGood. He never doubted you.\n\nBONASERA\nThe Don himself is coming to me\nTonight?\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nYes.\n(click)\n\nBONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE\nSees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.\n\nSilently, he begins the ritual of dressing. His WIFE knows\nSomething serious is happening, and never takes her eyes\nFrom him. He lights a cigarette.\n\nBONASERA\nFor the last year, they have been\nKilling one another. So now, what?\nYour Godfather comes to me...Why?\n(whispering, slyly)\nThey've killed someone so important\nThat they wish to make his body\nDisappear.\n\nMRS. BONASERA\n(frightened)\nAmerigo!\n\nBONASERA\nThey could make me an accomplice to\nTheir murder. They could send me\nTo jail!\n\nHe slips into his trousers. Then he moves to his WIFE to\nTie his tie, as she has done for years.\n\nBONASERA\nAnd if the other families find\nOut...they will make me their enemy.\nThey could come here to our house.\nI curse the day I ever went to the\nGodfather.\n\nEXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)\n\nWith his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.\n\nINT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)\n\nBONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without\nTurning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,\nPast the tables, and equipment. He operates the chain that\nLifts a large overhead garage type door. And looks out into\nThe alley.\n\nHe sits on a bench, and waits.\n\nEXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley;\nWe notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral\nParlor.\n\nCLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.\nBONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak. He notices TWO\nOTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a\nCORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet\nProtruding.\n\nBONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way\nThe MEN should carry their sinister burden.\n\nINT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThey carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming\nRoom.\n\nThen BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the\nDarkness somewhat uncertainly. It is DON CORLEONE.\n\nHe walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking. His\nCold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.\nThen, after a long gaze:\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWell my friend, are you ready to do\nMe this service?\n\nBONASERA nods. The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming\nTable; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.\n\nBONASERA\nWhat do you wish me to do?\n\nDON CORLEONE\n(staring at the table)\nI want you to use all your powers,\nAll your skill, as you love me. I\nDo not want his mother to see him\nAs he is.\n\nHe draws down the gray blanket.\n\nBONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:\n\nThe bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.\n\nEXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)\n\nSONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.\n\nA car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the\nBooth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets\nHim, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll\nBooths on both side of him, and from the front window of the\nCar blocking him.\n\nThe windows of his car are shot out.\n\nBullet holes puncture the doors of his car.\n\nHis hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.\n\nHis arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it\nContinues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that\nHe will survive it.\n\nSuddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and\nActually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER\nFire.\n\nHis face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.\n\nA FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and\nMake off in the distance.\n\nSONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they\nAre too late.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nView on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room. He is silent\nA moment, and then:\n\nHAGEN\n(quietly)\nOK. Go to Clemenza's house and\nTell him to come here right away.\nHe'll tell you what to do.\n\nThe MEN leave him alone. He is quiet, standing in the\nMiddle of the living room a moment. He looks in the\nDirection of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA\nMoving around.\n\nINT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)\n\nTOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the\nDON's room. He opens the DON's door. Looks in.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe DON in his hospital bed. Asleep under sedation. HAGEN\nHesitates. He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN. He\nCloses the door.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)\n\nHAGEN alone in the office. He is drinking. He looks up at\nThe sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving. Then he\nHears footsteps.\n\nThe door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE\nSlowly enters the room. He walks directly to his stuffed\nArmchair, sits down. His face is stern, as he looks into\nHAGEN's eyes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGive me a drop of anisette.\n\nHAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy wife was weeping before she fell\nAsleep, outside my window I saw my\nCaporegimes to the house, and it is\nMidnight. So, Consigliere of mine,\nI think you should tell your Don\nWhat everyone knows.\n\nHAGEN\n(quietly)\nI didn't tell Mama anything. I was\nAbout to come up and wake you and\nTell you. Just now.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBut you needed a drink first.\n\nHAGEN\nYes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNow you've had your drink.\n\nPause.\n\nHAGEN\nThey shot Sonny on the Causeway.\n(pause)\nHe's dead.\n\nDON CORLEONE blinks. One feels that just for a second he\nLoses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of\nHim on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI want no inquiries made. No acts\nOf vengeance.\n(pause)\nConsigliere, arrange a meeting with\nThe heads of the five\nFamilies...this war stops now.\n\nHe rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nCall Bonasera...he will do me a\nService.\n\nAnd leaves. HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...\n\nHAGEN\nThis is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for\nDon Corleone, at his request.\n\nBONASERA (O.S.)\nYes, I understand I'm listening.\n\nHAGEN\nYou owe the Don a service. He has\nNo doubt that you will repay it.\n\nEXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)\n\nDay in Manhattan. An impressive Bank Building in the\nFinancial center of New York. Many limousines are parked,\nUniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.\n\nINT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.\n\nCARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,\nSits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a\nMAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and\nSettles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;\nAs the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:\n\nDON CORLEONE (O.S.)\nI want to thank you all for coming.\nI consider it a service done to me\nPersonally and I am in the debt of\nEach and every one of you.\nEspecially those of you who have\nTraveled from such distances as\nCalifornia, St. Louis, Kansas City;\nAnd New Orleans...\n\nThe VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both\nYounger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,\nShort and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the\nTable to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his\nJEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an\nOlder man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO\nCUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then\nDON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair\nAnd a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his\nEarly sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at\nCONNIE's Wedding.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAh well, let's get down to business.\nWe are all honorable men here, we\nDon't have to give assurances as if\nWe were lawyers.\n(he sits, gazes out\nAt them, and sighs)\nHow did things ever go so far?\nWell, no matter. A lot of\nFoolishness has come to pass. It\nWas so unfortunate, so unnecessary.\n\nThe VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks. A\nLarge, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,\nAnd two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during\nThe day's trading, and projected above.\n\nDON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTattaglia has lost a son; I have\nLost a son. We are quits. Let\nThere be a peace...\n(he gestures\nExpressively,\nSubmissively, with\nHis hands)\nThat is all I want...\n\nBARZINI\nDon Corleone is too modest. He had\nThe judges and politicians in his\nPocket and he refused to share them.\nHis refusal is not the act of a\nFriend. He takes the bread out of\nThe mouths of our families. Times\nHave changed, it's not like the old\nDays where everyone can go his own\nWay. If Don Corleone had all the\nJudges and politicians in New York,\nThen he must share them or let\nOthers use them. Certainly he can\nPresent a bill for such services,\nWe're not Communists, after all.\nBut he has to let us draw water\nFrom the well. It's that simple.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy friends, I didn't refuse out of\nMalice. You all know me. When\nHave I ever refused an accommodation?\nBut why, this time? Because I\nThink this drug business will\nDestroy us in the years to come.\nIt's not like whiskey or gambling\nOr even women which most people\nWant and is forbidden them by the\nPezzonovante of the Church and the\nGovernment. But drugs? No. Even\nPolicemen, who help us in gambling\nAnd other things would refuse to\nHelp us in drugs. But...I am\nWilling to do whatever all of you\nThink is necessary.\n\nDON ZALUCHI\nI don't believe in drugs. For\nYears I paid my people extra so\nThey wouldn't do that kind of\nBusiness...$200 a week. But it\nDidn't matter. Somebody comes to\nThem and says, \"I have powders, if\nYou put up three, four thousand\nDollar investment, we can make\nFifty thousand distributing.\" Who\nCan resist such a profit?\nThere's no way to control it, as a\nBusiness...to keep it respectable.\n(rapping the table)\nI don't want it near schools! I\nDon't want it sold to children.\nThat is an infamita.\n(thinking)\nIn my city I would try to keep the\nTraffic in the dark people, the\nColored. They are the best\nCustomers, the least troublesome,\nAnd they are animals anyway. They\nHave no respect for their wives or\nTheir families or themselves. Let\nThem lose their souls with drugs.\nBut something has to be done, we\nCan't have everybody running around\nDoing just what they please, like a\nBunch of anarchists.\n\nBARZINI\nThen, are we agreed; the traffic in\nDrugs will be permitted, but\nControlled; and Don Corleone agrees\nTo give it protection in the East.\n\nDON CORLEONE nods.\n\nBARZINI\nThat's the whole matter then, we\nHave the peace, and let me pay my\nRespects to Don Corleone, whom we\nHave all known over the years as a\nMan of his word.\n(noticing TATTAGLIA\nIs uneasy)\nDon Philip?\n\nTATTAGLIA\nI agree to everything here, I'm\nWilling to forget my own misfortune.\nBut I must hear strict assurance\nFrom Corleone. When time goes by\nAnd his position becomes stronger,\nWill he attempt any individual\nVengeance?\n\nThey all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that\nDON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something\nElse in mind. Slowly the DON rises.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI forego my vengeance for my dead\nSon, for the common good. But I\nHave selfish reasons. My youngest\nSon had to flee, accused of\nSollozzo's murder, and I must now\nMake arrangements so that he can\nCome home with safety, cleared of\nAll those false charges. That is\nMy affair, and I will make those\nArrangements.\n(with strength)\nBut I am a superstitious man...and\nSo if some unlucky accident should\nBefall my youngest son, if some\nPolice officer should accidentally\nShoot him, or if he should hang\nHimself in his cell, or if my son\nIs struck by a bolt of lightning,\nThen I will blame some of the\nPeople here. That, I could never\nForgive, but...aside from that, let\nMe swear by the souls of my\nGrandchildren that I will never be\nThe one to break the peace we have\nMade.\n\nEXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe DON's black limousine. He sits quietly in the padded\nRear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.\n\nIt is night. Lights flash by them every so often.\n\nHAGEN\nWhen I meet with Tattaglia's\nPeople; should I insist that all\nHis drug middle-men be clean?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMention it, don't insist. Barzini\nIs a man who will know that without\nBeing told.\n\nHAGEN\nYou mean Tattaglia.\n\nDON CORLEONE\n(shaking his head)\nBarzini.\n\nHAGEN\n(a revelation)\nHe was the one behind Sollozzo?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTattaglia is a pimp. He could\nNever have outfought Santino. But\nI wasn't sure until this day. No,\nIt was Barzini all along.\n\nThe black limousine speeds away from us in the night.\n\n------------------------------------------FADE OUT------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT\n\nA CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and\nDowncast, the left side of his face healed, but left\nGrotesque and misshapen.\n\nGRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea\nJacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.\n\nTHE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on\nEither side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his\nShoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple\nHonest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,\nAnd with a pleasing build. Each of the SHEPHERDS carry\nKnapsacks.\n\nThe THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,\nOverlooking an impressive view of land and sea.\n\nEXT DAY: SICILY ROAD\n\nThe THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make\nTheir way to a dusty rural road. We HEAR a rinky horn\nSound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.\nAn OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL. The\nCar pulls in front of them and stops. MICHAEL nods\nRespectfully.\n\nMICHAEL\nDon Tommassino.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nMichael, why must you do this. We\nHave been lucky so far, all these\nMonths you've been here we've kept\nYour name a secret. It is from\nLove for your father that I've\nAsked you never to more than an\nHour from the Villa.\n\nMICHAEL\nCalo and Fabrizzio are with me;\nNothing will happen.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nYou must understand that your\nFather's enemies have friends in\nPalermo.\n\nMICHAEL\nI know.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nWhere are you going?\n\nMICHAEL\nCorleone.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nThere is nothing there. Not anymore.\n\nMICHAEL\nI was told that my Grandfather was\nMurdered on its main street; and\nHis murderers came to kill my\nFather there when he was twelve\nYears old.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nLong ago. Now there is nothing:\nThe men killed each other in family\nVendettas...the others escaped to\nAmerica.\n\nMICHAEL\nDon Tommassino...I should see this\nPlace.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nThat is your birthright...but\nMichael, use this car.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo...I would like to walk to\nCorleone.\n\nThe OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nBe careful Michael, don't let them\nKnow your name.\n\nThe old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues\nOn his journey.\n\nEXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE\n\nThe THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit\nTrees, in bloom and bursting with life.\n\nEXT DAY: VILLAGE\n\nThey continue in the empty streets of a little town; the\nPost-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the\nEmpty streets. Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only\nGasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass. And there\nAre many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.\n\nThe THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main\nRoad \"VOTA COMMUNISTA\".\n\nEXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD\n\nThey continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally\nA donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.\n\nEXT DAY: FIELD\n\nOut in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession\nOf peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,\nMarching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men\nCarrying billowing red banners.\n\nEXT DAY: GROVE\n\nThey are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees\nIs a deep, tall field of wild flowers.\n\nThe Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out\nLoaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.\n\nMICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nYou tell us about America.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow do you know I come from America?\n\nFABRIZZIO\nWe hear. We were told you were a\nPezzonovanta...big shot.\n\nMICHAEL\nOnly the son of a Pezzonovanta.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nHey America! Is she as rich as\nThey say?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nTake me to America! You need a\nGood lupara in America?\n(pats his shotgun)\nYou take me, I'll be the best man\nYou got. \"Oh say, can you\nSeeee...By da star early light...\"\n\nMICHAEL laughs.\n\nEXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD\n\nThe TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military\nConvoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of\nThe U.S. drivers, as they move by.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nAmerica.\nHey America!\nTake me with you!\nHey, take me to America G.I.!\n\nEXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL\n\nThey continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until\nThey hesitate, and look down.\n\nCALO\nCorleone.\n\nThey can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.\n\nEXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET\n\nMICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of\nThe village. They walk behind him, and spread to either\nSide about fifteen feet away from him.\n\nThey move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.\nMICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.\nThey go on.\n\nThey move up a very narrow old street. MICHAEL looks at the\nDoorways that they pass.\n\nMOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.\n\nCALO sees MICHAEL looking.\n\nCALO\nThe names of the dead.\n\nMICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street. He looks.\n\nThe street is empty, barren. Occasionally, an old woman\nWill pass.\n\nMICHAEL turns his head.\n\nThe other side of the street: empty and deathly.\n\nA HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old\nStreet, the shepherds a respectful distance away.\n\n-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------\n\nEXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE\n\nA green ribboned field of a baronial Estate. Further ahead\nIs a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been\nDiscovered in the ruins of Pompeii. There is a group of\nYoung village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,\nDressed in black. They have been gathering the pink sulla,\nPurple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon\nBlossoms. They are singing, off in the distance as they work.\n\nMICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this\nFantasy-like scene.\n\nFABRIZZIO\n(calling out to them)\nHey, beautiful girls!\n\nMICHAEL\n(sternly)\nShhhhh.\n\nHe settles down to watch.\n\nThe GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that\nCling to their bodies. They are still in their teens, but\nDeveloped and womanly.\n\nThey are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not\nAware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.\nThree or four of the girls begin chasing one of them\nPlayfully, in the direction of the grove.\n\nThe GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her\nLeft hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws\nThem back at her pursuers laughing.\n\nThey come closer and closer. Just short of the grove, she\nPoses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the\nView of the THREE MEN. She stands there on her toes about\nTo run.\n\nMICHAEL sees her; now face to face. He looks.\n\nHer face. Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair\nAnd a rich mouth.\n\nFABRIZZIO\n(murmuring)\nJesus Christ, take my soul. I'm\nDying.\n\nQuickly, she turns, and runs away.\n\nMICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her. We hold\nOn him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS\nLaughing. Then he turns to them.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nYou got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?\n\nCALO pats him on the shoulder.\n\nCALO\nEasy man.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nFABRIZZIO\nYou can't hide it when you're hit\nBy the thunderbolt.\n\nEXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE\n\nThe little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,\nIs decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.\n\nMICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central\nSquare, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.\n\nThe proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;\nHe greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at\nTheir table.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nYou know all the girls in this\nTown, eh? We saw some beauties\nComing down the road. One in\nParticular got our friend hit with\nThe Thunderbolt...\n(he indicates MICHAEL)\n\nVITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with\nNew interest.\n\nVITELLI\nYou had better bring a few bottles\nHome with you, my friend; you'll\nNeed help sleeping tonight.\n(he laughs)\n\nFABRIZZIO\nThis one could seduce the devil. A\nBody! and eyes as big and black as\nOlives.\n\nVITELLI\n(laughing with\nThem...pouring more wine)\nI know about what you mean!\n\nFABRIZZIO\nThis was a beauty. Right, Calo?\n\nVITELLI\n(laughing)\nBeautiful all over, eh?\n\nFABRIZZIO\nAnd hair. Black and curly, like a\nDoll. And such a mouth.\n\nVITELLI does not laugh quite so much.\n\nVITELLI\nYes, we have beautiful girls here...\nBut virtuous.\n\nVITELLI is no longer drinking with them.\n\nMICHAEL\nShe wore a red dress, and a red\nRibbon in her hair. She looks more\nGreek than Italian. Do you know a\nBeauty like that?\n\nAs MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,\nUntil he wears a scowl.\n\nVITELLI\nNo.\n\nThen he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nGod in Heaven, I think I\nUnderstand...\n\nHe goes into the back room after the innkeeper. Then he\nReturns.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nLet's get out of here; he's boiling\nUp his blood to do us mischief.\nIt's his daughter.\n\nThey start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.\n\nCALO\nCome quickly.\n\nMICHAEL\nInnkeeper. More wine!\n\nFABRIZZIO\n(whispered)\nThe old bastard mentioned two sons\nHe only has to whistle up.\n\nMICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.\n\nMICHAEL\nTell him to come to me.\n\nThe two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in\nA moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI\nBetween them.\n\nMICHAEL\n(quietly)\nI understand I've offended you by\nTalking about your daughter. I\nOffer you my apologies, I'm a\nStranger in this country, I don't\nKnow the customs very well. Let me\nSay this, I meant no disrespect to\nYou or her...\n\nCALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.\n\nVITELLI\n(shrugs)\nWho are you and what do you want\nFrom my daughter?\n\nMICHAEL\nI am an American hiding in Sicily\nFrom the police of my country. My\nName is Michael. You can inform\nThe police and make your fortune\nBut then your daughter would lose a\nFather rather than gain a husband.\nIn any case, I want to meet your\nDaughter. With your permission and\nUnder the supervision of your\nFamily. With all decorum. With\nAll respect. I am an honorable man.\n\nCALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then\nAsks:\n\nVITELLI\nAre you a friend of the friends?\n\nMICHAEL\nWhen the proper time comes, I'll\nTell you everything that a wife's\nFather should know.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nIt's the real Thunderbolt, then.\n\nVITELLI\n(formally)\nCome Sunday morning: My name is\nVitelli and my house is up there on\nThe hill, above the village.\n\nMICHAEL\nYour daughter's name?\n\nVITELLI\nAppolonia.\n\n-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------\n\nEXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD\n\nMUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from\nPalermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an\nAlfa Romeo. CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday\nBest, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their\nLuparas on their shoulders.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,\nRocky and bouncing on the dirt road.\n\nThe Sunday churchbells ring.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE\n\nMICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by\nThe yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the\nMOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.\nFinally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate\nSunday clothing. Now he presents the wrapped gift to\nAPPOLONIA. She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives\nHer permission to open it. She unwraps it. Her eyes light\nAt the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.\n\nShe looks at him.\n\nAPPOLONIA\nGrazia.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE\n\nNow the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's\nCafe.\n\nMICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS,\nThough they are all dressed differently.\n\nThey go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is\nTalking and talking.\n\nMICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.\nShe wears the gold necklace around her neck.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME\n\nMICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,\nSeemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.\n\nAs the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a\nHalf dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces\nFurther behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on\nTheir shoulders.\n\nFurther up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,\nAnd falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm. She modestly regains\nHer balance, and they continue walking.\n\nBehind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH\n\nChurch bells in an ancient belfry ring out. Music, old and\nDissonant, plays.\n\nThere is a bridal procession in the street of the village;\nThe same in feeling and texture as it might have been five\nHundred years ago.\n\nDonkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant\nFlowers; children carrying candles and wearing white\nConfirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by\nCountless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.\n\nWe present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with\nAll the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in\nSicily.\n\nAPPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome\nDespite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE\n\nCALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the\nGreat wedding celebration. It is held in the Village\nSquare; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the\nTops of buildings, carrying luparas.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nINT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA\n\nMICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight\nFills the room.\n\nHe turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA. A\nLittle frightened; but lovely.\n\nHe moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,\nLooking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.\n\nSlowly and tenderly he kisses her. Her tiny hands come up\nTo his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.\n\nShe lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.\n\n--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------\n\nINT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA\n\nMorning. MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the\nRoom.\n\nAPPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially\nCovered by the bedsheets.\n\nHe looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.\n\nEXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD\n\nHIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA\n\nWe HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving\nErratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost\nHitting th inner court wall.\n\nAPPOLONIA is laughing, driving. MICHAEL pretends to be\nFrightened, as he teaches her to drive.\n\nOutside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking\nGuard duty.\n\nThe car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's safer to teach you English.\n\nAPPOLONIA\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday,\nThursday, Friday...See, I learned\nIt. Now teach me to drive!\n\nDON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard. He seems tired and\nConcerned.\n\nMICHAEL\nCiao, Don Tommassino.\n\nAPPOLONIA kisses him.\n\nMICHAEL\nThings went badly in Palermo?\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nThe younger men have no respect.\nThings are changing; I don't know\nWhat will happen. Michael, because\nOf the wedding, people now know\nYour name.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs that why there are more men on\nThe walls?\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nEven so, I don't think it is safe\nHere anymore. I've made plans to\nMove you to a villa near Siracuse.\nYou must go right away.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat is it?\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nBad news from America. Your\nBrother, Santino. He has been\nKilled.\n\nFor a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the\nFive Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.\n\nEXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD\n\nMorning. MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.\n\nBelow, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,\nCombing his thick hair.\n\nMICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.\n\nMICHAEL\nGet the car. I'll be leaving in\nTen minutes. Where's Calo?\n\nFABRIZZIO\nCalo is having a cup of coffee in\nThe kitchen. Is your wife coming\nWith you?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, she's going home to her family.\nShe'll join me in a few weeks...\n\nINT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN\n\nMICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the\nKitchen. CALO is just finishing a bite. He rises when he\nSees MICHAEL.\n\nCALO\nShould I get your bag?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, I'll get it. Where's Appolonia?\n\nCALO\n(smiling)\nShe is sitting in the driver's seat\nOf the car, dying to step on the\nGas. She'll be a real American\nWoman before she gets to America.\n\nMICHAEL smiles.\n\nMICHAEL\nTell Fabrizzio and wait for me in\nThe car.\n\nHe leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.\n\nHe looks out from the opening in the doorway.\n\nEXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD\n\nThere is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's\nSeat, playing with the wheel like a child.\n\nCALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear\nSeat.\n\nThen MICHAEL seems disturbed.\n\nOver, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO\nDisappear through the gate.\n\nMICHAEL\n(muttering to himself)\nWhere the hell is he going?\n\nMICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.\n\nMICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer\nCourtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.\n\nAPPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay\nWhere he is.\n\nAPPOLONIA\n(calling out)\nI'll drive to you.\n\nHe smiles affectionately.\n\nCALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling\nBy his side. There is no sight of FABRIZZIO. Suddenly the\nSmile fades from MICHAEL's face. He steps forward and holds\nOut his hand.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. No!\n\nHis shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,\nAs she switched on the ignition.\n\nPart of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;\nAnd there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.\n\nMICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.\n\nINT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM\n\nMICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room. We hear\nWhispering around him, but can't make any of it out. A soft\nCloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open. DON\nTOMMASSINO is there, close to him. He looks at them and\nFrom their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.\n\nMICHAEL\nFabrizzio. Let your shepherds know\nThat the one who gives me Fabrizzio\nWill own the finest pastures in\nSicily.\n\n--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)\n\nEaster.\n\nA HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime. Hordes\nOf little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children\nAnd Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,\nSearching here and there for candy treasures and hidden\nEaster eggs.\n\nThe DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing\nBaggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around\nHis garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.\n\nSuddenly, he stops and looks.\n\nMICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.\n\nGreat emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in\nMICHAEL's direction.\n\nMICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son\nAnd embraces him.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBe my son...\n\nINT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY\n\nDON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the\nBuilding.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThis old building has seen its day.\nNo way to do business...too small,\nToo old.\n\nThey enter the DON's glass-panelled office.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nHave you thought about a wife? A\nFamily?\n\nMICHAEL\n(pained)\nNo.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI understand, Michael. But you\nMust make a family, you know.\n\nMICHAEL\nI want children, I want a family.\nBut I don't know when.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAccept what's happened, Michael.\n\nMICHAEL\nI could accept everything that's\nHappened; I could accept it, but\nThat I never had a choice. From\nThe time I was born, you had laid\nThis all out for me.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo, I wanted other things for you.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou wanted me to be your son.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYes, but sons who would be\nProfessors, scientists,\nMusicians...and grandchildren who\nCould be, who knows, a Governor, a\nPresident even, nothing's impossible\nHere in America.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen why have I become a man like\nYou?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou are like me, we refuse to be\nFools, to be puppets dancing on a\nString pulled by other men. I\nHoped the time for guns and killing\nAnd massacres was over. That was\nMy misfortune. That was your\nMisfortune. I was hunted on the\nStreets of Corleone when I was\nTwelve years old because of who my\nFather was. I had no choice.\n\nMICHAEL\nA man has to choose what he will be.\nI believe that.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat else do you believe in?\n\nMICHAEL doesn't answer.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBelieve in a family. Can you\nBelieve in your country? Those\nPezzonovante of the State who\nDecide what we shall do with our\nLives? Who declare wars they wish\nUs to fight in to protect what they\nOwn. Do you put your fate in the\nHands of men whose only talent is\nThat they tricked a bloc of people\nTo vote for them? Michael, in five\nYears the Corleone family can be\nCompletely legitimate. Very\nDifficult things have to happen to\nMake that possible. I can't do\nThem anymore, but you can, if you\nChoose to.\n\nMICHAEL listens.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBelieve in a family; believe in a\nCode of Honor, older and higher,\nBelieve in Roots that go back\nThousands of years into your Race.\nMake a family, Michael, and protect\nIt. These are our affairs, sono cosa\nNostra, Governments only protect\nMen who have their own individual\nPower. Be one of those men...you\nHave the choice.\n\n--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------\n\nEXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955)\n\nA MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.\n\nFREDO (O.S.)\nThere's a new one. Construction\nGoing on everywhere.\n\nMORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the\nBill marquees read: \"MARTIN AND LEWIS\", \"PATTI PAGE\", etc.\n\nFREDO (O.S.)\nThat's one of the family's new ones.\nNot bad, eh?\n\nEXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955)\n\nThe car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.\n\nInside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man,\nNERI, quiet and sinister.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy didn't Moe Green meet us at the\nAirport?\n\nFREDO\nHe had business at the hotel, but\nHe'll drop in for dinner.\n\nFrom the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a\nDiscourtesy.\n\nINT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)\n\nA whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of\nMICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI. Great fuss is made. They are\nBeing shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.\n\nFREDO\nYou look wonderful, kid; really\nWonderful. That doctor did some\nJob on your face.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou look good, too.\n\nThey enter the suite.\n\nFREDO\nNice, eh?\n\nFREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the\nBellboys, waiters and maids.\n\nFREDO\n(hurrying into the bedroom)\nKid, take a look-see.\n\nMICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.\n\nThere is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform,\nMirrors to each side. FREDO points upward.\n\nA VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.\n\nFREDO\nEver seen anything like that before?\n\nMICHAEL\n(dryly)\nNo.\n\nINT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)\n\nMICHAEL is alone in the bedroom. He is just finishing\nDressing; he puts on his jacket. From the window, with the\nLights blinking, we can tell it's late at night. MICHAEL\nPasses into the other room.\n\nHe stops, looks. He is disturbed.\n\nINT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)\n\nA magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite;\nA lavish table setting for eight. Standing by the table are\nHAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier,\nBeautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.\nNERI stands quietly by the door.\n\nFREDO\nMike! The party starting!\n\nMICHAEL\nCome here a minute, Fredo.\n\nFREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.\n\nMICHAEL\nWho are those girls?\n\nFREDO\n(jokingly)\nThat's for you to find out.\n\nMICHAEL\nGive them some money and send them\nHome.\n\nFREDO\nMike!\n\nMICHAEL\nGet rid of them...\n\nINT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)\n\nThey are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.\nMICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.\n\nMICHAEL\nJohnny, the Corleone family is\nThinking of selling out all our\nInterests in the Olive Oil business\nAnd settling here. Moe Greene will\nSell us his interest so it can be\nWholly owned by friends of the\nFamily.\n\nFREDDIE seems anxious.\n\nFREDO\nMike, you sure about Moe selling.\nHe never mentioned it to me and he\nLoves the business.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\n\nMICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.\n\nMICHAEL\nJohnny, the Don wants you to help\nUs get started. We figure\nEntertainment will be the big\nFactor in drawing gamblers. We\nHope you'll sign a contract to\nAppear five times a year for maybe\nA week long engagement.\nWe hope your friends in the movies\nWill do the same. We count on you\nTo convince them.\n\nJOHNNY\nSure, I'll do anything for my\nGodfather. You know that, Mike.\n\nThere is knock on the door. NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL,\nWho nods. NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters,\nFollowed by TWO BODYGUARDS. He is a handsome hood, dressed\nIn the Hollywood style. His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast\nStyle.\n\nMOE\nMike, good to see you. Got\nEverything you want?\n\nMICHAEL\nThanks.\n\nMOE\nThe chef cooked for you special;\nThe dancers will kick your tongue\nOut and you credit is good!\n(to his BODYGUARDS)\nDraw chips for all these people so\nThey can play on the house.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs my credit good enough to buy you\nOut?\n\nMOE laughs.\n\nMOE\nBuy me out?...\n\nMICHAEL\nThe hotel, the casino. The Corleone\nFamily wants to buy you out.\n\nGREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense. NERI eyes\nThe BODYGUARDS.\n\nMOE\n(furious)\nThe Corleone family wants to buy me\nOut. I buy you out. You don't buy\nMe out.\n\nMICHAEL\nYour casino loses money. Maybe we\nCan do better.\n\nMOE\nYou think I scam?\n\nMICHAEL\n(the worst insult)\nYou're unlucky.\n\nMOE\nYou goddamn dagos. I do you a\nFavor and take Freddie in when\nYou're having a bad time, and then\nYou try to push me out.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou took Freddie in because the\nCorleone family bankrolled your\nCasino. You and the Corleone\nFamily are evened out. This is for\nBusiness; name your price.\n\nMOE\nThe Corleone family don't have that\nKind of muscle anymore. The\nGodfather is sick. You're getting\nChased out of New York by Barzini\nAnd the other families, and you\nThink you can find easier pickings\nHere. I've talked to Barzini; I\nCan make a deal with him and keep\nMy hotel!\n\nMICHAEL\n(quietly, deadly)\nIs that why you thought you could\nSlap Freddie around in public?\n\nFREDO\n(his face turns red)\nAh Mike, that was nothing. Moe\nDidn't mean anything. He flies off\nThe handle sometimes; but me and\nHim are good friends. Right, Moe?\n\nMOE\nYeah sure. Sometimes I gotta kick\nAsses to make this place run right.\nFreddie and I had a little argument\nAnd I had to straighten him out.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou straightened my brother out?\n\nMOE\nHell, he was banging cocktail\nWaitresses two at a time. Players\nCouldn't get a drink.\n\nMICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:\n\nMICHAEL\nI have to go back to New York\nTomorrow. Think of your price.\n\nMOE\nYou son of a bitch, you think you\nCan brush me off like that? I made\nMy bones when you were going out\nWith cheerleaders.\n\nFREDO\n(frightened)\nTom, you're the Consigliere; you\nCan talk to the Don and advise him.\n\nMICHAEL\nThe Don has semi-retired. I'm\nRunning the Family business now.\nSo anything you have to say, say it\nTo me.\n\nNobody answers. MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.\nMOE exits angrily.\n\nMICHAEL\nFreddie, you're my older brother.\nI love you. But don't ever take\nSides with anybody against the\nFamily again.\n\nEXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955)\n\nKAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark\nAIRPORT. ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.\n\nShe has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who\nPlays with a cardboard bird on a string.\n\nTwo other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have\nLearned to tell are bodyguards.\n\nMICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO\nPORTERS carrying luggage.\n\nNERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.\n\nMICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.\n\nLAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and\nMICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son. Automatically,\nThe luggage is put in. NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver;\nAnd LAMPONE joins the other men. HAGEN gets into one of the\nOther cars.\n\nAnd the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other\nSedans.\n\nINT DAY: LIMO (1955)\n\nThe little BOY looks out the window as they drive.\n\nMICHAEL\nI have to see my father and his\nPeople when we get back to the Mall.\n\nKAY\nOh Michael.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe'll go to the show tomorrow\nNight--we can change the tickets.\n\nKAY\nDon't you want dinner first?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, you eat...don't wait up for me.\n\nKAY\nWake me up when you come to bed?\n\nThe little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding\nLimousine window.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nThe limousine arrives at the Mall. We are inside.\n\nKAY\nYour sister wants to ask you\nSomething.\n\nMICHAEL\nLet HER ask.\n\nNERI opens the door. KAY wants to talk just a little more.\n\nKAY\nShe's afraid to. Michael...\n\nMICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment\nLonger.\n\nKAY\nWhy are you so cold to her and\nCarlo? They live with us on the\nMall now, but you never get close\nTo them.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm busy.\n\nKAY\nConnie and Carlo want you to be\nGodfather to their little boy.\n\nNERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.\n\nHe smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.\n\nKAY\nWill you?\n\nMICHAEL\nLet me think about it, O.K.?\n\nShe smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY\nAnd the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)\n\nVIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size. He\nWears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt. He sits in a\nChair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.\n\nTESSIO (O.S.)\nBarzini's people chisel my territory\nAnd we do nothing about it. Pretty\nSoon there won't be one place in\nBrooklyn I can hang my hat.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nJust be patient.\n\nTESSIO\nI'm not asking you for help, Mike.\nJust take off the handcuffs.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nBe patient.\n\nCLEMENZA (O.S.)\nWe gotta fight sometime. Let us at\nLeast recruit our regimes to full\nStrength.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nNo, I don't want to give Barzini an\nExcuse to start fighting.\n\nTESSIO (O.S.)\nMike, you're wrong.\n\nCLEMENZA (O.S.)\nDon Corleone...Don Corleone.\n\nThe OLD MAN looks up. CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.\nBeside him is an anxious TESSIO. NERI stands by the door;\nHAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.\n\nCLEMENZA\nYou said there would come a day\nWhen Tessio and me could form our\nOwn Families. Only with your\nBenediction, of course. I ask\nPermission...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy son is head of the Family now.\nIf you have his permission, you\nHave my good will.\n\nMICHAEL\nIn six months you can break off\nFrom the Corleone Family and go on\nYour own. Carlo, I'm counting on\nYou to make the move to Nevada;\nYou'll be my right-hand man out\nThere. Tom Hagen is no longer the\nConsigliere.\n\nEveryone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.\nHe remains inexpressive.\n\nMICHAEL\nHe's going to be our lawyer in\nVegas. Nobody goes to him with any\nOther business as of now, this\nMinute. No reflection on Tom;\nThat's the way I want it. Besides,\nIf I ever need any advice, who's a\nBetter Consigliere than my father.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThen in a six month time we're on\nOur own; is that it?\n\nMICHAEL\nMaybe less...\n\nTESSIO\nLet us fill up our Regimes.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. I want things very calm for\nAnother six months.\n\nTESSIO\nForgive me, Godfather, let our\nYears of friendship be my excuse.\nHow can you hope for success there\nWithout your strength here to back\nYou up? The two go hand in hand.\nAnd with you gone from here the\nBarzini and the Tattaglias will be\nToo strong for us.\n\nCLEMENZA\nAnd I don't like Barzini. I say\nThe Corleone Family has to move\nFrom strength, not weakness. We\nShould build our Regimes and take\nBack our lost territories in Staten\nIsland, at least.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nDo you have faith in my judgement?\n\nCLEMENZA\nYes, Godfather...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThen do what Michael says...\n\nMICHAEL\nAll I can say is that things are\nBeing resolved that are more\nEffective than a thousand buttonmen\nOn the streets. Understood?\n\nThere are uneasy looks all around.\n\nCARLO\nUnderstood. I just wish I was\nDoing more to help out.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll come to you when I need you.\n\nHe looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN. They all nod,\nReluctantly.\n\nMICHAEL\nAll right, then it's resolved.\n\nNERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.\n\nCLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,\nThen CARLO. NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the\nCorridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.\n\nThen NERI closes the door.\n\nMICHAEL relaxes.\n\nHAGEN\nMike, why are you cutting me out of\nThe action?\n\nMICHAEL\nTom, we're going to be legitimate\nAll the way, and you're the legal\nMan. What could be more important\nThan that.\n\nHAGEN\nI'm not talking about that. I'm\nTalking about Rocco Lampone building\nA secret regime. Why does Neri\nReport directly to you, rather than\nThrough me or a caporegime?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI told you that it wouldn't escape\nHis eye.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow did you find out?\n\nHAGEN\nBookkeepers know everything.\nRocco's men are all a little too\nGood for the jobs they're supposed\nTo be doing. They get a little\nMore money than the job's worth.\n(pause)\nLampone's a good man; he's operating\nPerfectly.\n\nMICHAEL\nNot so perfectly if you noticed.\n\nHAGEN\nMike, why am I out?\n\nMICHAEL\nYou're not a wartime Consigliere.\nThings may get tough with the move\nWe're trying.\n\nHAGEN\nOK, but then I agree with Tessio.\nYou're going about it all wrong;\nYou're making the move out of\nWeakness... Barzini's a wolf, and\nIf he tears you apart, the other\nFamilies won't come running to help\nThe Corleones...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTom, I never thought you were a bad\nConsigliere, I thought Santino a\nBad Don, rest in peace. He had a\nGood heart but he wasn't the right\nMan to head the family when I had\nMy misfortune. Michael has all my\nConfidence, as you do. For reasons\nWhich you can't know, you must have\nNo part in what will happen.\n\nHAGEN\nMaybe I can help.\n\nMICHAEL\n(coldly)\nYou're out, Tom.\n\nTOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence. TOM\nLeaves.\n\nMICHAEL looks at NERI.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm going to talk to my father.\n\nNERI nods, and then leaves. The DON opens the doors,\nBreathes in the air, and steps outside.\n\nEXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI see you have your Luca Brasi.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll need him.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThere are men in this world who\nDemand to be killed. They argue in\nGambling games; they jump out of\nTheir cars in a rage if someone so\nMuch as scratches their fender.\nThese people wander through the\nStreets calling out \"Kill me, kill\nMe.\" Luca Brasi was like that.\nAnd since he wasn't scared of\nDeath, and in fact, looked for\nIt...I made him my weapon. Because\nI was the only person in the world\nThat he truly hoped would not kill\nHim. I think you have done the\nSame with this man.\n\nThey walk through the DON's vegetable garden. Tomatoes,\nPeppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.\nMICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him. Then\nStoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBarzini will move against you first.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nHe will get in touch with you\nThrough someone you absolutely\nTrust. That person will arrange a\nMeeting, guarantee your safety...\n\nHe rises, and looks at Michael...\n\nDON CORLEONE\n...and at that meeting you will be\nAssassinated.\n\nThe DON walks on further.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYour wife and children...you're\nHappy with them?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGood.\n\nMICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:\n\nMICHAEL\nI've always respected you...\n\nA long silence. The DON smiles at MICHAEL.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd I...you.\n\nEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nKAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left\nThem off.\n\nKAY\nHow is your husband feeling?\n\nMAMA\nHe's not the same since they shot\nHim. He lets Michael do all the\nWork. He just plays the fool with\nHis garden, his peppers, his\nTomatoes, as if he was some peasant\nStill. But men are like that...\n\nShe stops toward the Church.\n\nMAMA\nYou come in, too.\n\nKAY shakes her head.\n\nMAMA\nThe Priest ain't gonna bite you\nCause you're not Catholic.\n(whispered)\nHe's in the back drinkin' his wine.\n\nKAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.\nThey enter.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nInside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from\nThe holy water.\n\nMAMA\nYou can.\n\nTentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and\nBlesses herself. Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in\nAwe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally\nThe Altar.\n\nMAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles. There is a\nLarge coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting\nCandles. MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives\nHer some.\n\nMAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the\nTaper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great\nDignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights\nTwenty candles.\n\nShe finishes, and bows her head.\n\nEXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME\n\nVery few people in the streets. TOTAL SILENCE. But black\nFlower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.\nAn expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.\nCertainly no more could be done for a President or a King.\n\nEach car carries an elaborate floral decoration. We show\nThese in detail; and the flowered messages: \"A Benefactor to\nMankind\", \"He Knew and Pitied\"...\"Our Don Our Leader\"...\"The\nSacred Heart\"...\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nHIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL\n\nSilence.\n\nThe flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill\nAll the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.\n\nHundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the\nWedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is\nSomber and respectful.\n\nMICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform\nWhich holds the ornate coffin. We cannot see the remains of\nDon Corleone.\n\nBONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved\nFamily. One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely\nWith grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.\n\nThe VIEW ALTERS,\n\nAnd we see that the line is endless. JOHNNY FONTANE, tears\nOpenly falling, takes his turn.\n\nChildren are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last\nLook at the great man.\n\nCLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE. LAMPONE\nImmediately arranges for the members of the Five New York\nFamilies to pay their respects.\n\nFirst CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI. Then PHILIP\nTATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.\n\nThen BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.\n\nMICHAEL watches the scene.\n\nBARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined\nBy his men.\n\nAs BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on\nHim; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear\nFrom the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that\nHe is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don\nCorleone.\n\nMICHAEL watches silently.\n\nBARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes. First\nCLEMENZA. Then TESSIO.\n\nCONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes. He\nEmbraces and comforts her.\n\nEverywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching\nAll who come close to him.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (LATER)\n\nLater on the Mall; some people have left, although there are\nStill hundreds of mourners.\n\nA young GIRL approaches TESSIO. She's about 18.\n\nGIRL\nDo you remember me?\n\nTESSIO\nNo...\n\nGIRL\nWe danced together at Connie's\nWedding.\n\nTESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',\nAnd they move though the crowd, looking for Michael. He\nFinds him.\n\nTESSIO\nMike, could I have a minute?\n\nMIKE; nods; and they move to a private place. NERI is close\nBy.\n\nTESSIO\nBarzini wants to arrange a meeting.\nSays we can straighten any of our\nProblems out.\n\nMICHAEL\nHe talked to you?\n\nTESSIO\n(nods)\nI can arrange security.\n\nMICHAEL looks at him.\n\nEXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)\n\nThe Cemetery. Late day.\n\nThe hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the\nStone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in\nQueens Village.\n\nHundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take\nPictures, etc.\n\nMICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.\n\nMICHAEL\n(softly)\nChrist, Tom; I needed more time\nWith him. I really needed him.\n\nHAGEN\nDid he give you his politicians?\n\nMICHAEL\nNot all...I needed another four\nMonths and I would have had them\nAll.\n(he looks at TOM)\nI guess you've figured it all out?\n\nHAGEN\nHow will they come at you?\n\nMICHAEL\nI know now.\n(a passion wells up\nInside of MICHAEL)\nI'll make them call me Don.\n\nHAGEN\nHave you agreed on a meeting?\n\nMICHAEL\n(nods)\nA week from tonight. In Brooklyn\nOn Tessio's ground, where I'll be\nSafe.\n\nHAGEN looks at him; understands.\n\nMICHAEL\nBut after the Baptism. I've\nDecided to stand as godfather to\nConnie's baby.\n\nThey look up.\n\nThe coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which\nStands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,\nWith the bold inscription: CORLEONE.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)\n\nALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he\nPulls a small trunk from under his bed. He opens it, and we\nSee in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's\nUniform. He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.\nThen the badge, and the identification card; with his\nPicture on it. Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he\nBegins to dress.\n\nINT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)\n\nMICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in\nTheir room. MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is\nBeginning to take on a matronly look.\n\nINT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)\n\nIn a Long Island motel.\n\nROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it,\nChecks it, and puts it back together.\n\nEXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)\n\nPETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln. He hesitates,\nTakes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then\nGets in, drives off.\n\nEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nThe Church.\n\nVarious relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the\nChurch. They laugh and talk. A MONSIGNOR is officiating.\nNot all of the participants have arrived yet.\n\nCONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO. She holds the\nInfant; showing him off to interested people.\n\nEXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)\n\nNERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN\nBuilding. He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a\nPoliceman. He carries a huge flashlight.\n\nEXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)\n\nLAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort\nMotel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising\n\"ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY\".\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH\n\nThe Church.\n\nCONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and\nMICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.\n\nPRIEST\n(to MICHAEL)\nDo you pledge to guide and protect\nThis child if he is left fatherless?\nDo you promise to shield him\nAgainst the wickedness of the world?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes, I promise.\n\nEXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.\n\nNERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area. He\nContinues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center. On\nHis side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly\nAcross from the main entrance of the building. Slowly he\nApproaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his\nNightstick.\n\nThe DRIVER looks up in surprise.\n\nNERI points to the \"No Parking\" sign.\n\nThe DRIVER turns his head away.\n\nNERI\nOK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or\nYou wanna move?\n\nDRIVER\n(obviously a hood)\nYou better check with your precinct.\n\nNERI\nMove it!\n\nThe DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,\nAnd hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's\nJacket.\n\nNERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street. Then\nHe crooks a finger at the DRIVER.\n\nNERI\nLet me see you license and\nRegistration.\n\nEXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY\n\nLAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.\nIt parks. A young, pretty GIRL gets out. Quickly, he\nReturns into the room.\n\nINT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)\n\nCLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel. He\nRounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH\n\nThe Church. Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently\nApplies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.\n\nPRIEST\nEphetha...be opened...So you may\nPerceive the fragrance of God's\nSweetness.\n\nEXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)\n\nThe DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center\nIs arguing with NERI.\n\nNow the DRIVER looks up.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nTWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving\nGlass doors.\n\nNERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass\nDoors. The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of\nBARZINI within them.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH\n\nIn the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL. The PRIEST hands him\nThe infant.\n\nPRIEST\nDo you renounce Satan.\n\nMICHAEL\nI do renounce him.\n\nPRIEST\nAnd all his works?\n\nMICHAEL\nI do renounce them.\n\nINT DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)\n\nLAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down\nThe iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.\nPHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a\nSemi-nude young GIRL leans up.\n\nThey are riddled with gunfire.\n\nINT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)\n\nCLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with\nHis package.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH\n\nThe PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant\nMICHAEL holds.\n\nPRIEST\nDo you wish to be baptized?\n\nMICHAEL\nI do wish to be baptized.\n\nINT DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)\n\nCLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.\n\nHe walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate\nElevator waiting shaft.\n\nThe lights indicate the elevator has arrived.\n\nThe doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with\nThe dapper MOE GREENE.\n\nCLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.\n\nThe PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.\n\nPRIEST\nI christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.\n\nFlash bulbs go off. Everyone is smiles, and crowds around\nMICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.\n\n--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------\n\nEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nThe christening party outside the Church.\n\nFour or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to\nReceive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.\n\nEveryone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.\n\nAs the fuss is going on, a car pulls up. LAMPONE gets out\nAnd works his way to MICHAEL. He whispers in his ear. This\nIs the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.\n\nCONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.\n\nCONNIE\nKiss your Godfather.\n\nThe infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an\nExcuse to back away.\n\nMICHAEL\nCarlo...we've had a change in the\nPlans. Mama, Connie, Kay and the\nKids will have to take the trip out\nTo Vegas without us.\n\nCONNIE\nOh Mike, it's our first vacation\nTogether.\n\nCARLO\n(anxious to please)\nJesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...\n\nMICHAEL\nGo back to your house and wait for\nMe...\n\nHe kisses KAY.\n\nMICHAEL\n(to KAY)\nI'll just be a couple of days...\n\nPeople are guided to the correct limousines; they start to\nDrive off.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN\n\nTESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.\n\nHAGEN enters.\n\nHAGEN\nYou'd better make your call to\nBarzini; Michael's ready.\n\nTESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.\n\nTESSIO\nWe're on our way to Brooklyn.\n\nHe hangs up and smiles.\n\nTESSIO\nI hope Mike can get us a good deal\nTonight.\n\nHAGEN\n(gravely)\nI'm sure he will.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nThe TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car. On their\nWay they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.\n\nBUTTON MAN\nThe boss says he'll come in a\nSeparate car. He says for you two\nTo go on ahead.\n\nTESSIO\n(frowning)\nHell, he can't do that. It screws\nUp all my arrangements.\n\nTHREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.\n\nHAGEN\n(gently)\nI can't go with you either, Tessio.\n\nHe flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he\nPanics, and then he accepts it.\n\nTESSIO\n(after the pause)\nTell Mike it was business...I\nAlways liked him.\n\nHAGEN\nHe understands that.\n\nTESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.\n\nTESSIO\n(softly)\nTom, can you get me off the hook?\nFor old times' sake?\n\nHAGEN\nI can't.\n\nHAGEN turns, and walks away from the group. Then about\nTwenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.\n\nTESSIO is led into a waiting car.\n\nHAGEN looks away, and walks off.\n\nINT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\nCARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather\nNervously. He moves to the window and looks out.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nMICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,\nLAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.\n\nThey move toward us.\n\nExcitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.\n\nHe wears a broad smile.\n\nCARLO\nGodfather!\n\nMICHAEL\nYou have to answer for Santino.\n\nThe smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish\nAttempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and\nBacks into the living room.\n\nINT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\nThe door opens, and the grim party enters.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou fingered Sonny for the Barzini\nPeople. That little farce you\nPlayed out with my sister. Did\nBarzini kid you that would fool a\nCorleone?\n\nCARLO\n(dignity)\nI swear I'm innocent. I swear on\nThe head of my children, I'm\nInnocent. Mike, don't do this to\nMe, please Mike, don't do this to me!\n\nMICHAEL\n(quietly)\nBarzini is dead. So is Philip\nTattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo\nAnd Moe Greene...I want to square\nAll the family accounts tonight.\nSo don't tell me you're innocent;\nAdmit what you did.\n\nCARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.\n\nMICHAEL\n(almost kindly)\nDon't be frightened. Do you think\nI'd make my sister a widow? Do you\nThink I'd make your children\nFatherless? After all, I'm\nGodfather to your son. No, your\nPunishment is that you're out of\nThe family business. I'm putting\nYou on a plane to Vegas--and I want\nYou to stay there. I'll send\nConnie an allowance, that's all.\nBut don't keep saying you're\nInnocent; it insults my intelligence\nAnd makes me angry. Who approached\nYou, Tattaglia or Barzini?\n\nCARLO\n(sees his way out)\nBarzini.\n\nMICHAEL\n(softly)\nGood, good. Leave now; there's a\nCar waiting to take you to the\nAirport.\n\nCARLO moves to the door; opens it. There is a car waiting;\nWith a group of MEN around it.\n\nHe looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll call your wife and tell her\nWhat flight you're on.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL\n\nCARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his\nThings in the trunk.\n\nONE opens the front door for him.\n\nSOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.\n\nCARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back\nTo see the other man.\n\nIt is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.\n\nThe motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA\nSuddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck. He chokes\nAnd leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.\n\nThe garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.\n\nHis thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.\n\nThen the body goes slack.\n\nCLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car\nDrives off.\n\nEXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)\n\nMICHAEL and his party. They watch.\n\nThen he turns and walks off, and they follow.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)\n\nMICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.\n\nThey do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights\nFlash by.\n\nNERI turns back.\n\nNERI\nYou know I would never question\nAnything you say.\n\nMICHAEL\n(smiles)\nSpeak your mind.\n\nNERI\nI'll do this for you; you know I\nShould.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. This I have to do.\n\nEXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)\n\nMICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an\nItalian Pizzeria. NERI opens the door.\n\nMICHAEL\nSit in the car.\n\nINT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)\n\nHe walks alone into the restaurant. A MAN is tossing pizza\nDough in the air.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhere's the boss?\n\nMAN\nIn the back. Hey Frank, someone\nWants you.\n\nA MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.\n\nMAN\nWhat is it?\n\nHe stops, frozen in fear. It is FABRIZZIO.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL. Gunfire from under his coat. FABRIZZIO is\nCut down. MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nHIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL\n\nSeveral moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that\nThese are the final days; the families are moving out; signs\nIndicating that the property is for sale are evident.\n\nA black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,\nThe rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,\nRestrained by MAMA. She manages to break free and runs\nAcross the Mall into Michael's house.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\nInside the Corleone house. Big boxes have been packed;\nFurniture prepared for shipping.\n\nCONNIE\nMichael!\n\nShe hurries into the living room, where she comes upon\nMICHAEL and KAY.\n\nKAY\n(comforting)\nConnie...\n\nBut CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL. NERI\nIs watchful.\n\nCONNIE\nYou lousy bastard; you killed my\nHusband...\n\nKAY\nConnie...\n\nCONNIE\nYou waited until our father died\nAnd nobody could stop you and you\nKilled him, you killed him! You\nBlamed him about Sonny, you always\nDid, everybody did. But you never\nThought about me, never gave a damn\nAbout me.\n(crying)\nWhat am I going to do now, what am\nI going to do.\n\nTWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders\nFrom him. But he stands there, waiting for his sister to\nFinish.\n\nKAY\nConnie, how could you say such\nThings?\n\nCONNIE\nWhy do you think he kept Carlo on\nThe Mall? All the time he knew he\nWas going to kill my husband. But\nHe didn't dare while my father was\nAlive. And then he stood Godfather\nTo our child. That coldhearted\nBastard.\n(to KAY)\nAnd do you know how many men he had\nKilled with Carlo? Just read the\nPapers. That's your husband.\n\nShe tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria\nShe has no saliva.\n\nMICHAEL\nGet her home and get a doctor.\n\nThe TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,\nGently but firmly.\n\nKAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from\nMICHAEL. He feels her look.\n\nMICHAEL\nShe's hysterical.\n\nBut KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.\n\nKAY\nMichael, it's not true. Please\nTell me.\n\nMICHAEL\nDon't ask me.\n\nKAY\nTell me!\n\nMICHAEL\nAll right, this one time I'll let\nYou ask about my affairs, one last\nTime.\n\nKAY\nIs it true?\n\nShe looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so\nDirectly that we know he will tell the truth.\n\nMICHAEL\n(after a very long pause)\nNo.\n\nKAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs\nHim. Then she kisses him.\n\nKAY\n(through her tears)\nWe both need a drink.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)\n\nShe moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the\nDrinks. From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the\nDrinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the\nHouse with their BODYGUARDS.\n\nShe watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive\nThem. He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one\nFoot slightly behind the other. One hand on his hip, like a\nRoman Emperor. The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.\n\nCLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.\n\nCLEMENZA\nDon Corleone...\n\nThe smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her\nHusband has become.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nKAY wears a shawl over her hand. She drops many coins in\nThe coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in\nA pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.\n\nTHE END3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count":

waits to get even with me\nShe hooks up her cupcakes and puts on her jumper\nExplains that she'll be late to a worrying mother\nShe meets me in Piccadilly\n\n[Chorus 1]\nA begging folk singer stands tall by the entrance\nHis song relays worlds of most good intentions\nA fiver a ten p in his hat for collection\n[Verse 2]\nShe talks about office, she talks about dresses\nShe's seen one she fancies, her smile is impressing\nSo maybe I'll treat her someday\nWe queue among strangers and strange conversation\nLove's on the lips of all forms of engagements\nAll queuing to see tonight's play\n\n[Chorus 2]\nA man behind me talks to his young lady\nHe's happy that she is expecting his baby\nHis wife won't be pleased but she's not been 'round lately\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe girl was so dreadful we left in a hurry\nWe escaped in the rain for an Indian curry\nAt the candle lit Taj Mahal\nMy lips to a napkin I called for a taxi\nThe invite of eyes made it tense but relaxed me\nMy mind took a devious role\n\n[Chorus 3]\nThe cab took us home through a night I'd not noticed\nThe neon club lights of adult films and Trini Lopez\nMy arm around love but my acting was hopeless\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nWe crept like two thieves from the kettle to the fire\nWe kissed to the sound of the silence that we'd hired\nNow captured, your love in my arms\nA door opened slightly a voice spoke in worry\nMum went to bed without wind of the curry\nOur secret love made its advance\n\n[Chorus 4]\nLike Adam and Eve we took bite on the apple\nLoose change in my pocket it started to rattle\nHeart like a gun was just half of the battle\n(Heart like a gun was just half of the battle)\n\n[Outro]\nLike Adam and Eve we took bite on the apple\n(Heart like a gun was just half of the battle)\nLoose change in my pocket it started to rattle\n(Heart like a gun was just half of the battle)\nHeart like a gun was just half of the battle\n(Heart like a gun was just half of the battle)\nLike Adam and Eve we took bite on the apple\n(Heart like a gun was just half of the battle)\nLoose change in my pocket it started to rattle\n(Heart like a gun was just half of the

be?\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe kids all laugh at his hair and his funny clothes\nAnd more than once he's gone home with a bloody nose\nHe's not like them and they can't ignore it\nSo they all hate him for it\n[Chorus]\nHome of the brave, land of the free\nWhy won't you let him be what he wants to be?\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt really burns me up, when they put him down\nHe's the only one whose saying something in this whole town\nInstead of those the trouble they hand him\nWhy don't they try to understand him?\n\n[Outro]\nHome of the brave, land of the free\nWhy won't you let him be what he wants to be?\nHe never hurt nobody\nWhy won't you let him be what he wants to be?\nHe's just a little bit different\nWhy won't you let him be what he wants to be?\nYou gotta understand him\nWhy won't you let him be

part that used to touch our hearts\nSaying, \"Darling forever, (Darling) breaking up never.\"\n\n(It's the same old song,) Can't bear to hear it\n(But with a different meaning since you've been gone)\nSince you've been gone\nOh, it hurts to hear it\nIt's the same old song\nBut with a different meaning since you've been gone\n\n(Saxophone solo)\n\nPrecious memories keep lingering on\nEvery time I hear our favorite song\nI get lost in this emptiness\nI only reminisce the happiness we spent\nWe used to dance to the music (We used to dance to the music)\nMake romance to the music (Make

way it goes\n\"Better the devil you do than you don't know\"\nI hit pedals and switch levels, my heart: metal\nI can't settle, I'm part trouble, and not subtle\nI fuck good so fuck cuddles, burst bubbles\nThe dust levels at new highs\nI downed doubles and got baked till I felt high\nMy face puzzled, felt muddled\nThey're far strung and your flow's wooden\nThe thought might but the fit wouldn't, a fortnight\nAnd I thought right, it's all bark and ther\u0435's no bite\nI'm Tony Stark, still embarking on a dream\nTook a bit of tim\u0435 to take darkness from the team\nSeen what I've seen, heartless on the sleeve\nTried to burn my wings, so I put them in a piece on my chest\nAt peace, no rest\nFlipped this on its head\nRipped the scripture up now, flip it don't intend\nSlipping shit again\nFakers all around me, how they living in pretense\nFake friends, won't make amends\nThere's no need, these mean queens control the scenes\nAttention seekers, their span is weak and it's spamming news\nWhat the family need and the planet bleeds the damaged trees\nIt's never leaving till we ascend\nSo fuck the fence\nAnd till they stop killing coloureds\nIt's fuck the feds\nYou must be off it, I mean it\nYou know you hate\nNever get what you judging\nI used to dread growing my beard too long\nNever felt I belonged\nBut it's been long, like a minute\nI ain't looking to no mans for lyrics\nThey're feeling timid\nI'm telling them who they mimic\nWhile healing them like a clinic\nConfused why they get no women\nStill, we're just fucking girls\nLost in the wrong world - Jurassic\nNow to this vermin kicking the game, I'm serving\nThese losers are never learning\nMy fire's forever burning\nAdding it to my fuel\nSeems like I'm always focused on never becoming you\nThese locals that rob us, feeling\nThis slaughter is for a reason\nI'm seeing my new beginnings, watch out this loser's winning\nIn waters too deep to swim in\nLike combat I see me killing, I'm all that without a limit\nFlawless and feeling lawless\nThey're prisoner to the gimmicks\nMy vision is set to summit\nI'm watching you bitches plummet\nNo match enough for my cunning\nYou rappers are feeling done in\nSwitching your genre, running\nRunnin' your jaw, stuntin'\nPulling at straws, something\nI think you're a poor effort, definite\nTone-deaf and an attitude shitty separate\nLiving, I'm in my element, guarding it like a Sentinel\nNever lose me to fentanyl, scared when I take a Benadryl\nKeeping it green, in general\nThink that you remain irrelevant\nLook at yourself with reverence, hoping to always elevate\nCelibate of these thoughts, killin' themselves with sedatives\nIn comparison to Eminem, you're feeling feminine\nAnd politically correct, still dropping on my dick\nAnd I never gave a fuck about what they say about my shit\nI've been moving things in my mind like it's this mountain dew\nMemories made me wonder if one day amounts you\nWhat's the purpose that you do this\nWhat you hopin' that they learn?\nI'd like to say I'm done with this gettin' up on my nerve\nI'm looking at my life, saying what do I deserve\nIt's hard to say I know when I'm walking through the dirt\nTalking or do nothing, I can see for what it's worth\nI'm tired of feeling hurt and I've tried it and nothing works\nI'm racking up excuses while I'm slacking off of work\nShit chatting is the usual while talking with this clerk\nI beg you don't include me, I might write it on my shirt\nSo that every time they see me\nThat they always know it's worth\nLife is potent, did some fuck shit till they took notice\nWeren't no hocus pocus - it was hard work that got me heard\nSo I put in the graft like Google Maps\nGot the whole Earth\nWriting rhymes into my doormat\nTaking over like the Romans\nRolling dirt up on miles like the [?]\nRain exploding like [?]'s hematoma\nDon't need to see a slammer to know I don't want to go\nMan, I'm the showman\nI'm just focused on the doorman\nLeave the grill to George Foreman\nWhat kills it [?] like I got my own insurance\nShow myself up here while I boxed it in a frame\nIf we're about to talk greatness, I'm beyond great\nYou know you have to say my name like Beyonc\u00e9\n[Outro]\n(Say my, say my name)\n(Say my, say my, say my name)\n\n[Part II]\n\n[Verse 1]\nDumb, just a bum with a cigarette\nSun comin' up, all my thoughts on the Internet\nFeeling deep, I'm just bored with the silhouette\nSingle sec, get fucked up for the thrill of it\nKill a streak playing Pac Man\nLike I came from the Philippines\nVanilla beans, still a thing\nFor the thrill of seen\nFacility, there's a beam\nYou may fall, leave it well alone\nAin't moving, stood still on a Peleton\nTelephone, and it's always on the dial tone\nIt's been a while since I've smiled at a milestone\nSeen a big pile in my mind, stone\nMe against the world on my Jack Jones\nLike I'm John Jones with the bitches in the condor\nFar from John Doe\nIn the [?] like I'm Johnny Bravo\nGot bravado with your small dick\nSittin' in [?]\nStealin' Five Gum 'cause that last hit\nWas that good shit, was that stained lip\nYou can never take my shit\nCome and get me if you bailiffs\nOn the top floor, cloud 9, fadin'\nNever bailing, felt amazing\nInhaling, till my lungs two guns blazing\nOvercome all the stunts that I pulled\nA suit of just skin and then woah\nThis life it don't give you no armour\nA lot of meself that can harm ya'\nI swear on what's good, that I'm here 'til they take me\nI pray that I'm wrinkled, at least over eighty\nStarted movin' like a ruler\nDamn [?], gold bars from the jeweller\nBring the songs to the beach in the hope of findin' tuna\n[?]\n[?]\nFucking trap, I'm killin' rappers tumors\n(I wish it was a rumor)\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nGrab a bat, lose my rag\nCouple things got me mad\nCouple people got me wrong and now I'm changing up the swag\nComing in and stealing it, I might take the whole bag\nFeeling undefeated, I'ma beast with a reason\nI'ma lead the whole pack\nFearless like I'm Caesar, I'm just waiting for a chance\nTo fill it up with diesel, and all I've been achieving\nClocking miles in this region\nMoving like a legion\nPromise that I made to myself, an allegiance\nDo you still believe I'm a fool for ever leaving?\nStaring at the ceiling, can never put a cap on achieving\nI'm just here for the rap, then I'm leaving\n\n[Verse 3]\nI've had about enough of being my own enemy\nIt's time I grew up, a long way from seventeen\nAlways went against the grain, struggles in my life\nGot some things to say when I stand up on a mic\nI ain't dropping this for fame, I need this time like therapy\nIt's just to keep me sane\nThe truth is you're my medicine, can't put that on your plate\nSpeeding into everything, 'bout time I fixed the brakes\nDon't say I can't communicate\nYou know I conversate with you in several different ways\nAnd I know you know it's reverence, I'm looking at your face\nCan't justify mistakes, like every man that made them, seems I ain't the one to blame\nLying to myself, only had so much to gain\nSo now I'm switching up the play\nSee if that affects the place I'm at and lost to this\nI ain't going with the usual so they looking at me strange\nConfused, and I can feel it all\nI'm here to make the change\nIt's cold at 3 A.M. outside, I'm walking with the dog\nThanking god that you don't talk at all, my mind is switching off\nDriving time to find myself, 'cause I've been getting lost\nLived a selfish life and said that I can't give a toss\nLessons that I've learned I've tried teachin' to myself\nWhat I've learnt from certain people is that they're better than myself\nSo I surround myself with real ones, and you feel the plastic melt\nLike burning toy soldiers that used to go up on the shelf\nRecycled ideas, conveying on the belt\nMind stuck in the circus, always hurting how we felt\nEmbarrassed that we dreamt of bigger things, with this relent\nAnd letting go with notions till we feel the means cement\nTired of only hoping, we feel like broken men\n'Cause the gravity is weight, and it's kept us to the ground\nSee the only people speaking, ones with favours in their mouths\n[Verse 4]\nGun killer, rhyme-zilla, no fillers like Godzilla\nEating clouds 'cause my smoke's thicker\nThroat liqueur, my dope sicker\nBringing people they hope like I'm the pork slicker\nI hope you getting the point because I won't bicker\nI thought my city was shit because I want bigger\nLike my zipper couldn't zip up\nFed up with the lip\n[?], my love is fickle\nConstitual age has a primitive face\nI see demise for your limited ways\nLeft it to simmer, similar ways\nA straight pillar with fake glimmer in their heads\nFeeling trapped, this industry is a cage\n\n[Part III]\n\n[Verse 1]\nNobody's speaking the truth\nI'm offended by the State\nLook at the state of the news\nUndecided the argument\nReciting my views while they're inciting the hate\nI'm feeling pressured to choose\nStanding here as one man\nHow can I do half when you're half the person I am\nIf it wasn't in your life, you didn't choose it\nIt's the funny thing about music\nIt's the pain and beauty of it\nDon't give a fuck what my suit is, it looks good so I wear it\nBetter than the shit that people's wearing\nChanging the whole narrative for these basics, it's scary\nSee, I've been facing the racists from back when I were a kiddie\nGrowin' up in 93', living in Bradford City\nThey kicked me out of the schools\nSaid I had a problem with hittin' the kids that would call me paki\nStill sittin' in classroom chillin'\nI'm angry now that I'm older 'cause I see they treat us different\nGot me thinking I'm the problem 'cause they never dealt with these issues\n\n[Verse 2]\nTwenty years later, I'm still in the same boat\nTryna treat me like my grandpa, say I came up off the boat\nCame to tell you what I stand for, man I think this shit's a joke\nHow can I be civil when they've got me by the throat\nPushing my feelings down, you ain't got it like them\n\"Boy your skin is so light\"\nOkay motherfucker, take my name up on a flight\nAnd try to convince immigration that your bloodline's half white\nI don't know how that's acceptable\nWhen life is more susceptible to perception, be the death of them\nI've been looking at the sky saying where's that day of reckoning?\nYou had your prophets right when they said that you would speak to them\nI needed justice in this life, and I will trust that it's my fight\n'Cause when I'm writing it feel right to have them focused on the facts again\nFocused on the rap again, hoping for the change\nGonna put this on the map again\n\n[Verse 3]\nWritin' in all caps again\nThe pain, it goes through me so I write the letter\nAll the shit that could have broke me, but made me better\n[?]\nI'm at home with a pain in my soul\nYeah, 'cause that home ain't it\n'Cause you know I been too real to contest it\nMy time was invested\nNow I look upon the industry, I see it infested\nLooking like kids who would grab up a Nesquik\nMy name ain't on the list unless they label it \"ethnic\"\nI ain't never gave a fuck about these jokers and jesters\nAin't no answers for those things, so just save us the questions\nMan all out of of violence, 'cause my silence is deafening\nYour opinion stinks, somebody get 'em a breath mint\nStart to understand why they think that I'm threatening\nI move in certain ways, couldn't slow me with ketamine\nNow they all wanna hear me, got a table at Letterman\nDirection changed, like I changed up the lettering\nDon't believe the age, because I move like a veteran\nRaised on the benefit for whose benefit?\nThey'll never learn shit, man, if the shoe fits\n[?]\nNo one's gunna know, before you open your mouth\nAnd to be honest, it's insulting\nOffensive to my wounds they're rubbin' salt in\nTryna ask me questions that they know I never answer\nI'd rather sit online and reply to the fan art\nFuck a sports car, coming through in a raptor\nTell you what I like, farm life on the tractor\nFake life, 'sup online, suck a fat one\nYou don't wanna buy into that, none of that, son\nSitting in the garden, '98 in the Datsun\nSeen some hot summers, but I still remember that sun\n\n[Part IV]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI make millions off of my pain\n'Cause I know a few millions still living that way\nDealing with the hurt, that they should know they don't deserve\nIt hit deep, 'cause I hit the nerve\nOnly way that the sheep learn with the street\nFirm in my ways, I don't want to change\nEverything should stay the same\nWho you trying to convince, you understand?\nCan't maintain, let the lights dim\nSome' get the Chow Mein, flex, get the tape right\nUp at night, while these men be mice to my face be nice\nI ain't trying to be a gangster, it ruins my vibe\nRather stay lowkey and on my phone, B\nNever need the trophy or the showpiece\nNever show peace in the North Face fleece\nShowcase this like a goat, might flip\n'Cause the sign might fit to the start, I'm sick\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow you see where I come from\nThe raw dump\nOnly achievement in life is the Jordans\nCommitting petty crimes out of boredom\nCan't afford em', so I stole it\nSee the Rolex on door, let go\nIt don't make sense just to get yourself a job\nIt's a poor man's game, trying to sit and pray to God\nHe ain't sorting all your problems, got to sort them out yourself\nUsed to tell us fables, now I'm writing them myself\n'Cause we roar like animals, we all just need some help\nCathartic, I'm an artist, trying to put my heart in\nFelt double crossed like Leo in Departed\nFor the knowledge, I'm not charging, see I've got it all free\nBut my hunger kept me starving like I'm fiending for the feed\nI just need a reason, see me bleeding for my Creed\nTricky with the words like I keep them up my sleeve\nPicking where I fit, I see me sitting with the queen\nI ain't doing it unless you're used to saying please\nLet me flow a bit, before I sting 'em with the bees\nThey're tryna kill us with disease\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhy does it feel like they have the same notebook\nAnd the same four looks\nLike the rain won't touch on their face, so sus when they lie\nDon't, trust not a minor\nPlus, no fuss\nI just move through the game like must\nSomething in my way, I adjust\n'Til I take free form, like the shape\nFreefall, 'til I bust\nRemember '21, brother gave no fucks\nTryna project when they gave them looks\nIn the projects, and the object's us\nIn my own way, never gave me love\nShould have never started this, broken-hearted kid\nJarred of the feelings, 'til I stole the lick\nDon't want to relish in the pain, but I can't resist\n\n[Outro]\nI like the way we feel\nI like the way, I like the way\n\n[Part V]\n[Intro, needs lyrics]\n\n[Verse 1]\nMake no mistake I'm [?]\nI ain't tryna be a leader, been selling out since Jesus\nAll my rhymes are for the readers, between the lines\nLike Father time, I fuck with Mother Nature\nThat's what they get, the connotations\nTell 'em I lived a life\nAnd then I lived a life adjacent like it's [?] and played it patient\nAlone on my own spaceship, always tryna find greatness\nStill defying lines, but I'm fighting in my prime\nShining light like Kylo while I'ma kill it all the time\nAging like I'm wine\nAging in my face, but still my race you can't define\nFocused on defiance, I'ma fight it while it's life\nStarted something sick and on my mind is what's next\nJust became a dad now so I'm taking all the cheques\nBetter know I'm staying and paying like it's debt\nI'ma get it done, if it's taking all my breath\nSwear down, I ain't messing around till I'm the best\nSpeaking in full sentences\nShould'a thought about a strategy before you went in the stratosphere, better this\nOne of the rings around Saturn, this ain't about [?]\nCasually doing magic [?]\nI feel you could use some practice\nUntil that, you get the blacklist\nNot built like a zealous actress\nFoolin' them like a catfish, schoolin' them like a legend\nHappy to be the reference\n[?] like a iridescent, leavin' 'em all guessing\nLeaking out of my brain like a pipe I ain't fixin'\nShining like a star, you can see it from a distance\nAin't many of me around, paki, I'm just different\nCertain stages to this level and ain't here because of favors to the devil\nFuck a label, I'ma do this from the ghetto\nClean up like I'm Dettol\nI'm romantic, put the bet on sight, smart like a weapon\nThis is my kind of setting\nI write the world I'm sat in while these others live on hype\nI see know fight in how they type\nThe fruit is ripe for the taking, I think I might\n\n[Outro]\nLet me take you away from here\nLet me take you away from here\nLet me take you away from here\n\n[Part VI]\n\n[Verse 1]\nEccentric things I mention, like a kid stuck in detention tryna escape\nI'm just spittin' what is written on the next page\nSpittin' image of my dad in his young days\nBorn sinner, when I'm livid I say, \"fuck's sake\"\nDone runnin', I'm too cunning with no plumbing\nThe water works, I sung something that resonates\nI thought it first, like giving birth to the parrot perch\nThey see me do it and they know it works\nDon't know what's worse\nThe way that you live your life, or the way that you write a verse\nShouldn't be nervous, you don't deserve it\nWon't scratch the surface, I leave a crater\nAnd I lift the dirt up to find the find the hurtin'\nCan't know for certain, nothin' is guaranteed\nTryin' to be a better person than the world deserves to see\n'Cause I see a lot of sharks still swimming in the sea\nCease and arrest, what's the reason? It's theft\nAre these the kind of kids that we're bringing up next?\nDistorted reality, all they needed was family\nToo out of their face to see what the damage is\n\n[Bridge]\nI don't want to be, I want to be\nA part of this, no\nI don't want to be, I don't want to be\nA part of this\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes they ask the questions, too deep to form a sentence\nTo this form, is this the norm?\nIs this the sentence?\nI feel defenseless\nI played the setlist so long my sweat, blood, and tears\nForgot to mention\nFeelin' lost, goin' off into different sections\nI feel like love wrecked it\nIf it's not a drug why am I waiting for the next fix, affected\nCan't believe that you left this\nI guess I leave with a best wish\nMovin' on like next, I'm fine for the lectures\nWe see all full spectrum\n'Cause if we're fallin' down, we can fall down together\nStaircase to heaven, mirror down the middle like 11\nResentment on one side, it won't settle\nMind fried, but talking sense\nThey ain't got a sense of themself in them rich ends\nNeed to spell it out for the dickheads\nI'm here for this, so witness\nI know you feel afflicted, but you always love it Whitney\nWhile I'm laughing at you, you think you're laughing with me\nI try to pull up, but I've grown so they don't fit me\nMy body flown from this new to this old city\nI'm sick of sitting on my own, feeling so shitty\nI've been on roads where it's cold and the snow hittin'\nIt's okay to be yourself, sittin' talkin' to myself\nI've been walkin' for longest, just need a little rest\nKnow I ain't the strongest, I can feel it in my chest\nTalkin' 'bout my feelings and of me they get the best\nThey ain't leaving, see 'em breathin' in my breath\n'Til death do us part, it's just seeded in my heart like a work of art\n\n[Verse 3]\nNever winning, I'm just scarred\nCan't begin it from the start\nDo I play a part in the rhythm of the night?\nI guess I'm up to something, 'cause the dark's feelin' right\nEvery cloud got a lining, put my own miles in like Morales\nFigured that they're jealous that they could just\nNever tell us to change because the weather never made me\nQuestion whether or not I'm at that level\nGot rid of all the the bullshit sittin' in my way\nMost of 'em are full of shit, I see it everyday\nAre you hearing the same things that I do?\nMaybe that shit's hitting like haiku\nHow much do you pay for them to hype you?\nRecycle your flows, but they ain't like new\nLeavin' them conceited and full of diesel like engines in need of cleaning\nThe ending will be revealing\nEven though we ain't raising the facts\nNow we've been facing the cactus with spikes\nNeeding spaces, different faces, the same story\nA full body like straight voddy direct to your system\nBut never tell 'em we missed 'em\nNot even with the thoughts we gift 'em\n'Cause they just take advantage, guess we're caught in the system\nMy soul pouring out details of borrowed time\nHad enough of a fill, this is for sorrow time\nI'm seeing visions of heaven\nI seen the severed line between the gospel we speak\nAnd when they're telling lies\n\n[Verse 4]\nRemember tellin' a friend of mine, [?]\nIdentified like a third eye\nGot a habit of knowing now where the dirt lies, so benign\nI ain't sober after nine, gonna fuck their minds\nWhy you flippin' out, see another\nTryna rep it from the city?\nFuck a Chiller Crew, reppin' for the nittys\nTryna keep us down\nRaised on the social, don't wanna let us out of the system\nMe, I insist we assist them\nMe alone puttin' shift 'til I lift 'em\nI know it's hard, that's why I like it\nI'm fit to fight it, I'm from the North\nI'm backin' Tyson, it's been decided\nDon't see no light, they're needing guidin'\nJust be defining, realizing\nI'm realigning in full finance\nThey say silence can be louder, I'm juiced up with no powder\nI fix shit like slick spanner, I've gone green\nLike Bruce Banner so \"Free Gaza\" on my banner\nThe real McCoy, I ain't nothing to toy with\nSignified peace like a Japanese koi fish\nHow did this happen?\nWe're moving backwards in our timeline, killin' us with cyanide\nRiot for the freedom till we transform like Ironhide\nThis one's 'bout my feelings\nThe way that I move affects the fate that I'm sealing\nCan't say nothin' without somethin' being on the page\nKept inside the pen like the bars have been kept caged\nSee, I always had a plan since I was young, we had nothing man\nNow it's been a few years since I ain't seen the fam on foreign lands\n'Bout to climb Everest in the avalanche\nRight into the riddles as soon as you were born\nNever askin' a question, 'cause it's the norm\nSee, I'm on a questionin' session\nLike the manner got a method to teaching a lesson\nListenin' to MF Doom, he taught me like Ra's al Ghul\nFelt like livin' in Gotham, the people were rotten\nStill we play cartoons so it's never forgotten\nChillin' at the top, but we came from the bottom\nWritin' and jottin' for them life by spottin' the difference\n\n[Bridge, needs lyrics]\n\n[Verse 5]\nThey're hating on Palestine's ways\nThe [?] palace playing Prince on a Steinway\nSending out mind waves\nStop 'em like crime waves\nFreedom fighter, Yellow Metal is my name\nLike vipers I see the sly ones, the snake that's called Biden\nNone of 'em abiding by what they might put in writing\nWe should be used to it by now\nSay whatever for the vote, and then just chose another route\nSay they'd never kill another, unless that brother's skin is brown\nI'm just tellin' you the facts, if you can't take it\nThe truth, naked\nTo bare bones, and my thoughts lately\nSpittin' politics while done with it, shit just gets me vexed\nAnd now I'm sayin' that I think of it\nFeeling on the brink of it\nWhatever it is\nFigured out some shit, at least it feels that way\nTalk about my feelings, and I don't feel so strange\nFinding solace, that's a promise in Metropolis for bein' honest\nCan't write a sonnet without some pain\n\n[Outro, needs lyrics]6Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1281650", "artist_names": "Tom Jones", "full_title": "Little Lonely One by\u00a0Tom\u00a0Jones",

just ain't here among the rest and I'm a little upset\n\nYes, tell me Engine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line\nI know she got on in Baltimore\nA hundred and ten miles ain't much distance, but\nIt sure do make a difference, I don't think she loves me anymore\nI warned her of the dangers, don't speak to strangers\nIf by chance she find new romance, warmer lips to kiss her\nArms to hold her tighter, stirring new fires inside her\nHow I wish that it was me instead of he that stands beside her\nEngine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line\nI know she got on in Baltimore\nA hundred and ten miles ain't much distance\nBut it sure do make a difference, I don't think she loves me anymore\n\nNo, I don't think she loves me anymore\nI don't think she loves me

XV.[1] THE PERCEPTION OF TIME. LyricsIn the next two chapters I shall deal with what is sometimes called internal perception, or the perception of time, and of events as occupying a date therein, especially when the date is a past one, in which case the perception in question goes by the name of memory. To remember a thing as past, it is necessary that the notion of 'past' should be one of our 'ideas.' We shall see in the chapter on Memory that many things come to be thought by us as past, not because of any intrinsic quality of their own, but rather because they are associated with other things which for us signify pastness. But how do these things get their pastness? What is the original of our experience of pastness, from whence we get the meaning of the term? It is this question which the reader is invited to consider in the present chapter. We shall see that we have a constant feeling sui generis of pastness, to which every one of our experiences in turn falls a prey. To think a thing as past is to think it amongst the objects or in the direction of the objects which at the present moment appear affected by this quality. This is the original of our notion of past time, upon which memory and history build their systems. And in this chapter we shall consider this immediate sense of time alone.\n\nIf the constitution of consciousness were that of a string of bead-like sensations and images, all separate,\n\n\"we never could have any knowledge except that of the present instant. The moment each of our sensations ceased it would be gone for ever; and we should be as if we had never been.... We should be wholly incapable of acquiring experience.... Even if our ideas were associated in trains, but only as they are in imagination, we should still be without the capacity of acquiring knowledge. One idea, upon this supposition, would follow another. But that would be all. Each of our successive states of consciousness, the moment it ceased, would be gone forever. Each of those momentary states would be our whole being.\"[2]\n\nWe might, nevertheless, under these circumstances, act in a rational way, provided the mechanism which produced our trains of images produced them in a rational order. We should make appropriate speeches, though unaware of any word except the one just on our lips; we should decide upon the right policy without ever a glimpse of the total grounds of our choice. Our consciousness would be like a glow-worm spark, illuminating the point it immediately covered, but leaving all beyond in total darkness. Whether a very highly developed practical life be possible under such conditions as these is more than doubtful; it is, however, conceivable.\n\nI make the fanciful hypothesis merely to set off our real nature by the contrast. Our feelings are not thus contracted, and our consciousness never shrinks to the dimensions of a glow-worm spark. The knowledge of some other part of the stream, past or future, near or remote, is always mixed in with our knowledge of the present thing.\n\nA simple sensation, as we shall hereafter see, is an abstraction, and all our concrete states of mind are representations of objects with some amount of complexity. Part of the complexity is the echo of the objects just past, and, in a less degree, perhaps, the foretaste of those just to arrive. Objects fade out of consciousness slowly. If the present thought is of A B C D E F G, the next one will be of B C D E F G H, and the one after that of C D E F G H I -- the lingerings of the past dropping successively away, and the incomings of the future making up the loss. These lingerings of old objects, these incomings of new, are the germs of memory and expectation, the retrospective and the prospective sense of time. They give that continuity to consciousness without which it could not be called a stream.[3]\nTHE SENSIBLE PRESENT HAS DURATION.\n\nLet any one try, I will not say to arrest, but to notice or attend to, the present moment of time. One of the most baffling experiences occurs. Where is it, this present? It has melted in our grasp, fled ere we could touch it, gone in the instant of becoming. As a poet, quoted by Mr. Hodgson, says,\n\n\"Le moment o\u00f9 je parle est d\u00e9j\u00e0 loin de moi,\"\n\nand it is only as entering into the living and moving organization of a much wider tract of time that the strict present is apprehended at all. It is, in fact, an altogether ideal abstraction, not only never realized in sense, but probably never even conceived of by those unaccustomed to philosophic meditation. Reflection leads us to the conclusion that it must exist, but that it does exist can never be a fact of our immediate experience. The only fact of our immediate experience is what Mr. E. R. Clay has well called 'the specious present.' His words deserve to be quoted in full:[4]\n\n\"The relation of experience to time has not been profoundly studied. Its objects are given as being of the present, but the part of time referred to by the datum is a very different thing from the conterminous of the past and future which philosophy denotes by the name Present. The present to which the datum refers is really a part of the past -- a recent past -- delusively given as being a time that intervenes between the past and the future. Let it be named the specious present, and let the past, that is given as being the past, be known as the obvious past. All the notes of a bar of a song seem to the listener to be contained in the present. All the changes of place of a meteor seem to the beholder to be contained in the present. At the instant of the termination of such series, no part of the time measured by them seems to be a past. Time, then, considered relatively to human apprehension, consists of four parts, viz., the obvious past, the specious present, the real present, and the future. Omitting the specious present, it consists of three... nonentities -- the past, which does not exist, the future, which does not exist, and their conterminous, the present; the faculty from which it proceeds lies to us in the fiction of the specious present.\"\n\nIn short, the practically cognized present is no knife-edge, but a saddle-back, with a certain breadth of its own on which we sit perched, and from which we look in two directions into time. The unit of composition of our perception of time is a duration, with a bow and a stern, as it were -- a rearward -- and a forward-looking end.[5] It is only as parts of this duration-block that the relation of succession of one end to the other is perceived. We do not first feel one end and then feel the other after it, and from the perception of the succession infer an interval of time between, but we seem to feel the interval of time as a whole, with its two ends embedded in it. The experience is from the outset a synthetic datum, not a simple one; and to sensible perception its elements are inseparable, although attention looking back may easily decompose the experience, and distinguish its beginning from its end.\n\nWhen we come to study the perception of Space, we shall find it quite analogous to time in this regard. Date in time corresponds to position in space; and although we now mentally construct large spaces by mentally imagining remoter and remoter positions, just as we now construct great durations by mentally prolonging a series of successive dates, yet the original experience of both space and time is always of something already given as a unit, inside of which attention afterward discriminates parts in relation to each other. Without the parts already given as in a time and in a space, subsequent discrimination of them could hardly do more than perceive them as different from each other; it would have no motive for calling the difference temporal order in this instance and spatial position in that.\n\nAnd just as in certain experiences we may be conscious of an extensive space full of objects, without locating each of them distinctly therein; so, when many impressions follow in excessively rapid succession in time, although we may be distinctly aware that they occupy some duration, and are not simultaneous, we may be quite at a loss to tell which comes first and which last; or we may even invert their real order in our judgment. In complicated reaction-time experiments, where signals and motions, and clicks of the apparatus come in exceedingly rapid order, one is at first much perplexed in deciding what the order is, yet of the fact of its occupancy of time we are never in doubt.\n\nACCURACY OF OUR ESTIMATE OF SHORT DURATIONS.\n\nWe must now proceed to an account of the facts of time-perception in detail as preliminary to our speculative conclusion. Many of the facts are matters of patient experimentation, others of common experience.\n\nFirst of all, we note a marked difference between the elementary sensations of duration and those of space. The former have a much narrower range; the time-sense may be called a myopic organ, in comparison with the eye, for example. The eye sees rods, acres, even miles, at a single glance, and these totals it can afterward subdivide into an almost infinite number of distinctly identified parts. The units of duration, on the other hand, which the time-sense is able to take in at a single stroke, are groups of a few seconds, and within these units very few subdivisions -- perhaps forty at most, as we shall presently see -- can be clearly discerned. The durations we have practically most to deal with -- minutes, hours, and days -- have to be symbolically conceived, and constructed by mental addition, after the fashion of those extents of hundreds of miles and upward, which in the field of space are beyond the range of most men's practical interests altogether. To 'realize' a quarter of a mile we need only look out of the window and feel its length by an act which, though it may in part result from organized associations, yet seems immediately performed. To realize an hour, we must count 'now! -- now! -- now! -- now! --' indefinitely. Each 'now' is the feeling of a separate bit of time, and the exact sum of the bits never makes a very clear impression on our mind.\n\nHow many bits can we clearly apprehend at once? Very few if they are long bits, more if they are extremely short, most if they come to us in compound groups, each including smaller bits of its own.\n\nHearing is the sense by which the subdivision of durations is most sharply made. Almost all the experimental work on the time-sense has been done by means of strokes of sound. How long a series of sounds, then, can we group in the mind so as not to confound it with a longer or a shorter series?\nOur spontaneous tendency is to break up any monotonously given series of sounds into some sort of a rhythm. We involuntarily accentuate every second, or third, or fourth beat, or we break the series in still more intricate ways. Whenever we thus grasp the impressions in rhythmic form, we can identify a longer string of them without confusion.\n\nEach variety of verse, for example, has its 'law'; and the recurrent stresses and sinkings make us feel with peculiar readiness the lack of a syllable or the presence of one too much. Divers verses may again be bound together in the form of a stanza, and we may then say of another stanza, \"Its second verse differs by so much from that of the first stanza,\" when but for the felt stanza-form the two differing verses would have come to us too separately to be compared at all. But these superposed systems of rhythm soon reach their limit. In music, as Wundt[6] says, \"while the measure may easily contain 12 changes of intensity of sound (as in 12/8 time), the rhythmical group may embrace 6 measures, and the period consist of 4, exceptionally of 5 [8?] groups.\"\n\nWundt and his pupil Dietze have both tried to determine experimentally the maximal extent of our immediate distinct consciousness for successive impressions.\n\nWundt found[7] that twelve impressions could be distinguished clearly as a united cluster, provided they were caught in a certain rhythm by the mind, and succeeded each other at intervals not smaller than 0.3 and not larger than 0.5 of a second. This makes the total time distinctly apprehended to be equal to from 3.6 to 6 seconds.\n\nDietze[8] gives larger figures. The most favorable intervals for clearly catching the strokes were when they came at from 0.3 second to 0.18 second apart. Forty strokes might then be remembered as a whole, and identified without error when repeated, provided the mind grasped them in five sub-groups of eight, or in eight sub-groups of five strokes each. When no grouping of the strokes beyond making couples of them by the attention was allowed -- and practically it was found impossible not to group them in at least this simplest of all ways --16 was the largest number that could be clearly apprehended as a whole.[9] This would make 40 times 0.3 second, or 12 seconds, to be the maximum filled duration of which we can be both distinctly and immediately aware.\n\nThe maximum unfilled, or vacant duration, seems to lie within the same objective range. Estel and Mehner, also working in Wundt's laboratory, found it to vary from 5 or 6 to 12 seconds, and perhaps more. The differences seemed due to practice rather than to idiosyncrasy.[10]\n\nThese figures may be roughly taken to stand for the most important part of what, with Mr. Clay, we called, a few pages back, the specious present. The specious present has, in addition, a vaguely vanishing backward and forward fringe; but its nucleus is probably the dozen seconds or less that have just elapsed.\n\nIf these are the maximum, what, then, is the minimum amount of duration which we can distinctly feel?\n\nThe smallest figure experimentally ascertained was by Exner, who distinctly heard the doubleness of two successive clicks of a Savart's wheel, and of two successive snaps of an electric spark, when their interval was made as small as about 1/500 of a second.[11]\n\nWith the eye, perception is less delicate. Two sparks, made to fall beside each other in rapid succession on the centre of the retina, ceased to be recognized as successive by Exner when their interval fell below 0.044\".[12]\n\nWhere, as here, the succeeding impressions are only two in number, we can easiest perceive the interval between them. President Hall, who experimented with a modified Savart's wheel, which gave clicks in varying number and at varying intervals, says:[13]\n\n\"In order that their discontinuity may be clearly perceived, four or even three clicks or beats must be farther apart than two need to be. When two are easily distinguished, three or four separated by the same interval... are often confidently pronounced to be two or three respectively. It would be well if observations were so directed as to ascertain, at least up to ten or twenty, the increase [of interval] required by each additional click in a series for the sense of discontinuity to remain constant throughout.\"[14]\n\nWhere the first impression falls on one sense, and the second on another, the perception of the intervening time tends to be less certain and delicate, and it makes a difference which impression comes first. Thus, Exner found[15] the smallest perceptible interval to be, in seconds:\nFrom sight to touch.................. 0.071 From touch to sight.................. 0.053 From sight to hearing................0.16 From hearing to sight................0.06 From one ear to another...........0.064 To be conscious of a time interval at all is one thing; to tell whether it be shorter or longer than another interval is a different thing. A number of experimental data are on hand which give us a measure of the delicacy of this latter perception. The problem is that of the smallest difference between two times which we can perceive.\n\nThe difference is at its minimum when the times themselves are very short. Exner,[16] reacting as rapidly as possible with his foot, upon a signal seen by the eye (spark), noted all the reactions which seemed to him either slow or fast in the making. He thought thus that deviations of about 1/100 of a second either way from the average were correctly noticed by him at the time. The average was here 0.1840\". Hall and Jastrow listened to the intervals between the clicks of their apparatus. Between two such equal intervals of 4.27\" each, a middle interval was included, which might be made either shorter or longer than the extremes. \"After the series had been heard two or even three times, no impression of the relative length of the middle interval would often exist, and only after hearing the fourth and last [repetition of the series] would the judgment incline to the plus or minus side. Inserting the variable between two invariable and like intervals greatly facilitated judgment, which between two unlike terms is far less accurate.\"[17] Three observers in these experiments made no error when the middle interval varied 1/60 from the extremes. When it varied 1/120, errors occurred, but were few, This would make the minimum absolute difference perceived as large as 0.355.\"\n\nThis minimum absolute difference, of course, increases as the times compared grow long. Attempts have been made to ascertain what ratio it bears to the times themselves. According to Fechner's 'Psychophysic Law' it ought always to bear the same ratio. Various observers, however, have found this not to be the case.[18] On the contrary, very interesting oscillations in the accuracy of judgment and in the direction of the error -- oscillations dependent upon the absolute amount of the times compared -- have been noticed by all who have experimented with the question. Of these a brief account may be given.\n\nIn the first place, in every list of intervals experimented with there will be found what Vierordt calls an 'INDIFFERENCE-POINT;' that is to say, an interval which we judge with maximum accuracy, a time which we tend to estimate as neither longer or shorter than it really is, and away from which, in both directions, errors increase their size.[19] This time varies from one observer to another, but its average is remarkably constant, as the following table shows.[20]\n\nThe times, noted by the ear, and the average indifference-points (given in seconds) were, for --\n\nWundt[21]............................................. 0.72 Kollert[22]............................................. 0.75 Estel (probably)........................................ 0.75 Mehner................................................. 0.71 Stevens[23]............................................. 0.71 Mach[24].............................................. 0.35 Buccola (about)[25]................................... 0.40 The odd thing about these figures is the recurrence they show in so many men of about three fourths of a second, as the interval of time most easy to catch and reproduce. Odder still, both Estel and Mehner found that multiples of this time were more accurately reproduced than the time-intervals of intermediary length;[26] and Glass found a certain periodicity, with the constant increment of 1.25 sec., in his observations. There would seem thus to exist something like a periodic or rhythmic sharpening of our time-sense, of which the period differs somewhat from one observer to the next.\n\nOur sense of time, like other senses, seems subject to the law of contrast. It appeared pretty plainly in Estel's observations that an interval sounded shorter if a long one had immediately preceded it, and longer when the opposite was the case.\n\nLike other senses, too, our sense of time is sharpened by practice. Mehner ascribes almost all the discrepancies between other observers and himself to this cause alone.[27]\n\nTracks of time filled (with clicks of sound) seem longer than vacant ones of the same duration, when the latter does not exceed a second or two.[28] This, which reminds one of what happens with spaces seen by the eye, becomes reversed when longer times are taken. It is, perhaps, in accordance with this law that a loud sound, limiting a short interval of time, makes it appear longer, a slight sound shorter. In comparing intervals marked out by sounds, we must take care to keep the sounds uniform.[29]\n\nThere is a certain emotional feeling accompanying the intervals of time, as is well known in music. The sense of haste goes with one measure of rapidity, that of delay with another; and these two feelings harmonize with different mental moods. Vierordt listened to series of strokes performed by a metronome at rates varying from 40 to 200 a minute, and found that they very naturally fell into seven categories, from 'very slow' to 'very fast.'[30] Each category of feeling included the intervals following each other within a certain range of speed, and no others. This is a qualitative, not a quantitative judgment -- an \u00e6sthetic judgment, in fact. The middle category, of speed that was neutral, or, as he calls it, 'adequate,' contained intervals that were grouped about 0.62 second, and Vierordt says that this made what one might almost call an agreeable time.[31]\n\nThe feeling of time and accent in music, of rhythm, is quite independent of that of melody. Tunes with marked rhythm can be readily recognized when simply drummed on the table with the finger-tips.\n\nWE HAVE NO SENSE FOR EMPTY TIME.\n\nAlthough subdividing the time by beats of sensation aids our accurate knowledge of the amount of it that elapses, such subdivision does not seem at the first glance essential to our perception of its flow. Let one sit with closed eyes and, abstracting entirely from the outer world, attend exclusively to the passage of time, like one who wakes, as the poet says, \"to hear time flowing in the middle of the night, and all things moving to a day of doom.\" There seems under such circumstances as these no variety in the material content of our thought, and what we notice appears, if anything, to be the pure series of durations budding, as it were, and growing beneath our indrawn gaze. Is this really so or not? The question is important, for, if the experience be what it roughly seems, we have a sort of special sense for pure time -- a sense to which empty duration is an adequate stimulus; while if it be an illusion, it must be that our perception of time's flight, in the experiences quoted, is due to the filling of the time, and to our memory of a content which it had a moment previous, and which we feel to agree or disagree with its content now.\n\nIt takes but a small exertion of introspection to show that the latter alternative is the true one, and that we can no more intuit a duration than we can intuit an extension, devoid of all sensible content. Just as with closed eyes we perceive a dark visual field in which a curdling play of obscurest luminosity is always going on; so, be we never so abstracted from distinct outward impressions, we are always inwardly immersed in what Wundt has somewhere called the twilight of our general consciousness. Our heart-beats, our breathing, the pulses of our attention, fragments of words or sentences that pass through our imagination, are what people this dim habitat. Now, all these processes are rhythmical, and are apprehended by us, as they occur, in their totality; the breathing and pulses of attention, as coherent successions, each with its rise and fall; the heart-beats similarly, only relatively far more brief; the words not separately, but in connected groups. In short, empty our minds as we may, some form of changing process remains for us to feel, and cannot be expelled. And along with the sense of the process and its rhythm goes the sense of the length of time it lasts. Awareness of change is thus the condition on which our perception of time's flow depends; but there exists no reason to suppose that empty time's own changes are sufficient for the awareness of change to be aroused. The change must be of some concrete sort -- an outward or inward sensible series, or a process of attention or volition.[32]\n\nAnd here again we have an analogy with space. The earliest form of distinct space-perception is undoubtedly that of a movement over some one of our sensitive surfaces, and this movement is originally given as a simple whole of feeling, and is only decomposed into its elements -- successive positions successively occupied by the moving body -- when our education in discrimination is much advanced. But a movement is a change, a process; so we see that in the time-world and the space-world alike the first known things are not elements, but combinations, not separate units, but wholes already formed. The condition of being of the wholes may be the elements; but the condition of our knowing the elements is our having already felt the wholes as wholes.\n\nIn the experience of watching empty time flow -- 'empty' to be taken hereafter in the relative sense just set forth -- we tell it off in pulses. We say 'now! now! now!' or we count 'more! more! more!' as we feel it bud. This composition out of units of duration is called the law of time's discrete flow. The discreteness is, however, merely due to the fact that our successive acts of recognition or apperception of what it is are discrete. The sensation is as continuous as any sensation can be. All continuous sensations are named in beats. We notice that a certain finite 'more' of them is passing or already past. To adopt Hodgson's image, the sensation is the measuring-tape, the perception the dividing-engine which stamps its length. As we listen to a steady sound, we take it in in discrete pulses of recognition, calling it successively 'the same! the same! the same!' The case stands no otherwise with time.\n\nAfter a small number of beats our impression of the amount we have told off becomes quite vague. Our only way of knowing it accurately is by counting, or noticing the clock, or through some other symbolic conception.[33] When the times exceed hours or days, the conception is absolutely symbolic. We think of the amount we mean either solely as a name, or by running over a few salient dates therein, with no pretence of imagining the full durations that lie between them. No one has anything like a perception of the greater length of the time between now and the first century than of that between now and the tenth. To an historian, it is true, the longer interval will suggest a host of additional dates and events, and so appear a more multitudinous thing. And for the same reason most people will think they directly perceive the length of the past fortnight to exceed that of the past week. But there is properly no comparative time intuition in these cases at all. It is but dates and events, representing time; their abundance symbolizing its length. I am sure that this is so, even where the times compared are no more than an hour or so in length. It is the same with Spaces of many miles, which we always compare with each other by the numbers which measure them.[34]\n\nFrom this we pass naturally to speak of certain familiar variations in our estimation of lengths of time. In general, a time filled with varied and interesting experiences seems short in passing, but long as we look back. On the other hand, a tract of time empty of experiences seems long in passing, but in retrospect short. A week of travel and sight-seeing may subtend an angle more like three weeks in the memory; and a month of sickness hardly yields more memories than a day. The length in retrospect depends obviously on the multitudinousness of the memories which the time affords. Many objects, events, changes, many subdivisions, immediately widen the view as we look back. Emptiness, monotony, familiarity, make it shrivel up. In Von Holtei's 'Vagabonds' one Anton is described as revisiting his native village.\n\n\"Seven years,\" he exclaims, \"seven years since I ran away! More like seventy it seems, so much has happened. I cannot think of it all without becoming dizzy -- at any rate not now. And yet again, when I look at the village, at the church-tower, it seems as if I could hardly have been seven days away.\"\n\nProf. Lazarus[35] (from whom I borrow this quotation), thus explains both of these contrasted illusions by our principle of the awakened memories being multitudinous or few:\n\n\"The circle of experiences, widely extended, rich in variety, which he had in view on the day of his leaving the village rises now in his mind as its image lies before him. And with it -- in rapid succession and violent motion, not in chronologic order, or from chronologic motives, but suggesting each other by all sorts of connections -- arise massive images of all his rich vagabondage and roving life. They roll and wave confusedly together, first perhaps one from the first year, then from the sixth, soon from the second, again from the fifth, the first, etc., until it seems as if seventy years must have been there, and he reels with the fulness of his vision.... Then the inner eye turns away from all this past. The outer one turns to the village, especially to the church-tower. The sight of it calls back the old sight of it, so that the consciousness is filled with that alone, or almost alone. The one vision compares itself with the other, and looks so near, so unchanged, that it seems as if only a week of time could have come between.\"\n\nThe same space of time seems shorter as we grow older -- that is, the days, the months, and the years do so; whether the hours do so is doubtful, and the minutes and seconds to all appearance remain about the same.\n\n\"Whoever counts many lustra in his memory need only question himself to find that the last of these, the past five years, have sped much more quickly than the preceding periods of equal amount. Let any one remember his last eight or ten school years: it is the space of a century. Compare with them the last eight or ten years of life: it is the space of an hour.\"\n\nSo writes Prof. Paul Janet,[36] and gives a solution which can hardly be said to diminish the mystery. There is a law, he says, by which the apparent length of an interval at a given epoch of a man's life is proportional to the total length of the life itself. A child of 10 feels a year as 1/10 of his whole life -- a man of 50 as 1/50, the whole life meanwhile apparently preserving a constant length. This formula roughly expresses the phenomena, it is true, but cannot possibly be an elementary psychic law; and it is certain that, in great part at least, the foreshortening of the years as we grow older is due to the monotony of memory's content, and the consequent simplification of the backward-glancing view. In youth we may have an absolutely new experience, subjective or objective, every hour of the day. Apprehension is vivid, retentiveness strong, and our recollections of that time, like those of a time spent in rapid and interesting travel, are of something intricate, multitudinous, and long-drawn-out. But as each passing year converts some of this experience into automatic routine which we hardly note at all, the days and the weeks smooth themselves out in recollection to contentless units, and the years grow hollow and collapse.\n\nSo much for the apparent shortening of tracts of time in retrospect. They shorten in passing whenever we are so fully occupied with their content as not to note the actual time itself. A day full of excitement, with no pause, is said to pass 'ere we know it.' On the contrary, a day full of waiting, of unsatisfied desire for change, will seem a small eternity. T\u00e6dium, ennui, Langweile, boredom, are words for which, probably, every language known to man has its equivalent. It comes about whenever, from the relative emptiness of content of a tract of time, we grow attentive to the passage of the time itself. Expecting, and being ready for, a new impression to succeed; when it fails to come, we get an empty time instead of it; and such experiences, ceaselessly renewed, make us most formidably aware of the extent of the mere time itself.[37] Close your eyes and simply wait to hear somebody tell you that a minute has elapsed. The full length of your leisure with it seems incredible. You engulf yourself into its bowels as into those of that interminable first week of an ocean voyage, and find yourself wondering that history can have overcome many such periods in its course. All because you attend so closely to the mere feeling of the time per se, and because your attention to that is susceptible of such fine-grained successive subdivision. The odiousness of the whole experience comes from its insipidity; for stimulation is the indispensable requisite for pleasure in an experience, and the feeling of bare time is the least stimulating experience we can have.[38] The sensation of t\u00e6dium is a protest, says Volkmann, against the entire present.\n\nExactly parallel variations occur in our consciousness of space. A road we walk back over, hoping to find at each step an object we have dropped, seems to us longer than when we walked over it the other way. A space we measure by pacing appears longer than one we traverse with no thought of its length. And in general an amount of space attended to in itself leaves with us more impression of spaciousness than one of which we only note the content.[39]\n\nI do not say that everything in these fluctuations of estimate can be accounted for by the time's content being crowded and interesting, or simple and tame. Both in the shortening of time by old age and in its lengthening by ennui some deeper cause may be at work. This cause can only be ascertained, if it exist, by finding out why we perceive time at all. To this inquiry let us, though without much hope, proceed.\n\nTHE FEELING OF PAST TIME IS A PRESENT FEELING.\n\nIf asked why we perceive the light of the sun, or the sound of an explosion, we reply, \"Because certain outer forces, ether-waves or air-waves, smite upon the brain, awakening therein changes, to which the conscious perceptions, light and sound, respond.\" But we hasten to add that neither light nor sound copy or mirror the ether- or air-waves; they represent them only symbolically. The only case, says Helmholtz, in which such copying occurs, and in which\n\n\"our perceptions can truly correspond with outer reality, is that of the time-succession of phenomena. Simultaneity, succession, and the regular return of simultaneity or succession, can obtain as well in sensations as in outer events. Events, like our perceptions of them, take place in time, so that the time-relations of the latter can furnish a true copy of those of the former. The sensation of the thunder follows the sensation of the lightning just as the sonorous convulsing of the air by the electric discharge reaches the observer's place later than that of the luminiferous ether.\"[40]\n\nOne experiences an almost instinctive impulse, in pursuing such reflections as these, to follow them to a sort of crude speculative conclusion, and to think that he has at last got the mystery of cognition where, to use a vulgar phrase, 'the wool is short.' What more natural, we say, than that the sequences and durations of things should become known? The succession of the outer forces stamps itself as a like succession upon the brain. The brain's successive changes are copied exactly by correspondingly successive pulses of the mental stream. The mental stream, feeling itself, must feel the time-relations of its own states. But as these are copies of the outward time-relations, so must it know them too. That is to say, these latter time-relations arouse their own cognition; or, in other words, the mere existence of time in those changes out of the mind which affect the mind is a sufficient cause why time is perceived by the mind.\n\nThis philosophy is unfortunately too crude. Even though we were to conceive the outer successions as forces stamping their image on the brain, and the brain's successions as forces stamping their image on the mind,[41] still, between the mind's own changes being successive, and knowing their own succession, lies as broad a chasm as between the object and subject of any case of cognition in the world. A succession of feelings, in and of itself, is not a feeling of succession. And since, to our successive feelings, a feeling of their own succession is added, that must be treated as an additional fact requiring its own special elucidation, which this talk about outer time-relations stamping copies of themselves within, leaves all untouched.\n\nI have shown, at the outset of the article, that what is past, to be known as past, must be known with what is present, and during the 'present' spot of time. As the clear understanding of this point has some importance, let me, at the risk of repetition, recur to it again. Volkmann has expressed the matter admirably, as follows:\n\n\"One might be tempted to answer the question of the origin of the time-idea by simply pointing to the train of ideas, whose various members, starting from the first, successively attain to full clearness. But against this it must be objected that the successive ideas are not yet the idea of succession, because succession in thought is not the thought of succession. If idea A follows idea B, consciousness simply exchanges one for another. That B comes after A is for our consciousness a non-existent fact; for this after is given neither in B nor in A; and no third idea has been supposed. The thinking of the sequence of B upon A is another kind of thinking from that which brought forth A and then brought forth B; and this first kind of thinking is absent so long as merely the thinking of A and the thinking of B are there. In short, when we look at the matter sharply, we come to this antithesis, that if A and B are to be represented as occurring in succession they must be simultaneously represented; if we are to think of them as one after the other, we must think them both at once.\"[42]\n\nIf we represent the actual time-stream of our thinking by an horizontal line, the thought of the stream or of any segment of its length, past, present, or to come, might be figured in a perpendicular raised upon the horizontal at a certain point. The length of this perpendicular stands for a certain object or content, which in this case is the time thought of, and all of which is thought of together at the actual moment of the stream upon which the perpendicular is raised. Mr. James Ward puts the matter very well in his masterly article 'Psychology' in the ninth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, page 64. He says:\n\n\"We may, if we represent succession as a line, represent simultaneity as a second line at right angles to the first; empty time -- or time-length without time-breadth, we may say --is a mere abstraction. Now, it is with the former line that we have to do in treating of time as it is, and with the latter in treating of our intuition of time, where, just as in a perspective representation of distance, we are confined to lines in a plane at right angles to the actual line of depth. In a succession of events, say of sense-impressions, A B C D E... , the presence of B means the absence of A and C, but the presentation of this succession involves the simultaneous presence in some mode or other of two or more of the presentations A B C D. In reality, past, present, and future are differences in time, but in presentation all that corresponds to these differences is in consciousness simultaneously.\"\n\nThere is thus a sort of perspective projection of past objects upon present consciousness, similar to that of wide landscapes upon a camera-screen.\n\nAnd since we saw a while ago that our maximum distinct intuition of duration hardly covers more than a dozen seconds (while our maximum vague intuition is probably not more than that of a minute or so), we must suppose that this amount of duration is pictured fairly steadily in each passing instant of consciousness by virtue of some fairly constant feature in the brain-process to which the consciousness is tied. This feature of the brain-process, whatever it be, must be the cause of our perceiving the fact of time at all.[43] The duration thus steadily perceived is hardly more than the 'specious present,' as it was called a few pages back. Its content is in a constant flux, events dawning into its forward end as fast as they fade out of its rearward one, and each of them changing its time-coefficient from 'not yet,' or 'not quite yet,' to 'just gone' or 'gone,' as it passes by. Meanwhile, the specious present, the intuited duration, stands permanent, like the rainbow on the waterfall, with its own quality unchanged by the events that stream through it. Each of these, as it slips out, retains the power of being reproduced; and when reproduced, is reproduced with the duration and neighbors which it originally had. Please observe, however, that the reproduction of an event, after it has once completely dropped out of the rearward end of the specious present, is an entirely different psychic fact from its direct perception in the specious present as a thing immediately past. A creature might be entirely devoid of reproductive memory, and yet have the time-sense; but the latter would be limited, in his case, to the few seconds immediately passing by. Time older than that he would never recall. I assume reproduction in the text, because I am speaking of human beings who notoriously possess it. Thus memory gets strewn with dated things -- dated in the sense of being before or after each other.[44] The date of a thing is a mere relation of before or after the present thing or some past or future thing. Some things we date simply by mentally tossing them into the past or future direction. So in space we think of England as simply to the eastward, of Charleston as lying south. But, again, we may date an event exactly, by fitting it between two terms of a past or future series explicitly conceived, just as we may accurately think of England or Charleston being just so many miles away.[45]\n\nThe things and events thus vaguely or exactly dated become thenceforward those signs and symbols of longer time-spaces, of which we previously spoke. According as we think of a multitude of them, or of few, so we imagine the time they represent to be long or short. But the original paragon and prototype of all conceived times is the specious present, the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible.\n\nTO WHAT CEREBRAL PROCESS IS THE SENSE OF TIME DUE?\n\nNow, to what element in the brain-process may this sensibility be due? It cannot, as we have seen, be due to the mere duration itself of the process; it must be due to an element present at every moment of the process, and this element must bear the same inscrutable sort of relation to its correlative feeling which all other elements of neural activity bear to their psychic products, be the latter what they may. Several suggestions have been made as to what the element is in the case of time. Treating of them in a note,[46] I will try to express briefly the only conclusion which seems to emerge from a study of them and of the facts -- unripe though that conclusion be.\n\nThe phenomena of 'summation of stimuli' in the nervous system prove that each stimulus leaves some latent activity behind it which only gradually passes away. (See above, pp. 82-85.) Psychological proof of the same fact is afforded by those 'after-images' which we perceive when a sensorial stimulus is gone. We may read off peculiarities in an after-image, left by an object on the eye, which we failed to note in the original. We may 'hark back' and take in the meaning of a sound several seconds after it has ceased. Delay for a minute, however, and the echo itself of the clock or the question is mute; present sensations have banished it beyond recall. With the feeling of the present thing there must at all times mingle the fading echo of all those other things which the previous few seconds have supplied. Or, to state it in neural terms, there is at every moment a cumulation of brain-processes overlapping each other, of which the fainter ones are the dying phases of processes which but shortly previous were active in a maximal degree. The AMOUNT OF THE OVERLAPPING determines the feeling of the DURATION OCCUPIED. WHAT EVENTS shall appear to occupy the duration depends on just WHAT PROCESSES the overlapping processes are. We know so little of the intimate nature of the brain's activity that even where a sensation monotonously endures, we cannot say that the earlier moments of it do not leave fading processes behind which coexist with those of the present moment. Duration and events together form our intuition of the specious present with its content.[47] Why such an intuition should result from such a combination of brain-processes I do not pretend to say. All I aim at is to state the most elemental form of the psycho-physical conjunction.\n\nI have assumed that the brain-processes are sensational ones. Processes of active attention (see Mr. Ward's account in the long foot-note) will leave similar fading brain-processes behind. If the mental processes are conceptual, a complication is introduced of which I will in a moment speak. Meanwhile, still speaking of sensational processes, a remark of Wundt's will throw additional light on the account I give. As is known, Wundt and others have proved that every act of perception of a sensorial stimulus takes an appreciable time. When two different stimuli -- e.g. a sight and a sound -- are given at once or nearly at once, we have difficulty in attending to both, and may wrongly judge their interval, or even invert their order. Now, as the result of his experiments on such stimuli, Wundt lays down this law:[48] that of the three possible determinations we may make of their order --\n\n\"namely, simultaneity, continuous transition, and discontinuous transition -- only the first and last are realized, never the second. Invariably, when we fail to perceive the impressions as simultaneous, we notice a shorter or longer empty time between them, which seems to correspond to the sinking of one of the ideas and to the rise of the other.... For our attention may share itself equally between the two impressions, which will then compose one total percept [and be simultaneously felt]; or it may be so adapted to one event as to cause it to be perceived immediately, and then the second event can be perceived only after a certain time of latency, during which the attention reaches its effective maximum for it and diminishes for the first event. In this case the events are perceived as two, and in successive order -- that is, as separated by a time-interval in which attention is not sufficiently accommodated to either to bring a distinct perception about.... While we are hurrying from one to the other, everything between them vanishes in the twilight of general consciousness.\"[49]\n\nOne might call this the law of discontinuous succession in time, of percepts to which we cannot easily attend at once. Each percept then requires a separate brain-process; and when one brain-process is at its maximum, the other would appear perforce to be in either a waning or a waxing phase. If our theory of the time-feeling be true, empty time must then subjectively appear to separate the two percepts, no matter how close together they may objectively be; for, according to that theory, the feeling of a time-duration is the immediate effect of such an overlapping of brain-pro- cesses of different phase -- wherever and from whatever cause it may occur.\n\nTo pass, now, to conceptual processes: Suppose I think of the Creation, then of the Christian era, then of the battle of Waterloo, all within a few seconds. These matters have their dates far outside the specious present. The processes by which I think them, however, all overlap. What events, then, does the specious present seem to contain? Simply my successive acts of thinking these long-past things, not the long-past things themselves. As the instantly-present thought may be of a long-past thing, so the just-past thought may be of another long-past thing. When a long-past event is reproduced in memory and conceived with its date, the reproduction and conceiving traverse the specious present. The immediate content of the latter is thus all my direct experiences, whether subjective or objective. Some of these meanwhile may be representative of other experiences indefinitely remote.\n\nThe number of these direct experiences which the specious present and immediately-intuited past may embrace measures the extent of our 'primary,' as Exner calls it, or, as Richet calls it, of our 'elementary' memory.[50] The sensation resultant from the overlapping is that of the duration which the experiences seem to fill. As is the number of any larger set of events to that of these experiences, so we suppose is the length of that duration to this duration. But of the longer duration we have no direct 'realizing sense.' The variations in our appreciation of the same amount of real time may possibly be explained by alterations in the rate of fading in the images, producing changes in the complication of superposed processes, to which changes changed states of consciousness may correspond. But however long we may conceive a space of time to be, the objective amount of it which is directly perceived at any one moment by us can never exceed the scope of our 'primary memory' at the moment in question.[51]\n\nWe have every reason to think that creatures may possibly differ enormously in the amounts of duration which they intuitively feel, and in the fineness of the events that may fill it. Von B\u00e6r has indulged[52] in some interesting computations of the effect of such differences in changing the aspect of Nature. Suppose we were able, within the length of a second, to note 10,000 events distinctly, instead of barely 10, as now; if our life were then destined to hold the same number of impressions, it might be 1000 times as short. We should live less than a month, and personally know nothing of the change of seasons. If born in winter, we should believe in summer as we now believe in the heats of the Carboniferous era. The motions of organic beings would be so slow to our senses as to be inferred, not seen. The sun would stand still in the sky, the moon be almost free from change, and so on. But now reverse the hypothesis and suppose a being to get only one 1000th part of the sensations that we get in a given time, and consequently to live 1000 times as long. Winters and summers will be to him like quarters of an hour. Mushrooms and the swifter-growing plants will shoot into being so rapidly as to appear instantaneous creations; annual shrubs will rise and fall from the earth like restlessly boiling-water springs; the motions of animals will be as invisible as are to us the movements of bullets and cannon-balls; the sun will scour through the sky like a meteor, leaving a fiery trail behind him, etc. That such imaginary cases (barring the superhuman longevity) may be realized somewhere in the animal kingdom, it would be rash to deny.\n\n\"A gnat's wings,\" says Mr Spencer,[53] \"make ten or fifteen thousand strokes a second. Each stroke implies a separate nervous action. Each such nervous action or change in a nervous centre is probably as appreciable by the gnat as is a quick movement of his arm by a man. And if this, or anything like this, is the fact, then the time occupied by a given external change, measured by many movements in the one case, must seem much longer than in the other case, when measured by one movement.\"\n\nIn hashish-intoxication there is a curious increase in the apparent time-perspective. We utter a sentence, and ere the end is reached the beginning seems already to date from indefinitely long ago. We enter a short street, and it is as if we should never get to the end of it. This alteration might conceivably result from an approach to the condition of Von B\u00e6r's and Spencer's short-lived beings. If our discrimination of successions became finer-grained, so that we noted ten stages in a process where previously we only noted one; and if at the same time the processes faded ten times as fast as before; we might have a specious present of the same subjective length as now, giving us the same time-feeling and containing as many distinguishable successive events, but out from the earlier end of it would have drooped nine tenths of the real events it now contains. They would have fallen into the general reservoir of merely dated memories, reproducible at will. The beginning of our sentences would have to be expressly recalled; each word would appear to pass through consciousness at a tenth of its usual speed. The condition would, in short, be exactly analogous to the enlargement of space by a microscope; fewer real things at once in the immediate field of view, but each of them taking up more than its normal room, and making the excluded ones seem unnaturally far away.\n\nUnder other conditions, processes seem to fade rapidly without the compensating increase in the subdivisibility of successions. Here the apparent length of the specious present contracts. Consciousness dwindles to a point, and loses all intuitive sense of the whence and whither of its path. Express acts of memory replace rapid bird's-eye views. In my own case, something like this occurs in extreme fatigue. Long illnesses produce it. Occasionally, it appears to accompany aphasia.[54] It would be vain to seek to imagine the exact brain-change in any of these cases. But we must admit the possibility that to some extent the variations of time-estimate between youth and age, and excitement and ennui, are due to such causes, more immediate than to the one we assigned some time ago.\n\nBut whether our feeling of the time which immediately-past[55] events have filled be of something long or of something short, it is not what it is because those events are past, but because they have left behind them processes which are present. To those processes, however caused, the mind would still respond by feeling a specious present, with one part of it just vanishing or vanished into the past. As the Creator is supposed to have made Adam with a navel -- sign of a birth which never occurred -- so He might instantaneously make a man with a brain in which were processes just like the 'fading' ones of an ordinary brain. The first real stimulus after creation would set up a process additional to these. The processes would overlap; and the new-created man would unquestionably have the feeling, at the very primal instant of his life, of having been in existence already some little space of time.\n\nLet me sum up, now, by saying that we are constantly conscious of a certain duration -- the specious present -- varying in length from a few seconds to probably not more than a minute, and that this duration (with its content perceived as having one part earlier and the other part later) is the original intuition of time. Longer times are conceived by adding, shorter ones by dividing, portions of this vaguely bounded unit, and are habitually thought by us symbolically. Kant's notion of an intuition of objective time as an infinite necessary continuum has nothing to support it. The cause of the intuition which we really have cannot be the duration of our brain-processes or our mental changes. That duration is rather the object of the intuition which, being realized at every moment of such duration, must be due to a permanently present cause. This cause -- probably the simultaneous presence of brain-processes of different phase-fluctuates; and hence a certain range of variation in the amount of the intuition, and in its subdivisibility, accrues.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] This chapter is reprinted almost verbatim from the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, vol. XX. p. 374.\n\n[2] James Mill, Analysis, vol. I. p. 319 (J. S. Mill's Edition).\n\n[3] \"What I find, when I look at consciousness at all, is, that what I cannot divest myself of, or not have in consciousness, if I have consciousness at all, is a sequence of different feelings.... The simultaneous perception of both sub-feelings, whether as parts of a coexistence or of a sequence, is the total feeling -- the minimum of consciousness -- and this minimum has duration... Time-duration, however, is inseparable from the minimum, notwithstanding that, in an isolated moment, we could not tell which part of it came first, which last.... We do not require to know that the sub-feelings come in sequence, first one, then the other; nor to know what coming in sequence means. But we have, in any artificially isolated minimum of consciousness, the rudiments of the perception of former and latter in time, in the sub-feeling that grows fainter, and the sub-feeling that grows stronger, and the change between them....\n\n\"In the next place, I remark that the rudiments of memory are involved in the minimum of consciousness. The first beginnings of it appear in that minimum, just as the first beginnings of perception do. As each member of the change or difference which goes to compose that minimum is the rudiment of a single perception, so the priority of one member to the other, although both are given to consciousness in one empirical present moment, is the rudiment of memory. The fact that the minimum of consciousness is difference or change in feelings, is the ultimate explanation of memory as well as of single perceptions. A former and a latter are included in the minimum of consciousness; and this is what is meant by saying that all consciousness is in the form of time, or that time is the form of feeling, the form of sensibility. Crudely and popularly we divide the course of time into past, present, and future; but, strictly speaking, there is no present; it is composed of past and future divided by an indivisible point or instant. That instant, or time-point, is the strict present. What we call, loosely, the present, is an empirical portion of the course of time, containing at least a minimum of consciousness, in which the instant of change is the present time-point.... If we take this as the present time-point, it is clear that the minimum of feeling contains two portions -- a sub-feeling that goes and a sub-feeling that comes. One is remembered, the other imagined. The limits of both are indefinite at beginning and end of the minimum, and ready to melt into other minima, proceeding from other stimuli.\n\n\"Time and consciousness do not come to us ready marked out into minima; we have to do that by reflection, asking ourselves, What is the least empirical moment of consciousness? That least empirical moment is what we usually call the present moment; and even this is too minute for ordinary use; the present moment is often extended practically to a few seconds, or even minutes, beyond which we specify what length of time we mean, as the present hour, or day, or year, or century.\n\n\"But this popular way of thinking imposes itself on great numbers even of philosophically-minded people, and they talk about the present as if it was a datum -- as if time came to us marked into present periods like a measuring-tape.\" (S. H. Hodgson: Philosophy of Reflection, vol. I. pp. 248-254.)\n\n\"The representation of time agrees with that of space in that a certain amount of it must be presented together -- included between its initial and terminal limit. A continuous ideation, flowing from one point to another, would indeed occupy time, but not represent it, for it would exchange one element of succession for another instead of grasping the whole succession at once. Both points -- the beginning and the end -- are equally essential to the conception of time, and must be present with equal clearness together.\" (Herbart: Psychol. als W., \u00a7 115.)\n\n\"Assume that... similar pendulum-strokes follow each other at regular intervals in a consciousness otherwise void. When the first one is over, an image of it remains in the fancy until the second succeeds. This, then, reproduces the first by virtue of the law of association by similarity, but at the same time meets with the aforesaid persisting image.... Thus does the simple repetition of the sound provide all the elements of time-perception. The first sound [as it is recalled by association] gives the beginning, the second the end, and the persistent image in the fancy represents the length of the interval. At the moment of the second impression, the entire time-perception exists at once, for then all its elements are presented together, the second sound and the image in the fancy immediately, and the first impression by reproduction. But, in the same act, we are aware of a state in which only the first sound existed, and of another in which only its image existed in the fancy. Such a consciousness as this is that of time.... In it no succession of ideas takes place.\" (Wundt: Physiol. Psych., 1st ed. pp. 681-2.) Note here the assumption that the persistence and the reproduction of an impression are two processes which may go on simultaneously. Also that Wundt's description is merely an attempt to analyze the 'deliverance' of a time-perception, and no explanation of the manner in which it comes about.\n\n[4] The Alternative, p. 167.\n\n[5] Locke, in his dim way, derived the sense of duration from reflection on the succession of our ideas (Essay, book II. chap. XIV. \u00a7 3; chap. XV. \u00a7 12). Reid justly remarks that if ten successive elements are to make duration, \"then one must make duration, otherwise duration must be made up of parts that have no duration, which is impossible.... I conclude, therefore, that there must be duration in every single interval or element of which the whole duration is made up. Nothing, indeed, is more certain than that every elementary part of duration must have duration, as every elementary part of extension must have extension. Now, it must be observed that in these elements of duration, or single intervals of successive ideas, there is no succession of ideas, yet we must conceive them to have duration; whence we may conclude with certainty that there is a conception of duration where there is no succession of ideas in the mind.\" (Intellectual Powers. essay III. chap. V.) ''Qu'on ne cherche point,\" says Royer Collard in the Fragments added to Jouffroy's Translation of Reid, \"la dur\u00e9e dans la succession; on ne l'y trouvera jamais; la dur\u00e9e a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la succession; in notion de la dur\u00e9e a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la notion de la succession. Elle en est donc tout-\u00e0 fait ind\u00e9pendante, dira-t-on? Oui, elle en est tout-\u00e0-fait ind\u00e9pendante.\"\n\n[6] Physiol. Psych.,\" II. 54, 55.\n\n[7] Ibid. II. 213.\n\n[8] Philosophische Studien, II. 362.\n\n[9] Counting was of course not permitted. It would have given a symbolic concept and no intuitive or immediate perception of the totality of the series. With counting we may of course compare together series of any length -- series whose beginnings have faded from our mind, and of whose totality we retain no sensible impression at all. To count a series of clicks is an altogether different thing from merely perceiving them as discontinuous. In the latter case we need only be conscious of the bits of empty duration between them ; in the former we must perform rapid acts of association between them and as many names of numbers.\n\n[10] Estel in Wundt's Philosophische Studien, II. 50. Mehner, ibid. II. 571. In Dietze's experiments even numbers of strokes were better caught than odd ones, by the ear. The rapidity of their sequence had a great influence on the result. At more than 4 seconds apart it was impossible to perceive series of them as units in all (cf. Wundt, Physiol. Psych., II. 214). They were simply counted as so many individual strokes. Below 0.21 to 0.11 second, according to the observer, judgment again became confused. It was found that the rate of succession most favorable for grasping long series was when the strokes were sounded at intervals of from 0.3\" to 0.18\" apart. Series of 4, 6, 8, 16 were more easily identified than series of 10, 12, 14, 18. The latter could hardly be clearly grasped at all. Among odd numbers, 3, 5, 7 were the series easiest caught ; next, 9, 15; hardest of all, 11 and 13; and 17 was impossible to apprehend.\n\n[11] The exact interval of the sparks was 0.00205\". The doubleness of their snap was usually replaced by a single-seeming sound when it fell to 0.00198\", the sound becoming louder when the sparks seemed simultaneous. The difference between these two intervals is only 7/100000 of a second; and, as Exner remarks, our ear and brain must be wonderfully efficient organs to get distinct feelings from so slight an objective difference as this. See Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, Bd. XI.\n\n[12] Ibid. p. 407. When the sparks fell so close together that their irradiation-circles overlapped, they appeared like one spark moving from the position of the first to that of the second; and they might then follow each other as close as 0.015\" without the direction of the movement ceasing to be clear. When one spark fell on the centre, the other on the margin, of the retina, the time-interval for successive apprehension had to be raised to 0.076\".\n\n[13] Hall and Jastrow: Studies of Rhythm. Mind, XI. 58.\n\n[14] Nevertheless, multitudinous impressions may be felt as discontinuous, though separated by excessively minute intervals of time. Gr\u00fcnhagen says (Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, VI. 175) that 10,000 electric shocks a second are felt as interrupted, by the tongue (!). Von Wittich (ibid. II. 329), that between 1000 and 2000 strokes a second are felt as discrete by the finger. W. Preyer, on the other hand (Die Grenzen des Empfindungsverm\u00f6gens, etc., 1868, p. 15), makes contacts appear continuous to the finger when 36.8 of them follow in a second. Similarly, Mach (Wiener Sitzgsb., LI. 2, 142) gives about 36. Lalanne (Comptes Rendus, LXXXII. p. 1314) found summation of finger-contacts after 22 repetitions in a second. Such discrepant figures are of doubtful worth. On the retina 20 to 30 impressions a second at the very utmost can be felt as discrete when they fall on the same spot. The ear, which begins to fuse stimuli together into a musical tone when they follow at the rate of a little over 30 a second, can still feel 132 of them a second as discontinuous when they take the shape of 'beats' (Helmholtz, Tonempfindungen, 3d ed. p. 270).\n\n[15] Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, XI. 428. Also in Herrmann's Hdbh. d. Physiol., 2 Bd., I. Thl. pp. 260-262.\n\n[16] Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, VII. 639. Tigerstedt (Bihang till Kongl. Svenska Vetenskaps-Akad. Handl., Bd. 8, H\u00e4fte 2, Stockholm, 1884) revises Exner's figures, and shows that his conclusions are exaggerated. According to Tigerstedt, two observers almost always rightly appreciated 0.05\" or 0.06\" of reaction-time difference. Half the time they did it rightly when the difference sank to 0.03\", though from 0.03\" and 0.06\" differences were often not noticed at all. Buccola found (Le Legge del Tempo nei Fenomeni del Pensiero, Milano, 1883, p. 371) that, after much practice in making rapid reactions upon a signal, he estimated directly, in figures, his own reaction-time, in 10 experiments, with an error of from 0.010\" to 0.018\"; in 6, with one of 0.005\" to 0.009\"; in one, with one of 0.002\"; and in 3, with one of 0.003\".\n\n[17] \"Mind, XI. 61 (1886).\n\n[18] Mach, Wiener Sitzungsb., LI. 2. 133 (1865); Estel, loc. cit. p. 65; Mehner, loc. cit. p. 586; Buccola, op. cit. p 378. Fechner labors to prove that his law is only overlaid by other interfering laws in the figures recorded by these experimenters; but his case seems to me to be one of desperate infatuation with a hobby. (See Wundt's Philosophische Studien, III. 1.)\n\n[19] Curious discrepancies exist between the German and the American observers with respect to the direction of the error below and above the point of indifference -- differences perhaps due to the fatigue involved in the American method. The Germans lengthened intervals below it and shortened those above. With seven Americans experimented on by Stevens this was exactly reversed. The German method was to passively listen to the intervals, then judge; the American was to reproduce them actively by movements of the hand. In Mehner's experiments there was found a second indifference-point at about 5 seconds, beyond which times were judged again too long. Glass, whose work on the subject is the latest (Philos. Studien, IV. 423), found (when corrections were allowed for) that all times except 0.8 sec. were estimated too short. He found a series of points of greatest relative accuracy (viz., at 1.5, 2.5, 3.75, 5, 6.25, etc., seconds respectively[)], and ([sic] thought that his observations roughly corroborated Weber's law. As 'maximum' and 'minimum' are printed interchangeably in Glass's article it is hard to follow.\n\n[20] With Vierordt and his pupils the indifference point lay as high as from 1.5 sec. to 4.9 sec., according to the observer (cf. Der Zeitsinn, 1868, p. 112). In most of these experiments the time heard was actively reproduced, after a short pause, by movements of the hand, which were recorded. Wundt gives good reasons (Physiol. Psych., II. 289, 290) for rejecting Vierordt's figures as erroneous. Vierordt's book, it should be said, is full of important matter, nevertheless.\n\n[21] Physiol.

Mach's and Buccola's figures, it will be observed, are about one half of the rest -- sub-multiples, therefore. It ought to be observed, however, that Buccola's figure has little value, his observations not being well fitted to show this particular point.\n\n[26] Estel's figures led him to think that all the multiples enjoyed this privilege; with Mehner, on the other hand, only the odd multiples showed diminution of the average error; thus, 0.71, 2.15, 3.55, 5, 6.4, 7.8, 9.3, and 10.65 second were respectively registered with the least error.

Since then M\u00fcnsterberg in his masterly Beitr\u00e4ge zur experimentellen Psychologie (Heft 2, 1889) seems to have made it clear what the sensible changes are by which we measure the lapse of time. When the time which separates two sensible impressions is less than one third of a second, he thinks it is almost entirely the amount to which the memory-image of the first impression had faded when the second one overtakes it, which makes us feel how wide they are apart (p. 29). When the time is longer than this, we rely, he thinks, exclusively upon the feelings of muscular tension and relaxation, which we are constantly receiving although we give to them so little of our direct attention. These feelings are primarily in the muscles by which we adopt our sense-organs in attending to the signals used, some of the muscles being in the eye and ear themselves, some of them in the head, neck, etc. We here judge two time-intervals to be equal when between the beginning and end of each we feel exactly similar relaxations and subsequent expectant tensions of these muscles to have occurred. In reproducing intervals ourselves we try to make our feelings of this sort just what they were when we passively heard the interval. These feelings by themselves, however, can only be used when the intervals are very short, for the tension anticipatory of the terminal stimulus naturally reaches its maximum very soon. With longer intervals we take the feeling of our inspirations and expirations into account. With our expirations all the other muscular tensions in our body undergo a rhythmical decrease; with our inspirations the reverse takes place. When, therefore, we note a time-interval of several seconds with intent to reproduce it, what we seek is to make the earlier and later interval agree in the number and amount of these respiratory changes combined with sense-organ adjustments with which they are filled. M\u00fcnsterberg has studied carefully in his own case the variations of the respiratory factor. They are many; but he sums up his experience by saying that whether he measured by inspirations that were divided by momentary pauses into six parts, or by inspirations that were continuous; whether with sensory tension during inspiration and relaxation during expiration, or by tension during both inspiration and expiration, separated by a sudden interpolated relaxation; whether with special notice taken of the cephalic tensions, or of those in the trunk and shoulders, in all cases alike and without exception he involuntarily endeavored, whenever he compared two times or tried to make one the same as the other, to get exactly the same respiratory conditions and conditions of tension, all the subjective conditions, in short, exactly the same during the second interval as they were during the first. M\u00fcnsterberg corroborated his subjective observations by experiments. The observer of the time had to reproduce as exactly as possible an interval between two sharp sounds given him by an assistant. The only condition imposed upon him was that he should not modify his breathing for the purposes of measurement. It was then found that when the assistant broke in at random with his signals, the judgment of the observer was vastly less accurate than when the assistant carefully watched the observer's breathing and made both the beginning of the time given him and that of the time which he was to give coincide with identical phases thereof. -- Finally, M\u00fcnsterberg with great plausibility tries to explain the discrepancies between the results of Vierordt, Estel, Mehner, Glass, etc., as due to the fact that they did not all use the same measure. Some breathe a little faster, some a little slower. Some break their inspirations into two parts, some do not, etc. The coincidence of the objective times measured with definite natural phases of breathing would very easily give periodical maxima of facility in measuring accurately.\n\n[33] \"Any one wishing yet further examples of this mental substitution will find one on observing how habitually he thinks of the spaces on the clock-face instead of the periods they stand for; how, on discovering it to be half an hour later than he supposed, he does not represent the half hour in its duration, but scarcely passes beyond the sign of it marked by the finger.\" (H. Spencer: Psychology, \u00a7 336.)\n\n[34] The only objections to this which I can think of are: (1) The accuracy with which some men judge of the hour of day or night without looking at the clock; (2) the faculty some have of waking at a preappointed hour; (3) the accuracy of time-perception reported to exist in certain trance-subjects. It might seem that in these persons some sort of a sub-conscious record was kept of the lapse of time per se. But this cannot be admitted until it is proved that there are no physiological processes, the feeling of whose course may serve as a sign of how much time has sped, and so lead us to infer the hour. That there are such processes it is hardly possible to doubt. An ingenious friend of mine was long puzzled to know why each day of the week had such a characteristic physiognomy to him. That of Sunday was soon noticed to be due to the cessation of the city's rumbling, and the sound of people's feet shuffling on the sidewalk; of Monday, to come from the clothes drying in the yard and casting a white reflection on the ceiling; of Tuesday, to a cause which I forget; and I think my friend did not get beyond Wednesday. Probably each hour in the day has for most of us some outer or inner sign associated with it as closely as these signs with the days of the week. It must be admitted, after all, however, that the great improvement of the time-perception during sleep and trance is a mystery not as yet cleared up. All my life I have been struck by the accuracy with which I will wake at the same exact minute night after night and morning after morning, if only the habit fortuitously begins. The organic registration in me is independent of sleep. After lying in bed a long time awake I suddenly rise without knowing the time, and for days and weeks together will do so at an identical minute by the clock, as if some inward physiological process caused the act by punctually running down. -- Idiots are said sometimes to possess the time-measuring faculty in a marked degree. I have an interesting manuscript account of an idiot girl which says: \"She was punctual almost to a minute in her demand for food and other regular attentions. Her dinner was generally furnished her at 12.30 P.M., and at that hour she would begin to scream if it were not forthcoming. If on Fast-day or Thanksgiving it were delayed, in accordance with the New England custom, she screamed from her usual dinner-hour until the food was carried to her. On the next day, however, she again made known her wants promptly at 12.30. Any slight attention shown her on one day was demanded on the next at the corresponding hour. If an orange were given her at 4 P.M. on Wednesday, at the same hour on Thursday she made known her expectation, and if the fruit were not given her she continued to call for it at intervals for two or three hours. At four on Friday the process would be repeated but would last less long; and so on for two or three days. If one of her sisters visited her accidentally at a certain hour, the sharp piercing scream was sure to summon her at the same hour the next day,\" etc., etc. -- For these obscure matters consult C. Du Prel: The Philosophy of Mysticism, chap. III. \u00a7 1.\n\n[35] Ideale Fragen (1878). p. 219 (Essay, 'Zeit und Weile').\n\n[36] Revue Philosophique, vol. III. p. 496.\n\n[37] \"Empty time is most strongly perceived when it comes as a pause in music or in speech. Suppose a preacher in the pulpit, a professor at his desk, to stick still in the midst of his discourse; or let a composer (as is sometimes purposely done) make all his instruments stop at once; we await every instant the resumption of the performance, and, in this awaiting, perceive, more than in any other possible way, the empty time. To change the example, let, in a piece of polyphonic music -- a figure, for instance, in which a tangle of melodies are under way -- suddenly a single voice be heard, which sustains a long note, while all else is hushed.... This one note will appear very protracted -- why? Because we expect to hear accompanying it the notes of the other instruments, but they fail to come.\" (Herbart: Psychol. als W., \u00a7115.) -- Compare also M\u00fcnsterberg, Beitr\u00e4ge, Heft 2, p. 41.\n\n[38] A night of pain will seem terribly long; we keep looking forward to a moment which never comes -- the moment when it shall cease. But the odiousness of this experience is not named ennui or Langweile, like the odiousness of time that seems long from its emptiness. The more positive odiousness of the pain, rather, is what tinges our memory of the night. What we feel, as Prof. Lazarus says (op cit. p. 202), is the long time of the suffering, not the suffering of the long time per se.\n\n[39] On these variations of time-estimate, cf. Romanes, Consciousness of Time. in Mind, vol. III. p. 297; J. Sully, Illusions, pp. 245-261, 302-305; W. Wundt, Physiol. Psych., II. 287, 288; besides the essays quoted from Lazarus and Janet. In German, the successors of Herbart have treated of this subject: compare Volkmann's Lehrbuch d. Psych., \u00a7 89, and for references to other authors his note 3 to this section. Lindner (Lbh. d. empir. Psych.), as a parallel effect, instances Alexander the Great's life (thirty-three years), which seems to us as if it must be long, because it was so eventful. Similarly the English Commonwealth, etc.\n\n[40] Physiol Optik, p. 445.\n\n[41] Succession, time per se, is no force. Our talk about its devouring tooth, etc., is all elliptical. Its contents are what devour. The law of innertia is incompatible with time's being assumed as an efficient cause of anything.\n\n[42] Lehrbuch d. Psych., \u00a7 87. Compare also H. Lotze, Metaphysik, \u00a7 154.\n\n[43] The cause of the perceiving, not the object perceived!\n\n[44] \"'No more' and 'not yet' are the proper time-feelings, and we are aware of time in no other way than through these feelings,\" says Volkmann (Psychol., \u00a7 87). This, which is not strictly true of our feeling of time per se, as an elementary bit of duration, is true of our feeling of date in its events.\n\n[45] We construct the miles just as we construct the years. Travelling in the cars makes a succession of different fields of view pass before our eyes. When those that have passed from present sight revive in memory, they maintain their mutual order because their contents overlap. We think them as having been before or behind each other; and, from the multitude of the views we can recall behind the one now presented, we compute the total space we have passed through.\n\nIt is often said that the perception of time develops later than that of space, because children have so vague an idea of all dates before yesterday and after to-morrow. But no vaguer than they have of extensions that exceed as greatly their unit of space-intuition. Recently I heard my child of four tell a visitor that he had been 'as much as one week' in the country. As he had been there three months, the visitor expressed surprise; whereupon the child corrected himself by saying he had been there 'twelve years.' But the child made exactly the same kind of mistake when he asked if Boston was not one hundred miles from Cambridge, the distance being three miles.\n\n[46] Most of these explanations simply give the signs which, adhering to impressions, lead us to date them within a duration, or, in other words, to assign to them their order. Why it should be a time-order, however, is not explained. Herbart's would-be explanation is a simple description of time-perception. He says it comes when, with the last member of a series present to our consciousness, we also think of the first; and then the whole series revives in our thought at once, but with strength diminishing in the backward direction (Psychol. als Wiss., \u00a7 115; Lehrb. zur Psychol., \u00a7\u00a7 171, 172, 175). Similarly Drobisch, who adds that the series must appear as one already elapsed (durchlaufene), a word which shows even more clearly the question-begging nature of this sort of account (Empirische Psychol., \u00a7 59). Th. Waitz is guilty of similar question-begging when he explains our time-consciousness to be engendered by a set of unsuccessful attempts to make our percepts agree with our expectations (Lehrb. d. Psychol., \u00a7 52). Volkmann's mythological account of past representations striving to drive present ones out of the seat of consciousness, being driven back by them, etc., suffers from the same fallacy (Psychol., \u00a7 87). But all such accounts agree in implying one fact -- viz., that the brain-processes of various events must be active simultaneously, and in varying strength, for a time-perception to be possible. Later authors have made this idea more precise. Thus, Lipps:\n\n\"Sensations arise, occupy consciousness, fade into images, and vanish. According as two of them, a and b, go through this process simultaneously, or as one precedes or follows the other, the phases of their fading will agree or differ; and the difference will be proportional to the time-difference between their several moments of beginning. Thus there are differences of quality in the images, which the mind may translate into corresponding differences of their temporal order. There is no other possible middle term between the objective time-relations and those in the mind than these differences of phase.\" (Grundtatsachen des Seelenlebens, p. 588.) Lipps accordingly calls them 'temporal signs,' and hastens explicitly to add that the soul's translation of their order of strength into a time-order is entirely inexplicable (p. 591). M. Guyau's account (Revue Philosophique, XIX. 353) hardly differs from that of his predecessors, except in picturesqueness of style. Every change leaves a series of train\u00e9es lumineuses in the mind like the passage of shooting stars. Each image is in a more fading phase, according as its original was more remote. This group of images gives duration, the mere time-form, the 'bed' of time. The distinction of past, present, and future within the bed comes from our active nature. The future (as with Waitz) is what I want, but have not yet got, and must wait for. All this is doubtless true, but is no explanation.\n\nMr. Ward gives, in his Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica article (Psychology. p. 65, col. 1), a still more refined attempt to specify the 'temporal sign.' The problem being, among a number of other things thought as successive, but simultaneously thought, to determine which is first and which last, he says: \"After each distinct representation, a b c d, there may intervene the representation of that movement of attention of which we are aware in passing from one object to another. In our present reminiscence we have, it must be allowed, little direct proof of this intervention; though there is, I think, indirect evidence of it in the tendency of the flow of ideas to follow the order in which the presentations were at first attended to. With the movement itself when the direction of attention changes, we are familiar enough, though the residua of such movements are not ordinarily conspicuous. These residua, then, are our temporal signs.... But temporal signs alone will not furnish all the pictorial exactness of the time-perspective. These give us only fixed series; but the law of obliviscence, by insuring a progressive variation in intensity as we pass from one member of the series to the other, yields the effect which we call time-distance. By themselves such variations in intensity would leave us liable to confound more vivid representations in the distance with fainter ones nearer the present, but from this mistake the temporal signs save us; where the memory-continuum is imperfect such mistakes continually occur. On the other hand, where these variations are slight and imperceptible, though the memory-continuum preserves the order of events intact, we have still no such distinct appreciation of comparative distance in time as we have nearer to the present, where these perceptive effects are considerable.... Locke speaks of our ideas succeeding each other 'at certain distances not much unlike the images in the inside of a lantern turned round by the heat of a candle,' and 'guesses' that 'this appearance of theirs in train varies not very much in a waking man.' Now what is this 'distance' that separates a from b, b from c, and so on; and what means have we of knowing that it is tolerably constant in waking life? It is, probably, that, the residuum of which I have called a temporal sign; or, in other words, it is the movement of attention from a to b.\" Nevertheless, Mr. Ward does not call our feeling of this movement of attention the original of our feeling of time, or its brain-process the brain-process which directly causes us to perceive time. He says, a moment later, that \" though the fixation of attention does of course really occupy rime, it is probably not in the first instance perceived as time -- i.e. as continuous 'protensity,' to use a term of Hamilton's -- but as intensity. Thus, if this supposition be true, there is an element in our concrete time-perceptions which has no place in our abstract conception of Time. In Time physically conceived there is no trace of intensity; in time psychically experienced, duration is primarily an intensive magnitude, and so far literally a perception.\" Its 'original' is, then, if I understand Mr. Ward, something like a feeling which accompanies, as pleasure and pain may accompany, the movements of attention. Its brain-process must, it would seem, be assimilated in general type to the brain-processes of pleasure and pain. Such would seem more or less consciously to be Mr. Ward's own view, for he says: \"Everybody knows what it is to be distracted by a rapid succession of varied impressions, and equally what it is to be wearied by the slow and monotonous recurrence of the same impressions. Now these 'feelings' of distraction and tedium owe their characteristic qualities to movements of attention. In the first, attention is kept incessantly on the move; before it is accommodated to a, it is disturbed by the suddenness, intensity, and novelty of b; in the second, it is kept all but stationary by the repeated presentation of the same impression. Such excess and defect of surprises make one realize a fact which in ordinary life is so obscure as to escape notice. But recent experiments have set this fact in a more striking light, and made clear what Locke had dimly before his mind in talking of a certain distance between the presentations of a waking man. In estimating very short periods of time of a second or less, indicated, say, by the beats of a metronome, it is found that there is a certain period for which the mean of a number of estimates is correct, while shorter periods are on the whole over-, and longer periods under-estimated. I take this to be evidence of the time occupied in accommodating or fixing attention.\" Alluding to the fact that a series of experiences, a b c d e, may seem short in retrospect, which seemed everlasting in passing, he says: \"What tells in retrospect is the series a b c d e, etc.; what tells in the present is the intervening t1 t2 t3, etc., or rather the original accommodation of which these temporal signs are the residuum.\" And he concludes thus: \"We seem to have proof that our perception of duration rests ultimately upon quasi-motor objects of varying intensity, the duration of which we do not directly experience as duration at all.\"\n\nWundt also thinks that the interval of about three-fourths of a second, which is estimated with the minimum of error, points to a connection between the time-feeling and the succession of distinctly 'apperceived' objects before the mind. The 'association-time' is also equal to about three fourths of a second. This association-time he regards as a sort of internal standard of duration to which we involuntarily assimilate all intervals which we try to reproduce, bringing shorter ones up to it and longer ones down. [In the Stevens result we should have to say contrast instead of assimilate, for the longer intervals there seem longer, and the shorter ones shorter still.] \"Singularly enough,\" he adds (Physiol. Psych., II. 286), \"this time is about that in which in rapid walking, according to the Webers, our legs perform their swing. It seems thus not unlikely that both psychical constants, that of the average speed of reproduction and that of the surest estimation of time, have formed themselves under the influence of those most habitual movements of the body which we also use when we try to subdivide rhythmically longer tracts of time.\"\n\nFinally, Prof. Mach makes a suggestion more specific still. After saying very rightly that we have a real sensation of time -- how otherwise should we identify two entirely different airs as being played in the same 'time'? how distinguish in memory the first stroke of the clock from the second, unless to each there clove its special time-sensation, which revived with it? -- he says \"it is probable that this feeling is connected with that organic consumption which is necessarily linked with the production of consciousness, and that the time which we feel is probably due to the [mechanical?] work of [the process of?] attention. When attention is strained, time seems long; during easy occupation, short, etc.... The fatigue of the organ of consciousness, as long as we wake, continually increases, and the work of attention augments as continually. Those impressions which are conjoined with a greater amount of work of attention appear to us as the later.\" The apparent relative displacement of certain simultaneous events and certain anachronisms of dreams are held by Mach to be easily explicable as effects of a splitting of the attention between two objects, one of which consumes most of it (Beitr\u00e4ge zur Analyse der Empfindungen, p. 103 foll.). Mach's theory seems worthy of being better worked out. It is hard to say now whether he, Ward, and Wundt mean at bottom the same thing or not. The theory advanced in my own text, it will be remarked, does not pretend to be an explanation, but only an elementary statement of the 'law' which makes us aware of time. The Herbartian mythology purports to explain.\n\n[47] It would be rash to say definitely just how many seconds long this specious present must needs be, for processes fade 'asymptotically,' and the distinctly intuited present merges into a penumbra of mere dim recency before it turns into the past which is simply reproduced and conceived. Many a thing which we do not distinctly date by intercalating it in a place between two other things will, nevertheless, come to us with this feeling of belonging to a near past. This sense of recency is a feeling sui generis, and may affect things that happened hours ago. It would seem to show that their brain-processes are still in a state modified by the foregoing excitement, still in a 'fading' phase, in a spite of the long interval.\n\n[48] Physiol. Psych., II. 263.\n\n[49] I leave my text as it was printed before M\u00fcnsterberg's essay appeared (see above page 620, note). He denies that we measure any but minimal durations by the amount of fading in the ideational processes, and talks almost exclusively of our feelings of muscular tension in his account, whereas I have made no mention of such things in mine. I cannot, however, see that there is any conflict between what he and I suggest. I am mainly concerned with the consciousness of duration regarded as a specific sort of object, he is concerned with this object's measurement exclusively. Feelings of tension might be the means of the measurement, whilst overlapping processes of any and every kind gave the object to be measured. The accommodative and respiratory movements from which the feelings of tension come form regularly recurring sensations divided by their 'phases' into intervals as definite as those by which a yardstick is divided by the marks upon its length.\n\nLet a1, a2, a3, a4, be homologous phases in four successive movements of this kind. If four outer stimuli 1, 2, 3, 4, coincide each with one of these successive phases, then their 'distances apart' are felt as equal, otherwise not. But there is no reason whatever to suppose that the mere overlapping of the brain-process of 2 by the fading process of1, or that of 3 by that of 2, etc., does not give the characteristic quality of content which we call 'distance apart' in this experience, and which by aid of the muscular feelings gets judged to be equal. Doubtless the muscular feelings can give us the object 'time' as well as its measure, because their earlier phases leave fading sensations which constantly overlap the vivid sensation of the present phase. But it would be contrary to analogy to suppose that they should be the only experiences which give this object. I do not understand Herr M\u00fcnsterberg to claim this for them. He takes our sense of time for granted, and only discusses its measurement.\n\n[50] Exner in Hermann's Hdbch. d. Physiol., Bd. II. Thl. II. p. 281. Richet in Revue Philosophique, XXI. 568 (juin, 1886). See the next chapter, pp. 642-646.\n\n[51] I have spoken of fading brain-processes alone, but only for simplicity's sake. Dawning processes probably play as important a part in giving the feeling of duration to the specious present.\n\n[52] Reden (St. Petersburg, 1864), vol. I. pp. 255-268.\n\n[53] Psychology, \u00a7 91.\n\n[54] \"The patient cannot retain the image of an object more than a moment. His memory is as short for sounds, letters, figures, and printed words. If we cover a written or printed word with a sheet of paper in which a little window has been cut, so that only the first letter is visible through the window, he pronounces this letter. If, then, the sheet is moved so as to cover the first letter and make the second one visible, he pronounces the second, but forgets the first, and cannot pronounce the first and second together.\" And so forth to the end. \"If he closes his eyes and draws his finger exploringly over a well-known object like a knife or key, he cannot combine the separate impressions and recognize the object. But if it is put into his hand so that he can simultaneously touch it with several fingers, he names it without difficulty. This patient has thus lost the capacity for grouping successive... impressions... into a whole and perceiving them as a whole.\" (Grashey, in Archiv f\u00fcr Psychiatrie, Bd. XVI. pp. 672-673.) It is hard to believe that in such a patient the time intuited was not clipped off like the impressions it held, though perhaps not so much of it.\n\nI have myself often noted a curious exaggeration of time-perspective at the moment of a falling asleep. A person will be moving or doing something in the room, and a certain stage of his act (whatever it may be) will be my last waking perception. Then a subsequent stage will wake me to a new perception. The two stages of the act will not be more than a few seconds apart; and yet it always seems to me as if, between the earlier and the later one, a long interval has passed away. I conjecturally account for the phenomenon thus, calling the two stages of the act a and b respectively: Were I awake, a would leave a fading process in my sensorium which would overlap the process of b when the latter came, and both would then appear in the same specious present, a belonging to its earlier end. But the sudden advent of the brain-change called sleep extinguishes a's fading process abruptly. When b then comes and wakes me, a comes back, it is true, but not as belonging to the specious present. It has to be specially revoked in memory. This mode of revocation usually characterizes long-past things -- whence the illusion.\n\n[55] Again I omit the future, merely for simplicity's sake.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1220692", "artist_names": "Jody Miller",

House Lyrics[Verse 1]\nUp every day at six\nBacon and eggs to fix\nFour kids from one to four\nPretty soon there'll be one more\nI got old floors to wax and scrub\nAnd there's a dirty old ring in the tub\nI'll get a maid someday but till then I'm\nQueen of the house\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo time to fix my hair\nNeed a new dress to wear\nOld clothes will have to do\n'Cause the kids all need new shoes\nI got bridge club each Tuesday night\nHe goes out with the boys and gets tight\nBut when the evenin's through he comes a-home to\nThe queen of the house\n[Bridge]\nI know the milkman, the iceman they come every day\nThey give me tips on the horses to play\nAnd when I got the time to spare\nI sit and wish that I'd picked a rich millionaire\n\n[Verse 3]\nI sing, up every day at six\nBacon and eggs

my\u2005part\u2005is\nI hear my\u2005own voice\nI make my own choice\nI\u2005guess, we're fuckin' doing it\nThe horse is out the gates\nIt's\u205ftime\u205fto\u205fstart the race\nShoutout\u205fto Kathy Bates\u205fand also Betty White\nAll the people, if you're the type\nI wanna say that you're equal on the mic\nBut nobody's equal to me\nNobody is coming for my neck\nI am looking for respect\nI'm not looking for a check\nUnless it is for my friends\nThat's why we're doing this\nTo make some pennies\nAnd maybe make amends\nSailors in the sea might get the bends\nThat is my fuckin' dream\nTo go with James Cameron in a submarine\nTo the bottom of the ocean\nRocking forth with the motion\nMe and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion\nSharing our emotion\nDaring you to fuck with us\nAt the sea, at a deep water vent\nBut we don't got the bends, we're not bent\nI think that's what I'm meant to do\nMe and my crew\nGigantic, looking to cross the sea\nFor the Titanic\nOh shit, you mean they found it?\nAlready? They'd abounded with treasure?\nMan, that doesn't give me pleasure\nI don't know how to measure\nHow I feel about that shit\nBut that won't make me quit\nIn my quest, to scour the deep sea\nLike, you and me?\nSearching for an angle, mangled\nThe corpse in the Bermuda Triangle\nMaybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane\nWe're like \"oh, shit, what remains\"\nAnd\nThen we get to the bottom\nAmelia Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil\nAll my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal\nAnd you know, I am not gonna take a foil\nTo my head in a little tin cap shape\nBecause you know I'm great\nI popped the grape\nBut I'm not on some conspiracies\nI'm just trying to see what's up in the seas\nI believe that I will not cease and desist\nYou cannot resist\nWhen I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist\nI am in Manila, in Hong Kong\nIn San Francisco, doing a disco\nPop it hot like it's Crisco\nBut I gotta pace myself\nIf we're gonna raise this wealth\nThat's why I flow at this tempo\nHello, I do kempo\nIn my mind, that's a form of martial arts\nBut I take, partial starts\nAnd I just gave little partial farts\nWhen I'm shitting on the mic\n'Cause you know I got this heart\nAnd you know I got the K-Mart\nState-of-the-art mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never make the wrong call\nAnd you know, chicks dig the long ball!\nI am like (Ah)\nThey are like (Wow)\nWatsky, you cannot stop me\nI got no paparazzi\nI'm a fucking doorstep\nI'm gonna take one more step\nAnd then, take another\nWord, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'\nHere I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada\nJust keep rappin', yada yada yada\nHey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld\nMe and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld\nOr maybe it's more like Larry David\nBecause you know we're not playing\nShoutout to the Jews, the chosen people\nYou know that you cannot fuckin' lose\nBut also, shoutout to the Christians\nShoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions\nYou know you cannot stop it\nAlso, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith\nWho know we're gonna make way\nFor the Jehovah's Witnesses\nThey got their hit list-esses\nWalking up to the different fuckin' doors\nSaying \"Would you like to love God a little more?\"\nBut it kinda sucks, just because of COVID\nThey can't be making no bids\nI heard they're not doing that door-knockin'\nBut, you know, we're not stoppin'\nHowever you appraise 'em\nNo, we are fuckin' raising\nOn the mic I'm fuckin' blazing\nIf the sun is blazing\nI turn into a raisin\nI'm bringing this whole craze\nFor almost two whole days\nI don't think that's possible\nI don't think that's wise\nI don't think that's probable\nThat is what they say when they look in to my eyes\nMy momma was afraid for me\nShe busted in like the ma\u00eetre d\nShe said \"Hello umm\"\nI don't think you wanna sit here\nI don't think you wanna get here\n'Cause you might die\nYou know but then I was like \"I gotta try\"\nI gotta try to do the right thing\nShoutout to Spike Lee\nI'm gonna try to get the ring\nTry to get the bling\nTry to be the king of the long raps\nLike I was the dude with the ass raps\nDoesn't matter\nAs long as the people fuckin' clap\nAs long as we give a little joy\nGive em dat'\nThen I will cut the crap\nI guess I am a believer\nAnd I don't care that I got seizures\nI got my fuckin' pills\nI'm gonna take 'em right around midnight\nSo I can get right\nI think that's what I gotta do\nShout out to the medical commun-\nItty I just get gritty\nI hope my rhymes are not shitty\nUmm, mic check are you with me?\nShout-out Bobby and Whitney\nBut not shout out to the bad things he did\nI don't know if I'm gonna have a kid\nI don't know if I'm gonna raise a child\nBut it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild\nThey would make be fuckin' smile\nThey got fuckin' bile and some guts\nEverybody does\nEverybody got guts\nEverybody got nuts\nOr half the people maybe like 48.7%\nThat's about how it went\nI think that is the percentage-ish\nOf the gender fuckin' separation\nAlthough we know in this nation\nThings are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient\nIf you don't understand\nI got my fuckin' rhymes on demand\nI can run it back\nBut I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness\nIf I'm trying to fuckin' win this\nI will not get winded, I have not rescinded\nAnything that I've fucking said\nBy the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead\nI'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds\nThat is like Right Said Fred\nYou just gotta relax\nIf you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe\nI don't get lyrical cataracts\nSo I can see clearly, so I can be dearly\nReceived, I've got to achieve\nWhatever I've got up my sleeve\nWhatever I've got in my pouch\nShoutout to pouch, ouch\nI pricked my finger, that is not true\nBut on this mic I will linger for you\nAnd for my crew\nThis is what I've got to do\nI've got to drop it hot for you\n'Cause this is why I'm hot\nThis is why I'm not\nShoutout to Mims\nShoutout to Hims\nThat's that brand of underwear\nThat I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway\nI'm drivin' down the one way\nI'm cruisin' up the runway\nSpreading my wings\nLike I am a Cessna\nLike I am a chestnut\nRoastin' on an open fire, bing!\nCrosby, you got me\nMe, hot see?\nMe Watsky\nSee?\nSittin' in the hot seat\nNo, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat\nBut that word, beats droppin' me\nAnd meha coppin'\nShoutout to Frank Macoppin\nPlayground\nIn the fuckin' San Francisco SFC\nBecause you know how this go\nWe are the best in Dolores Park\nWe have a chorus singin' in the dark\nHark, the angel\nShoutout to Chuck Rangel\nRangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but\nIn December maybe I will be dismembered\nBy a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa\nComin' down my chimney\nWavin' fuckin' butcher knives\nThat\u2019d be fucking crazy\nWho is he\nWho is this robotic crazy Santa\nOh my \u2018lanta\nI can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s tryna get me\nInstead of giving me presents\nI can't believe that he got me on the ground\nBut I'm like \"no I'm Watsky\"\nAnd Santa said \"oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude\"\nBut I'm like \"that's rude\nSanta you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'\nPlus I was in the nude\nHe got me tackled on the ground\nMy fuckin' whole brood around me\nAnd I got my whole butt out\nHe's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away\nCut-out\nCut it out like on Full House\nJohn Stamos\nJohn Stains-Most in his pants\nBut that's okay\nWe don't judge people who like to dance away the day\nIf they need a Pepto-Bismol\nMy throat is not abysmal\nThis all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt\nI will not repent\nAnd I\u2019m not demented\nBut I meant it\nWhen I sent it\nFrom my brain\nI'm not plain\nIm not fuckin' around\nI\u2019m not cluckin' the ground\nJust right there it\u2019s only two feet\nThat\u2019s pretty cool man I eat\nFrom that cup right there\nThe one that\u2019s floatin' up in the air\nIt\u2019s got a fuckin' strawber-\n-ry smoothie\nI flow very smoothly\nBut you

just remain\nOn the ground\nEven the cat\u2019s eye\nThat is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by\nDid you know at places\nPeople on the internet watch marble races\nI watched one\nIt was mad fun\nI picked the fuckin' blue marble\nAnd my pick wasn't all garbled\nIt came down the shoot\nIt was going all fuckin' cool\nAnd then it fuckin scooted past the red one\nThat kid from The Shining like Red-Rum\nMeaning murder\nWorder\nWordier\nAll my flows are so dirtier\nThan you could even fuckin' guess\nI'm not even fucking stressed\nI'm so damn relaxy\nShout out to a Maxi-Pad\nFor being so absorbent\nThat's a good fuckin' fuction\nMy girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it\nPut her hands in the air\nMaxi Pads doing what they do down there\nIf you are shaved or if you've got hair\nIt doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare\nDo what you wanna\nWord to your mama\nYour dude can't tell you what you gotta do\nGotta do what you wanna\nMake your own choice\nWith your body or your voice\nIf you are moist\nI know some people don't like that word\nPalabra\nBut you know you gotta like what you like\nThere was this one time this dude named Ike\nRan to be Prez\nAnd he fuckin' won\nEisenhower, that's what I said\nI's a power-rapper\nYes I am\nSo fuckin' dapper\nThe clapper\nDoesn't work on the lights on this green screen\nMan, that would be a dream scene\nIf I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want\nWhat I want, damn\nThat would be no scam\nI don't eat no Spam\nThat's 'cause I am a soft boy\nAnd I only eat Bok-Choy\n'Cause I'm a little veggie human\nAnd that's what I be doin'\nLet me clarify\nLike clarified butter\nAgain, word to your mother\nAnd also not to digress\nBut I gotta get it off of my chest\nWord to Mark Wahlberg\nWord to ballers\nWait, okay, let me make my main point\nAs I rap over this joint\nAnd that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy\nI also eat soy\nI also as a Jewish type dude not a goy\nGet lots of joy out of eatin' carrots\nOut of eatin' broccoli\nOut of eatin' lots of trees\nOut of smokin' lots of trees\nThat is true\nThat is not\nI don't smoke a lot\nBut I do when I party\nBut during COVID, I party hardly\nAnd I guess that's kinda sad\nBut I've had some calls with my dad\nPaul Watsky\nAnd Claire Watsky\nIt's rare, stop me\nIt's not, lots of Sundays\nI call my parentals\nAnd I just steal out my fuckin' mentals\nBut I don't pull out my dentals\nI go sometimes I do in a dream\nWhen I am on the scene\nAnd the ghost come and make me scream\nIt's like you are doing the most\nAnd I gotta fuckin' boast\nShout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast\nThat is some shit if you take a gander\nThat was said by Mr. Ned Flanders\nMr. Homer Simpson\nI'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on\nThey're like \u201cWatsky, I'll do everything for you\nI'll white knight for you and your fucking crew\u201d\nI'm like \u201cDude, don't be a simp\nActually, DO be a simp\nYou could be pimp\nYou could be wimp\nYou could fucking walk with a limp\nYou can have a crimp in your dimp-le\u201d\nI just get the whole tent pole\nUp in the sky cause I meant\nLots of people can come in\nCause I got a big tent\nSo if you are a lame\nFucking get bent\nAnd by lame, what I mean in this game\nIs the type of person who says that you're lame\nIs the type of person who judges\nIs the type of person who never budges\nWhen they get stubborn\nCause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard\n[?] 00:18:04\nWord!\nI think I got this whole thing turn-ed up\nBut that is bound to happen\n34 hours when you keep on rappin'\nSome words are going to collide like trains\nComing head to head, but it remains\nTo be seen that I get back on the track\nWith the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*\nWith my fucking clapping gums\nSo don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb\nSometimes\nCause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes\nBut it happens and I think that is the lesson\nThat you cannot achieve perfection\nAnd it's not even a worthy goal\nYou just gotta try to put that ball in the hole\nMore times than not\nThis is why I'm hot, as I said\nBut, you know Man's Not Hot?\nAlthough the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am\n'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham\nOn the microphone-o oh no\nCan't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno\nIce skatin' all over the beat\nMakin' it repeat\nI do not want to beat my meat, on the camera\nThat would be a bad fuckin' PR move\nWhen I'm all up in the groove with my meat out\nThey would be like \"oh, shout out\nThat will ruin my career\nIs that fuckin' clear?\nShowin' his whole rear?\nHe got fuckin' nakey\nMake me, take me\nYou cannot bake me\nIn my EZ bake oven\nNo Sara Lee\nI just keep on flowing, so merrily\nVerily, forsooth, did he do that shit\nOh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it\nHe's just Frank Coppin it\nAnd there is no halting' it\nI just put some fuckin malt in it\nMake it like some Yoo-hoo\nYoo-hoo!\nDid you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed\n[00:20:00]\n'Cause you could not rhyme\nLike I do, do the crime and you know that I'm\nJust puttin' lime on top of this shit\nAnd that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me\n'Cause you know when I put it on top\nThat I am going to make it drop\nTo the bottom of the urinal\nYou're all in my brain\nAnd I'm hearing y'all\nBut I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments\nI be too scared to see the tools\nBut I got to just remain bold\nAnd I've got to stay in the hold\nMy whole nuts life, oh, my nuts\nRemember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?\nRemember jungle?\n[00:20:41]\n\n[00:30:00]\nThey got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate\nVerbally, vocally, stoking the fire\nOf the couress I retired\nI feel one year\n'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear\nSee how I could sing, that took many years\nBefore I try to do with the din\nAnd now I only rapped\nAnd now I only try to cap, no cap\nI just try to get that back\nThat back, uh, back\nAnd I'm gone\nOver the fence\nNo shout out to my pens\n\nYou know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda\n\n[00:40:00]\nI'm sittin' on the veranda\nJust sippin' on my water\nLookin' at my ink blotter\nFeelin' like the best\nStarin' at my Rorschach test\nAnd it's tellin' me some dark crap\nIt's tellin' some star type of stuff\nLike oh shit, I'm gruff\nI'm like

"Angela\u2019s Ashes LyricsAngela's Ashes\n\nA Memoir of a Childhood\n\nBy Frank McCourt\n\nThis book is dedicated to my brothers, Malachy, Michael, Alphonsus. I learn from you, I admire you and I love you.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis is a small hymn to an exaltation of women.\nR'lene Dahlberg fanned the embers.\nLisa Schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me.\nMary Breasted Smyth, elegant novelist herself, read the first third\nand passed it on to Molly Friedrich, who became my agent and thought that Nan Graham, Editor-in-Chief at Scribner, would be just the right person to put the book on the road.\nAnd Molly was right.\nMy daughter, Maggie, has shown me how life can be a grand adventure, while exquisite moments with my granddaughter, Chiara, have helped me recall a small child's wonder.\nMy wife, Ellen, listened while I read and cheered me to the final\npage.\nI am blessed among men.\n\nI\nMy father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone.\nWhen I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\nPeople everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years.\nAbove all-we were wet.\nOut in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve.\nIt created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges. It provoked cures galore; to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper; for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles, wrapped it in a rag, and slapped it, sizzling, on the chest.\nFrom October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week's wages.\nThe rain drove us into the church-our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flowers and candles.\nLimerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the\nrain.\nMy father, Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County\nAntrim. Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head.\nWhen I was a child I would look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that. When I was thirteen my father's mother told me a secret: as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar.\nBecause of the price on the head he had been dropped on, he had to be spirited out of Ireland via cargo ship from Galway. In New York, with Prohibition in full swing, he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins. Then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced.\nAfter wandering and drinking in America and England he yearned for peace in his declining years. He returned to Belfast, which erupted all around him. He said, A pox on all their houses, and chatted with the ladies of Andersontown. They tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea. He no longer smoked or touched alcohol, so what was the use? It was time to go and he died in the Royal Victoria Hospital.\nMy mother, the former Angela Sheehan, grew up in a Limerick slum with her mother, two brothers, Thomas and Patrick, and a sister, Agnes. She never saw her father, who had run off to Australia weeks before her birth.\nAfter a night of drinking porter in the pubs of Limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song, Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder?\nNobody spoke so he said it all the louder It's a dirty Irish trick and I can lick the Mick Who threw the overalls in Murphy's chowder.\nHe's in great form altogether and he thinks he'll play a while with little Patrick, one year old. Lovely little fella. Loves his daddy. Laughs when Daddy throws him up in the air. Upsy daisy, little Paddy, upsy daisy, up in the air in the dark, so dark, oh, Jasus, you miss the child on the way down and poor little Patrick lands on his head, gurgles\na bit, whimpers, goes quiet. Grandma heaves herself from the bed, heavy with the child in her belly, my mother. She's barely able to lift little Patrick from the floor. She moans a long moan over the child and turns on Grandpa. Get out of it. Out. If you stay here a minute longer I'll take the hatchet to you, you drunken lunatic. By Jesus, I'll swing at the end of a rope for you. Get out.\nGrandpa stands his ground like a man. I have a right, he says, to stay in me own house.\nShe runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside. He stumbles from the house, up the lane, and doesn't stop till he reaches Melbourne in Australia.\nLittle Pat, my uncle, was never the same after. He grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way, his body the other. He never learned to read or write but God blessed him in another way. When he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. No one knew why he was called Ab Sheehan, The Abbot, but all Limerick loved him.\nMy mother's troubles began the night she was born. There is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains, praying to St. Gerard Majella, patron saint of expectant mothers. There is Nurse O'Halloran, the midwife, all dressed up in her finery. It's New Year's Eve and Mrs. O'Halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations. She tells my grandmother: Will you push, will you, push. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph, if you don't hurry with this child it won't be born till the New Year and what good is that to me with me new dress? Never mind St. Gerard Majella. What can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint? St. Gerard Majella my arse.\nMy grandmother switches her prayers to St. Ann, patron saint of difficult labor. But the child won't come. Nurse O'Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases.\nSt. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I'm desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant's head appears, only the head, my mother, and it's the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O'Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes.\nAh, Lord above, says Nurse O'Halloran, this child is a time straddler, born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New. You'll have to write to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I'll save this dress for next year.\nAnd the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway.\nLove her as in childhood\nThough feeble, old and grey.\nFor you'll never miss a mother's love\nTill she's buried beneath the clay.\nAt the St. Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write, and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done. She tried her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said, You don't have the knack of it. You're pure useless. Why don't you go to America where there's room for all sorts of uselessness? I'll give you the fare.\nShe arrived in New York just in time for the first Thanksgiving Day of the Great Depression. She met Malachy at a party given by Dan MacAdorey and his wife, Minnie, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn. Malachy liked Angela and she liked him. He had a hangdog look, which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck. He and his friend John McErlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy, that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans. Neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along Myrtle Avenue they pulled it over. The police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing, not pork and beans, but cases of buttons.\nWith Angela drawn to the hangdog look and Malachy lonely after three months in jail, there was bound to be a knee-trembler.\nA knee-trembler is the act itself done up against a wall, man and woman up on their toes, straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that's in it.\nThat knee-trembler put Angela in an interesting condition and, of course, there was talk. Angela had cousins, the MacNamara sisters, Delia and Philomena, married, respectively, to Jimmy Fortune of County Mayo, and Tommy Flynn, of Brooklyn itself.\nDelia and Philomena were large women, great-breasted and fierce. When they sailed along the sidewalks of Brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside, respect was shown. The sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They knew that Angela, unmarried, had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps.\nSteps they took. With Jimmy and Tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where Malachy could be found on Friday, payday when he had a job. The man in the speak, Joey Cacciamani, did not want to admit the sisters but Philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he'd better open up for they were there on God's business. Joey said, Awright, awright, you Irish. Jeezoz! Trouble, trouble.\nMalachy, at the far end of the bar, turned pale, gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile, offered them a drink. They resisted the smile and spurned the offer. Delia said, We don't know what class of a tribe you come from in the North of Ireland.\nPhilomena said, There is a suspicion you might have Presbyterians in your family, which would explain what you did to our cousin.\nJimmy said, Ah, now, ah, now. 'Tisn't his fault if there's Presbyterians in his family.\nDelia said, You shuddup.\nTommy had to join in. What you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the Irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself.\nOch, I am, said Malachy. I am.\nNobody asked you to talk, said Philomena. You done enough damage with your blather, so shut your yap.\nAnd while your yap is shut, said Delia, we're here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin, Angela Sheehan.\nMalachy said, Och, indeed, indeed. The right thing is the right thing and I'd be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little\ntalk.\nTake the drink, said Tommy, and shove it up your ass.\nPhilomena said, Our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than\nyou are at her. We have morals in Limerick, you know, morals. We're not like jackrabbits from Antrim, a place crawling with Presbyterians.\nJimmy said, He don't look like a Presbyterian.\nYou shuddup, said Delia.\nAnother thing we noticed, said Philomena. You have a very odd\nmanner.\nMalachy smiled. I do?\nabout\nYou do, says Delia. I think 'tis one of the first things we noticed you, that odd manner, and it gives us a very uneasy feeling.\n'Tis that sneaky little Presbyterian smile, said Philomena.\nOch, said Malachy, it's just the trouble I have with my teeth. Teeth or no teeth, odd manner or no odd manner, you're gonna marry\nthat girl, said Tommy. Up the middle aisle you're going.\nOch, said Malachy, I wasn't planning to get married, you know.\nThere's no work and I wouldn't be able to support... Married is what you're going to be, said Delia. Up the middle aisle, said Jimmy.\nYou shuddup, said Delia.\nMalachy watched them leave. I'm in a desperate pickle, he told Joey Cacciamani.\nBet your ass, said Joey. I see them babes comin' at me I jump inna Hudson River.\nMalachy considered the pickle he was in. He had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in San Francisco or one of the other California Sans. Wouldn't he be better off in California, far from the great breasted MacNamara sisters and their grim husbands? He would, indeed, and he'd have a drop of the Irish to celebrate his decision and departure. Joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off Malachy's gullet. Irish, indeed! He told Joey it was a Prohibition concoction from the devil's own still. Joey shrugged. I don't know nothing. I only pour. Still, it was better than nothing and Malachy would have another and one for yourself, Joey, and ask them two decent Italians what they'd like and what are you talking about, of course, I have the money to pay for it.\nHe awoke on a bench in the Long Island Railroad Station, a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick, his escape money gone, the MacNamara sisters ready to eat him alive in Brooklyn.\nOn the feast of St. Joseph, a bitter day in March, four months after the knee-trembler, Malachy married Angela and in August the child was born. In November Malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child's birth. He thought he might name the child Malachy, after himself, but his North of Ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name Male on the certificate.\nNot until late December did they take Male to St. Paul's Church to be baptized and named Francis after his father's father and the lovely saint of Assisi. Angela wanted to give him a middle name, Munchin, after the patron saint of Limerick but Malachy said over his dead body. No son of his would have a Limerick name. It's hard enough going through life with one name. Sticking on middle names was an atrocious American habit and there was no need for a second name when you're christened after the man from Assisi.\nThere was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather, John McErlaine, got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities. Philomena told her husband, Tommy, he'd have to be godfather. Child's soul is in danger, she said. Tommy put his head down and grumbled. All right. I'll be godfather but I'm not goin' to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin' trouble and goin' through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to John McErlaine at the speakeasy. The priest said, True for you, Tom, decent man that you are, fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy. Malachy, fresh from the speakeasy himself, felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest, one sacrilege on top of another. Take off that collar and we'll see who's the man. He had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim. Angela, new mother, agitated, forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font, a total immersion of the Protestant type. The altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom. The priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a Protestant. The priest said, Quiet, man, you're in God's house, and when Malachy said, God's house, my arse, he was thrown out on Court Street because you can't say arse in God's house.\nAfter baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner. Malachy said, Tea? and she said, Yes, tea, or is it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he'd have to go and deal with John McErlaine, who didn't have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather. Angela said, You're only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy, and he said, As God is my witness, the drink is the last thing on my mind. Angela started to cry. Your son's christening day and you have to go drinking. Delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the North of Ireland.\nMalachy looked from one to the other, shifted on his feet, pulled his cap down over his eyes, shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets, said, Och, aye, the way they do in the far reaches of County Antrim, turned, hurried up Court Street to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where he was sure they'd ply him with free drink in honor of his son's baptism.\nAt Philomena's house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while Angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying. Philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at Angela, That's what you get for being such a fool. Hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic. You shoulda stayed single, put the child up for adoption, and you'd be a free woman today. Angela cried harder and Delia took up the attack, Oh, stop it, Angela, stop it. You have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin' into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that doesn't even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I'd say\nthat... that... Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right enough. You shuddup, Jimmy.\nIf I was you, said Philomena, I'd make sure there's no more children. He don't have a job, so he don't, an' never will the way he drinks. So... no more children, Angela. Are you listenin' to me?\nI am, Philomena.\nA year later another child was born. Angela called him Malachy after his father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father's brother.\nThe MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses.\nTheir husbands agreed.\nI'm in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, Malachy. He's two, I'm three. We're on the seesaw.\nUp, down, up, down.\nMalachy goes up.\nI get off.\nMalachy goes down. Seesaw hits the ground. He screams. His hand is\non his mouth and there's blood.\nOh, God. Blood is bad. My mother will kill me.\nAnd here she is, trying to run across the playground. Her big belly\nslows her.\nShe says, What did you do? What did you do to I don't know what to say. I don't know what I She pulls my ear. Go home. Go to bed. Bed?\nIn the middle of the day?\nShe pushes me toward the playground gate. Go. She picks up Malachy and waddles off.\nMy father's friend, Mr. MacAdorey, is outside\nthe child?\ndid.\nour building. He's standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife, Minnie, looking at a\ndog lying in the gutter. There is blood all around the dog's head. It's the color of the blood from Malachy's mouth.\nMalachy has dog blood and the dog has Malachy blood.\nI pull Mr. MacAdorey's hand. I tell him Malachy has blood like the\ndog.\nOh, he does, indeed, Francis. Cats have it, too. And Eskimos. All\nthe same blood.\nMinnie says, Stop that, Dan. Stop confusing the wee fellow. She\ntells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died. Wanted to come home, the poor wee creature.\nMr. MacAdorey says, You'd better go home, Francis. I don't know what you did to your wee brother, but your mother took him off to the hospital. Go home, child.\nWill Malachy die like the dog, Mr. MacAdorey? Minnie says, He bit his tongue. He won't die. Why did the dog die?\nIt was his time, Francis.\nThe apartment is empty and I wander between the two rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen. My father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with Malachy. I wish I had something to eat but there's nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice. My father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it. I fall asleep on my parents' bed and when my mother\nshakes me it's nearly dark. Your little brother is going to sleep a while. Nearly bit his tongue off. Stitches galore. Go into the other\nroom.\nMy father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white\nenamel mug. He lifts me to his lap.\nDad, will you tell me the story about Coo Coo?\nCuchulain. Say it after me, Coo-hoo-lin. I'll tell you the story\nwhen you say the name right. Coo-hoo-lin.\nI say it right and he tells me the story of Cuchulain, who had a\ndifferent name when he was a boy, Setanta. He grew up in Ireland where Dad lived when he was a boy in County Antrim. Setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to Culain and choked him. Oh, Culain was angry and he said, What am I to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs, hens, sheep?\nSetanta said, I'm sorry. I'll guard your house with my stick and ball and I'll change my name to Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain. He did. He guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero, the Hound of Ulster itself. Dad said he was a greater hero than Hercules or Achilles that the Greeks were always bragging about and he could take on King Arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which, of course, you could never get with an Englishman anyway.\nThat's my story. Dad can't tell that story to Malachy or any other children down the hall.\nHe finishes the story and lets me sip his tea. It's bitter, but I'm happy there on his lap.\nFor days Malachy's tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk. But even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night. The neighbors say, Ooh, Ah, they're lovely boys, look at those big eyes.\nMalachy stands in the middle of the room, looking up at everyone, pointing to his tongue and saying, Uck, uck. When the neighbors say, Can't you see we're looking at your little brothers? he cries, till Dad pats him on the head. Put in your tongue, son, and go out and play with Frankie. Go on.\nIn the playground I tell Malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth. Malachy shakes his head. No uck ball. Car uck kill dog. He cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it's terrible when you can't talk. He won't let me push him on the swing. He says, You uck kill me uck on seesaw. He gets Freddie Leibowitz to push him and he's happy, laughing when he swings to the sky. Freddie is big, he's seven, and I ask him to push me. He says, No, you tried to kill your brother.\nI try to get the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back and forth and I'm angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at the way I can't swing. They're great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, two. They laugh every day and Malachy's tongue gets better with all the laughing.\nWhen he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest child in the world.\nShe tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I can't ask because I'm not supposed to be listening.\nI wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oliver and Eugene, cry in the middle of the night anymore. My mother says they're always hungry. She cries in the middle of the night, too. She says she's worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her. She wishes she had one little girl all for herself. She'd give anything for one little girl.\nI'm in the playground with Malachy. I'm four, he's three. He lets me push him on the swing because he's no good at swinging himself and Freddie Leibowitz is in school. We have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she's worn out. Go out and play, she says, and give me some rest. Dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey, singing all the songs about suffering Ireland. Mam gets angry and says Ireland can kiss her arse. He says that's nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language, food on the table is what she wants, not suffering Ireland. She says it was a sad day Prohibition ended because Dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer. Sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch, rye bread, corned beef, pickles. He puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself. He says food is a shock to the system and he doesn't know where we get our appetites. Mam\nsays,\nThey get their appetites because they're starving half the time.\nWhen Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,\nIt had to be and the reason is this\nCould it be true, someone like you\nCould love me, love me?\nWhen Dad brings home the first week's wages Mam is delighted she can pay the lovely Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone. She cleans the kitchen, washes the mugs and plates, brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table, cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another Italian. She buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that, she says, is better than having the headlines from the Daily News blackening your arse. She boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks, diapers for the twins, our two sheets, our three towels. She hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun. She says you wouldn't want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there's nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun.\nWhen Dad brings home the first week's wages on a Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. On Saturday night Mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we'll all laugh. Mam will make hot cocoa and we'll be able to stay up while Dad tells us a story out of his head. All we have to do is\nsay a name, Mr. MacAdorey or Mr. Leibowitz down the hall, and Dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in Brazil chased by Indians with green noses and puce shoulders. On nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs, fried tomatoes and fried bread, tea with lashings of sugar and milk and, later in the day, a big dinner of mashed potatoes, peas and ham, and a trifle Mam makes, layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry.\nWhen Dad brings home the first week's wages and the weather is fine Mam takes us to the playground. She sits on a bench and talks to Minnie MacAdorey. She tells Minnie stories about characters in Limerick and Minnie tells her about characters in Belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in Ireland, North and South. Then they teach each other sad songs and Malachy and I leave the swings and see-saws to sit with them on the bench and sing, A group of young soldiers one night in a camp Were talking of sweethearts they had.\nAll seemed so merry except one young lad, And he was downhearted and sad.\nCome and join us, said one of the boys, Surely there's someone for you.\nBut Ned shook his head and proudly he said I am in love with two, Each like a mother to me,\nFrom neither of them shall I part.\nFor one is my mother,\nGod bless her and love her,\nThe other is my sweetheart.\nMalachy and I sing that song and Mam and Minnie laugh till they cry at the way Malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to Mam at the end. Dan MacAdorey comes along on his way home from work and says Rudy Vallee better start worrying about the competition.\nWhen we go home Mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt. Dad drinks the tea and eats nothing. Mam says, God above, How can you work all day and not eat? He says, The tea is enough. She says, You'll ruin your health, and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system. He drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the Daily News or he smokes a cigarette, stares at the wall, runs his tongue over his lips.\nWhen Dad's job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages. On Friday night we wait for him and Mam gives us bread and tea. The darkness comes down and the lights come on along Classon Avenue. Other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can't have meat on a Friday. You can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and Bing Crosby is singing on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime?\nMalachy and I play with the twins. We know Mam won't sing Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking to herself, What am I going to do? till it's late and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley. He pushes in the door and calls for us, Where are my troops? Where are my four warriors?\nMam says, Leave those boys alone. They're gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey.\nHe comes to the bedroom door. Up, boys, up. A nickel for everyone who promises to die for Ireland.\nDeep in Canadian woods we met\nFrom one bright island flown.\nGreat is the land we tread, but yet\nOur hearts are with our own.\nUp, boys, up. Francis, Malachy, Oliver, Eugene. The Red Branch Knights, the Fenian Men, the IRA. Up, up.\nMam is at the kitchen table, shaking, her hair hanging damp, her face wet. Can't you leave them alone? she says. Jesus, Mary and Joseph,\nisn't it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it? She comes to us. Go back to bed, she\nI want them up, he says. I want them\nbe free from the center to the sea.\nDon't cross me, she says, for if you your mother's house.\na penny in your pocket without\nsays.\nready for the day Ireland will\ndo it'll be a sorry day in\nHe pulls his cap down over his face and cries, My poor mother. Poor Ireland. Och, what are we going to do?\nMam says, You're pure stone mad, and she tells us again to go to bed.\nOn the morning of the fourth Friday of Dad's job Mam asks him if he'll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again? He looks at us and shakes his head at Mam as if to say, Och, you shouldn't talk like that in front of the children.\nMam keeps at him. I'm asking you, Are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing Kevin Barry and the rest of the sad songs?\nHe puts on his cap, shoves his hands into his trouser pockets, sighs and looks up at the ceiling. I told you before I'll be home, he\nsays.\nLater in the day Mam dresses us. She puts the twins into the pram\nand off we go through the long streets of Brooklyn. Sometimes she lets Malachy sit in the pram when he's tired of trotting along beside her. She tells me I'm too big for the pram. I could tell her I have pains in my legs from trying to keep up with her but she's not singing and I know this is not the day to be talking about my pains.\nWe come to a big gate where there's a man standing in a box with windows all around. Mam talks to the man. She wants to know if she can go inside to where the men are paid and maybe they'd give her some of Dad's wages so he wouldn't spend it in the bars. The man shakes his head. I'm sorry, lady, but if we did that we'd have half the wives in Brooklyn storming the place. Lotta men have the drinking problem but there's nothing we can do long as they show up sober and do their work.\nWe wait across the street. Mam lets me sit on the sidewalk with my back against the wall. She gives the twins their bottles of water and sugar but Malachy and I have to wait till she gets money from Dad and we can go to the Italian for tea and bread and eggs.\nWhen the whistle blows at half five men in caps and overalls swarm through the gate, their faces and hands black from the work. Mam tells us watch carefully for Dad because she can hardly see across the street\nherself, her eyes are that bad. There are dozens of men, then a few, then none. Mam is crying, Why couldn't ye see him? Are ye blind or what?\nShe goes back to the man in the box. Are you sure there wouldn't be one man left inside?\nNo, lady, he says. They're out. I don't know how he got past you.\nWe go back through the long streets of Brooklyn. The twins hold up their bottles and cry for more water and sugar. Malachy says he's hungry and Mam tells him wait a little, we'll get money from Dad and we'll all have a nice supper. We'll go to the Italian and get eggs and make toast with the flames on the stove and we'll have jam on it. Oh, we will, and we'll all be nice and warm.\nIt's dark on Atlantic Avenue and all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station are bright and noisy. We go from bar to bar looking for Dad. Mam leaves us outside with the pram while she goes in or she sends me. There are crowds of noisy men and stale smells that remind me of Dad when he comes home with the smell of the whiskey on him.\nThe man behind the bar says, Yeah, sonny, whaddya want? You're not supposeta be in here, y'know.\nI'm looking for my father. Is my father here?\nNaw, sonny, how'd I know dat? Who's your fawdah?\nHis name is Malachy and he sings Kevin Barry.\nMalarkey?\nNo, Malachy.\nMalachy? And he sings Kevin Barry?\nHe calls out to the men in the bar, Youse guys, youse know guy\nMalachy what sings Kevin Barry?\nMen shake their heads. One says he knew a guy Michael sang Kevin\nBarry but he died of the drink which he had because of his war wounds. The barman says, Jeez, Pete, I didn't ax ya to tell me history o'\nda woild, did I? Naw, kid. We don't let people sing in here. Causes trouble. Specially the Irish. Let 'em sing, next the fists are flying. Besides, I never hoid a name like dat Malachy. Naw, kid, no Malachy here.\nThe man called Pete holds his glass toward me. Here, kid, have a sip, but the barman says, Whaddya doin', Pete? Tryina get the kid drunk? Do that again, Pete, an' I'll come out an' break y'ass.\nMam tries all the bars around the station before she gives up. She leans against a wall and cries. Jesus, we still have to walk all the way to Classon Avenue and I have four starving children. She sends me back into the bar where Pete offered me the sip to see if the barman would fill the twins' bottles with water and maybe a little sugar in each. The men in the bar think it's very funny that the barman should be filling baby bottles but he's big and he tells them shut their lip. He tells me babies should be drinking milk not water and when I tell him Mam doesn't have the money he empties the baby bottles and fills them with milk. He says, Tell ya mom they need that for the teeth an' bones. Ya drink water an' sugar an' all ya get is rickets. Tell ya Mom.\nMam is happy with the milk. She says she knows all about teeth and bones and rickets but beggars can't be choosers.\nWhen we reach Classon Avenue she goes straight to the Italian grocery shop. She tells the man her husband is late tonight, that he's probably working overtime, and would it be at all possible to get a few things and she'll be sure to see him tomorrow?\nThe Italian says, Missus, you always pay your bill sooner or later and you can have anything you like in this store.\nOh, she says, I don't want much.\nAnything you like, missus, because I know you're an honest woman and you got a bunch o' nice kids there.\nWe have eggs and toast and jam though we're so weary walking the long streets of Brooklyn we can barely move our jaws to chew. The twins fall asleep after eating and Mam lays them on the bed to change their diapers. She sends me down the hall to rinse the dirty diapers in the lavatory so that they can be hung up to dry and used the next day. Malachy helps her wash the twins' bottoms though he's ready to fall asleep himself.\nI crawl into bed with Malachy and the twins. I look out at Mam at the kitchen table, smoking a cigarette, drinking tea, and crying. I want to get up and tell her I'll be a man soon and I'll get a job in the place with the big gate and I'll come home every Friday night with money for eggs and toast and jam and she can sing again Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss.\nThe next week Dad loses the job. He comes home that Friday night, throws his wages on the table and says to Mam, Are you happy now? You hang around the gate complaining and accusing and they sack me. They were looking for an excuse and you gave it to them.\nHe takes a few dollars from his wages and goes out. He comes home late roaring and singing. The twins cry and Mam shushes them and cries a long time herself.\nWe spend hours in the playground when the twins are sleeping, when Mam is tired, and when Dad comes home with the whiskey smell on him, roaring about Kevin Barry getting hanged on a Monday morning or the Roddy McCorley song, Up the narrow street he stepped Smiling and proud and young About the hemp rope on his neck The golden ringlets clung, There's never a tear in the blue eyes Both glad and bright are they, As Roddy McCorley goes to die On the bridge of Toome today.\nWhen he sings he marches around the table, Mam cries and the twins howl with her. She says, Go out, Frankie, go out, Malachy. You shouldn't see your father like this. Stay in the playground. We don't mind going to the playground.\nWe can play with the leaves piling up on the ground and we can push each other on the swings but then winter comes to Classon Avenue and the swings are frozen and won't even move. Minnie MacAdorey says, God help these poor wee boys.\nThey don't have a glove between them. That makes me laugh because I know Malachy and I have four hands between us and one glove would be silly. Malachy doesn't know what I'm laughing at: He won't know anything till he's four going on five.\nMinnie brings us in and gives us tea and porridge with jam in it. Mr. MacAdorey sits in an armchair with their new baby, Maisie. He holds her bottle and sings, Clap hands, clap hands, Till Daddy comes home, With buns in his pocket For Maisie alone.\nClap hands, clap hands,\nTill Daddy comes home,\nFor Daddy has money\nAnd Mammy has none.\nMalachy tries to sing that song but I tell him stop, it's Maisie's song. He starts to cry and Minnie says, There, there. You can sing the\nsong.\nand I\nsong.\nThat's a song for all the children. Mr. MacAdorey smiles at Malachy wonder what kind of world is it where anyone can sing anyone else's\nMinnie says, Don't frown, Frankie. It makes your face dark and God it's dark enough. Some day you'll have a little sister and you can\nknows\nsing that song to her. Och, aye. You'll have a little sister, surely.\nMinnie is right and Mam gets her wish. There's a new baby soon, a little girl, and they call her Margaret. We all love Margaret. She has black curly hair and blue eyes like Mam and she waves her little hands and chirps like any little bird in the trees along Classon Avenue. Minnie says there was a holiday in heaven the day this child was made. Mrs. Leibowitz says the world never saw such eyes, such a smile, such happiness. She makes me dance, says Mrs. Leibowitz.\nsings\nWhen Dad comes home from looking for a job he holds Margaret and to her: In a shady nook one moonlit night A leprechaun I spied.\nWith scarlet cap and coat of green\nA cruiskeen by his side.\n'Twas tick tock tick his hammer went Upon a tiny shoe.\nOh, I laugh to think he was caught at last, But the fairy was laughing, too.\nHe walks around the kitchen with her and talks to her. He tells her how lovely she is with her curly black hair and the blue eyes of her mother. He tells her he'll take her to Ireland and they'll walk the Glens of Antrim and swim in Lough Neagh. He'll get a job soon, so he will, and she'll have dresses of silk and shoes with silver buckles.\nThe more Dad sings to Margaret the less she cries and as the days pass she even begins to laugh. Mam says, Look at him trying to dance with that child in his arms, him with his two left feet. She laughs and we all laugh.\nThe twins cried when they were small and Dad and Mam would say Whisht and Hush and feed them and they'd go back to sleep. But when Margaret cries there's a high lonely feeling in the air and Dad is out of bed in a second, holding her to him, doing a slow dance around the table, singing to her, making sounds like a mother. When he passes the window where the streetlight shines in you can see tears on his cheeks and that's strange because he never cries for anyone unless he has the drink taken and he sings the Kevin Barry song and the Roddy McCorley song. Now he cries over Margaret and he has no smell of drink on him.\nMam tells Minnie MacAdorey, He's in heaven over that child. He hasn't touched a drop since she was born. I should've had a little girl a long time ago.\nOch, they're lovely, aren't they? says Minnie. The little boys are grand, too, but you need a little girl for yourself.\nMy mother laughs, For myself? Lord above, if I didn't nurse her I wouldn't be able to get near her the way he wants to be holding her day and night.\nMinnie says it's lovely, all the same, to see a man so charmed with his little girl for isn't everyone charmed with her?\nEveryone.\nThe twins are able to stand and walk and they have accidents all the time. Their bottoms are sore because they're always wet and shitty. They put dirty things in their mouths, bits of paper, feathers, shoelaces, and they get sick. Mam says we're all driving her crazy. She dresses the twins, puts them in the pram, and Malachy and I take them to the playground. The cold weather is gone and the trees have green leaves up and down Classon Avenue.\nWe race the pram around the playground and the twins laugh and make goo-goo sounds till they get hungry and start to cry. There are two bottles in the pram filled with water and sugar and that keeps them quiet for awhile till they're hungry again and they cry so hard I don't know what to do because they're so small and I wish I could give them all kinds of food so that they'd laugh and make the baby sounds. They love the mushy food Mam makes in a pot, bread mashed up in milk and water and sugar. Mam calls it bread and goody.\nIf I take the twins home now Mam will yell at me for giving her no rest or for waking Margaret. We are to stay in the playground till she sticks her head out the window and calls for us. I make funny faces for the twins to stop their crying. I put a piece of paper on my head and let it fall and they laugh and laugh. I push the pram over to Malachy playing on the swings with Freddie Leibowitz. Malachy is trying to tell Freddie all about the way Setanta became Cuchulain. I tell him stop telling that story, it's my story. He won't stop. I push him and he cries, Waah, waah, I'll tell Mam. Freddie pushes me and everything turns dark in my head and I run at him with fists and knees and feet till he yells, Hey, stop, stop, and I won't because I can't, I don't know how, and if I stop Malachy will go on taking my story from me. Freddie pushes me away and runs off, yelling, Frankie tried to kill me. Frankie tried to kill me. I don't know what to do because I never tried to kill anyone before and now Malachy, on the swing, cries, Don't kill me, Frankie, and he looks so helpless I put my arms around him and help him off the swing. He hugs me. I won't tell your story anymore. I won't tell Freddie about Coo, Coo. I want to laugh but I can't because the twins are crying in the pram and it's dark in the playground and what's the use of trying to make funny faces and letting things fall off your head when they can't see you in the dark?\nThe Italian grocery shop is across the street and I see bananas, apples, oranges. I know the twins can eat bananas. Malachy loves bananas and I like them myself. But you need money, Italians are not known for giving away bananas especially to the McCourts who owe them money already for groceries.\nMy mother tells me all the time, Never, never leave that playground except to come home. But what am I to do with the twins bawling with the hunger in the pram? I tell Malachy I'll be back in a minute. I make sure no one is looking, grab a bunch of bananas outside the Italian grocery shop and run down Myrtle Avenue, away from the playground, around the block and back to the other end where there's a hole in the fence. We push the pram to a dark corner and peel the bananas for the twins. There are five bananas in the bunch and we feast on them in the dark corner. The twins slobber and chew and spread banana over their faces, their hair, their clothes. I realize then that questions will be asked. Mam will want to know why the twins are smothered in bananas, where did you get them? I can't tell her about the Italian shop on the corner. I will have to say, A man.\nThat's what I'll say. A man.\nThen the strange thing happens. There's a man at the gate of the playground. He's calling me. Oh, God, it's the Italian. Hey, sonny, come 'ere. Hey, talkin' to ya. Come 'ere.\nI go to him.\nYou the kid wid the little bruddas, right? Twins?\nYes, sir.\nHeah. Gotta bag o' fruit. I don' give it to you I trow id out.\nRight? So, heah, take the bag. Ya got apples, oranges, bananas. Ya like bananas, right? I think ya like bananas, eh? Ha, ha. I know ya like the bananas. Heah, take the bag. Ya gotta nice mother there. Ya father? Well, ya know, he's got the problem, the Irish thing. Give them twins a banana. Shud 'em up. I hear 'em all the way cross the street.\nThank you, sir.\nJeez. Polite kid, eh? Where ja loin dat?\nMy father told me to say thanks, sir.\nYour father? Oh, well.\nDad sits at the table reading the paper. He says that President\nRoosevelt is a good man and everyone in America will soon have a job. Mam is on the other side of the table feeding Margaret with a bottle. She has the hard look that frightens me.\nWhere did you get that fruit?\nThe man.\nWhat man?\nThe Italian man gave it to me.\nDid you steal that fruit?\nMalachy says, The man. The man\nAnd what did you do to Freddie\nLovely woman. I don't know what we'd\nAnd you had to attack poor Freddie.\ngave Frankie the bag.\nLeibowitz? His mother was here.\ndo without her and Minnie MacAdorey.\nMalachy jumps up and down. He din't. He din't. Din't try to kill Freddie. Din't try to kill me.\nDad says, Whisht, Malachy, whisht. Come over here. And he takes Malachy on his lap.\nMy mother says, Go down the hall and tell Freddie you're sorry.\nBut Dad says, Do you want to tell Freddie you're sorry?\nI don't.\nMy parents look at one another. Dad says, Freddie is a good boy. He\nwas only pushing your little brother on the swing. Isn't that right? He was trying to steal my Cuchulain story.\nOch, now. Freddie doesn't care about the Cuchulain story. He has\nhis own story. Hundreds of stories. He's Jewish. What's Jewish?\nDad laughs. Jewish is, Jewish is people with their own stories. They don't need Cuchulain. They have Moses. They have Samson.\nWhat's Samson?\nIf you go down and talk to Freddie I'll tell you about Samson later. You can tell Freddie you're sorry and you'll never do it again and you can even ask him about Samson. Anything you like as long as you talk to Freddie. Will you?\nThe baby gives a little cry in my mother's arms and Dad jumps up, dropping Malachy to the floor. Is she all right? My mother says, Of course she's all right. She's feeding. God above, you're a bundle of nerves.\nThey're talking about Margaret now and I'm forgotten. I don't care. I'm going down the hall to ask Freddie about Samson, to see if Samson is as good as Cuchulain, to see if Freddie has his own story or if he still wants to steal Cuchulain. Malachy wants to go with me now that my father is standing and doesn't have a lap anymore.\nMrs. Leibowitz says, Oh, Frankie, Frankie, come in, come in. And little Malachy. And tell me, Frankie, what did you do to Freddie? Tried to kill him? Freddie is a good boy, Frankie. Reads his book. Listens to radio with his papa. He swinks you brother on swink. And you try to kill him. Oh, Frankie, Frankie. And you poor mother and her sick baby.\nShe's not sick, Mrs. Leibowitz.\nSick she is. Zat is one sick baby. I know from sick babies. I work in hoztipal. Don't tell me, Frankie. Come in, come in. Freddie, Freddie, Frankie is here. Come out. Frankie won't kill you no more. You and little Malachy. Nice Chewish name, have piece cake, eh? Why they give you a Chewish name, eh? So, glass milk, piece cake. You boys so thin, Irish don't eat.\nWe sit at the table with Freddie, eating cake, drinking milk. Mr. Leibowitz sits in an armchair reading the paper, listening to the radio. Sometimes he speaks to Mrs. Leibowitz and I don't understand because strange sounds come from his mouth. Freddie understands. When Mr. Leibowitz makes the strange sounds Freddie gets up and takes him a piece of cake. Mr. Leibowitz smiles at Freddie and pats his head and Freddie smiles back and makes the strange sounds.\nMrs. Leibowitz shakes her head at Malachy and me. Oy, so thin. She says Oy so much Malachy laughs and says Oy and the Leibowitzes laugh and Mr. Leibowitz says words we can understand, When Irish oyes are smiling. Mrs. Leibowitz laughs so hard her body shakes and she holds her stomach and Malachy says Oy again because he knows that makes everyone laugh. I say Oy but no one laughs and I know Oy belongs to Malachy the way Cuchulain belongs to me and Malachy can have his Oy.\nMrs. Leibowitz, my father said Freddie has a favorite story.\nMalachy says, Sam, Sam, Oy. Everyone laughs again but I don't because I can't remember what comes after Sam. Freddie mumbles through his cake, Samson, and Mrs. Leibowitz tells him, Don't talk wiz you mouse full, and I laugh because she's grown-up and she says mouse instead of mouth. Malachy laughs because I laugh and the Leibowitzes look at each other and smile. Freddie says, Not Samson. My favorite story is David and the giant, Goliath. David killed him dead with a slingshot, a stone in his head. His brains was on the ground.\nWere on the ground, says Mr. Leibowitz.\nYes, Papa. Papa.\nThat's what Freddie calls his father and Dad is what I call my\nfather.\nMy mother's whisper wakes me. What's up with the child? It's still\nearly and there isn't much morning in the room but you can see Dad over by the window with Margaret in his arms. He's rocking her and sighing,\nOch.\nMam says, Is she, is she sick?\nOch, she's very quiet and she's a wee bit cold.\nMy mother is out of the bed, taking the child. Go for the doctor.\nGo for God's sake, and my father is pulling on his trousers over his shirt, no jacket, shoes, no socks on this bitter day.\nWe wait in the room, the twins asleep at the bottom of the bed, Malachy stirring beside me. Frankie, I want a drink of water. Mam rocks in her bed with the baby in her arms. Oh, Margaret, Margaret, my own little love. Open your lovely blue eyes, my little leanv.\nI fill a cup of water for Malachy and me and my mother wails, Water for you and your brother. Oh, indeed, Water, is it? And nothing for your sister. Your poor little sister. Did you ask if she had a mouth in her head? Did you ask if she'd like a drop of water? Oh, no. Go on and drink your water, you and your brother, as if nothing happened. A regular day for the two of you, isn't it? And the twins sleeping away as if they didn't have a care and their poor little sister sick here in my arms. Sick in my arms. Oh, sweet Jesus in heaven.\nWhy is she talking like this? She's not talking like my mother today. I want my father. Where is my father?\nI get back into bed and start to cry. Malachy says, Why you cry? Why you cry? till Mam is at me again. Your sister is sick in my arms and you're there whining and whinging. If I go over to that bed I'll give you something to whinge about.\nDad is back with the doctor. Dad has the whiskey smell. The doctor examines the baby, prods her, raises her eyelids, feels her neck, arms, legs. He straightens up and shakes his head. She's gone. Mam reaches for the baby, hugs her, turns to the wall. The doctor wants to know, Was there any kind of accident? Did anyone drop the baby? Did the boys play too hard with her? Anything?\nMy father shakes his head. Doctor says he'll have to take her to examine her and Dad signs a paper. My mother begs for another few minutes with her baby but the doctor says he doesn't have all day. When Dad reaches for Margaret my mother pulls away against the wall. She has the wild look, her black curly hair is damp on her forehead and there is sweat all over her face, her eyes are wide open and her face is shiny with tears, she keeps shaking her head and moaning, Ah, no, ah, no, till Dad eases the baby from her arms. The doctor wraps Margaret completely in a blanket and my mother cries, Oh, Jesus, you'll smother her. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me. The doctor leaves. My mother turns to the wall and doesn't make a move or sound. The twins are awake, crying with the hunger, but Dad stands in the middle of the room, staring at the ceiling. His face is white and he beats on his thighs with his fists. He comes to the bed, puts his hand on my head. His hand is shaking. Francis, I'm going out for cigarettes.\nMam stays in the bed all day, hardly moving. Malachy and I fill the twins' bottles with water and sugar. In the kitchen we find a half loaf of stale bread and two cold sausages. We can't have tea because the milk is sour in the icebox where the ice is melted again and everyone knows you can't drink tea without milk unless your father gives it to you out of his mug while he's telling you about Cuchulain.\nThe twins are hungry again but I know I can't give them water and sugar all day and night. I boil sour milk in a pot, mash in some of the stale bread, and try to feed them from a cup, bread and goody. They make faces and run to Mam's bed, crying. She keeps her face to the wall and they run back to me, still crying. They won't eat the bread and goody till I kill the taste of the sour milk with sugar. Now they eat and smile and rub the goody over their faces. Malachy wants some and if he can eat it, so can I. We all sit on the floor eating the goody and chewing on the\ncold sausage and drinking water my mother keeps in a milk bottle in the icebox.\nAfter we eat and drink we have to go to the lavatory down the hall but we can't get in because Mrs. Leibowitz is inside, humming and singing. She says, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Won't be two seconds. Malachy claps his hands and dances around, singing, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Mrs. Leibowitz opens the lavatory door. Look at him. Little actor awready. So, chiltren, how's you mother?\nShe's in bed, Mrs. Leibowitz. The doctor took Margaret and my father went for cigarettes.\nOh, Frankie, Frankie. I said that was one sick child.\nMalachy is clutching himself. Have to pee. Have to pee.\nSo, pee awready. You boys pee and we see you mother.\nAfter we pee Mrs. Leibowitz comes to see Mam. Oh, Mrs. McCourt. Oy\nvey, darlink. Look at this. Look at these twins. Naked. Mrs. McCourt, what is mazzer, eh? The baby she is sick? So talk to me. Poor woman. Here turn around, missus. Talk to me. Oy, this is one mess. Talk to me, Mrs. McCourt.\nShe helps my mother sit up against the wall. Mam seems smaller. Mrs. Leibowitz says she'll bring some soup and tells me get some water to wash my mother's face. I dip a towel in cold water and pat her forehead. She presses my hand against her cheeks. Oh, Jesus, Frankie. Oh, Jesus. She won't let my hand go and I'm frightened because I've never seen her like this before. She's saying Frankie only because it's my hand she's holding and it's Margaret she's thinking about, not me. Your lovely little sister is dead, Frankie. Dead. And where is your father? She lets my hand drop. I said where is your father? Drinking. That's where he is. There isn't a penny in the house. He can't get a job but he finds money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink. She rears back, knocks her head on the wall and screams, Where is she? Where is she? Where is my little girl? Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me this night. I'll go mad, so I will, I'll go pure mad.\nMrs. Leibowitz rushes in. Missus, missus, what is it? The little girl. Where is she?\nMy mother screams again, Dead, Mrs. Leibowitz. Dead. Her head drops and she rocks back and forth. Middle of the night, Mrs. Leibowitz. In her pram. I should have been watching her. Seven weeks she had in this world and died in the middle of the night, alone, Mrs. Leibowitz, all alone in that pram.\nMrs. Leibowitz holds my mother in her arms. Shush, now, shush. Babies go like that. It happens, missus. God takes them.\nIn the pram, Mrs. Leibowitz. Near my bed. I could have picked her up and she didn't have to die, did she? God doesn't want little babies. What is God going to do with little babies?\nI don't know, missus. I don't know from God. Have soup. Good soup. Make you strong. You boys. Get bowls. I give you soup.\nWhat's bowls, Mrs. Leibowitz?\nOh, Frankie. You don't know bowl? For the soup, darlink. You don' have a bowl? So get cups for the soup. I mix pea soup and lentil soup. No ham. Irish like the ham. No ham, Frankie. Drink, missus. Drink you soup.\nShe spoons the soup into my mother's mouth, wipes the dribble from her chin. Malachy and I sit on the floor drinking from mugs. We spoon the soup into the twins' mouths. It is lovely and hot and tasty. My mother never makes soup like this and I wonder if there's any chance Mrs.\nLeibowitz could ever be my mother. Freddie could be me and have my mother and my father, too, and he could have Malachy and the twins for brothers. He can't have Margaret anymore because she's like the dog in the street that was taken away. I don't know why she was taken away. My mother said she died in her pram and that must be like getting hit by a car because they take you away.\nI wish little Margaret could be here for the soup. I could give it to her with a spoon the way Mrs. Leibowitz is giving it to my mother and she'd gurgle and laugh the way she did with Dad. She wouldn't cry anymore and my mother wouldn't be in the bed day and night and Dad would be telling me Cuchulain stories and I wouldn't want Mrs. Leibowitz to be my mother anymore. Mrs. Leibowitz is nice but I'd rather have my father telling me Cuchulain stories and Margaret chirping and Mam laughing when Dad dances with two left feet.\nMinnie MacAdorey comes in to help. Mother o' God, Mrs. Leibowitz, these twins smell to the high heavens.\nI don't know about Mother o' God, Minnie, but these twins need a wash. They need clean diapers. Frankie, where are the clean diapers?\nI don't know.\nMinnie says, They're just wearing rags for diapers. I'll get some of Maisie's. Frankie, you take off those rags and throw them out.\nMalachy removes Oliver's rag and I struggle with Eugene. The safety pin is stuck and when he wriggles it comes loose, sticks him in the hip, and starts him screaming for Mam. But Minnie is back with a towel and soap and hot water. I help her wash away the caked shit and she lets me shake talcum powder on the twins' raw sore skin. She says they're good little boys and she has a big surprise for them. She goes down the hall and brings back a pot of mashed potatoes for all of us. There is plenty of salt and butter in the potatoes and I wonder if there's any chance Minnie could be my mother so that I could eat like this all the time. If I could have Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie for mothers at the same time I'd have no end of soup and mashed potatoes.\nMinnie and Mrs. Leibowitz sit at the table. Mrs. Leibowitz says something has to be done. These children are running wild and where is the father? I hear Minnie whisper he's out for the drink. Mrs. Leibowitz says terrible, terrible, the way the Irish drink. Minnie says her Dan doesn't drink. Never touches the stuff and Dan told her that when the baby died that poor man, Malachy McCourt, went mad all over Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, that he was thrown out of all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station, that the cops would have thrown him in jail if it was anything else but the death of that lovely little baby.\nHere he has four lovely little boys, says Minnie, but it's no comfort to him. That little girl brought out something in him. You know he didn't even drink after she was born and that was a miracle.\nMrs. Leibowitz wants to know where Mam's cousins are, the big women with the quiet husbands. Minnie will find them and tell them the children are neglected, running wild, sore arses and everything.\nTwo days later Dad returns from his cigarette hunt. It's the middle of the night but he gets Malachy and me out of the bed. He has the smell of the drink on him. He has us stand at attention in the kitchen. We are soldiers. He tells us we must promise to die for Ireland.\nWe will, Dad, we will.\nAll together we sing Kevin Barry,\nOn Mountjoy one Monday morning,\nHigh upon the gallows tree,\nKevin Barry gave his young life\nFor the cause of liberty.\nJust a lad of eighteen summers\nSure there's no one can deny\nAs he marched to death that morning\nHow he held his head on high.\nThere's a knock at the door, Mr. MacAdorey. Och, Malachy, for God's sake, it's three in the morning. You have the whole house woke with the singing.\nOch, Dan, I'm only teaching the boys to die for Ireland.\nYou can teach them to die for Ireland in the daytime, Malachy. 'Tis urgent, Dan, 'tis urgent.\nI know, Malachy, but they're only children. Babies. You go to bed\nnow like a dacent man.\nBed, Dan! What am I to do in bed? Her little face is there day and\nnight, her curly black hair and her lovely blue eyes. Oh, Jesus, Dan, what will I do? Was it the hunger that killed her, Dan?\nOf course not. Your missus was nursing her. God took her. He has his reasons.\nOne more song, Dan, before we go to bed. Good night, Malachy.\nCome on, boys. Sing.\nBecause he loved the motherland, Because he loved the green\nHe goes to meet a martyr's fate With proud and joyous mien;\nTrue to the last, oh! true to the last He treads the upward way;\nYoung Roddy McCorley goes to die\nOn the bridge at Toome today.\nYou'll die for Ireland, won't you, boys?\nWe will, Dad.\nAnd we'll all meet your little sister in heaven, won't we, boys? We will, Dad.\nMy brother is standing with his face pressed against a leg of the\ntable and he's asleep. Dad lifts him, staggers across the room, places him in the bed by my mother. I climb into bed and my father, still in his clothes, lies beside me. I'm hoping he'll put his arms around me but he goes on singing about Roddy McCorley and talking to Margaret, Oh, my little curly-haired, blue-eyed love, I would dress you in silks and take you to Lough Neagh, till day is at the window and I fall asleep.\nThat night Cuchulain comes to me. There's a big green bird on his shoulder that keeps singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley and I don't like that bird because there's blood dripping from his mouth when he sings. In one hand Cuchulain carries the gae bolga, the spear that is so mighty only he can throw it. In the other hand he carries a banana, which he keeps offering to the bird, who just squawks and spits blood at\nhim. You'd wonder why Cuchulain puts up with a bird like that. If the twins ever spat blood at me when I offered them a banana I think I'd hit them on the head with it.\nIn the morning my father is at the kitchen table and I tell him my dream. He says there were no bananas in Ireland in the old times and even if there were Cuchulain would never offer one to that bird because that was the one that came over from England for the summer and perched on his shoulder when he was dying and propped up against a stone and when the men of Erin which is Ireland wanted to kill him they were afraid till they saw the bird drinking Cuchulain's blood and then they knew it was safe to attack him, the dirty bloody cowards. So you have to be wary of birds, Francis, birds and Englishmen.\nMost of the day Mam lies in bed with her face to the wall. If she drinks tea or eats anything she throws up in the bucket under the bed and I have to empty it and rinse it in the lavatory down the hall. Mrs. Leibowitz brings her soup and funny bread that is twisted. Mam tries to slice it but Mrs. Leibowitz laughs and tells her just pull. Malachy calls it pull bread but Mrs. Leibowitz says, No, it's challah, and teaches us how to say it. She shakes her head. Oy, you Irish. You'll live forever but you'll never say challah like a Chew.\nMinnie MacAdorey brings potatoes and cabbage and sometimes a piece of meat. Och, times are hard, Angela, but that lovely man, Mr. Roosevelt, will find a job for everyone and your husband will have work. Poor man, it's not his fault there's a Depression. He looks for work day and night. My Dan is lucky, four years with the city and he don't drink. He grew up in Toome with your husband. Some drink. Some don't. Curse of the Irish. Now eat, Angela. Build yourself up after your loss.\nMr. MacAdorey tells Dad there's work with the WPA and when he gets the work there's money for food and Mam leaves the bed to clean the twins and to feed us. When Dad comes home with the drink smell there's no money and Mam screams at him till the twins cry, and Malachy and I run out to the playground. On those nights Mam crawls back into bed and Dad sings the sad songs about Ireland. Why doesn't he hold her and help her sleep the way he did with my little sister who died? Why doesn't he sing a Margaret song or a song that will dry Mam's tears? He still gets Malachy and me out of bed to stand in our shirts promising to die for Ireland. One night he wanted to make the twins promise to die for Ireland but they can't even talk and Mam screamed at him, You mad oul' bastard, can't you leave the children alone?\nHe'll give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for Ireland and we promise but we never get the nickel.\nWe get soup from Mrs. Leibowitz and mashed potatoes from Minnie MacAdorey and they show us how to take care of the twins, how to wash their bottoms and how to wash diaper rags after they get them all shitty. Mrs. Leibowitz calls them diapers and Minnie calls them nappies but it doesn't matter what they call them because the twins get them shitty anyway. If Mam stays in the bed and Dad goes out looking for a job we can do what we like all day. We can put the twins in the small swings in the park and swing them till they get hungry and cry. The Italian man calls to me from across the street, Hey, Frankie, c'mere. Watch out crossing da street. Dem twins hungry again? He gives us bits of cheese and ham and bananas but I can't eat bananas anymore after the way the bird spat blood at Cuchulain.\nThe man says his name is Mr. Dimino and that's his wife, Angela, behind the counter. I tell him that's my mother's name. No kiddin', kid. Your mother is Angela? I didn't know the Irish had any Angelas. Hey, Angela, his mother's name is Angela. She smiles. She says, Thatsa nice.\nMr. Dimino asks me about Mam and Dad and who cooks for us. I tell him we get food from Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. I tell him all about the diapers and the nappies and how they get shitty anyway and he laughs. Angela, you listenin' to this? Thank God you're Italian, Angela. He says, Kid, I gotta talk to Mrs. Leibowitz. Ya gotta have relations can take care of you. Ya see Minnie MacAdorey, tell her come in see me. You kids runnin' wild.\nTwo big women are at the door. They say, Who are you? I'm Frank. Frank! How old are you?\nI'm four going on five.\nYou're not very big for your age, are you?\nI don't know.\nIs your mother here?\nShe's in the bed.\nWhat is she doing in the bed on a fine day in the middle of the\nday?\nShe's sleeping. Well, we'll come in. We have to talk to your\nmother.\nThey brush past me into the room. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, the smell\nof this place. And who are these children?\nMalachy runs smiling to the big women. When he smiles you can see\nhow white and straight and pretty his teeth are and you can see the shiny blue of his eyes, the pink of his cheeks. All that makes the big women smile and I wonder why they didn't smile when they talked to me.\nMalachy says, I'm Malachy and this is Oliver and this is Eugene, they're twins, and that's Frankie over there.\nThe big woman with the brown hair says, Well, you're not a bit shy, are you? I'm your mother's cousin, Philomena, and this is your mother's cousin, Delia. I'm Mrs. Flynn and she's Mrs. Fortune and that's what you call us.\nGood God, says Philomena. Those twins are naked. Don't you have clothes for them?\nMalachy says, They're all shitty.\nDelia barks. See. That's what happens. A mouth like a sewer, and no wonder with a father from the North. Don't use that word. That's a bad word, a curse word. You could go to hell using a word like that.\nWhat's hell? says Malachy. You'll know soon enough, says Delia.\nThe big women sit at the table with Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. Philomena says it's terrible what happened to Angela's little baby. They heard all about it and you'd wonder, wouldn't you, what they did with the little body. You might wonder and I might wonder but Tommy Flynn didn't wonder. Tommy said that Malachy from the North got money for that baby. Money? says Mrs. Leibowitz. That's right, says Philomena. Money. They take bodies any age and do experiments on them and there's not much left to give back nor would you want back bits of baby when they can't be buried in consecrated ground in that condition.\nThat's terrible, says Mrs. Leibowitz. A father or mother would never give the baby for something like that.\nThey would, says Delia, when they have the craving for the drink. They'd give their own mothers when they have the craving so what's a baby that's dead and gone in the first place?\nMrs. Leibowitz shakes her head and rocks in her chair. Oy, she says, oy, oy, oy. The poor baby. The poor mother. I thank God my husband don'have no what you call it? Craving? Right, craving. It's the Irish have the craving.\nNot my husband, says Philomena. I'd break his face if he came home with the craving. Of course, Delia's Jimmy has the craving. Every Friday night you see him slipping into the saloon.\nYou needn't start insulting my Jimmy, says Delia. He works. He brings home his wages.\nYou'd want to keep an eye on him, says Philomena. The craving could get the better of him and you'd have another Malachy from the North on your hands.\nMind your own bloody business, says Delia. At least Jimmy is Irish, not born in Brooklyn like your Tommy.\nAnd Philomena has no answer for that.\nMinnie is holding her baby and the big women say she's a lovely baby, clean, not like this pack of Angela's running around this place. Philomena says she doesn't know where Angela got her dirty habits because Angela's mother was spotless, so clean you could eat your dinner off her floor.\nI wonder why you'd want to eat your dinner off the floor when you had a table and a chair.\nDelia says something has to be done about Angela and these children for they are a disgrace, so they are, enough to make you ashamed to be related. A letter has to be written to Angela's mother. Philomena will write it because a teacher in Limerick told her once she had a fine fist. Delia has to tell Mrs. Leibowitz that a fine fist means good handwriting.\nMrs. Leibowitz goes down the hall to borrow her husband's fountain pen, paper and an envelope. The four women sit at the table and make up a letter to send to my mother's mother: Dear Aunt Margaret, I take pen in hand to write you this letter and hope this finds you as it leaves us in the best of health. My husband Tommy is in fine form working away and Delia's husband Jimmy is in fine form working away and we hope this finds you in fine form. I am very sorry to tell you that Angela is not in fine form as the baby died, the little girl that was called Margaret after yourself, and Angela has not been the same since lying in the bed with her face to the wall. To make matters worser we think she's expecting again and that's too much altogether. The minute she losses one child there is another one on the way. We don't know how she does it. She's married four years, five children and another on the way. That shows you what can happen when you marry someone from the North for they have no control over themselves up there a bunch of Protestands that they are. He goes out for work every day but we know he spends all his time in the saloons and gets a few dollars for sweeping floors and lifting barrels and spends the money right back on the drink. It's terrible, Aunt Margaret, and we all think Angela and the children would be better off in her native land. We don't have the money to buy the tickets ourselves for times is hard but you might be able to see your way. Hopping this finds you in fine form as it leaves us thank God and His Blessed Mother.\nI remain your loving neice\nPhilomena Flynn (what was MacNamara) and last but not least your neice Delia Fortune (what was MacNamara, too, ha ha ha)\nGrandma Sheehan sent money to Philomena and Delia. They bought the tickets, found a steamer trunk at the St. Vincent de Paul Society, hired a van to take us to the pier in Manhattan, put us on the ship, said Good- bye and good riddance, and went away.\nThe ship pulled away from the dock. Mam said, That's the Statue of Liberty and that's Ellis Island where all the immigrants came in. Then she leaned over the side and vomited and the wind from the Atlantic blew it all over us and other happy people admiring the view. Passengers cursed and ran, seagulls came from all over the harbor and Mam hung limp and pale on the ship's rail.\nII\nIn a week we arrived at Moville, County Donegal, where we took a bus to Belfast and from there another bus to Toome in County Antrim. We left the trunk in a shop and set out to walk the two miles up the road to Grandpa McCourt's house. It was dark on the road, the dawn barely stirring on the hills beyond.\nDad carried the twins in his arms and they took turns crying with the hunger. Mam stopped every few minutes to sit and rest on the stone wall along the road. We sat with her and watched the sky turn red and then blue. Birds started to chirp and sing in the trees and as the dawn came up we saw strange creatures in the fields, standing, looking at us. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?\nCows, son.\nWhat are cows, Dad?\nCows are cows, son.\nWe walked farther along the brightening road and there were other\ncreatures in the fields, white furry creatures. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?\nSheep, son.\nWhat are sheep, Dad?\nMy father barked at him, Is there any end to your questions? Sheep are sheep, cows are cows, and that over there is a goat. A goat is a goat. The goat gives milk, the sheep gives wool, the cow gives everything. What else in God's name do you want to know?\nAnd Malachy yelped with fright because Dad never talked like that, never spoke sharply to us. He might get us up in the middle of the night and make us promise to die for Ireland but he never barked like this. Malachy ran to Mam and she said, There, there, love, don't cry. Your father is just worn out carrying the twins and 'tis hard answering all those questions when you're carting twins through the world.\nDad set the twins on the road and held out his arms to Malachy. Now the twins started to cry and Malachy clung to Mam, sobbing. The cows mooed, the sheep maaed, the goat ehehed, the birds twittered in the trees, and the beep beep of a motor car cut through everything. A man called from the motor car, Good Lord, what are you people doing on this road at this hour of an Easter Sunday morning?\nDad said, Good morning, Father.\nFather? I said. Dad, is that your father?\nMam said, Don't ask him any questions.\nDad said, No, no, this is a priest.\nMalachy said, What's a-? but Mam put her hand over his mouth. The priest had white hair and a white collar. He said, Where are\nyou going?\nDad said, Up the road to McCourts of Moneyglass, and the priest\ntook us in his motor car. He said he knew the McCourts, a fine family, good Catholics, some daily communicants, and he hoped he'd see us all at Mass, especially the little Yankees who didn't know what a priest was, God help us.\nAt the house my mother reaches for the gate latch. Dad says, No, no, not that way. Not the front gate. They use the front door only for visits from the priest or funerals.\nWe make our way around the house to the kitchen door. Dad pushes in the door and there's Grandpa McCourt drinking tea from a big mug and Grandma McCourt frying something.\nOch, says Grandpa, you're here.\nOch, we are, says Dad. He points to my mother. This is Angela, he says. Grandpa says, Och, you must be worn out, Angela. Grandma says nothing, she turns back to the frying pan. Grandpa leads us through the kitchen to a large room with a long table and chairs. He says, Sit down and have some tea. Would you like boxty?\nMalachy says, What's boxty?\nDad laughs. Pancakes, son. Pancakes made with potatoes.\nGrandpa says, We have eggs. It's Easter Sunday and you can have all\nthe eggs you can hold.\nWe have tea and boxty and boiled eggs and we all fall asleep. I\nwake up in a bed with Malachy and the twins. My parents are in another bed over by the window. Where am I? It's getting dark. This is not the ship. Mam snores hink, Dad snores honk. I get up and poke at Dad. I have to pee. He says, Use the chamber pot.\nWhat?\nUnder the bed, son. The chamber pot. It has roses on it and maidens cavorting in the glen. Pee in that, son.\nI want to ask him what he's talking about for even if I'm bursting I feel strange peeing into a pot with roses and maidens cavorting, whatever they are. We had nothing like this in Classon Avenue where Mrs. Leibowitz sang in the lavatory while we clutched ourselves in the hall.\nNow Malachy has to use the chamber pot but he wants to sit on it. Dad says, No, you can't do that, son. You have to go outside. When he says that I have to go, too, to sit. He leads us downstairs and through the big room where Grandpa is sitting reading by the fire and Grandma is dozing in her chair. It's dark outside, though the moon is bright enough for us to see where we're going. Dad opens the door of a little house that has a seat with a hole in it. He shows Malachy and me how to sit on the hole and how to wipe ourselves with squares of newspaper stuck on a nail. Then he tells us wait while he goes inside, closes the door and grunts. The moon is so bright I can look down the field and see the things called cows and sheep and I wonder why they don't go home.\nIn the house there are other people in the room with my grandparents. Dad says, These are your aunts: Emily, Nora, Maggie, Vera. Your aunt Eva is in Ballymena with children like you. My aunts are not like Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey, they nod their heads but they don't hug us or smile. Mam comes into the room with the twins and when\nDad tells his sisters, This is Angela and these are the twins, they just nod again.\nGrandma goes to the kitchen and soon we have bread and sausages and tea. The only one who speaks at the table is Malachy. He points his spoon at the aunts and asks their names again. When Mam tells him eat his sausage and be quiet his eyes fill with tears and Aunt Nora reaches over to comfort him. She says, There, there, and I wonder why everyone says there there when Malachy cries. I wonder what there there means.\nIt's quiet at the table till Dad says, Things are terrible in America. Grandma says, Och, aye. I read it in the paper. But they say Mr. Roosevelt is a good man and if you stayed you might have work by now.\nDad shakes his head and Grandma says, I don't know what you're going to do, Malachy. Things are worse here than they are in America. No work here and, God knows, we don't have room in this house for six more people.\nDad says, I thought I might get work on some of the farms. We could get a small place.\nWhere would you stay in the meantime? says Grandma. And how would you support yourself and your family?\nOch, I could go on the dole, I suppose.\nYou can't get off a ship from America and go on the dole, says Grandpa. They make you wait a while and what would you do while you're waiting?\nDad says nothing and Mam looks straight ahead at the wall.\nYou'd be better off in the Free State, says Grandma. Dublin is big and surely there's work there or in the farms around.\nYou're entitled to money from the IRA, too, says Grandpa. You did your bit and they've been handing out money to men all over the Free State. You could go to Dublin and ask for help. We can loan you the bus fare to Dublin. The twins can sit on your lap and you won't have to pay for them.\nDad says, Och, aye, and Mam stares at the wall with tears in her eyes.\nAfter we ate we went back to bed and next morning, all the grown- ups sat around looking sad. Soon a man came in a motor car and took us back down the road to the shop which had our trunk. They lifted the trunk up on the roof of a bus and we got into the bus. Dad said we were going to Dublin. Malachy said, What's Dublin? but no one answered him. Dad held Eugene on his lap and Mam held Oliver. Dad looked out at the fields and told me this is where Cuchulain liked to go for a walk. I asked him where Cuchulain hit the ball into the dog's mouth and he said a few miles away.\nMalachy said, Look, look, and we looked. It was a great silvery sheet of water and Dad said it was Lough Neagh, the largest lake in Ireland, the lake where Cuchulain used to swim after his great battles. Cuchulain would get so hot that when he jumped into Lough Neagh it boiled over and warmed the surrounding countryside for days. Some day we'd all come back and go swimming like Cuchulain himself. We'd fish for eels and fry them in a pan not like Cuchulain, who would pluck them from the lough and swallow them, wriggling, because there's great power in an eel.\nIs that right, Dad?\n'Tis.\nMam didn't look out the window at Lough Neagh. Her cheek rested on\ntop of Oliver's head and she stared at the floor of the bus.\nSoon the bus is rolling into a place where there are big houses, motor cars, horses pulling carts, people on bicycles and hundreds walking. Malachy is excited. Dad, Dad, where's the playground, the swings? I want to see Freddie Leibowitz.\nOch, son, you're in Dublin now, far from Classon Avenue. You're in Ireland, a long way from New York.\nWhen the bus stops the trunk is lifted down and set on the floor of the bus station. Dad tells Mam she can sit on a bench in the station while he goes to see the IRA man in a place called Terenure. He says there are lavatories in the station for the boys, he won't be long, he'll have money when he returns and we'll all have food. He tells me go with him and Mam says, No, I need him to help. But when Dad says, I'll need help carrying all that money, she laughs and says, All right, go with your Pop.\nYour Pop. That means she's in a good mood. If she says your father it means she's in a bad mood.\nDad holds my hand as I trot along beside him. He's a fast walker, it's a long way to Terenure and I'm hoping he'll stop and carry me the way he did with the twins in Toome. But he lopes along and says nothing except to ask people where Terenure is. In awhile he says we're in Terenure and now we have to find Mr. Charles Heggarty of the IRA. A man with a pink patch on his eye tells us we're on the right street, Charlie Heggarty lives at number fourteen, God blast him. The man tells Dad, I can see you're a man that did his bit. Dad says, Och, I did my bit, and the man says, I did me bit, too, and what did it get me but one eye less and a pension that wouldn't feed a canary.\nBut Ireland is free, says Dad, and that's a grand thing.\nFree, my arse, the man says. I think we were better off under the English. Good luck to you anyway, mister, for I think I know what you're here for.\nA woman opens the door at number fourteen. I'm afraid, she says, that Mr. Heggarty is busy. Dad tells her he just walked all the way from the middle of Dublin with his small son, that he left wife and three children waiting for him at the bus place, and if Mr. Heggarty is that busy then we'll wait for him on the doorstep.\nThe woman is back in a minute to say Mr. Heggarty has a little time to spare and would you come this way. Mr. Heggarty is sitting at a desk near a glowing fire. He says, What can I do for you? Dad stands before the desk and says, I have just returned from America with wife and four children. We have nothing. I fought with a Flying Column during the Troubles and I'm hoping you can help me now in the time of need.\nMr. Heggarty takes Dad's name and turns the pages of a big book on his desk. He shakes his head, No, no record of your service here. Dad makes a long speech. He tells Mr. Heggarty how he fought, where, when, how he had to be smuggled out of Ireland because of the price on his head, how he was raising his sons to love Ireland.\nMr. Heggarty says he's sorry but he can't be handing out money to every man who wanders in claiming he did his bit. Dad says to me, Remember this, Francis. This is the new Ireland. Little men in little chairs with little bits of paper. This is the Ireland men died for. Mr. Heggarty says he'll look into Dad's claim and he'll be sure to let him know what turns up. He'll let us have money to take the bus back into the city. Dad looks at the coins in Mr. Heggarty's hand and says, You could add to that and make the price of a pint.\nOh, it's the drink you want, is it?\nOne pint is hardly drink.\nYou'd walk the miles back and make the boy walk because you want a\npint, wouldn't you?\nWalking never killed anyone.\nI want you to leave this house, says Mr. Heggarty, or I'll call a\nguard, and you can be sure you'll never hear from me again. We're not handing out money to support the Guinness family.\nNight falls along the streets of Dublin. Children laugh and play under streetlights, mothers call from doorways, smells of cooking come at us all the way, through windows we see people around tables, eating. I'm tired and hungry and I want Dad to carry me but I know there's no use asking him now the way his face is tight and set. I let him hold my hand and I run to keep up with him till we reach the bus place where Mam is waiting with my brothers.\nThey're all asleep on the bench, my mother and three brothers. When Dad tells Mam there's no money she shakes her head and sobs, Oh, Jesus, what are we going to do? A man in a blue uniform comes over and asks her, What's up, missus? Dad tells him we're stranded there at the bus station, we have no money and no place to stay and the children are hungry. The man says he's going off duty now, he'll take us to the police barracks where he has to report anyway, and they'll see what can be done.\nThe man in uniform tells us we can call him guard. That's what you call policemen in Ireland. He asks us what you call policemen in America and Malachy says, cop. The guard pats him on the head and tells him he's a clever little Yankee.\nAt the police barracks the sergeant tells us we can spend the night. He's sorry but all he can offer is the floor. It's Thursday and the cells are filled with men who drank their dole money and wouldn't leave the pubs.\nThe guards give us hot sweet tea and thick slices of bread slathered with butter and jam and we're so happy we run around the barracks, playing. The guards say we're a great bunch of little Yanks and they'd like to take us home but I say, No, Malachy says, No, the twins say, No, No, and all the guards laugh. Men in cells reach out and pat our heads, they smell like Dad when he comes home singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley going to die. The men say, Jasus, will ye listen to them. They sound like bloody fillum stars. Did yez fall outa the sky or what? Women in cells at the other end tell Malachy he's gorgeous and the twins are dotes. One woman talks to me. C'mere, love, would you like a sweet? I nod, and she says, All right, put your hand out. She takes something sticky from her mouth and puts it on my hand. There you are now, she says, a nice bit of butterscotch. Put that in your mouth. I don't want to put it in my mouth because it's sticky and wet from her mouth but I don't know what you're supposed to do when a woman in a cell offers you sticky butterscotch and I'm about to put it in my mouth when a guard comes, takes the butterscotch and throws it back at the woman. You drunken hoor, he says, leave the child alone, and all the women laugh.\nThe sergeant gives my mother a blanket and she sleeps stretched out on a bench. The rest of us lie on the floor. Dad sits with his back to the wall, his eyes open under the peak of his cap, and he smokes when the guards give him cigarettes. The guard who threw the butterscotch at the woman says he's from Ballymena in the north and he talks with Dad about people they know there and in other places like Cushendall and Toome. The\nguard says he'll have a pension some day and he'll live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away. Eels, he says, eels galore. Jasus, I love a fried eel. I ask Dad, Is this Cuchulain? and the guard laughs till his face turns red. Ah, Mother o' God, did yez hear this? The lad wants to know if I'm Cuchulain. A little Yank and he knows all about Cuchulain.\nDad says, No, he's not Cuchulain but he's a fine man who will live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away.\n****\nDad is shaking me. Up, Francis, up. It is noisy in the barracks. A boy mopping the floor is singing, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this, Could it be true, someone like you Could love me, love me?\nI tell him that's my mother's song and he's to stop singing it but he just puffs on his cigarette and walks away and I wonder why people have to sing other people's songs. Men and women coming out of the cells are yawning and grunting. The woman who offered me the butterscotch stops and says, I had a drop taken, child. I'm sorry I made a fool of you, but the guard from Ballymena tells her, Move on, you oul' hoor, before I lock you up again.\nOh, lock me up, she says. In, out. What does it matter, you blue arsed bastard.\nMam is sitting up on the bench, the blanket wrapped around her. A woman with gray hair brings her a mug of tea and tells her, Sure, I'm the sergeant's wife and he said you might need help. Would you like a nice soft-boiled egg, missus?\nMam shakes her head, no.\nAh, now, missus, surely you should have a nice egg in your condition.\nBut Mam shakes her head and I wonder how she can say no to a soft- boiled egg when there's nothing in the world like it.\nAll right, ma'am, says the sergeant's wife, a bit of toast, then, and something for the children and your poor husband.\nShe goes back to another room and soon there's tea and bread. Dad drinks his tea but gives us his bread and Mam says, Will you eat your bread, for God's sake. You won't be much use to us falling down with the hunger. He shakes his head and asks the sergeant's wife is there any chance of a cigarette. She brings him the cigarette and tells Mam the guards in the barracks have taken up a collection to pay our train fares to Limerick. There will be a motor car to pick up our trunk and leave us at Kingsbridge Railway Station and, You'll be in Limerick in three or four hours.\nMam puts up her arms and hugs the sergeant's wife. God bless you and your husband and all the guards, Mam says. I don't know what we'd do without you. God knows 'tis a lovely thing to be back among our own.\n'Tis the least we could do, says the sergeant's wife. These are lovely children you have and I'm from Cork meself and I know what 'tis to be in Dublin without two pennies to rub together.\nDad sits at the other end of the bench, smoking his cigarette, drinking his tea. He stays that way till the motor car comes to take us through the streets of Dublin. Dad asks the driver if he'd mind going by way of the G. P. O. and the driver says, Is it a stamp you want or what? No, says Dad. I hear they put up a new statue of Cuchulain to honor the men who died in 1916 and I'd like to show it to my son here who has a great admiration for Cuchulain.\nThe driver says he has no notion of who this Cuchulain was but he wouldn't mind stopping one bit. He might come in himself and see what the commotion is all about for he hasn't been in the G. P. O. since he was a boy and the English nearly wrecked it with their big guns firing up from the Liffey River. He says you'll see the bullet holes all over the front and they should be left there to remind the Irish of English perfidy. I ask the man what's perfidy and he says ask your father and I would but we're stopping outside a big building with columns and that's the G. P. O.\nMam stays in the motor car while we follow the driver into the G. P. O. There he is, he says, there's your man Cuchulain.\nAnd I feel tears coming because I'm looking at him at last, Cuchulain, there on his pedestal in the G. P. O. He's golden and he has long hair, his head is hanging and there's a big bird perched on his shoulder.\nThe driver says, Now what in God's name is this all about? What's this fellow doin' with the long hair and the bird on his shoulder? And will you kindly tell me, mister, what this has to do with the men of 1916?\nDad says, Cuchulain fought to the end like the men of Easter Week. His enemies were afraid to go near him till they were sure he was dead and when the bird landed on him and drank his blood they knew.\nWell, says the driver, 'tis a sad day for the men of Ireland when they need a bird to tell them a man is dead. I think we better go now or we'll be missing that train to Limerick.\nThe sergeant's wife said she'd send a telegram to Grandma to meet us in Limerick and there she was on the platform, Grandma, with white hair, sour eyes, a black shawl, and no smile for my mother or any of us, even my brother, Malachy, who had the big smile and the sweet white teeth. Mam pointed to Dad. This is Malachy, she said, and Grandma nodded and looked away. She called two boys who were hanging around the railway station and paid them to carry the trunk. The boys had shaved heads, snotty noses, and no shoes and we followed them through the streets of Limerick. I asked Mam why they had no hair and she said their heads were shaved so that the lice would have no place to hide. Malachy said, What's a lice? and Mam said, Not lice. One of them is a louse. Grandma said, Will ye stop it! What kind o' talk is this? The boys whistled and laughed and trotted along as if they had shoes and Grandma told them, Stop that laughin' or 'tis droppin' an' breakin' that trunk ye'll be. They stopped the whistling and laughing and we followed them into a park with a tall pillar and a statue in the middle and grass so green it dazzled you.\nDad carried the twins, Mam carried a bag in one hand and held Malachy's hand with the other. When she stopped every few minutes to catch her breath, Grandma said, Are you still smokin' them fags? Them fags will be the death of you. There's enough consumption in Limerick without people smokin' fags on top of it an'\n'tis a rich man's foolishness.\nAlong the path through the park there were hundreds of flowers of different colors that excited the twins. They pointed and made squeaky noises and we laughed, everyone except Grandma, who pulled her shawl over her head. Dad stopped and put the twins down so that they could be closer to the flowers. He said, Flowers, and they ran back and forth, pointing, trying to say Flowers. One of the boys with the trunk said, God, are they Americans? and Mam said, They are. They were born in New York. All the\nboys were born in New York. The boy said to the other boy, God, they're Americans. They put the trunk down and stared at us and we stared back at them till Grandma said, Are ye goin' to stand here all day lookin' at flowers an' gawkin' at each other? And we all moved on again, out of the park, down a narrow lane and into another lane to Grandma's house.\nThere is a row of small houses on each side of the lane and Grandma lives in one of the small houses. Her kitchen has a shiny polished black iron range with a fire glowing in the grate. There is a table along the wall under the window and a press opposite with cups and saucers and vases. This press is always locked and she keeps the key in her purse because you're not supposed to use anything in there unless someone dies or returns from foreign parts or there's a visit by a priest.\nThere is a picture on the wall by the range of a man with long brown hair and sad eyes. He is pointing to his chest where there is a big heart with flames coming out of it. Mam tells us, That's the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and I want to know why the man's heart is on fire and why doesn't He throw water on it? Grandma says, Don't these children know anything about their religion? and Mam tells her it's different in America. Grandma says the Sacred Heart is everywhere and there's no excuse for that kind of ignorance.\nUnder the picture of the man with the burning heart there is a shelf with a red glass holding a flickering candle and next to it a small statue. Mam tells us, That's the Baby Jesus, the Infant of Prague, and if ye ever need anything pray to Him.\nMalachy says, Mam, could I tell Him I'm hungry, and Mam puts her finger to her lips.\nGrandma grumbles around the kitchen making tea and telling Mam to cut the loaf of bread and don't make the cuts too thick. Mam sits by the table with her breath coming hard and says she'll cut the bread in a minute. Dad takes the knife and starts slicing the bread and you can see Grandma doesn't like that. She frowns at him but says nothing even though he makes thick slices.\nThere aren't enough chairs for everyone so I sit on the stairs with my brothers to have bread and tea. Dad and Mam sit at the table and Grandma sits under the Sacred Heart with her mug of tea. She says, I don't know under God what I'm goin' to do with ye. There is no room in this house. There isn't room for even one of ye.\nMalachy says, Ye, ye, and starts to giggle and I say, Ye, ye, and the twins say, Ye, ye, and we're laughing so hard we can hardly eat our bread.\nGrandma glares at us. What are ye laughin' at? There's nothin' to laugh at in this house. Ye better behave yeerselves before I go over to\nye.\nShe won't stop saying Ye, and now Malachy is helpless with\nlaughter, spewing out his bread and tea, his face turning red.\nDad says, Malachy and the rest of you, stop it. But Malachy can't, he goes on laughing till Dad says, Come over here. He rolls up Malachy's\nsleeve and raises his hand to slap his arm.\nAre you going to behave yourself?\nMalachy's eyes fill with tears and he nods, I will, because Dad\nnever raised his hand like that before. Dad says, Be a good boy and go sit with your brothers, and he pulls down the sleeve and pats Malachy on the head.\nThat night Mam's sister, Aunt Aggie, came home from her job in the clothing factory. She was big like the MacNamara sisters, and she had flaming red hair. She wheeled a large bicycle into the little room behind the kitchen and came out to her supper. She was living in Grandma's because she had a fight with her husband, Pa Keating, who told her, when he had drink taken, You're a great fat cow, go home to your mother. That's what Grandma told Mam and that's why there was no room for us in Grandma's house. She had herself, Aunt Aggie, and her son Pat, who was my uncle and who was out selling newspapers.\nAunt Aggie complained when Grandma told her Mam would have to sleep with her that night. Grandma said, Oh, will you shut your gob. 'Tis only for one night an' that won't kill you an' if you don't like it you can go back to your husband where you belong anyway instead of runnin' home to me. Jesus, Mary an' Holy St. Joseph, look at this house- you an' Pat an' Angela and her clatther of Americans. Will I have any peace in the latter end of my life?\nShe spread coats and rags on the floor of the little back room and we slept there with the bicycle. Dad stayed on a chair in the kitchen, took us to the lavatory in the backyard when we needed it, and in the night hushed the twins when they cried from the cold.\nIn the morning, Aunt Aggie came for her bicycle telling us, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of my way?\nWhen she left, Malachy kept saying, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of the way, will ye? and I could hear Dad laughing out in the kitchen till Grandma came down the stairs and he had to tell Malachy be quiet.\nThat day Grandma and Mam went out and found a furnished room on Windmill Street where Aunt Aggie had a flat with her husband, Pa Keating. Grandma paid the rent, ten shillings for two weeks. She gave Mam money for food, loaned us a kettle, a pot, a frying pan, knives and spoons, jam jars to be used for mugs, a blanket and a pillow. She said that was all she could afford anymore, that Dad would have to get up off his arse, get a job, go on the dole, go for the charity at the St. Vincent de Paul Society or go on the relief.\nThe room had a fireplace where we could boil water for our tea or an egg in case we ever came into money. We had a table and three chairs and a bed, which Mam said was the biggest she had ever seen. We were glad of the bed that night, worn out after nights on floors in Dublin and in Grandma's. It didn't matter that there were six of us in the bed, we were together, away from grandmothers and guards, Malachy could say ye ye ye and we could laugh as much as we liked.\nDad and Mam lay at the head of the bed, Malachy and I at the bottom, the twins wherever they could find comfort. Malachy made us laugh again. Ye, ye, ye, he said, and oy oy oy, and then fell asleep. Mam made the little hink hink snore sound that told us she was sleeping. In the moonlight I could look up the length of the bed and see Dad still awake and when Oliver cried in his sleep Dad reached for him and held him. Whisht, he said. Whisht.\nThen Eugene sat up, screaming, tearing at himself. Ah, ah, Mommy, Mommy. Dad sat up. What? What's up, son? Eugene went on crying and when Dad leaped from the bed and turned on the gaslight we saw the fleas, leaping, jumping, fastened to our flesh. We slapped at them and slapped but they hopped from body to body, hopping, biting. We tore at the bites till they bled. We jumped from the bed, the twins crying, Mam moaning,\nOh, Jesus, will we have no rest! Dad poured water and salt into a jam jar and dabbed at our bites. The salt burned but he said we'd feel better\nsoon.\nMam sat by the fireplace with the twins on her lap. Dad pulled on\nhis trousers and dragged the mattress off the bed and out to the street. He filled the kettle and the pot with water, stood the mattress against the wall, pounded it with a shoe, told me to keep pouring water on the ground to drown the fleas dropping there. The Limerick moon was so bright I could see bits of it shimmering in the water and I wanted to scoop up moon bits but how could I with the fleas leaping on my legs. Dad kept pounding with the shoe and I had to run back through the house to the backyard tap for more water in the kettle and the pot. Mam said, Look at you. Your shoes are drenched and you'll catch your death and your father will surely get the pneumonia without a shoe to his foot.\nA man on a bicycle stopped and wanted to know why Dad was beating that mattress. Mother o' God, he said, I never heard such a cure for fleas. Do you know that if a man could jump like a flea one lep would take him halfway to the moon? The thing to do is this, when you go back inside with that mattress stick it on the bed upside down and that will confuse the little buggers. They won't know where they are and they'll be biting the mattress or each other, which is the best cure of all. After they bite the human being they have the frenzy, you know, for there are other fleas around them that also bit the human being and the smell of the blood is too much for them and they go out of their minds. They're a right bloody torment an' I should know for didn't I grow up in Limerick, down in the Irishtown, an' the fleas there were so plentiful an' forward they'd sit on the toe of your boot an' discuss Ireland's woeful history with you. It is said there were no fleas in ancient Ireland, that they were brought in be the English to drive us out of our wits entirely, an'I wouldn't put it past the English. An'isn't it a very curious thing that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland an' the English brought in the fleas. For centuries Ireland was a lovely peaceful place, snakes gone, not a flea to be found. You could stroll the four green fields of Ireland without fear of snakes an' have a good night's sleep with no fleas to bother you. Them snakes were doin' no harm, they wouldn't bother you unless you cornered them an' they lived off other creatures that move under bushes an'such places, whereas the flea sucks the blood from you mornin' noon an' night for that's his nature an' he can't help himself. I hear for a fact that places that have snakes galore have no fleas. Arizona, for instance. You're forever hearing about the snakes of Arizona but when did you ever hear of fleas in Arizona? Good luck to you. I have to be careful standin' here for if one of them gets on my clothes I might as well invite his whole family home. They multiply faster than Hindus.\nDad said, You wouldn't by any chance have a cigarette, would you?\nA cigarette? Oh, sure, of course. Here you are. Aren't I nearly destroyed from the fags myself. The oul' hacking cough, you know. So powerful it nearly knocks me off the bicycle. I can feel that cough stirring in me solar plexus an' workin' its way up through me entrails till the next thing it takes off the top o' me head.\nHe struck a match on a box, lit a cigarette for himself and held out the match for Dad. Of course, he said, you're bound to have the cough when you live in Limerick because this is the capital city of the weak chest and the weak chest leads to the consumption. If all the people that has consumption in Limerick were to die this would be a ghost town,\nthough I don't have consumption meself. No, this cough was a present from the Germans. He paused, puffed on his cigarette, and struggled with a cough. Bejesus, excuse the language, but the fags'll get me in the end. Well, I'll leave you now to the mattress an' remember what I told you, confuse the little buggers.\nHe wobbled away on his bicycle, the cigarette dangling from his mouth, the cough racking his body. Dad said, Limerickmen talk too much. Come on, we'll put this mattress back and see if there's any sleep in this night.\nMam sat by the fireplace with the twins asleep on her lap, and Malachy lay curled up on the floor by her feet. She said, Who was that you were talking to? It sounded very like Pa Keating, Aggie's husband. I could tell by the cough. He got that cough in France in the war when he swallowed the gas.\nWe slept the rest of that night, and in the morning we saw where the fleas had feasted, our flesh pink with flea welts and bright with the blood of our scratches.\nMam made tea and fried bread, and once more Dad dabbed at our bites with the salty water. He hauled the mattress outside again to the backyard. On a cold day like this the fleas would surely freeze to death and we'd all have a good night's sleep.\nA few days later when we're settled into the room Dad is shaking me out of my dreams. Up, Francis, up. Put on your clothes and run over for your aunt Aggie. Your mother needs her. Hurry.\nMam is moaning in the bed, her face pure white. Dad has Malachy and the twins out of the bed and sitting on the floor by the dead fire. I run across the street and knock on Aunt Aggie's door till Uncle Pat Keating comes coughing and grumbling, What's up? What's up?\nMy mother is moaning in the bed. I think she's sick.\nNow Aunt Aggie comes grumbling. Ye are nothing but trouble since ye came from America.\nLeave him alone, Aggie, he's only a child that's doing what he's told.\nShe tells Uncle Pa go back to bed, that he has to go to work in the morning not like some from the North that she won't mention. He says, No, no, I'm coming. There's something wrong with Angela.\nDad tells me sit over there with my brothers. I don't know what's up with Mam because everyone is whispering and I can barely hear Aunt\nAggie\nPa is\nabout\nnever looks at him.\ntelling Uncle Pa the child is lost run for the ambulance and Uncle out the door, Aunt Aggie telling Mam you can say what you like Limerick but the ambulance is fast. She doesn't talk to my father,\nMalachy says, Dad, is Mammy sick?\nOch, she'll be all right, son. She has to see the doctor.\nI wonder what child is lost because we're all here, one two three\nfour of us, not a lost child anywhere and why can't they tell me what's wrong with my mother. Uncle Pa comes back and the ambulance is right behind him. A man comes in with a stretcher and after they carry Mam away there are blood spots on the floor by the bed. Malachy bit his tongue and there was blood and the dog on the street had blood and he died. I want to ask Dad to tell me if Mam will be gone forever like my sister Margaret but he's going with Mam and there's no use asking Aunt Aggie anything for fear she'd bite your head off. She wipes away the blood spots and tells us get back into bed and stay there till Dad comes home.\nIt's the middle of the night and the four of us are warm in the bed and we fall asleep till Dad comes home and tells us Mam is nice and comfortable in the hospital and she'll be home in no time.\nLater, Dad goes to the Labour Exchange for the dole. There is no hope of a laboring man with a North of Ireland accent getting a job in Limerick.\nWhen he returns, he tells Mam we'll be getting nineteen shillings a week. She says that's just enough for all of us to starve on. Nineteen shillings for six of us? That's less than four dollars in American money and how are we supposed to live on that? What are we to do when we have to pay rent in a fortnight? If the rent for this room is five shillings a week we'll have fourteen shillings for food and clothes and coal to boil the water for the tea.\nDad shakes his head, sips his tea from a jam jar, stares out the window and whistles \"The Boys of Wexford. \" Malachy and Oliver clap their hands and dance around the room and Dad doesn't know whether to whistle or smile because you can't do both and he can't help himself. He has to stop and smile and pat Oliver's head and then go back to the whistling. Mam smiles, too, but it's a very quick smile and when she looks into the ashes you can see the worry where the corners of her mouth turn down.\nNext day she tells Dad to mind the twins and takes Malachy and me with her to the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We stand in a queue with women wearing black shawls. They ask our names and smile when we talk. They say, Lord above, would you listen to the little Yankees, and they wonder why Mam in her American coat would be looking for charity since there's hardly enough for the poor people of Limerick without Yanks coming over and taking the bread out of their mouths.\nMam tells them a cousin gave her that coat in Brooklyn, that her husband has no work, that she has other children at home, twin boys. The women sniff and pull their shawls about them, they have their own troubles. Mam tells them she had to leave America because she couldn't stand it after her baby girl died. The women sniff again but now it's because Mam is crying. Some say they lost little ones, too, and there's nothing worse in the world, you could live as long as Methuselem's wife but you never get over it. No man can ever know what it is to be a mother that has lost a child, not if the man lived longer than two Methuselems.\nThey all have a good cry till a red-haired woman passes a little box around. The women pick something from the box between their fingers and stuff it up their noses. A young woman sneezes and the red-haired woman laughs. Ah, sure, Biddy, you're not able for that snuff. Come here, little Yankee boys, have a pinch. She plants the brown stuff in our nostrils and we sneeze so hard the women stop crying and laugh till they have to wipe their eyes with their shawls. Mam tells us, That's good for ye, 'twill clear yeer heads.\nThe young woman, Biddy, tells Mam we're two lovely boys. She points at Malachy. That little fella with the goldy ringlet, isn't he gorgeous? He could be a film star with Shirley Temple. And Malachy smiles and warms up the queue.\nThe woman with the snuff says to Mam, Missus, I don't want to be forward but I think you should be sitting down for we heard about your\nloss.\nAnother woman worries, Ah, no, they don't like that. Who don't like what?\nAh, sure, Nora Molloy, the Society don't like us sittin' on the steps. They want us to be standin' respectful against the wall.\nThey can kiss my arse, says Nora, the red-haired woman. Sit down there, missus, on that step an' I'll sit next to you an' if there's one word out of the St. Vincent de Paul Society I'll take the face off 'em, so I will. Do you smoke, missus?\nI do, says Mam, but I don't have them.\nNora takes a cigarette from a pocket in her apron, breaks it, and offers half to Mam.\nThe worried woman says, They don't like that either. They say every fag you smoke is taking food from the mouth of your child. Mr. Quinlivan inside is dead against it. He says if you have money for the fags you have money for food.\nQuinlivan can kiss my arse, too, the grinny oul' bastard. Is he going to begrudge us a puff of a fag, the only comfort we have in the world?\nA door opens at the end of the hall and a man appears. Are any of ye waiting for children's boots?\nWomen raise their hands, I am. I am.\nWell, the boots are all gone. Ye'll have to come back next month. But my Mikey needs boots for school.\nThey're all gone, I told you.\nBut 'tis freezin' abroad, Mr. Quinlivan.\nThe boots are all gone. Nothing I can do. What's this? Who's\nsmoking?\nNora waves her cigarette. I am, she says, and enjoying it down to\nthe last ash.\nEvery puff you take, he starts.\nI know, she says, I'm taking food out of the mouths of my children. You're insolent, woman. You'll get no charity here.\nIs that a fact? Well, Mr. Quinlivan, if I don't get it here I know\nwhere I will.\nWhat are you talking about?\nI'll go to the Quakers. They'll give me the charity.\nMr. Quinlivan steps toward Nora and points a finger. Do you know\nwhat we have here? We have a souper in our midst. We had the soupers in the Famine. The Protestants went round telling good Catholics that if they gave up their faith and turned Protestant they'd get more soup than their bellies could hold and, God help us, some Catholics took the soup, and were ever after known as soupers and lost their immortal souls doomed to the deepest part of hell. And you, woman, if you go to the Quakers you'll lose your immortal soul and the souls of your children.\nother\nThen, Mr. Quinlivan, you'll have to save us, won't you?\nHe stares at her and she stares back at him. His eyes wander to the\nwomen. One puts her hand to her mouth to smother a laugh.\nWhat are you tittering about? he barks.\nOh, nothing, Mr. Quinlivan. Honest to God.\nI'm telling ye once more, no boots. And he slams the door behind\nhim.\nOne by one the women are called into the room. When Nora comes out\nshe's smiling and waving a piece of paper. Boots, she says. Three pairs I'm gettin' for my children. Threaten the men in there with the Quakers and they'll give you the drawers off their arses.\nWhen Mam is called she brings Malachy and me in with her. We stand before a table where three men are sitting asking questions. Mr. Quinlivan starts to say something but the man in the middle says, Enough out of you, Quinlivan. If we left it up to you we'd have the poor people of Limerick jumping into the arms of the Protestants.\nHe turns to Mam, he wants to know where she got that fine red coat. She tells him what she told the women outside and when she comes to the death of Margaret she shakes and sobs. She tells the men she's very sorry for crying like that but it was only a few months ago and she's not over it yet, not even knowing where her baby was buried if she was buried at all, not knowing even if she was baptized itself because she was so weak from having the four boys she didn't have the energy to be going to the church for the baptism and it's a heart scald to think Margaret might be in Limbo forever with no hope of her ever seeing the rest of us whether we're in heaven, hell, or Purgatory itself.\nMr. Quinlivan brings her his chair. Ah, now, missus. Ah, now. Sit down, will you. Ah, now.\nThe other men look at the table, the ceiling. The man in the middle says he's giving Mam a docket to get a week's groceries at McGrath's shop on Parnell Street. There will be tea, sugar, flour, milk, butter and a separate docket for a bag of coal from Sutton's coal yard on the Dock Road.\nThe third man says, Of course you won't be getting this every week, missus. We will be visiting your house to see if there's a real need. We have to do that, missus, so we can review your claim.\nMam wipes her face on the back of her sleeve and takes the docket. She tells the men, God bless you for your kindness. They nod and look at the table, the ceiling, the walls and tell her send in the next woman.\nThe women outside tell Mam, When you go to McGrath's, keep an eye on the oul' bitch for she'll cheat you on the weight. She'll put stuff on a paper on the scale with the paper hanging down on her side behind the counter where she thinks you can't see it. She'll pull on that paper so that you're lucky if you get half of what you're supposed to get. And she has pictures of the Virgin Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus all over the shop, and she's forever on her knees abroad in St. Joseph's chapel clackin' her rosary beads an' breathing like a virgin martyr, the oul' bitch.\nNora says, I'll go with you, missus. I'm on to the same Mrs. McGrath and I'll know if she's cheating you.\nShe leads the way to the shop in Parnell Street. The woman behind the counter is pleasant to Mam in her American coat till Mam shows the St. Vincent de Paul docket. The woman says, I don't know what you're doing here at this hour of the day. I never serve the charity cases before six in the evening. But this is your first time and I'll make an exception.\nShe says to Nora, Do you have a docket, too?\nNo. I'm a friend helping this poor family with their first docket from the St. Vincent de Paul.\nThe woman lays a sheet of newspaper on the scale and pours on flour from a large bag. When she finishes pouring, she says, There's a pound of flour.\nI don't think so, says Nora. That's a very small pound of flour. The woman flushes and glares, Are you accusin' me?\nAh, no, Mrs. McGrath, says Nora. I think there was a little accident there the way your hip was pressed against that paper and you didn't even know the paper was pulled down a bit. Oh, God, no. A woman like you that's forever on her knees before the Virgin Mary is an inspiration to us all and is that your money I see on the floor there?\nMrs. McGrath steps back quickly and the needle on the scale jumps and quivers. What money? she says, till she looks at Nora, and knows. Nora smiles. Must be a trick of the shadows, she says, and smiles at the scale. There was a mistake right enough for that shows barely half a pound of flour.\nThat scale gives me more trouble, says Mrs. McGrath.\nI'm sure it does, says Nora.\nBut my conscience is clear before God, says Mrs. McGrath.\nI'm sure it is, says Nora, and you're admired by one and all at the\nSt. Vincent de Paul Society and the Legion of Mary.\nI try to be a good Catholic.\nTry? God knows 'tis little trying you'd have for you're well known\nfor having a kind heart and I was wondering if you could spare a couple of sweets for the little boys here.\nWell, now, I'm not a millionaire, but here...\nGod bless you, Mrs. McGrath, and I know it's asking a lot but could you possibly lend me a couple of cigarettes?\nWell, now, they're not on the docket. I'm not here to supply luxuries.\nIf you could see your way, missus, I'd be sure to mention your kindness to the St. Vincent de Paul.\nAll right, all right, says Mrs. McGrath. Here. One time for the cigarettes and one time only.\nGod bless you, says Nora, and I'm sorry you had so much trouble with that scale.\nOn the way home we stopped in the People's Park and sat on a bench while Malachy and I sucked on our sweets and Mam and Nora smoked their cigarettes. The smoking brought on Nora's cough and she told Mam the fags would kill her in the end, that there was a touch of consumption in her family and no one lived to a ripe old age, though who would want to in Limerick, a place where you could look around and the first thing you noticed was a scarcity of gray hairs, all the gray hairs either in the graveyard or across the Atlantic working on railroads or sauntering around in police uniforms.\nYou're lucky, missus, that you saw a bit of the world. Oh, God, I'd give anything to see New York, people dancing up and down Broadway without a care. No, I had to go and fall for a boozer with the charm, Peter Molloy, a champion pint drinker that had me up the pole and up the aisle when I was barely seventeen. I was ignorant, missus. We grew up ignorant in Limerick, so we did, knowing feck all about anything and signs on, we're mothers before we're women. And there's nothing here but rain and oul' biddies saying the rosary. I'd give me teeth to get out, go to America or even England itself. The champion pint drinker is always on the dole and sometimes he even drinks that and drives me so demented I wind up in the lunatic asylum.\nShe drew on her cigarette and gagged, coughing till her body rocked back and forth, and in between the coughs she whimpered, Jesus, Jesus. When the cough died away she said she had to go home and take her medicine. She said, I'll see you next week, missus, at the St. Vincent de\nPaul. If you're stuck for anything send a message to me at Vize's Field. Ask anyone for the wife of Peter Molloy, champion pint drinker.\nEugene is sleeping under a coat on the bed. Dad sits by the fireplace with Oliver on his lap. I wonder why Dad is telling Oliver a Cuchulain story. He knows the Cuchulain stories are mine, but when I look at Oliver I don't mind. His cheeks are bright red, he's staring into the dead fire, and you can see he has no interest in Cuchulain. Mam puts her hand on his forehead. I think he has a fever, she says. I wish I had an onion and I'd boil it in milk and pepper. That's good for the fever. But even if I had what would I boil the milk on? We need coal for that fire.\nShe gives Dad the docket for the coal down the Dock Road. He takes me with him but it's dark and all the coal yards are closed.\nWhat are we going to do now, Dad?\nI don't know, son.\nAhead of us women in shawls and small children are picking up coal\nalong the road.\nThere, Dad, there's coal.\nOch, no, son. We won't pick coal off the road. We're not beggars. He tells Mam the coal yards are closed and we'll have to drink milk\nand eat bread tonight, but when I tell her about the women on the road she passes Eugene to him.\nIf you're too grand to pick coal off the road I'll put on my coat and go down the Dock Road.\nShe gets a bag and takes Malachy and me with her. Beyond the Dock Road there is something wide and dark with lights glinting in it. Mam says that's the River Shannon. She says that's what she missed most of all in America, the River Shannon. The Hudson was lovely but the Shannon sings. I can't hear the song but my mother does and that makes her happy. The other women are gone from the Dock Road and we search for the bits of coal that drop from lorries. Mam tells us gather anything that burns, coal, wood, cardboard, paper. She says, There are them that burn the horse droppings but we're not gone that low yet. When her bag is nearly full she says, Now we have to find an onion for Oliver. Malachy says he'll find one but she tells him, No, you don't find onions on the road, you get them in shops.\nThe minute he sees a shop he cries out, There's a shop, and runs\nin.\nOonyen, he says. Oonyen for Oliver.\nMam runs into the shop and tells the women behind the counter, I'm\nsorry. The woman says, Lord, he's a dote. Is he an American or what? Mam says he is. The woman smiles and shows two teeth, one on each\nside of her upper gum. A dote, she says, and look at them gorgeous goldy curls. And what is it he wants now? A sweet?\nAh, no, says Mam. An onion.\nThe woman laughs, An onion? I never heard a child wanting an onion before. Is that what they like in America?\nMam says, I just mentioned I wanted to get an onion for my other child that's sick. Boil the onion in milk, you know.\nTrue for you, missus. You can't beat the onion boiled in milk. And look, little boy, here's a sweet for yourself and one for the other little boy, the brother, I suppose.\nMam says, Ah, sure, you shouldn't. Say thank you, boys.\nThe woman says, Here's a nice onion for the sick child, missus.\nMam says, Oh, I can't buy the onion now, missus. I don't have a penny on me.\nI'm giving you the onion, missus. Let it never be said a child went sick in Limerick for want of an onion. And don't forget to sprinkle in a little pepper. Do you have pepper, missus?\nAh, no, I don't but I should be getting it any day now.\nWell, here, missus. Pepper and a little salt. Do the child all the good in the world.\nMam says, God bless you, ma'am, and her eyes are watery.\nDad is walking back and forth with Oliver in his arms and Eugene is playing on the floor with a pot and a spoon. Dad says, Did you get the onion?\nI did, says Mam, and more. I got coal and the way of lighting it. I knew you would. I said a prayer to St. Jude. He's my favorite saint, patron of desperate cases.\nI got the coal. I got the onion, no help from St. Jude.\nDad says, You shouldn't be picking up coal off the road like a common beggar. It isn't right. Bad example for the boys.\nThen you should have sent St. Jude down the Dock Road.\nMalachy says, I'm hungry, and I'm hungry, too, but Mam says, Ye'll wait till Oliver has his onion boiled in milk.\nShe gets the fire going, cuts the onion in half, drops it in the boiling milk with a little butter and sprinkles the milk with pepper. She takes Oliver on her lap and tries to feed him but he turns away and looks into the fire.\nAh, come on, love, she says. Good for you. Make you big and strong.\nHe tightens his mouth against the spoon. She puts the pot down, rocks him till he's asleep, lays him on the bed and tells the rest of us be quiet or she'll demolish us. She slices the other half of the onion and fries it in butter with slices of bread. She lets us sit on the floor around the fire where we eat the fried bread and sip at the scalding sweet tea in jam jars. She says, That fire is good and bright so we can turn off that gaslight till we get money for the meter.\nThe fire makes the room warm and with the flames dancing in the coal you can see faces and mountains and valleys and animals leaping. Eugene falls asleep on the floor and Dad lifts him to the bed beside Oliver. Mam puts the boiled onion pot up on the mantelpiece for fear a mouse or rat might be at it. She says she's tired out from the day, the Vincent de Paul Society, Mrs. McGrath's shop, the search for coal down the Dock Road, the worry over Oliver not wanting the boiled onion, and if he's like this tomorrow she's taking him to the doctor, and now she's going to bed.\nSoon we're all in bed and if there's the odd flea I don't mind because it's warm in the bed with the six of us and I love the glow of the fire the way it dances on the walls and ceiling and makes the room go red and black, red and black, till it dims to white and black and all you can hear is a little cry from Oliver turning in my mother's arms.\nIn the morning Dad is lighting the fire, making tea, cutting the bread. He's already dressed and he's telling Mam hurry up and get dressed. He says to me, Francis, your little brother Oliver is sick and we're taking him to the hospital. You are to be a good boy and take care of your two brothers. We'll be back soon.\nMam says, When we're out go easy with that sugar. We're not millionaires.\nWhen Mam picks up Oliver and wraps him in a coat Eugene stands on the bed. I want Ollie, he says. Ollie play.\nOllie will be back soon, she says, and you can play with him. Now you can play with Malachy and Frank.\nOllie, Ollie, I want Ollie.\nHe follows Oliver with his eyes and when they're gone he sits on the bed looking out the window. Malachy says, Genie, Genie, we have bread, we have tea. Sugar on your bread, Genie. He shakes his head and pushes away the bread Malachy is offering. He crawls to the place where Oliver slept with Mam, puts his head down and stares out the window.\nGrandma is at the door. I heard your father and mother were running down Henry Street with the child in their arms. Now where are they gone to?\nOliver is sick, I said. He wouldn't eat the boiled onion in milk. What are you blatherin' about?\nWouldn't eat the boiled onion and got sick.\nAnd who's minding ye?\nI am.\nAnd what's up with the child in the bed? What's That's Eugene. He misses Oliver. They're twins. I know they're twins. That child looks starved.\nhis name?\nHave ye any\nporridge here?\nWhat's porridge? says Malachy.\nJesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! What's porridge! Porridge is\nporridge. That's what porridge is. Ye are the most ignorant bunch o' Yanks I ever seen. Come on, put on yeer clothes and we'll go across the street to your aunt Aggie. She's there with the husband, Pa Keating, and she'll give ye some porridge.\nShe picks up Eugene, wraps him in her shawl and we cross the street to Aunt Aggie's. She's living with Uncle Pa again because he said she wasn't a fat cow after all.\nDo you have any porridge? Grandma says to Aunt Aggie.\nPorridge? Am I supposed to be feeding porridge to a crowd of Yanks? Pity about you, says Grandma. It won't kill you to give them a\nlittle porridge.\nAnd I suppose they'll be wanting sugar and milk on top of\neverything or they might be banging on my door looking for an egg if you don't mind. I don't know why we have to pay for Angela's mistakes.\nJesus, says Grandma, 'tis a good thing you didn't own that stable in Bethlehem or the Holy Family would still be wanderin' the world crumblin' with the hunger.\nGrandma pushes her way past Aunt Aggie, puts Eugene on a chair near the fire and makes the porridge. A man comes in from another room. He has black curly hair and his skin is black and I like his eyes because they're very blue and ready to smile. He's Aunt Aggie's husband, the man who stopped the night we were attacking the fleas and told us all about fleas and snakes, the man with the cough he got from swallowing gas in the war.\nMalachy says, Why are you all black? and Uncle Pa Keating laughs and coughs so hard he has to ease himself with a cigarette. Oh, the little Yanks, he says. They're not a bit shy. I'm black because I work at the Limerick Gas Works shoveling coal and coke into the furnaces. Gassed in France and back to Limerick to work in the gas works. When you grow up you'll laugh.\nMalachy and I have to leave the table so the big people can sit and have tea. They have their tea but Uncle Pa Keating, who is my uncle because he's married to my aunt Aggie, picks up Eugene and takes him on his lap. He says, This is a sad little fella, and makes funny faces and silly sounds. Malachy and I laugh but Eugene only reaches up to touch the blackness of Pa Keating's skin, and then when Pa pretends to bite his little hand, Eugene laughs and everyone in the room laughs. Malachy goes to Eugene and tries to make him laugh even more but Eugene turns away and hides his face in Pa Keating's shirt.\nI think he likes me, says Pa, and that's when Aunt Aggie puts down her teacup and starts to bawl, Waah, waah, waah, big teardrops tumbling down her fat red face.\nAw, Jesus, says Grandma, there she is again. What's up with you this time?\nAnd Aunt Aggie blubbers, To see Pa there with a child on his lap an' me with no hope of having my own.\nGrandma barks at her, Stop talkin' like that in front of the children. Have you no shame? When God is good and ready He'll send you your family.\nAunt Aggie sobs, Angela with five born an' one just gone an' her so useless she couldn't scrub a floor an' me with none an' I can scrub an' clean with the best and make any class of a stew or a fry.\nPa Keating laughs, I think I'll keep this little fella.\nMalachy runs to him. No, no, no. That's my brother, that's Eugene. And I say, No, no, no, that's our brother. Aunt Aggie pats the tears on her cheeks. She says, I don't want nothing of Angela's. I don't want nothing that's half Limerick and half North of Ireland, so I don't, so ye can take him home. I'll have me own someday if I have to do a hundred novenas to the Virgin Mary and her mother, St. Ann, or if I have to crawl from here to Lourdes on me two bended knees.\nGrandma says, That's enough. Ye have had yeer porridge and 'tis time to go home and see if yeer father and mother are back from the hospital.\nShe puts on her shawl and goes to pick up Eugene but he clutches so hard at Pa Keating's shirt she has to pull him away though he keeps looking back at Pa till we're out the door.\n***\nWe followed Grandma back to our room. She put Eugene in the bed and gave him a drink of water. She told him to be a good boy and go to sleep for his little brother, Oliver, would be home soon and they'd be playing again there on the floor.\nBut he kept looking out the window.\nShe told Malachy and me we could sit on the floor and play but to be quiet because she was going to say her prayers. Malachy went to the bed and sat by Eugene and I sat on a chair at the table making out words on the newspaper that was our tablecloth. All you could hear in the room was Malachy whispering to make Eugene happy and Grandma mumbling to the click of her rosary beads. It was so quiet I put my head on the table and fell asleep.\nDad is touching my shoulder. Come on, Francis, you have to take care of your little brothers.\nMam is slumped on the edge of the bed, making small crying sounds like a bird. Grandma is pulling on her shawl. She says, I'll go down to\nThompson the undertaker about the coffin and the carriage. The St. Vincent de Paul Society will surely pay for that, God knows.\nShe goes out the door. Dad stands facing the wall over the fire, beating on his thighs with his fists, sighing, Och, och, och.\nDad frightens me with his och, och, och, and Mam frightens me with her small bird sounds and I don't know what to do though I wonder if anyone will light the fire in the grate so that we can have tea and bread because it's a long time since we had the porridge. If Dad would move away from the fireplace I could light the fire myself. All you need is paper, a few bits of coal or turf, and a match. He won't move so I try to go around his legs while he's beating on his thighs but he notices me and wants to know why I'm trying to light the fire. I tell him we're all hungry and he lets out a crazy laugh. Hungry? he says. Och, Francis, your wee brother Oliver is dead. Your wee sister is dead and your wee brother is dead.\nHe picks me up and hugs me so hard I cry out. Then Malachy cries, my mother cries, Dad cries, I cry, but Eugene stays quiet. Then Dad sniffles, We'll have a feast. Come on, Francis.\nHe tells my mother we'll be back in awhile but she has Malachy and Eugene on her lap in the bed and she doesn't look up. He carries me through the streets of Limerick and we go from shop to shop with him asking for food or anything they can give to a family that has two children dead in a year, one in America, one in Limerick, and in danger of losing three more for the want of food and drink. Most shopkeepers shake their heads. Sorry for your troubles but you could go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or get the public assistance.\nDad says he's glad to see the spirit of Christ alive in Limerick and they tell him they don't need the likes of him with his northern accent to be telling them about Christ and he should be ashamed of himself dragging a child around like that like a common beggar, a tinker, a knacker.\nA few shopkeepers give bread, potatoes, tins of beans and Dad says, We'll go home now and you boys can eat something, but we meet Uncle Pa Keating and he tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and would Dad like to have a pint in this pub here?\nThere are men sitting in this pub with great glasses of black stuff before them. Uncle Pa Keating and Dad have the black stuff, too. They lift their glasses carefully and slowly drink. There is creamy white stuff on their lips, which they lick with little sighs. Uncle Pa gets me a bottle of lemonade and Dad gives me a piece of bread and I don't feel hungry anymore. Still, I wonder how long we'll sit here with Malachy and Eugene hungry at home, hours from the porridge, which Eugene didn't eat anyway.\nDad and Uncle Pa drink their glass of black stuff and have another. Uncle Pa says, Frankie, this is the pint. This is the staff of life. This is the best thing for nursing mothers and for those who are long weaned.\nHe laughs and Dad smiles and I laugh because I think that's what you're supposed to do when Uncle Pa says something. He doesn't laugh when he tells the other men about Oliver dying. The other men tip their hats to Dad. Sorry for your troubles, mister, and surely you'll have a pint.\nDad says yes to the pints and soon he's singing Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry and song after song I never heard before and crying over his lovely little girl, Margaret, that died in America and his little boy, Oliver, dead beyond in the City Home Hospital. It frightens me the way he\nyells and cries and sings and I wish I could be at home with my three brothers, no, my two brothers, and my mother.\nThe man behind the bar says to Dad, I think now, mister, you've had enough. We're sorry for your troubles but you have to take that child home to his mother that must be heartbroken by the fire.\nDad says, One, one more pint, just one, eh? and the man says no. Dad shakes his fist. I did me bit for Ireland, and when the man comes out and takes Dad's arm, Dad tries to push him away.\nUncle Pa says, Come on now, Malachy, stop the blaguarding. You have to go home to Angela. You have a funeral tomorrow and the lovely children waiting for you.\nBut Dad struggles till a few men push him out into the darkness. Uncle Pa stumbles out with the bag of food. Come on, he says. We'll go back to your room.\nDad wants to go to another place for a pint but Uncle Pa says he has no more money. Dad says he'll tell everyone his sorrows and they'll give him pints. Uncle Pa says that's a disgraceful thing to do and Dad cries on his shoulder. You're a good friend, he tells Uncle Pa. He cries again till Uncle Pa pats him on the back. It's terrible, terrible, says Uncle Pa, but you'll get over this in time.\nDad straightens up and looks at him. Never, he says. Never.\nNext day we rode to the hospital in a carriage with a horse. They put Oliver in a white box that came with us in the carriage and we took him to the graveyard. They put the white box into a hole in the ground and covered it with earth. My mother and Aunt Aggie cried, Grandma looked angry, Dad, Uncle Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat Sheehan looked sad but did not cry and I thought that if you're a man you can cry only when you have the black stuff that is called the pint.\nI did not like the jackdaws that perched on trees and gravestones and I did not want to leave Oliver with them. I threw a rock at a jackdaw that waddled over toward Oliver's grave. Dad said I shouldn't throw rocks at jackdaws, they might be somebody's soul. I didn't know what a soul was but I didn't ask him because I didn't care. Oliver was dead and I hated jackdaws. I'd be a man someday and I'd come back with a bag of rocks and I'd leave the graveyard littered with dead jackdaws.\nThe morning after Oliver's burial Dad went to the Labour Exchange to sign and collect the week's dole, nineteen shillings and sixpence. He said he'd be home by noon, that he'd get coal and make a fire, that we'd have rashers and eggs and tea in honor of Oliver, that we might even have a sweet or two.\nHe wasn't home by noon, or one, or two, and we boiled and ate the few potatoes the shopkeepers had given the day before. He wasn't home anytime before the sun went down that day in May. There was no sign of him till we heard him, long after the pubs closed, rolling along Windmill Street, singing, When all around a vigil keep, The West's asleep, the West's asleep- Alas, and well may Erin weep When Connacht lies in slumber deep.\nThere lake and plain smile fair and free, 'Mid rocks their guardian chivalry.\nSing, Oh, let man learn liberty\nFrom crashing wind and lashing sea.\nHe stumbled into the room, hanging on to the wall. A snot oozed from his nose and he wiped it away with the back of his hand. He tried to speak. Zeeze shildren should be in bed. Lishen to me. Shildren go to bed.\nMam faced him. These children are hungry. Where's the dole money? We'll get fish and chips so they'll have something in their bellies when they go to sleep.\nShe tried to stick her hands into his pockets but he pushed her away. Have respheck, he said. Reshpeck in front of shildren.\nShe struggled to get at his pockets. Where's the money? The children are hungry. You mad oul' bastard, did you drink all the money again? Just what you did in Brooklyn.\nHe blubbered, Och, poor Angela. And poor wee Margaret and poor wee Oliver.\nHe staggered to me and hugged me and I smelled the drink I used to smell in America. My face was wet from his tears and his spit and his snot and I was hungry and I didn't know what to say when he cried all over my head.\nThen he let me go and hugged Malachy, still going on about the wee sister and the wee brother cold in the ground, and how we all have to pray and be good, how we have to be obedient and do what our mother tells us. He said we have our troubles but it's time for Malachy and me to start school because there's nothing like an education, it will stand to you in the end, and you have to get ready to do your bit for Ireland.\n***\nMam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Windmill Street. She can't sleep with the memory of Oliver in that room, Oliver in the bed, Oliver playing on the floor, Oliver sitting on Dad's lap by the fire. She says it's not good for Eugene to be in that place, that a twin will suffer more over the loss of his brother than even a mother can understand. There's a room going on Hartstonge Street with two beds instead of the one we have here for the six of us, no, the five of us. We're getting that room and to make sure she's going to the Labour Exchange on Thursday to stand in the queue to take the dole money the minute it's handed to Dad. He says she can't do that, he'd be disgraced with the other men. The Labour Exchange is a place for men not for women taking the money from under their noses. She says, Pity about you. If you didn't squander the money in the pubs I wouldn't have to follow you the way I did in Brooklyn.\nHe tells her he'll be shamed forever. She says she doesn't care. She wants that room on Hartstonge Street, a nice warm comfortable room with a lavatory down the hall like the one in Brooklyn, a room without fleas and the dampness that kills. She wants that room because it's on the same street as Leamy's National School and Malachy and I can come home at the dinner hour, which is noon, for a cup of tea and a cut of fried bread.\nOn Thursday Mam follows Dad to the Labour Exchange. She marches in behind him and when the man pushes the money toward Dad she takes it. The other men on the dole nudge each other and grin and Dad is disgraced because a woman is never supposed to interfere with a man's dole money. He might want to put sixpence on a horse or have a pint and if all the women start acting like Mam the horses will stop running and Guinness will go broke. But she has the money now and we move to Hartstonge Street. Then she carries Eugene in her arms and we go up the street to Leamy's National School. The headmaster, Mr. Scallan, says we are to\nreturn on Monday with a composition book, a pencil, and a pen with a good nib on it. We are not to come to school with ringworm or lice and our noses are to be blown at all times, not on the floor, that spreads the consumption, or on our sleeves, but in a handkerchief or a clean rag. He asks us if we are good boys and when we say we are, he says, Good Lord, what's this? Are they Yanks or what?\nMam tells him about Margaret and Oliver and he says, Lord above, Lord above, there's great suffering in the world. Anyway, we'll put the little fellow, Malachy, in the infants' class and his brother in first class. They're in the same room with one master. Monday morning, then, nine o'clock prompt.\nThe boys in Leamy's want to know why we talk like that. Are ye Yanks or what? And when we tell them we came from America they want to know, Are ye gangsters or cowboys?\nA big boy sticks his face up to mine. I'm asking ye a question, he says. Are ye gangsters or cowboys?\nI tell him I don't know and when he pokes his finger into my chest Malachy says, I'm a gangster, Frank's a cowboy. The big boy says, Your little brother is smart and you're a stupid Yank.\nThe boys around him are excited. Fight, they yell, fight, and he pushes me so hard I fall. I want to cry but the blackness comes over me the way it did with Freddie Leibowitz and I rush at him, kicking and punching. I knock him down and try to grab his hair to bang his head on the ground but there's a sharp sting across the backs of my legs and I'm pulled away from him.\nMr. Benson, the master, has me by the ear and he's whacking me across the legs. You little hooligan, he says. Is that the kind of behavior you brought from America? Well, by God, you'll behave yourself before I'm done with you.\nHe tells me hold out one hand and then the other and hits me with his stick once on each hand. Go home now, he says, and tell your mother what a bad boy you were. You're a bad Yank. Say after me, I'm a bad boy.\nI'm a bad boy.\nNow say, I'm a bad Yank.\nI'm a bad Yank.\nMalachy says, He's not a bad boy. It's that big boy. He said we\nwere cowboys and gangsters.\nIs that what you did, Heffernan?\nI was only jokin', sir.\nNo more joking, Heffernan. It's not their fault that they're Yanks. 'Tisn't, sir.\nAnd you, Heffernan, should get down on your two knees every night\nand thank God you're not a Yank for if you were, Heffernan, you'd be the greatest gangster on two sides of the Atlantic. Al Capone would be coming to you for lessons. You're not to be bothering these two Yanks anymore, Heffernan.\nI won't, sir.\nAnd if you do, Heffernan, I'll hang your pelt on the wall. Now go home, all of ye.\nThere are seven masters in Leamy's National School and they all have leather straps, canes, blackthorn sticks. They hit you with the sticks on the shoulders, the back, the legs, and, especially, the hands. If they hit you on the hands it's called a slap. They hit you if you're\nlate, if you have a leaky nib on your pen, if you laugh, if you talk, and if you don't know things.\nThey hit you if you don't know why God made the world, if you don't know the patron saint of Limerick, if you can't recite the Apostles' Creed, if you can't add nineteen to forty-seven, if you can't subtract nineteen from forty-seven, if you don't know the chief towns and products of the thirty-two counties of Ireland, if you can't find Bulgaria on the wall map of the world that's blotted with spit, snot, and blobs of ink thrown by angry pupils expelled forever.\nThey hit you if you can't say your name in Irish, if you can't say the Hail Mary in Irish, if you can't ask for the lavatory pass in Irish. It helps to listen to the big boys ahead of you. They can tell you\nabout the master you have now, what he likes and what he hates.\nOne master will hit you if you don't know that Eamon De Valera is\nthe greatest man that ever lived. Another master will hit you if you don't know that Michael Collins was the greatest man that ever lived.\nMr. Benson hates America and you have to remember to hate America or he'll hit you.\nMr. O'Dea hates England and you have to remember to hate England or he'll hit you.\nIf you ever say anything good about Oliver Cromwell they'll all hit\nyou.\nEven if they slap you six times on each hand with the ash plant or\nthe blackthorn with the knobs you must not cry. You'll be a sissy. There are boys who might jeer at you and mock you on the street but even they have to be careful because the day will come when the master hits and slaps them and they have to keep the tears behind their eyes or be disgraced forever. Some boys say it is better to cry because that pleases the masters. If you don't cry the masters hate you because you've made them look weak before the class and they promise themselves the next time they have you up they'll draw tears or blood or both.\nBig boys in fifth class tell us Mr. O'Dea likes to get you in front of the class so that he can stand behind you, pinch your sideburns, which are called cossicks, pull up on them. Up, up, he says, till you're on tiptoe and the tears are filling your eyes. You don't want the boys in the class to see you cry but pulling on the cossicks makes the tears come whether you like it or not and the master likes that. Mr. O'Dea is the one master who can always bring the tears and the shame.\nIt is better not to cry because you have to stick with the boys in the school and you never want to give the masters any satisfaction.\nIf the master hits you there's no use complaining to your father or mother. They always say, You deserve it. Don't be a baby.\nI know Oliver is dead and Malachy knows Oliver is dead but Eugene is too small to know anything. When he wakes in the morning he says, Ollie, Ollie, and toddles around the room looking under the beds or he climbs up on the bed by the window and points to children on the street, especially children with fair hair like him and Oliver. Ollie, Ollie, he says, and Mam picks him up, sobs, hugs him. He struggles to get down because he doesn't want to be picked up and hugged. He wants to find Oliver.\nDad and Mam tell him Oliver is in heaven playing with angels and we'll all see him again someday but he doesn't understand because he's only two and doesn't have the words and that's the worst thing in the whole world.\nMalachy and I play with him. We try to make him laugh. We make funny faces. We put pots on our heads and pretend to let them fall off. We run across the room and pretend to fall down. We take him to the People's Park to see the lovely flowers, play with dogs, roll in the grass.\nHe sees small children with fair hair like Oliver. He doesn't say Ollie anymore. He only points.\nDad says Eugene is lucky to have brothers like Malachy and me because we help him forget and soon, with God's help, he'll have no memory of Oliver at all.\n***\nHe died anyway.\nSix months after Oliver went, we woke on a mean November morning\nand there was Eugene, cold in the bed beside us. Dr. Troy came and said that child died of pneumonia and why wasn't he in the hospital long ago? Dad said he didn't know and Mam said she didn't know and Dr. Troy said that's why children die. People don't know. He said if Malachy or I showed the slightest sign of a cough or the faintest rattle in the throat we were to be brought to him no matter what time of day or night. We were to be kept dry at all times because there seemed to be a bit of a weakness in the chest in this family. He told Mam he was very sorry for her troubles and he'd give her a prescription for something to ease the pain of the days to come. He said God was asking too much, too damn much.\nGrandma came over to our room with Aunt Aggie. She washed Eugene, and Aunt Aggie went to a shop for a little white gown and a set of rosary beads. They dressed him in a white gown and laid him on the bed by the window where he used to look out for Oliver. They placed his hands on his chest, one hand on top of the other, bound in the little white rosary beads. Grandma brushed the hair back from his eyes and forehead and she said, Doesn't he have lovely soft silky hair? Mam went to the bed and pulled a blanket over his legs to keep him warm. Grandma and Aunt Aggie looked at each other and said nothing. Dad stood at the end of the bed beating his fists against his thighs, talking to Eugene, telling him, Och, it was the River Shannon that harmed you, the dampness from that river that came and took you and Oliver. Grandma said, Will you stop that? You're making the whole house nervous. She took Dr. Troy's prescription and told me run over to O'Connor the chemist for the pills, that there would be no charge due to the kindness of Dr. Troy. Dad said he'd come with me, that we'd go to the Jesuit church and say a prayer for Margaret and Oliver and Eugene, all happy in heaven. The chemist gave us the pills, we stopped to say the prayers, and when we returned to the room, Grandma gave Dad money to bring a few bottles of stout from the pub. Mam said, No, no, but Grandma said, He doesn't have the pills to ease him, God help us, and a bottle of stout will be some small comfort. Then she told him he'd have to go to the undertaker tomorrow to bring the coffin back in a carriage. She told me to go with my father and make sure he didn't stay in the pub all night and drink all the money. Dad said, Och, Frankie shouldn't be in pubs, and she said, Then don't stay there. He put on his cap and we went to South's pub and he told me at the door I could go home now, that he'd be home after one pint. I said, No, and he said, Don't be disobedient. Go home to your poor mother. I said, No, and he said I was a bad boy and God would be displeased. I said I wasn't going home without him and he said, Och, what is the world coming to? He had one quick pint of porter in the pub and we went home with the bottles\nof stout. Pa Keating was in our room with a small bottle of whiskey and bottles of stout and Uncle Pat Sheehan brought two bottles of stout for himself. Uncle Pat sat on the floor with his arms around his bottles and he kept saying, They're mine, they're mine, for fear they'd be taken from him. People who were dropped on their heads always worry someone will steal their stout. Grandma said, All right, Pat, drink your stout yourself. No one will bother you. She and Aunt Aggie sat on the bed by Eugene. Pa Keating sat at the kitchen table drinking his stout and offering everyone a sip of his whiskey. Mam took her pills and sat by the fire with Malachy on her lap. She kept saying Malachy had hair like Eugene and Aunt Aggie said no he did not till Grandma drove her elbow into Aunt Aggie's chest and told her shut up. Dad stood against the wall drinking his stout between the fireplace and the bed with Eugene. Pa Keating told stories and the big people laughed even though they didn't want to laugh or they weren't supposed to laugh in the presence of a dead child. He said when he was in the English army in France the Germans sent gas over which made him so sick they had to take him to the hospital. They kept him in the hospital a while and then sent him back to the trenches. English soldiers were sent home but they didn't give a fiddler's fart about the Irish soldiers, whether they lived or died. Instead of dying Pa made a vast fortune. He said he solved one of the great problems of trench warfare. In the trenches it was so wet and muddy they had no way of boiling the water for the tea. He said to himself, Jasus, I have all this gas in my system and 'tis a great pity to waste it. So he shoved a pipe up his arse, lit a match to it, and there in a second he had a fine flame ready to boil water in any billycan. Tommies came running from trenches all around when they heard the news and they gave him any amount of money if he'd let them boil water. He made so much money he was able to bribe the generals to let him out of the army and off he went to Paris where he had a fine time drinking wine with artists and models. He had such a high time of it he spent all his money and when he came back to Limerick the only job he could get was in the gas works shoveling coal into the furnaces. He said there was so much gas in his system now he could supply light to a small town for a year. Aunt Aggie sniffed and said that was not a proper story to be telling in the presence of a dead child and Grandma said it was better to have a story like that than to be sitting around with the long face. Uncle Pat Sheehan, sitting on the floor with his stout, said he was going to sing a song. More power to you, said Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat sang \"The Road to Rasheen. \" He kept saying, Rasheen, Rasheen, mavourneen mean, and the song made no sense because his father dropped him on his head long ago and every time he sang that song he had different words. Grandma said that was a fine song and Pa Keating said Caruso better look over his shoulder. Dad went over to the bed in the corner where he slept with Mam. He sat on the edge, put his bottle on the floor, covered his face with his hands and cried. He said, Frank, Frank, come here, and I had to go to him so that he could hug me the way Mam was hugging Malachy. Grandma said, We better go now and sleep a bit before the funeral tomorrow. They each knelt by the bed and said a prayer and kissed Eugene's forehead. Dad put me down, stood up and nodded to them as they left. When they were gone he lifted each of the stout bottles to his mouth and drained it. He ran his finger inside the whiskey bottle and licked it. He turned down the flame in the paraffin oil lamp on the table and said it was time for Malachy and me to be in bed. We'd have to sleep with him and Mam that\nnight as little Eugene would be needing the bed for himself. It was dark in the room now except for the sliver of streetlight that fell on Eugene's lovely soft silky hair.\nDad lights the fire in the morning, makes the tea, toasts the bread in the fire. He brings Mam's toast and tea but she waves it away and turns to the wall. He brings Malachy and me to Eugene to kneel and say a prayer. He says the prayers of one child like us are worth more in heaven than the prayers of ten cardinals and forty bishops. He shows us how to bless ourselves, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen, and he says, Dear God, this is what you want, isn't it? You want my son, Eugene. You took his brother, Oliver, You took his sister, Margaret. I'm not supposed to question that, am I? Dear God above, I don't know why children have to die but that is Your will. You told the river to kill and the Shannon killed. Could You at last be merciful? Could You leave us the children we have? That is all we ask. Amen.\nHe helps Malachy and me wash our heads and feet so that we'll be clean for Eugene's funeral. We have to be very quiet even when he hurts us cleaning our ears with the corner of the towel we brought from America. We have to be quiet because Eugene is there with his eyes closed and we don't want him to be waking up and looking out the window for Oliver.\nGrandma comes and tells Mam she has to get up. There are children dead, she says, but there are children alive and they need their mother. She brings Mam a little tea in a mug to wash down the pills that ease the pain. Dad tells Grandma it's Thursday and he has to go to the Labour Exchange for the dole and then down to the undertaker to bring the mourning carriage and the coffin. Grandma tells him to take me with him but he says it's better for me to stay with Malachy so that I can pray for my little brother dead in the bed. Grandma says, Is it coddin' me you are? Pray for a little child that's barely two and already playing with his little brother in heaven? You'll take your son with you and he'll remind you this is no day for the pubs. She looks at him and he looks at her and he puts on his cap.\nAt the Labour Exchange we stand at the end of the queue till a man comes from behind the counter and tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and he should go ahead of everyone else on this sorrowful day. Men touch their caps and say they're sorry for his troubles and some pat my head and give me pennies, twenty-four pennies, two shillings. Dad tells me I'm rich now and I should buy myself a sweet while he goes into this place for a minute. I know this place is a pub and I know he wants to get the black stuff that is called a pint but I don't say anything because I want to go to the shop next door for a piece of toffee. I chew my toffee till it melts and leaves my mouth all sweet and sticky. Dad is still in the pub and I wonder if I should get another piece of toffee as long as he's in there with the pint. I'm about to give the money to the woman in the shop when my hand is slapped down and there's Aunt Aggie, raging. Is this what you do, she says, on the day of your brother's funeral? Gorgin' yourself on sweets. And where's that father of yours?\nHe's, he's, in the pub.\nOf course he's in the pub. You out here stuffin' yourself with sweets and him in there gettin' himself into a staggerin' condition the day your poor little brother goes to the graveyard.\nShe tells the shop woman, Just like his father, the same odd manner, the same oul' northern jaw. She tells me get into that pub and tell my father to stop the drinking and get the coffin and the carriage. She will not set foot inside the pub for the drink is the curse of this poor godforsaken country.\nDad is sitting at the back of the pub with a man who has a dirty face and hair growing out of his nose. They're not talking but staring straight ahead and their black pints are resting on a small white coffin on the seat between them. I know that's Eugene's coffin because Oliver had one like it and I want to cry when I see the black pints on top of it. I'm sorry now I ever ate that toffee and I wish I could take it out of my stomach and give it back to the woman in the shop because it's not right to be eating toffee when Eugene is dead in the bed and I'm frightened by the two black pints on his white coffin. The man with Dad is saying, No, mister, you can't leave a child's coffin in a carriage no more. I did that once, went in for a pint and they robbed that little coffin out of the bloody carriage. Can you credit that? It was empty, thank God, but there you are. Desperate times we live in, desperate. The man with Dad lifts his pint and takes a long swallow and when he puts his glass down there's a hollow sound in the coffin. Dad nods at me. We'll be going in a minute, son, but when he goes to put his glass on the coffin after the long swallow I push it away.\nThat's Eugene's coffin. I'll tell Mam you put your glass on Eugene's coffin.\nNow, son. Now, son.\nDad, that's Eugene's coffin. The other man says, Will we have another pint, mister?\nDad says to me, Wait outside another few minutes, Francis. No.\nDon't be a bad boy.\nNo.\nThe other man says, By Jesus, if that was my son I'd kick his arse from here to the County Kerry. He have no right to be talkin' to his father in that manner on a sorrowful day. If a man can't have a pint the day of a funeral what's the use of livin' at all, at all.\nDad says, All right. We'll go.\nThey finish their pints and wipe the wet brown stains off the coffin with their sleeves. The man climbs up to the driver's seat of the carriage and Dad and I ride inside. He has the coffin on his lap and he presses it against his chest. At home our room is filled with big people, Mam, Grandma, Aunt Aggie, her husband, Pa Keating, Uncle Pat Sheehan, Uncle Tom Sheehan, who is Mam's oldest brother and who never came near us before because he hates people from the North of Ireland. Uncle Tom has his wife, Jane, with him. She's from Galway and people say she has the look of a Spaniard and that's why no one in the family talks to her.\nThe man takes the coffin from Dad and when he brings it into the room Mam moans, Oh, no, oh, God, no. The man tells Grandma he'll be back in awhile to take us to the graveyard. Grandma tells him he'd better not come back to this house in a drunken state because this child that's going to the graveyard suffered greatly and deserves a bit of dignity and she won't put up with a driver that's drunk and ready to fall out of the high seat.\nThe man says, Missus, I drove dozens o' children to the graveyard an' never once fell out of any seat, high or low.\nThe men are drinking stout from bottles again and the women are sipping sherry from jam jars. Uncle Pat Sheehan tells everyone, This is my stout, this is my stout, and Grandma says, 'Tis all right, Pat. No one will take your stout. Then he says he wants to sing \"The Road to Rasheen\" till Pa Keating says, No, Pat, you can't sing on the day of a funeral. You can sing the night before. But Uncle Pat keeps saying, This is my stout and I want to sing \"The Road to Rasheen, \" and everyone knows he talks like that because he was dropped on his head. He starts to sing his song but stops when Grandma takes the lid off the coffin and Mam sobs, Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus, will it ever stop? Will I be left with one child?\nMam is sitting on a chair at the head of the bed. She's stroking Eugene's hair and face and hands. She tells him that of all the children in the world he was the sweetest and the most delicate and loving. She tells him 'tis a terrible thing to lose him but isn't he in heaven now with his brother and his sister and isn't that a comfort to us, knowing Oliver is no longer lonesome for his twin. Still, she puts her head down next to Eugene and cries so hard all the women in the room cry with her. She cries till Pa Keating tells her we have to go before the darkness falls, that we can't be in graveyards in the dark.\nGrandma whispers to Aunt Aggie, Who'll put the child in the coffin? and Aunt Aggie whispers, I won't. That's the job for the mother.\nUncle Pat hears them. I'll put the child in the coffin, he says. He limps to the bed and places his arms around Mam's shoulders. She looks up at him and her face is drenched. He says, I'll put the child in the coffin, Angela.\nOh, Pat, she says. Pat.\nI can do it, he says. Sure he's only a small child an' I never lifted a small child before in my life. I never had a small child in me arms. I won't drop him, Angela. I won't. Honest to God, I won't.\nI know you won't, Pat. I know you won't.\nI'll lift him an' I won't be singin'\"The Road to Rasheen.\"\nI know you won't, Pat, Mam says.\nPat pulls down the blanket Mam put there to keep Eugene warm.\nEugene's feet are white and bright with little blue veins. Pat bends over, picks up Eugene and holds him against his chest. He kisses Eugene's forehead and then everyone in the room kisses Eugene. He places Eugene in the coffin and steps back. We are all gathered around looking at Eugene for the last time.\nUncle Pat says, See, I didn't drop him, Angela, and she touches his\nface.\nAunt Aggie goes to the pub for the driver. He puts the lid on the\ncoffin and screws it down. He says, Who's comin' in the carriage? and takes the coffin to the carriage. There's room only for Mam and Dad, Malachy and me. Grandma says, Ye go ahead to the graveyard and we'll wait here.\nI don't know why we can't keep Eugene. I don't know why they have to send him away with that man who puts his pint on the white coffin. I don't know why they had to send Margaret away and Oliver. It is a bad thing to put my sister and my brothers in a box and I wish I could say something to someone.\nThe horse clop-clopped through the streets of Limerick. Malachy said, Are we going to see Oliver? and Dad said, No, Oliver is in heaven and don't ask me what heaven is because I don't know.\nMam said, Heaven is a place where Oliver and Eugene and Margaret are happy and warm and we'll see them there some day.\nMalachy said, The horse did his doodoo on the street and there was a smell, and Mam and Dad had to smile.\nAt the graveyard the driver climbs down and opens the door of the carriage. Gimme that coffin, he says, an' I'll carry it up to the grave. He yanks at the coffin and stumbles. Mam says, You're not carrying my child in the condition you're in. She turns to Dad. You carry him, she says. Do what you like, says the driver.\nDo what you bloody well like, and he climbs up to his seat.\nIt's getting dark now and the coffin seems whiter than ever in Dad's arms. Mam takes our hands and we follow Dad through the graves. The jackdaws are quiet in the trees because their day is nearly over and they have to rest so that they can get up early in the morning and feed their babies.\nTwo men with shovels are waiting by a small open grave. One man says, Ye are very late. Good thing this is a small job or we'd be gone. He climbs into the grave. Hand it to me, he says, and Dad hands him the coffin.\nThe man sprinkles some straw and grass on the coffin and as he climbs out the other man shovels in the earth. Mam lets out a long cry, Oh, Jesus, Jesus, and a jackdaw croaks in a tree. I wish I had a rock to hit that jackdaw. When the men finish shoveling in the earth they wipe their foreheads and wait. One says, Ah, well, now, there's usually a little something for the thirst that's in it.\nDad says, Oh, yes, yes, and gives them money. They say, Sorry for your troubles, and they leave.\nWe make our way back to the carriage at the graveyard gate but the carriage is gone. Dad looks around in the darkness and comes back shaking his head. Mam says, That driver is nothing but a dirty old drunkard, God forgive me.\nIt's a long walk from the graveyard to our room. Mam tells Dad, These children need some nourishment and you have money left from the dole this morning. If you're thinking of going to the pubs tonight you can forget it. We're taking them to Naughton's and they can have fish and chips and lemonade for 'tisn't every day they bury a brother.\nThe fish and chips are delicious with vinegar and salt and the lemonade is tart in our throats.\nWhen we get home the room is empty. There are empty stout bottles on the table and the fire is out. Dad lights the paraffin oil lamp and you can see the hollow left in the pillow by Eugene's head. You expect to hear him and see him toddling across the room, climbing up on the bed to look out the window for Oliver.\nDad tells Mam he's going out for a walk. She says no. She knows what he's up to, that he can't wait to spend his last few shillings in the pubs. All right, he says. He lights the fire and Mam makes tea and soon we're in bed.\nMalachy and I are back in the bed where Eugene died. I hope he's not cold in that white coffin in the graveyard though I know he's not there anymore because angels come to the graveyard and open the coffin and he's far from the Shannon dampness that kills, up in the sky in heaven with Oliver and Margaret where they have plenty of fish and chips and toffee and no aunts to bother you, where all the fathers bring home\nthe money from the Labour Exchange and you don't have to be running around to pubs to find them.\nIII\nMam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Hartstonge Street. She sees Eugene morning, noon and night. She sees him climbing the bed to look out at the street for Oliver and sometimes she sees Oliver outside and Eugene inside, the two of them chatting away. She's happy they're chatting like that but she doesn't want to be seeing and hearing them the rest of her life. It's a shame to move when we're so near Leamy's National School but if she doesn't move soon she'll go out of her mind and wind up in the lunatic asylum.\nWe move to Roden Lane on top of a place called Barrack Hill. There are six houses on one side of the lane, one on the opposite side. The houses are called two up, two down, two rooms on top, two on the bottom. Our house is at the end of the lane, the last of the six. Next to our door is a small shed, a lavatory, and next to that a stable.\nMam goes to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to see if there's any chance of getting furniture. The man says he'll give us a docket for a table, two chairs, and two beds. He says we'll have to go to a second- hand furniture shop down in the Irishtown and haul the furniture home ourselves. Mam says we can use the pram she had for the twins and when she says that she cries. She wipes her eyes on her sleeves and asks the man if the beds we're getting are secondhand. He says of course they are, and she says she's very worried about sleeping in beds someone might have died in, especially if they had the consumption. The man says, I'm very sorry, but beggars can't be choosers.\nIt takes us all day to haul the furniture on the pram from one end of Limerick to the other. There are four wheels on the pram but one is bockety, it wants to go in a different direction. We have two beds, one sideboard with a mirror, a table and two chairs. We're happy with the house. We can walk from room to room and up and down the stairs. You feel very rich when you can go up and down the stairs all day as much as you please. Dad lights the fire and Mam makes the tea. He sits at the table on one chair, she sits on the other and Malachy and I sit on the trunk we brought from America. While we're drinking our tea an old man passes our door with a bucket in his hand. He empties the bucket into the lavatory and flushes and there's a powerful stink in our kitchen. Mam goes to the door and says, Why are you emptying your bucket in our lavatory? He raises his cap to her. Your lavatory, missus? Ah, no. You're making a bit of a mistake there, ha, ha. This is not your lavatory. Sure, isn't this the lavatory for the whole lane. You'll see passing your door here the buckets of eleven families and I can tell you it gets very powerful here in the warm weather, very powerful altogether. 'Tis December now, thank God, with a chill in the air and Christmas around the corner and the lavatory isn't that bad, but the day will come when you'll be calling for a gas mask. So, good night to you, missus, and I hope you'll be happy in your house.\nMam says, Wait a minute, sir. Could you tell me who cleans this lavatory?\nCleans? Ah, Jasus, that's a good one. Cleans, she says. Is it joking you are? These houses were built in the time of Queen Victoria herself and if this lavatory was ever cleaned it must have been done by someone in the middle of the night when no one was lookin'.\nAnd he shuffles up the lane laughing away to himself.\nMam comes back to her chair and her tea. We can't stay here, she says. That lavatory will kill us with all diseases.\nDad says, We can't move again. Where will we get a house for six shillings a week? We'll keep the lavatory clean ourselves. We'll boil buckets of water and throw them in there.\nOh, will we? says Mam, and where will we get the coal or turf or blocks to be boiling water?\nDad says nothing. He finishes his tea and looks for a nail to hang our one picture. The man in the picture has a thin face. He wears a yellow skullcap and a black robe with a cross on his chest. Dad says he was a Pope, Leo the Thirteenth, a great friend of the workingman. He brought this picture all the way from America where he found it thrown out by someone who had no time for the workingman. Mam says he's talking a lot of bloody nonsense and he says she shouldn't say bloody in front of the children. Dad finds a nail but wonders how he's going to get it into the wall without a hammer. Mam says he could go borrow one from the people next door but he says you don't go around borrowing from people you don't know. He leans the picture against the wall and drives the nail with the bottom of a jam jar. The jam jar breaks and cuts his hand and a blob of blood falls on the Pope's head. He wraps his hand in the dish rag and tells Mam, Quick, quick, wipe the blood off the Pope before it dries. She tries to wipe the blood away with her sleeve but it's wool and spreads the blood till the whole side of the Pope's face is smeared. Dad says, Lord above, Angela, you've destroyed the Pope entirely, and she says, Arrah, stop your whining, we'll get some paint and go over his face some day, and Dad says, He's the only Pope that was ever a friend to the workingman and what are we to say if someone from the St. Vincent de Paul Society comes in and sees blood all over him? Mam says, I don't know. It's your blood and 'tis a sad thing when a man can't even drive a nail straight. It just goes to show how useless you are. You'd be better off digging fields and anyway I don't care. I have pain in my back and I'm going to bed.\nOch, what am I going to do? Dad says.\nTake down the Pope and hide him in the coal hole under the stairs where he won't be seen and he'll be out of harm's way.\nI can't, says Dad. It would be bad luck. Coal hole is no place for a Pope. When the Pope is up, he's up.\nSuit yourself, says Mam.\nI will, says Dad.\nThis is our first Christmas in Limerick and the girls are out in\nthe lane, skipping rope and singing, Christmas is coming And the goose is getting fat, Please put a penny In the old man's hat.\nIf you haven't a penny\nA ha'penny will do\nAnd if you haven't a ha'penny\nGod bless you.\nBoys tease the girls and call out,\nMay your mother have an accident\nAbroad in the loo.\nMam says she'd like to have a nice Christmas dinner but what can you do when the Labour Exchange reduces the dole to sixteen shillings after Oliver and Eugene died? You pay the rent of six shillings, you have ten shillings left, and what use is that to four people?\nDad can't get any work. He gets up early on weekdays, lights the fire, boils water for the tea and his shaving mug. He puts on a shirt and attaches a collar with studs. He puts on his tie and his cap and goes to the Labour Exchange to sign for the dole. He will never leave the house without collar and tie. A man without collar and tie is a man with no respect for himself. You never know when the clerk at the Labour Exchange might tell you there's a job going at Rank's Flour Mills or the Limerick Cement Company, and even if it's a laboring job what will they think if you appear without collar and tie?\nBosses and foremen always show him respect and say they're ready to hire him, but when he opens his mouth and they hear the North of Ireland accent, they take a Limerickman instead. That's what he tells Mam by the fire and when she says, Why don't you dress like a proper workingman? he says he'll never give an inch, never let them know, and when she says, Why can't you try to talk like a Limerickman? he says he'll never sink that low and the greatest sorrow of his life is that his sons are now afflicted with the Limerick accent. She says, Sorry for your troubles and I hope that's all you'll ever have, and he says that some day, with God's help, we'll get out of Limerick and far from the Shannon that kills.\nI ask Dad what afflicted means and he says, Sickness, son, and things that don't fit.\nWhen he's not looking for work Dad goes for long walks, miles into the country. He asks farmers if they need any help, that he grew up on a farm and can do anything. If they hire him he goes to work right away with his cap on and his collar and tie. He works so hard and long the farmers have to tell him to stop. They wonder how a man can work through a long hot day with no thought of food or drink. Dad smiles. He never brings home the money he earns on farms. That money seems to be different from the dole, which is supposed to be brought home. He takes the farm money to the pub and drinks it. If he's not home when the Angelus rings at six o'clock Mam knows he had a day of work. She hopes he might think of his family and pass the pub even once, but he never does. She hopes he might bring home something from the farm, potatoes, cabbage, turnips, carrots, but he'll never bring home anything because he'd never stoop so low as to ask a farmer for anything. Mam says 'tis all right for her to be begging at the St. Vincent de Paul Society for a docket for food but he can't stick a few spuds in his pocket. He says it's different for a man. You have to keep the dignity. Wear your collar and tie, keep up the appearance, and never ask for anything. Mam says, I hope it keeps fine for you.\nWhen the farm money is gone he rolls home singing and crying over Ireland and his dead children, mostly about Ireland. If he sings Roddy McCorley, it means he had only the price of a pint or two. If he sings Kevin Barry, it means he had a good day, that he is now falling down drunk and ready to get us out of bed, line us up and make us promise to die for Ireland, unless Mam tells him leave us alone or she'll brain him with the poker.\nYou wouldn't do that, Angela.\nI would and more. You better stop the nonsense and go to bed.\nBed, bed, bed. What's the use of going to bed? If I go to bed I'll\nonly have to get up again and I can't sleep in a place where there's a river sending poison to us in mist and fog.\nHe goes to bed, pounds the wall with his fist, sings a woeful song, falls asleep. He's up at daylight because no one should sleep beyond the dawn. He wakes Malachy and me and we're tired from being kept up the night before with his talking and singing. We complain and say we're sick, we're tired, but he pulls back the overcoats that cover us and forces us out on the floor. It's December and it's freezing and we can see our breath. We pee into the bucket by the bedroom door and run down stairs for the warmth of the fire Dad has already started. We wash our faces and hands in a basin that sits under the water tap by the door. The pipe that leads to the tap has to be held to the wall by a piece of twine looped around a nail. Everything around the tap is damp, the floor, the wall, the chair the basin sits on. The water from the tap is icy and our fingers turn numb. Dad says this is good for us, it will make men of us. He throws the icy water on his face and neck and chest to show there's nothing to fear. We hold our hands to the fire for the heat that's in it but we can't stay there long because we have to drink our tea and eat our bread and go to school. Dad makes us say grace before meals and grace after meals and he tells us be good boys at school because God is watching every move and the slightest disobedience will send us straight to hell where we'll never have to worry about the cold again.\nAnd he smiles.\nTwo weeks before Christmas Malachy and I come home from school in a heavy rain and when we push in the door we find the kitchen empty. The table and chairs and trunk are gone and the fire is dead in the grate. The Pope is still there and that means we haven't moved again. Dad would never move without the Pope. The kitchen floor is wet, little pools of water all around, and the walls are twinkling with the damp. There's a noise upstairs and when we go up we find Dad and Mam and the missing furniture. It's nice and warm there with a fire blazing in the grate, Mam sitting in the bed, and Dad reading The Irish Press and smoking a cigarette by the fire. Mam tells us there was a terrible flood, that the rain came down the lane and poured in under our door. They tried to stop it with rags but they only turned sopping wet and let the rain in. People emptying their buckets made it worse and there was a sickening stink in the kitchen. She thinks we should stay upstairs as long as there is rain. We'll be warm through the winter months and then we can go downstairs in the springtime if there is any sign of a dryness in the walls or the floor. Dad says it's like going away on our holidays to a warm foreign place like Italy. That's what we'll call the upstairs from now on, Italy. Malachy says the Pope is still on the wall downstairs and he's going to be all cold and couldn't we bring him up? but Mam says, No, he's going to stay where he is because I don't want him on the wall glaring at me in the bed. Isn't it enough that we dragged him all the way from Brooklyn to Belfast to Dublin to Limerick? All I want now is a little peace, ease and comfort....\nMam takes Malachy and me to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to stand in the queue and see if there's any chance of getting something for the Christmas dinner-a goose or a ham, but the man says everyone in\nLimerick is desperate this Christmas. He gives her a docket for groceries at McGrath's shop and another one for the butcher.\nNo goose, says the butcher, no ham. No fancy items when you bring the docket from the St. Vincent de Paul. What you can have now, missus, is black pudding and tripe or a sheep's head or a nice pig's head. No harm in a pig's head, missus, plenty of meat and children love it, slice that cheek, slather it with mustard and you're in heaven, though I suppose they wouldn't have the likes of that in America where they're mad for the steak and all classes of poultry, flying, walking or swimming itself.\nHe tells Mam, no, she can't have boiled bacon or sausages and if she has any sense she'll take the pig's head before they're all gone the way the poor people of Limerick are clamoring for them.\nMam says the pig's head isn't right for Christmas and he says 'tis more than the Holy Family had in that cold stable in Bethlehem long ago. You wouldn't find them complaining if someone offered them a nice fat pig's head.\nNo, they wouldn't complain, says Mam, but they'd never eat the pig's head. They were Jewish.\nAnd what does that have to do with it? A pig's head is a pig's head.\nAnd a Jew is a Jew and 'tis against their religion and I don't blame them.\nThe butcher says, Are you a bit of an expert, missus, on the Jews and the pig.\nI am not, says Mam, but there was a Jewish woman, Mrs. Leibowitz, in New York, and I don't know what we would have done without her.\nThe butcher takes the pig's head off a shelf and when Malachy says, Ooh, look at the dead dog, the butcher and Mam burst out laughing. He wraps the head in newspaper, hands it to Mam and says, Happy Christmas. Then he wraps up some sausages and tells her, Take these sausages for your breakfast on Christmas Day. Mam says, Oh, I can't afford sausages, and he says, Am I asking you for money? Am I? Take these sausages. They might help make up for the lack of a goose or a ham.\nSure, you don't have to do that, says Mam.\nI know that, missus. If I had to do it, I wouldn't.\nMam says she has a pain in her back, that I'll have to carry the\npig's head. I hold it against my chest but it's damp and when the newspaper begins to fall away everyone can see the head. Mam says, I'm ashamed of me life that the world should know we're having pig's head for Christmas. Boys from Leamy's National School see me and they point and laugh. Aw, Gawd, look at Frankie McCourt an'his pig's snout. Is that what the Yanks ate for Christmas dinner, Frankie?\nOne calls to another, Hey, Christy, do you know how to ate a pig's\nhead?\nNo, I don't, Paddy.\nGrab him by the ears an' chew the face offa him.\nAnd Christy says, Hey, Paddy, do you know the only part of the pig the McCourts don't ate?\nNo, I don't, Christy.\nThe only part they don't ate is the oink.\nAfter a few streets the newspaper is gone altogether and everyone\ncan see the pig's head. His nose is flat against my chest and pointing up at my chin and I feel sorry for him because he's dead and the world is\nlaughing at him. My sister and two brothers are dead, too, but if anyone laughed at them I'd hit them with a rock.\nI wish Dad would come and help us because Mam has to stop every few steps and lean against a wall. She's holding her back and telling us she'll never be able to climb Barrack Hill. Even if Dad came he wouldn't be much use because he never carries anything, parcels, bags, packages. If you carry such things you lose your dignity. That's what he says. He carried the twins when they were tired and he carried the Pope, but that was not the same as carrying ordinary things like a pig's head. He tells Malachy and me that when you grow up you have to wear a collar and tie and never let people see you carry things.\nHe's upstairs sitting by the fire, smoking a cigarette, reading The Irish Press, which he loves because it's De Valera's paper and he thinks De Valera is the greatest man in the world. He looks at me and the pig's head and tells Mam it's a disgraceful thing to let a boy carry an object like that through the streets of Limerick. She takes off her coat and eases herself into the bed and tells him that next Christmas he can go out and find the dinner. She's worn out and gasping for a cup of tea so would he drop his grand airs, boil the water for the tea and fry some bread before his two small sons starve to death.\nOn Christmas morning he lights the fire early so that we can have sausages and bread and tea. Mam sends me to Grandma to see if we can borrow a pot for the pig's head. Grandma says, What are ye having for yeer dinner? Pig's head! Jesus, Mary an' Joseph, that's goin' beyond the beyonds. Couldn't your father get out and find a ham or a goose at least? What kind of man is he at all, at all?\nMam puts the head in the pot, just covered with water, and while the pig is boiling away Dad takes Malachy and me to Mass at the Redemptorist church. It's warm in the church and sweet with flowers and incense and candles. He takes us to see the Baby Jesus in the crib. He's a big fat baby with fair curls like Malachy. Dad tells us that's Jesus' mother there, Mary, in the blue dress, and his father, St. Joseph, the old man with the beard. He says they're sad because they know Jesus will grow up and be killed so that we can all go to heaven. I ask why the Baby Jesus has to die and Dad says you can't ask questions like that. Malachy says, Why? and Dad tells him be quiet.\nMam is in a terrible state at home. There isn't enough coal to cook the dinner, the water isn't boiling anymore and she says she's demented with worry. We'll have to go down the Dock Road again to see if there's any coal or turf lying around from the lorries. Surely we'll find something on the road this day of all days. Even the poorest of the poor don't go out on Christmas Day picking coal off the road. There's no use asking Dad to go because he will never stoop that low and even if he did he won't carry things through the streets. It's a rule he has. Mam can't go because of the pain in her back.\nShe says, You'll have to go, Frank, and take Malachy with you.\nIt's a long way to the Dock Road but we don't mind because our bellies are filled with sausages and bread and it's not raining. We carry a canvas bag Mam borrowed from Mrs. Hannon next door and Mam is right, there is no one on the Dock Road. The poor are all at home having pig's head or maybe a goose and we have the Dock Road to ourselves. We find bits of coal and turf stuck in cracks on the road and in the walls of the coal yards. We find bits of paper and cardboard that will be useful in starting the fire again. We're wandering around trying to fill the bag\nwhen Pa Keating comes along. He must have washed himself for Christmas because he's not as black as he was when Eugene died. He wants to know what we're doing with that bag and when Malachy tells him he says, Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! Christmas Day and ye don't have a fire for yeer pig's head. That's a bloody disgrace.\nHe takes us to South's pub, which is not supposed to be open, but he's a regular customer and there's a back door for men who want their pint to celebrate the birthday of the Baby Jesus above in the crib. He orders his pint and lemonade for us and asks the man if there's any chance of getting a few lumps of coal. The man says he's been serving drink for twenty-seven years and nobody ever asked him for coal before. Pa says it would be a favor and the man says if Pa asked for the moon he'd fly up and bring it back. The man leads us to the coal hole under the stairs and tells us take what we can carry. It's real coal and not bits from the Dock Road and if we can't carry it we can drag it along the ground.\nIt takes us a long time to go from South's pub to Barrack Hill because of a hole in the bag. I pull the bag and it's Malachy's job to pick up the lumps that fall through the hole and put them back again. Then it starts to rain and we can't stand in a doorway till it passes because we have that coal and it's leaving a black trail along the pavement and Malachy is turning black from picking up the lumps, pushing them into the bag and wiping the rain from his face with his wet black hands. I tell him he's black, he tells me I'm black, and a woman in a shop tells us get away from that door, 'tis Christmas Day and she doesn't want to be looking at Africa.\nWe have to keep dragging the bag or we'll never have our Christmas dinner. It will take ages to get a fire going and ages more to get our dinner because the water has to be boiling when Mam puts in the head of cabbage and the potatoes to keep the pig company in the pot. We drag the bag up O'Connell Avenue and we see people in their houses sitting around tables with all kinds of decorations and bright lights. At one house they push up the window and the children point and laugh and call to us, Look at the Zulus. Where are yeer spears?\nMalachy makes faces at them and wants to throw coal at them but I tell him if he throws coal there's less for the pig and we'll never get our dinner.\nThe downstairs in our house is a lake again from the rain pouring under the door but it doesn't matter because we're drenched anyway and we can wade through the water. Dad comes down and drags the bag upstairs to Italy. He says we're good boys for getting so much coal, that the Dock Road must have been covered with it. When Mam sees us she starts to laugh, and then she cries. She's laughing because we're so black and crying because we're sopping wet. She tells us take off all our clothes and she washes the coal off our hands and faces. She tells Dad the pig's head can wait a while so that we can have a jam jar of hot tea.\nIt's raining outside and there's a lake downstairs in our kitchen but up here in Italy the fire is going again and the room is so dry and warm that, after our tea, Malachy and I doze off in the bed and we don't wake till Dad tells us the dinner is ready. Our clothes are still wet, so Malachy sits on the trunk at the table wrapped in Mam's red American overcoat and I'm wrapped in an old coat that Mam's father left behind when he went to Australia.\nThere are delicious smells in the room, cabbage, potatoes, and the pig's head, but when Dad lifts the head from the pot to a plate Malachy says, Oh, the poor pig. I don't want to eat the poor pig.\nMam says, If you were hungry you'd eat it. Now stop the nonsense and eat your dinner.\nDad says, Wait a minute. He takes slices from the two cheeks, places them on our plates and smears them with mustard. He takes the plate that holds the pig's head and puts it on the floor under the table. Now, he says to Malachy, that's ham, and Malachy eats it because he's not looking at what it came from and it isn't pig's head anymore. The cabbage is soft and hot and there are plenty of potatoes with butter and salt. Mam peels our potatoes but Dad eats his skin and all. He says all the nourishment of a potato is in the skin and Mam says it's a good thing he's not eating eggs, he'd be chewing the shells and all.\nHe says he would, and it's a disgrace that the Irish throw out millions of potato skins every day and that's why thousands are dying of consumption and surely there's nourishment in the shell of an egg since waste is the eighth deadly sin. If he had his way, and Mam says, Never mind your way. Eat your dinner.\nHe eats half a potato with its skin on and puts the other half back in the pot. He eats a small slice of the pig's cheek and a leaf of cabbage and leaves the rest on his plate for Malachy and me. He makes more tea and we have that with bread and jam so that no one can say we didn't have a sweet on Christmas Day.\nIt's dark now and still raining outside and the coal is glowing in the grate where Mam and Dad sit and smoke their cigarettes. There's nothing to do when your clothes are wet but get back into bed where it's cozy and your father can tell you a story about how Cuchulain became a Catholic and you fall asleep and dream about the pig standing in the crib at the Redemptorist church crying because he and the Baby Jesus and Cuchulain all have to grow up and die.\nThe angel that brought Margaret and the twins comes again and brings us another brother, Michael. Dad says he found Michael on the seventh step of the stairs to Italy. He says that's what you have to watch for when you ask for a new baby, the Angel on the Seventh Step.\nMalachy wants to know how you can get a new brother from the Angel on the Seventh Step if you don't have any stairs in your house and Dad tells him that asking too many questions is an affliction.\nMalachy wants to know what an affliction is.\nAffliction. I'd like to know what that word means. Affliction, but Dad says, Och, child, the world is an affliction and everything in it, puts on his cap and goes to the Bedford Row Hospital to see Mam and Michael. She's in the hospital with the pain in her back and she has the baby with her to make sure he was healthy when he was left on the seventh step. I don't understand this because I'm sure angels would never leave a sick baby on the seventh step. There's no use asking Dad or Mam about this. They say, You're getting as bad as your brother for asking questions. Go play.\nI know that big people don't like questions from children. They can ask all the questions they like, How's school? Are you a good boy? Did you say your prayers? but if you ask them did they say their prayers you might be hit on the head.\nDad brings Mam home with the new baby and she has to stay in bed for a few days with the pain in her back. She says this baby is the\nspitting image of our sister who died, with his wavy black hair, his lovely blue eyes, and the gorgeous eyebrows. That's what Mam says.\nI want to know if the baby will be spitting. I also want to know which is the seventh step because there are nine steps on the stairs and I'd like to know if you count from the bottom or the top. Dad doesn't mind answering this question. Angels come down from above, he says, and not up from kitchens like ours which are lakes from October till April.\nSo I find the seventh step by counting from the top.\nThe baby Michael has a cold. His head is stuffed and he can barely breathe. Mam worries because it's Sunday and the Dispensary for the poor is closed. If you go to the doctor's house and the maid sees you're from the lower classes she tells you go to the Dispensary where you belong. If you tell her the child is dying in your arms she'll say the doctor is in the country riding his horse.\nMam cries because the baby is struggling to get air through his mouth. She tries to clear his nostrils with a bit of rolled up paper but she's afraid to push it too far up. Dad says, There's no need for that. You're not supposed to be pushing things inside a child's head. It looks like he's going to kiss the baby. Instead, he has his mouth on the little nose and he's sucking sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head. He spits it into the fire, Michael gives out a loud cry and you can see him drawing the air into his head and kicking his legs and laughing. Mam looks at Dad as if he just came down from heaven and Dad says, That's what we did in Antrim long before there were doctors riding their horses.\nMichael entitles us to a few extra shillings on the dole but Mam says it isn't enough and now she has to go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society for food. One night there is a knock on the door and Mam sends me down to see who it is. There are two men from the St. Vincent de Paul and they want to see my mother and father. I tell them my parents are upstairs in Italy and they say, What?\nUpstairs where 'tis dry. I'll tell them.\nThey want to know what that little shed is beside our front door. I tell them it's the lavatory. They want to know why it isn't in the back of the house and I tell them it's the lavatory for the whole lane and it's a good thing it's not in the back of our house or we'd have people traipsing through our kitchen with buckets that would make you sick.\nThey say, Are you sure there's one lavatory for the whole lane? I am.\nThey say, Mother of God.\nMam calls down from Italy. Who's down there?\nThe men.\nWhat men? From the St. Vincent de Paul.\nThey're careful the way they step into the lake in the kitchen and\nthey make tsk tsk and tut tut noises and they tell one another, Isn't this a disgrace? till they get upstairs to Italy. They tell Mam and Dad they're sorry to disturb them but the Society has to be sure they're helping deserving cases. Mam offers them a cup of tea but they look around and say, No, thank you. They want to know why we're living upstairs. They want to know about the lavatory. They ask questions because big people can ask all the questions they like and write in notebooks, especially when they're wearing collars and ties and suits. They ask how old Michael is, how much Dad gets at the Labour Exchange, when did he last have a job, why doesn't he have a job now and what class of an accent is that he has?\nDad tells them the lavatory could kill us with every class of disease, that the kitchen floods in the winter and we have to move upstairs to stay dry. He says the River Shannon is responsible for all the dampness in the world and killing us one by one.\nMalachy tells them we're living in Italy and they smile.\nMam asks if there's any chance of getting boots for Malachy and me and they say she'll have to come down to Ozanam House and apply. She says she hasn't been feeling well since the baby came and she wouldn't be able to stand long in a queue, but they say everyone has to be treated the same, even a woman down in the Irishtown that had triplets and, thank you, we'll make our report to the Society.\nWhen they're leaving Malachy wants to show them where the angel left Michael on the seventh step but Dad tells him, Not now, not now. Malachy cries and one of the men gives him a piece of toffee from his pocket and I wish I had something to cry about so that I'd get a piece, too.\nI have to go downstairs again and show the men where to step to keep their feet dry. They keep shaking their heads and saying, God Almighty and Mother of God, this is desperate. That's not Italy they have upstairs, that's Calcutta.\nDad is telling Mam up in Italy she should never beg like that. What do you mean, beg?\nDon't you have any pride, begging for boots like that?\nAnd what would you do, Mr. Grand Manner? Would you let them go\nbarefoot?\nI'd rather fix the shoes they have.\nThe shoes they have are falling to pieces.\nI can fix them, he says.\nYou can't fix anything. You're useless, she says.\nHe comes home the next day with an old bicycle tire. He sends me to\nMr. Hannon next door for the loan of a last and a hammer. He takes Mam's sharp knife and he hacks at the tire till he has pieces to fit on the soles and heels of our shoes. Mam tells him he's going to destroy the shoes altogether but he pounds away with the hammer, driving the nails through the rubber pieces and into the shoes. Mam says, God above, if you left the shoes alone they'd last till Easter, at least, and we might get the boots from the St. Vincent de Paul. But he won't stop till the soles and heels are covered with squares of rubber tire which stick out on each side of the shoe and flop before and behind. He makes us put on the shoes and tells us our feet will be good and warm but we don't want to wear them anymore because the tire pieces are so lumpy we stumble when we walk around Italy. He sends me back to Mr. Hannon with the last and hammer and Mrs. Hannon says, God above, what's up with your shoes? She laughs and Mr. Hannon shakes his head and I feel ashamed. I don't want to go to school next day and I pretend to be sick but Dad gets us up and gives us our fried bread and tea and tells us we should be grateful we have any shoes at all, that there are boys in Leamy's National School who go to school barefoot on bitter days. On our way to school Leamy's boys laugh at us because the tire pieces are so thick they add a few inches to our height and the boys say, How's the air up there? There are six or seven barefoot boys in my class and they don't say anything and I wonder if it's better to have shoes with rubber tires that make you trip and stumble or to go barefoot. If you have no shoes at all you'll have all the barefoot boys on your side. If you have rubber tires on your shoes\nyou're all alone with your brother and you have to fight your own battles. I sit on a bench in the schoolyard shed and take off my shoes and stockings but when I go into the class the master wants to know where my shoes are. He knows I'm not one of the barefoot boys and he makes me go back to the yard, bring in the shoes and put them on. Then he says to the class, There is sneering here. There is jeering at the misfortunes of others. Is there anyone in this class that thinks he's perfect? Raise your hands.\nThere are no hands. Is there anyone in this class that comes from a rich family with money galore to spend on shoes? Raise your hands.\nThere are no hands.\nHe says, There are boys here who have to mend their shoes whatever way they can. There are boys in this class with no shoes at all. It's not their fault and it's no shame. Our Lord had no shoes. He died shoeless. Do you see Him hanging on the cross sporting shoes? Do you, boys?\nNo, sir.\nWhat is it you don't see Our Lord doing?\nHanging on the cross and sporting shoes, sir.\nNow if I hear of one boy in this class jeering and sneering at\nMcCourt or his brother over their\nwill come out, boys?\nThe stick, sir.\nThe stick will sting, boys.\nair, it will land on the backside\nsneers. Where will it land, boys?\nshoes the stick will come out. What\nThe ash plant will whistle through the\nof the boy that jeers, the boy that\nOn the boy that jeers, sir.\nAnd?\nThe boy that sneers, sir.\nThe boys bother us no more and we wear our shoes with the rubber\ntires the few weeks to Easter when the St. Vincent de Paul Society gives us the gift of boots.\nIf I have to get up in the middle of the night to pee in the bucket I go to the top of the stairs and look down to see if the angel might be on the seventh step. Sometimes I'm sure there's a light there and if everyone's asleep I sit on the step in case the angel might be bringing another baby or just coming for a visit. I ask Mam if the angel just brings the babies and then forgets about them. She says, Of course not. The angel never forgets the babies and comes back to make sure the baby is happy.\nI could ask the angel all kinds of questions and I'm sure he'd answer, unless it's a girl angel. But I'm sure a girl angel would answer questions, too. I never heard anyone say they didn't.\nI sit on the seventh step a long time and I'm sure the angel is there. I tell him all the things you can't tell your mother or father for fear of being hit on the head or told go out and play. I tell him all about school and how I'm afraid of the master and his stick when he roars at us in Irish and I still don't know what he's talking about because I came from America and the other boys were learning Irish a year before me.\nI stay on the seventh step till it gets too cold or Dad gets up and tells me go back to bed. He's the one who told me the angel comes to the seventh step in the first place and you'd think he'd know why I'm sitting there. I told him one night that I was waiting for the angel, and he said, Och, now, Francis, you're a bit of a dreamer.\nI get back into bed but I can hear him whisper to my mother. The poor wee lad was sitting on the stairs talking away to an angel.\nHe laughs and my mother laughs and I think, Isn't it curious the way big people laugh over the angel who brought them a new child.\nBefore Easter we move back downstairs to Ireland. Easter is better than Christmas because the air is warmer, the walls are not dripping with the damp, and the kitchen isn't a lake anymore, and if we're up early we might catch the sun slanting for a minute through the kitchen window.\nIn fine weather men sit outside smoking their cigarettes if they have them, looking at the world and watching us play. Women stand with their arms folded, chatting. They don't sit because all they do is stay at home, take care of the children, clean the house and cook a bit and the men need the chairs. The men sit because they're worn out from walking to the Labour Exchange every morning to sign for the dole, discussing the world's problems and wondering what to do with the rest of the day. Some stop at the bookie to study the form and place a shilling or two on a sure thing. Some spend hours in the Carnegie Library reading English and Irish newspapers. A man on the dole needs to keep up with things because all the other men on the dole are experts on what's going on in the world. A man on the dole must be ready in case another man on the dole brings up Hitler or Mussolini or the terrible state of the Chinese millions. A man on the dole goes home after a day with the bookie or the newspaper and his wife will not begrudge him a few minutes with the ease and peace of his cigarette and his tea and time to sit in his chair and think of the world.\nEaster is better than Christmas because Dad takes us to the Redemptorist church where all the priests wear white and sing. They're happy because Our Lord is in heaven. I ask Dad if the baby in the crib is dead and he says, No, He was thirty-three when He died and there He is, hanging on the cross. I don't understand how He grew up so fast that He's hanging there with a hat made of thorns and blood everywhere, dripping from His head, His hands, His feet, and a big hole near His belly.\nDad says I'll understand when I grow up. He tells me that all the time now and I want to be big like him so that I can understand everything. It must be lovely to wake up in the morning and understand everything. I wish I could be like all the big people in the church, standing and kneeling and praying and understanding everything.\nAt the Mass people go up to the altar and the priest puts something into their mouths. They come back to their seats with their heads down, their mouths moving. Malachy says he's hungry and he wants some, too. Dad says, Shush, that's Holy Communion, the body and blood of Our Lord.\nBut, Dad.\nShush, it's a mystery.\nThere's no use asking more questions. If you ask a question they\ntell you it's a mystery, you'll understand when you grow up, be a good boy, ask your mother, ask your father, for the love o' Jesus leave me alone, go out and play.\nDad gets his first job in Limerick at the cement factory and Mam is happy. She won't have to stand in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society asking for clothes and boots for Malachy and me. She says it's not begging, it's charity, but Dad says it's begging and shameful. Mam says she can now pay off the few pounds she owes at Kathleen O'Connell's shop and she can pay back what she owes her own mother. She hates to be under obligation to anyone, especially her own mother.\nThe cement factory is miles outside Limerick and that means Dad has to be out of the house by six in the morning. He doesn't mind because he's used to the long walks. The night before Mam makes him a flask of tea, a sandwich, a hard-boiled egg. She feels sorry for him the way he has to walk three miles out and three miles back. A bicycle would be handy but you'd have to be working a year for the price of it.\nFriday is payday and Mam is out of the bed early, cleaning the house and singing.\nAnyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this...\nThere isn't much to clean in the house. She sweeps the kitchen floor and the floor of Italy upstairs. She washes the four jam jars we use for mugs. She says if Dad's job lasts we'll get proper cups and maybe saucers and some day, with the help of God and His Blessed Mother, we'll have sheets on the bed and if we save a long time a blanket or two instead of those old coats which people must have left behind during the Great Famine. She boils water and washes the rags that keep Michael from shitting all over the pram and the house itself. Oh, she says, we'll have a lovely tea when your Pop brings home the wages tonight.\nPop. She's in a good mood.\nSirens and whistles go off all over the city when the men finish work at half-past five. Malachy and I are excited because we know that when your father works and brings home the wages you get the Friday Penny. We know this from other boys whose fathers work and we know that after your tea you can go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and buy sweets. If your mother is in a good mood she might even give you tuppence to go to the Lyric Cinema the next day to see a film with James Cagney.\nThe men who work in factories and shops in the city are coming into the lanes to have their supper, wash themselves and go to the pub. The women go to the films at the Coliseum or the Lyric Cinema. They buy sweets and Wild Woodbine cigarettes and if their husbands are working a long time they treat themselves to boxes of Black Magic chocolates. They love the romance films and they have a great time crying their eyes out when there's an unhappy ending or a handsome lover goes away to be shot by Hindus and other non-Catholics.\nWe have to wait a long time for Dad to walk the miles from the cement factory. We can't have our tea till he's home and that's very hard because you smell the cooking of other families in the lane. Mam says it's a good thing payday is Friday when you can't eat meat because the smell of bacon or sausages in other houses would drive her out of her mind. We can still have bread and cheese and a nice jam jar of tea with lashings of milk and sugar and what more do you want?\nThe women are gone to the cinemas, the men are in the pubs, and still Dad isn't home. Mam says it's a long way to the cement factory even if he's a fast walker. She says that but her eyes are watery and she's not singing anymore. She's sitting by the fire smoking a Wild Woodbine she got on credit from Kathleen O'Connell. The fag is the only luxury she has and she'll never forget Kathleen for her goodness. She doesn't know how long she can keep the water boiling in this kettle. There's no use making the tea till Dad gets home because it will be stewed, coddled, boiled and unfit to drink. Malachy says he's hungry and she gives him a piece of bread and cheese to keep him going. She says, This job could be\nthe saving of us. 'Tis hard enough for him to get a job with his northern accent and if he loses this one I don't know what we're going to do.\nThe darkness is in the lane and we have to light a candle. She has to give us our tea and bread and cheese because we're so hungry we can't wait another minute. She sits at the table, eats a bit of bread and cheese, smokes her Wild Woodbine. She goes to the door to see if Dad is coming down the lane and she talks about the paydays when we searched for him all over Brooklyn. She says, Some day we'll all go back to America and we'll have a nice warm place to live and a lavatory down the hall like the one in Classon Avenue and not this filthy thing outside our door.\nThe women are coming home from the cinemas, laughing, and the men, singing, from the pubs. Mam says there's no use waiting up any longer. If Dad stays in the pubs till closing time there will be nothing left from his wages and we might as well go to bed. She lies in her bed with Michael in her arms. It's quiet in the lane and I can hear her crying even though she pulls an old coat over her face and I can hear in the distance, my father.\nI know it's my father because he's the only one in Limerick who sings that song from the North, Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today. He comes round the corner at the top of the lane and starts Kevin Barry. He sings a verse, stops, holds on to a wall, cries over Kevin Barry. People stick their heads out windows and doors and tell him, For Jasus' sake, put a sock in it. Some of us have to get up in the morning for work. Go home and sing your feckin' patriotic songs.\nHe stands in the middle of the lane and tells the world to step outside, he's ready to fight, ready to fight and die for Ireland, which is more than he can say for the men of Limerick, who are known the length and breadth of the world for collaborating with the perfidious Saxons.\nHe's pushing in our door and singing,\nAnd if, when all a vigil keep,\nThe West's asleep, the West's asleep! Alas! and well my Erin weep,\nThat Connacht lies in slumber deep,\nBut hark! a voice like thunder spake 'The West's awake! the West's awake! Sing, Oh, hurrah, let England quake, We'll watch till death for Erin's sake!'\nHe calls from the bottom of the stairs, Angela, Angela, is there a drop of tea in this house?\nShe doesn't answer and he calls again, Francis, Malachy, come down here, boys. I have the Friday Penny for you.\nI want to go down and get the Friday Penny but Mam is sobbing with the coat over her mouth and Malachy says, I don't want his old Friday Penny. He can keep it.\nDad is stumbling up the stairs, making a speech about how we all have to die for Ireland. He lights a match and touches it to the candle by Mam's bed. He holds the candle over his head and marches around the room, singing, See who comes over the red-blossomed heather, Their green banners kissing the pure mountain air, Heads erect, eyes to front,\nstepping proudly together, Sure freedom sits throned on each proud spirit there.\nMichael wakes and lets out a loud cry, the Hannons are banging on the wall next door, Mam is telling Dad he's a disgrace and why doesn't he get out of the house altogether.\nHe stands in the middle of the floor with the candle over his head. He pulls a penny from his pocket and waves it to Malachy and me. Your Friday Penny, boys, he says. I want you to jump out of that bed and line up here like two soldiers and promise to die for Ireland and I'll give the two of you the Friday Penny.\nMalachy sits up in the bed. I don't want it, he says.\nAnd I tell him I don't want it, either.\nDad stands for a minute, swaying, and puts the penny back in his\npocket. He turns toward Mam and she says, You're not sleeping in this bed tonight. He makes his way downstairs with the candle, sleeps on a chair, misses work in the morning, loses the job at the cement factory, and we're back on the dole again.\nIV\nThe master says it's time to prepare for First Confession and First Communion, to know and remember all the questions and answers in the catechism, to become good Catholics, to know the difference between right and wrong, to die for the Faith if called on.\nThe master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk.\nThe master says we're each to bring threepence for the First Communion catechism with the green cover. The catechism has all the questions and answers we have to know by heart before we can receive First Communion. Older boys in the fifth class have the thick Confirmation catechism with the red cover and that costs sixpence. I'd love to be big and important and parade around with the red Confirmation catechism but I don't think I'll live that long the way I'm expected to die for this or that. I want to ask why there are so many big people who haven't died for Ireland or the Faith but I know if you ask a question like that you get you the thump on the head or you're told go out and play.\nIt's very handy to have Mikey Molloy living around the corner from me. He's eleven, he has fits and behind his back we call him Molloy the Fit. People in the lane say the fit is an affliction and now I know what affliction means. Mikey knows everything because he has visions in his fits and he reads books. He's the expert in the lane on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General and he promises, I'll tell you everything, Frankie, when you're eleven like me and you're not so thick and ignorant.\nIt's a good thing he says Frankie so I'll know he's talking to me because he has crossed eyes and you never know who he's looking at. If he's talking to Malachy and I think he's talking to me he might go into a\nrage and have a fit that will carry him off. He says it's a gift to have crossed eyes because you're like a god looking two ways at once and if you had crossed eyes in the ancient Roman times you had no problem getting a good job. If you look at pictures of Roman emperors you'll see there's always a great hint of crossed eyes. When he's not having the fit he sits on the ground at the top of the lane reading the books his father brings home from the Carnegie Library. His mother says books books books, he's ruining his eyes with the reading, he needs an operation to straighten them but who'll pay for it. She tells him if he keeps on straining his eyes they'll float together till he has one eye in the middle of his head. Ever after his father calls him Cyclops, who is in a Greek story.\nNora Molloy knows my mother from the queues at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. She tells Mam that Mikey has more sense than twelve men drinking pints in a pub. He knows the names of all the Popes from St. Peter to Pius the Eleventh. He's only eleven but he's a man, oh, a man indeed. Many a week he saves the family from pure starvation. He borrows a handcart from Aidan Farrell and knocks on doors all over Limerick to see if there are people who want coal or turf delivered, and down the Dock Road he'll go to haul back great bags a hundredweight or more. He'll run messages for old people who can't walk and if they don't have a penny to give him a prayer will do.\nIf he earns a little money he hands it over to his mother, who loves her Mikey. He is her world, her heart's blood, her pulse, and if anything ever happened to him they might as well stick her in the lunatic asylum and throw away the key.\nMikey's father, Peter, is a great champion. He wins bets in the pubs by drinking more pints than anyone. All he has to do is go out to the jakes, stick his finger down his throat and bring it all up so that he can start another round. Peter is such a champion he can stand in the jakes and throw up without using his finger. He's such a champion they could chop off his fingers and he'd carry on regardless. He wins all that money but doesn't bring it home. Sometimes he's like my father and drinks the dole itself and that's why Nora Molloy is often carted off to the lunatic asylum demented with worry over her hungry famishing family. She knows as long as you're in the asylum you're safe from the world and its torments, there's nothing you can do, you're protected, and what's the use of worrying. It's well known that all the lunatics in the asylum have to be dragged in but she's the only one that has to be dragged out, back to her five children and the champion of all pint drinkers.\nYou can tell when Nora Molloy is ready for the asylum when you see her children running around white with flour from poll to toe. That happens when Peter drinks the dole money and leaves her desperate and she knows the men will come to take her away. You know she's inside frantic with the baking. She wants to make sure the children won't starve while she's gone and she roams Limerick begging for flour. She goes to priests, nuns, Protestants, Quakers. She goes to Rank's Flour Mills and begs for the sweepings from the floor. She bakes day and night. Peter begs her to stop but she screams, This is what comes of drinking the dole. He tells her the bread will only go stale. There's no use talking to her. Bake bake bake. If she had the money she'd bake all the flour in Limerick and regions beyond. If the men didn't come from the lunatic asylum to take her away she'd bake till she fell to the floor.\nThe children stuff themselves with so much bread people in the lane say they're looking like loaves. Still the bread goes stale and Mikey is so bothered by the waste he talks to a rich woman with a cookbook and she tells him make bread pudding. He boils the hard bread in water and sour milk and throws in a cup of sugar and his brother loves it even if that's all they have the fortnight their mother is in the lunatic asylum.\nMy father says, Do they take her away because she's gone mad baking bread or does she go mad baking bread because they're taking her away?\nNora comes home calm as if she had been at the seaside. She always says, Where's Mikey? Is he alive? She worries over Mikey because he's not a proper Catholic and if he had a fit and died who knows where he might wind up in the next life. He's not a proper Catholic because he could never receive his First Communion for fear of getting anything on his tongue that might cause a fit and choke him. The master tried over and over with bits of the Limerick Leader but Mikey kept spitting them out till the master got into a state and sent him to the priest, who wrote to the bishop, who said, Don't bother me, handle it yourself. The master sent a note home saying Mikey was to practice receiving Communion with his father or mother but even they couldn't get him to swallow a piece of the Limerick Leader in the shape of a wafer. They even tried a piece of bread shaped like the wafer with bread and jam and it was no use. The priest tells Mrs. Molloy not to worry. God moves in mysterious ways His wonders to perform and surely He has a special purpose for Mikey, fits and all. She says, Isn't it remarkable he can swally all kinds of sweets and buns but if he has to swally the body of Our Lord he goes into a fit? Isn't that remarkable? She worries Mikey might have the fit and die and go to hell if he has any class of a sin on his soul though everyone knows he's an angel out of heaven. Mikey tells her God is not going to afflict you with the fit and then boot you into hell on top of it. What kind of a God would do a thing like that?\nAre you sure, Mikey?\nI am. I read it in a book.\nHe sits under the lamppost at the top of the lane and laughs over\nhis First Communion day, which was all a cod. He couldn't swallow the wafer but did that stop his mother from parading him around Limerick in his little black suit for The Collection? She said to Mikey, Well, I'm not lying so I'm not. I'm only saying to the neighbors, Here's Mikey in his First Communion suit. That's all I'm saying, mind you. Here's Mikey. If they think you swallied your First Communion who am I to contradict them and disappoint them? Mikey's father said, Don't worry, Cyclops. You have loads of time. Jesus didn't become a proper Catholic till he took the bread and wine at the Last Supper and He was thirty-three years of age. Nora Molloy said, Will you stop calling him Cyclops? He has two eyes in his head and he's not a Greek. But Mikey's father, champion of all pint drinkers, is like my uncle Pa Keating, he doesn't give a fiddler's fart what the world says and that's the way I'd like to be myself.\nMikey tells me the best thing about First Communion is The Collection. Your mother has to get you a new suit somehow so she can show you off to the neighbors and relations and they give you sweets and money and you can go to the Lyric Cinema to see Charlie Chaplin.\nWhat about James Cagney?\nNever mind James Cagney. Lots of blather. Charlie Chaplin is your only man. But you have to be with your mother on The Collection. The grown-up people of Limerick are not going to be handing out money to\nevery little Tom Dick and Mick with a First Communion suit that doesn't have his mother with him.\nMikey got over five shillings on his First Communion day and ate so many sweets and buns he threw up in the Lyric Cinema and Frank Goggin, the ticket man, kicked him out. He says he didn't care because he had money left over and went to the Savoy Cinema the same day for a pirate film and ate Cadbury chocolate and drank lemonade till his stomach stuck out a mile. He can't wait for Confirmation day because you're older, there's another collection and that brings more money than First Communion. He'll go to the cinema the rest of his life, sit next to girls from lanes and do dirty things like an expert. He loves his mother but he'll never get married for fear he might have a wife in and out of the lunatic asylum. What's the use of getting married when you can sit in cinemas and do dirty things with girls from lanes who don't care what they do because they already did it with their brothers. If you don't get married you won't have any children at home bawling for tea and bread and gasping with the fit and looking in every direction with their eyes. When he's older he'll go to the pub like his father, drink pints galore, stick the finger down the throat to bring it all up, drink more pints, win the bets and bring the money home to his mother to keep her from going demented.\nHe says he's not a proper Catholic which means he's doomed so he can do anything he bloody well likes. He says, I'll tell you more when you grow up, Frankie. You're too young now and you don't know your arse from your elbow.\nThe master, Mr. Benson, is very old. He roars and spits all over us every day. The boys in the front row hope he has no diseases for it's the spit that carries all the diseases and he might be spreading consumption right and left. He tells us we have to know the catechism backwards, forwards and sideways. We have to know the Ten Commandments, the Seven Virtues, Divine and Moral, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Deadly Sins. We have to know by heart all the prayers, the Hail Mary, the Our Father, the Confiteor, the Apostles' Creed, the Act of Contrition, the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary. We have to know them in Irish and English and if we forget an Irish word and use English he goes into a rage and goes at us with the stick. If he had his way we'd be learning our religion in Latin, the language of the saints who communed intimately with God and His Holy Mother, the language of the early Christians, who huddled in the catacombs and went forth to die on rack and sword, who expired in the foaming jaws of the ravenous lion. Irish is fine for patriots, English for traitors and informers, but it's the Latin that gains us entrance to heaven itself. It's the Latin the martyrs prayed in when the barbarians pulled out their nails and cut their skin off inch by inch. He tells us we're a disgrace to Ireland and her long sad history, that we'd be better off in Africa praying to bush or tree. He tells us we're hopeless, the worst class he ever had for First Communion but as sure as God made little apples he'll make Catholics of us, he'll beat the idler out of us and the Sanctifying Grace into us.\nBrendan Quigley raises his hand. We call him Question Quigley because he's always asking questions. He can't help himself. Sir, he says, what's Sanctifying Grace?\nThe master rolls his eyes to heaven. He's going to kill Quigley. Instead he barks at him, Never mind what's Sanctifying Grace, Quigley. That's none of your business. You're here to learn the catechism and do\nwhat you're told. You're not here to be asking questions. There are too many people wandering the world asking questions and that's what has us in the state we're in and if I find any boy in this class asking questions I won't be responsible for what happens. Do you hear me, Quigley?\nI do.\nI do what?\nI do, sir.\nHe goes on with his speech, There are boys in this class who will\nnever know the Sanctifying Grace. And why? Because of the greed. I have heard them abroad in the schoolyard talking about First Communion day, the happiest day of your life. Are they talking about receiving the body and blood of Our Lord? Oh, no. Those greedy little blaguards are talking about the money they'll get, The Collection. They'll go from house to house in their little suits like beggars for The Collection. And will they take any of that money and send it to the little black babies in Africa? Will they think of those little pagans doomed forever for lack of baptism and knowledge of the True Faith? Little black babies denied knowledge of the Mystical Body of Christ? Limbo is packed with little black babies flying around and crying for their mothers because they'll never be admitted to the ineffable presence of Our Lord and the glorious company of saints, martyrs, virgins. Oh, no. It's off to the cinemas, our First Communion boys run to wallow in the filth spewed across the world by the devil's henchmen in Hollywood. Isn't that right, McCourt?\n'Tis, sir.\nQuestion Quigley raises his hand again. There are looks around the room and we wonder if it's suicide he's after.\nWhat's henchmen, sir?\nThe master's face goes white, then red. His mouth tightens and opens and spit flies everywhere. He walks to Question and drags him from his seat. He snorts and stutters and his spit flies around the room. He flogs Question across the shoulders, the bottom, the legs. He grabs him by the collar and drags him to the front of the room.\nLook at this specimen, he roars.\nQuestion is shaking and crying. I'm sorry, sir.\nThe master mocks him. I'm sorry, sir. What are you sorry for? I'm sorry I asked the question. I'll never ask a question again,\nsir.\nThe day you do, Quigley, will be the day you wish God would take\nyou to His bosom. What will you wish, Quigley?\nThat God will take me to His bosom, sir.\nGo back to your seat, you omadhaun, you poltroon, you thing from\nthe far dark corner of a bog.\nHe sits down with the stick before him on the desk. He tells\nQuestion to stop the whimpering and be a man. If he hears a single boy in this class asking foolish questions or talking about The Collection again he'll flog that boy till the blood spurts.\nwhat?\nWhat will I do, boys?\nFlog the boy, sir.\nTill?\nTill the blood spurts, sir.\nNow, Clohessy, what is the Sixth Commandment?\nThou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not commit adultery\nThou shalt not commit adultery, sir.\nAnd what is adultery, Clohessy?\nImpure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, sir.\nGood, Clohessy. You're a good boy. You may be slow and forgetful in\nthe sir department and you may not have a shoe to your foot but you're powerful with the Sixth Commandment and that will keep you pure.\nPaddy Clohessy has no shoe to his foot, his mother shaves his head to keep the lice away, his eyes are red, his nose always snotty. The sores on his kneecaps never heal because he picks at the scabs and puts them in his mouth. His clothes are rags he has to share with his six brothers and a sister and when he comes to school with a bloody nose or a black eye you know he had a fight over the clothes that morning. He hates school. He's seven going on eight, the biggest and oldest boy in the class, and he can't wait to grow up and be fourteen so that he can run away and pass for seventeen and join the English army and go to India where it's nice and warm and he'll live in a tent with a dark girl with the red dot on her forehead and he'll be lying there eating figs, that's what they eat in India, figs, and she'll cook the curry day and night and plonk on a ukulele and when he has enough money he'll send for the whole family and they'll all live in the tent especially his poor father who's at home coughing up great gobs of blood because of the consumption. When my mother sees Paddy on the street she says, Wisha, look at that poor child. He's a skeleton with rags and if they were making a film about the famine he'd surely be put in the middle of it.\nI think Paddy likes me because of the raisin and I feel a bit guilty because I wasn't that generous in the first place. The master, Mr. Benson, said the government was going to give us the free lunch so we wouldn't have to be going home in the freezing weather. He led us down to a cold room in the dungeons of Leamy's School where the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, was handing out the half pint of milk and the raisin bun. The milk was frozen in the bottles and we had to melt it between our thighs. The boys joked and said the bottles would freeze our things off and the master roared, Any more of that talk and I'll warm the bottles on the backs of yeer heads. We all searched our raisin buns for a raisin but Nellie said they must have forgotten to put them in and she'd inquire from the man who delivered. We searched again every day till at last I found a raisin in my bun and held it up. The boys started grousing and said they wanted a raisin and Nellie said it wasn't her fault. She'd ask the man again. Now the boys were begging me for the raisin and offering me everything, a slug of their milk, a pencil, a comic book. Toby Mackey said I could have his sister and Mr. Benson heard him and took him out to the hallway and knocked him around till he howled. I wanted the raisin for myself but I saw Paddy Clohessy standing in the corner with no shoes and the room was freezing and he was shivering like a dog that had been kicked and I always felt sad over kicked dogs so I walked over and gave Paddy the raisin because I didn't know what else to do and all the boys yelled that I was a fool and a feckin' eejit and I'd regret the day and after I handed the raisin to Paddy I longed for it but it was too late now because he pushed it right into his mouth and gulped it and looked at me and said nothing and I said in my head what kind of an eejit are you to be giving away your raisin.\nMr. Benson gave me a look and said nothing and Nellie Ahearn said, You're a great oul'Yankee, Frankie.\nThe priest will come soon to examine us on the catechism and everything else. The master himself has to show us how to receive Holy\nCommunion. He tells us gather round him. He fills his hat with the Limerick Leader torn into little bits. He gives Paddy Clohessy the hat, kneels on the floor, tells Paddy to take one bit of paper and place it on his tongue. He shows us how to stick out the tongue, receive the bit of paper, hold it a moment, draw in the tongue, fold your hands in prayer, look toward heaven, close your eyes in adoration, wait for the paper to melt in your mouth, swallow it, and thank God for the gift, the Sanctifying Grace wafting in on the odor of sanctity. When he sticks out his tongue we have to hold in the laugh because we never saw a big purple tongue before. He opens his eyes to catch the boys who are giggling but he can't say anything because he still has God on his tongue and it's a holy moment. He gets off his knees and tells us kneel around the classroom for the Holy Communion practice. He goes around the room placing bits of paper on our tongues and mumbling in Latin. Some boys giggle and he roars at them that if the giggling doesn't stop it's not Holy Communion they'll be getting but the Last Rites and what is that sacrament called, McCourt?\nExtreme Unction, sir.\nThat's right, McCourt. Not bad for a Yank from the sinful shores of Amerikay.\nHe tells us we have to be careful to stick out our tongues far enough so that the Communion wafer won't fall to the floor. He says, That's the worst thing that can happen to a priest. If the wafer slides off your tongue that poor priest has to get down on his two knees, pick it up with his own tongue and lick the floor around it in case it bounced from one spot to another. The priest could get a splinter that would make his tongue swell to the size of a turnip and that's enough to choke you and kill you entirely.\nHe tells us that next to a relic of the True Cross the Communion wafer is the holiest thing in the world and our First Communion is the holiest moment in our lives. Talking about First Communion makes the master all excited. He paces back and forth, waves his stick, tells us we must never forget that the moment the Holy Communion is placed on our tongues we become members of that most glorious congregation, the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church, that for two thousand years men, women and children have died for the Faith, that the Irish have nothing to be ashamed of in the martyr department. Haven't we provided martyrs galore? Haven't we bared our necks to the Protestant ax? Haven't we mounted the scaffold, singing, as if embarking on a picnic, haven't we, boys?\nWe have, sir.\nWhat have we done, boys?\nBared our necks to the Protestant ax, sir.\nAnd?\nMounted the scaffold singing, sir.\nAs if?\nEmbarking on a picnic, sir.\nHe says that, perhaps, in this class there is a future priest or a\nmartyr for the Faith, though he doubts it very much for we are the laziest gang of ignoramuses it has ever been his misfortune to teach.\nBut it takes all kinds, he says, and surely God had some purpose when He sent the likes of ye to infest this earth. Surely God had a purpose when among us He sent Clohessy with no shoes, Quigley with his damnable questions and McCourt heavy with sin from America. And remember\nthis, boys, God did not send His only begotten Son to hang on the cross so that ye can go around on yeer First Communion day with the paws clutching for The Collection. Our Lord died so that ye might be redeemed. It is enough to receive the gift of Faith. Are ye listening to me?\nWe are, sir.\nAnd what's enough?\nThe gift of Faith, sir.\nGood. Go home.\nAt night three of us sit under the light pole at the top of the\nlane reading, Mikey, Malachy and I. The Molloys are like us with their father drinking the dole money or the wages and leaving no money for candles or paraffin oil for the lamp. Mikey reads books and the rest of us read comic books. His father, Peter, brings books from the Carnegie Library so that he'll have something to do when he's not drinking pints or when he's looking after the family anytime Mrs. Molloy is in the lunatic asylum. He lets Mikey read any book he likes and now Mikey is reading this book about Cuchulain and talking as if he knows everything about him. I want to tell him I knew all about Cuchulain when I was three going on four, that I saw Cuchulain in Dublin, that Cuchulain thinks nothing of dropping into my dreams. I want to tell him stop talking about Cuchulain, he's mine, he was mine years ago when I was young, but I can't because Mikey reads us a story I never heard of before, a dirty story about Cuchulain which I can never tell my father or mother, the story of how Emer became Cuchulain's wife.\nCuchulain was getting to be an old man of twenty-one. He was lonely and wanted to get married, which made him weak, says Mikey, and got him killed in the end. All the women in Ireland were mad about Cuchulain and they wanted to marry him. He said that would be grand, he wouldn't mind marrying all the women of Ireland. If he could fight all the men of Ireland why couldn't he marry all the women? But the King, Conor MacNessa, said, That's all very well for you, Cu, but the men of Ireland don't want to be lonely in the far reaches of the night. The King decided there would have to be a contest to see who would marry Cuchulain and it would be a pissing contest. All the women of Ireland assembled on the plains of Muirthemne to see who could piss the longest and it was Emer. She was the champion woman pisser of Ireland and married Cuchulain and that's why to this day she is called Great Bladdered Emer.\nMikey and Malachy laugh over this story though I don't think Malachy understands it. He's young and far from his First Communion and he's only laughing over the piss word. Then Mikey tells me I've committed a sin by listening to a story that has that word in it and when I go to my First Confession I'll have to tell the priest. Malachy says, That's right. Piss is a bad word and you have to tell the priest because 'tis a sin word.\nI don't know what to do. How can I go to the priest and tell him this terrible thing in my First Confession? All the boys know what sins they're going to tell so that they'll get the First Communion and make The Collection and go to see James Cagney and eat sweets and cakes at the Lyric Cinema. The master helped us with our sins and everyone has the same sins. I hit my brother. I told a lie. I stole a penny from my mother's purse. I disobeyed my parents, I ate a sausage on Friday.\nBut now I have a sin no one else has and the priest is going to be shocked and drag me out of the confession box into the aisle and out into the street where everyone will know I listened to a story about\nCuchulain's wife being the champion woman pisser in all Ireland. I'll never be able to make my First Communion and mothers will hold their small children up and point at me and say, Look at him. He's like Mikey Molloy, never made his First Communion, wandering around in a state of sin, never made The Collection, never saw James Cagney.\nI'm sorry I ever heard of First Communion and The Collection. I'm sick and I don't want any tea or bread or anything. Mam tells Dad it's a strange thing when a child won't have his bread and tea and Dad says, Och, he's just nervous over the First Communion. I want to go over to him and sit on his lap and tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me but I'm too big to be sitting on laps and if I did Malachy would go out in the lane and tell everyone I was a big baby. I'd like to tell my troubles to the Angel on the Seventh Step but he's busy bringing babies to mothers all over the world. Still, I'll ask Dad.\nDad, does the Angel on the Seventh Step have other jobs besides bringing babies?\nHe does.\nWould the Angel on the Seventh Step tell you what to do if you didn't know what to do?\nOch, he would, son, he would. That's the job of an angel, even the one on the seventh step.\nDad goes for a long walk, Mam takes Michael and goes to see Grandma, Malachy plays in the lane, and I have the house to myself so that I can sit on the seventh step and talk to the angel. I know he's there because the seventh step feels warmer than the other steps and there's a light in my head. I tell him my troubles and I hear a voice. Fear not, says the voice.\nHe's talking backward and I tell him I don't know what he's talking about.\nDo not fear, says the voice. Tell the priest your sin and you'll be forgiven.\nNext morning I'm up early and drinking tea with Dad and telling him about the Angel on the Seventh Step. He places his hand on my forehead to see if I'm feeling all right. He asks if I'm sure I had a light in my head and heard a voice and what did the voice say?\nI tell him the voice said Fear not and that means Do not fear.\nDad tells me the angel is right, I shouldn't be afraid, and I tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me. I tell him all about Great Bladdered Emer and I even use the piss word because the angel said, Fear not. Dad puts down his jam jar of tea and pats the back of my hand. Och, och, och, he says, and I wonder if he's going demented like Mrs. Molloy, in and out of the lunatic asylum, but he says, Is that what you were worried about last night?\nI tell him it is and he says it's not a sin and I don't have to tell the priest.\nBut the Angel on the Seventh Step said I should.\nAll right. Tell the priest if you like but the Angel on the Seventh Step said that only because you didn't tell me first. Isn't it better to be able to tell your father your troubles rather than an angel who is a light and a voice in your head?\n'Tis, Dad.\nThe day before First Communion the master leads us to St. Joseph's Church for First Confession. We march in pairs and if we so much as move a lip on the streets of Limerick he'll kill us on the spot and send us to\nhell bloated with sin. That doesn't stop the bragging about the big sins. Willie Harold is whispering about his big sin, that he looked at his sister's naked body. Paddy Hartigan says he stole ten shillings from his aunt's purse and made himself sick with ice cream and chips. Question Quigley says he ran away from home and spent half the night in a ditch with four goats. I try to tell them about Cuchulain and Emer but the master catches me talking and gives me a thump on the head.\nWe kneel in the pews by the confession box and I wonder if my Emer sin is as bad as looking at your sister's naked body because I know now that some things in the world are worse than others. That's why they have different sins, the sacrilege, the mortal sin, the venial sin. Then the masters and grown-up people in general talk about the unforgivable sin, which is a great mystery. No one knows what it is and you wonder how you can know if you've committed it if you don't know what it is. If I tell a priest about Great Bladdered Emer and the pissing contest he might say that's the unforgivable sin and kick me out of the confession box and I'll be disgraced all over Limerick and doomed to hell tormented forever by devils who have nothing else to do but stab me with hot pitchforks till I'm worn out.\nI try to listen to Willie's confession when he goes in but all I can hear is a hissing from the priest and when Willie comes out he's crying.\nIt's my turn. The confession box is dark and there's a big crucifix hanging over my head. I can hear a boy mumbling his confession on the other side. I wonder if there's any use trying to talk to the Angel on the Seventh Step. I know he's not supposed to be hanging around confession boxes but I feel the light in my head and the voice is telling me, Fear not.\nThe panel slides back before my face and the priest says, Yes, my child?\nBless me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my First Confession. Yes, my child, and what sins have you committed?\nI told a lie. I hit my brother. I took a penny from my mother's\npurse. I said a curse.\nYes, my child. Anything else?\nI, I listened to a story about Cuchulain and Emer.\nSurely that's not a sin, my child. After all we are assured by\ncertain writers that Cuchulain turned Catholic in his last moments as did his King, Conor MacNessa.\n'Tis about Emer, Father, and how she married him.\nHow was that, my child?\nShe won him in a pissing contest.\nThere is heavy breathing. The priest has his hand over his mouth\nand he's making choking sounds and talking to himself, Mother o' God. Who, who told you that story, my child?\nMikey Molloy, Father.\nAnd where did he hear it?\nHe read it in a book, Father.\nAh, a book. Books can be dangerous for children, my child. Turn your mind from those silly stories and think of the lives of the saints. Think of St. Joseph, the Little Flower, the sweet and gentle St. Francis of Assisi, who loved the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. Will you do that, my child?\nI will, Father.\nAre there any other sins, my child?\nNo, Father.\nFor your penance say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, and say a\nspecial prayer for me.\nI will. Father, was that the worst sin?\nWhat do you mean?\nAm I the worst of all the boys, Father?\nNo, my child, you have a long way to go. Now say an Act of\nContrition and remember Our Lord watches you every minute. God bless you, my child.\nFirst Communion day is the happiest day of your life because of The Collection and James Cagney at the Lyric Cinema. The night before I was so excited I couldn't sleep till dawn. I'd still be sleeping if my grandmother hadn't come banging at the door.\nGet up! Get up! Get that child outa the bed. Happiest day of his life an' him snorin' above in the bed.\nI ran to the kitchen. Take off that shirt, she said. I took off the shirt and she pushed me into a tin tub of icy cold water. My mother scrubbed me, my grandmother scrubbed me. I was raw, I was red.\nThey dried me. They dressed me in my black velvet First Communion suit with the white frilly shirt, the short pants, the white stockings, the black patent leather shoes. Around my arm they tied a white satin bow and on my lapel they pinned the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a picture of the Sacred Heart, with blood dripping from it, flames erupting all around it and on top a nasty looking crown of thorns.\nCome here till I comb your hair, said Grandma. Look at that mop, it won't lie down. You didn't get that hair from my side of the family. That's that North of Ireland hair you got from your father. That's the kind of hair you see on Presbyterians. If your mother had married a proper decent Limerickman you wouldn't have this standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair.\nShe spat twice on my head.\nGrandma, will you please stop spitting on my head. If you have anything to say, shut up. A little spit won't kill you. Come on, we'll be late for the Mass.\nWe ran to the church. My mother panted along behind with Michael in her arms. We arrived at the church just in time to see the last of the boys leaving the altar rail where the priest stood with the chalice and the host, glaring at me. Then he placed on my tongue the wafer, the body and blood of Jesus. At last, at last.\nIt's on my tongue. I draw it back.\nIt stuck.\nI had God glued to the roof of my mouth. I could hear the master's\nvoice, Don't let that host touch your teeth for if you bite God in two you'll roast in hell for eternity.\nI tried to get God down with my tongue but the priest hissed at me, Stop that clucking and get back to your seat.\nGod was good. He melted and I swallowed Him and now, at last, I was a member of the True Church, an official sinner.\nWhen the Mass ended there they were at the door of the church, my mother with Michael in her arms, my grandmother. They each hugged me to their bosoms. They each told me it was the happiest day of my life. They each cried all over my head and after my grandmother's contribution that morning my head was a swamp.\nMam, can I go now and make The Collection?\nShe said, After you have a little breakfast.\nNo, said Grandma. You're not making no collection till you've had a\nproper First Communion breakfast at my house. Come on.\nWe followed her. She banged pots and rattled pans and complained\nthat the whole world expected her to be at their beck and call. I ate the egg, I ate the sausage, and when I reached for more sugar for my tea she slapped my hand away.\nGo aisy with that sugar. Is it a millionaire you think I am? An American? Is it bedecked in glitterin' jewelry you think I am? Smothered in fancy furs?\nThe food churned in my stomach. I gagged. I ran to her backyard and threw it all up. Out she came.\nLook at what he did. Thrun up his First Communion breakfast. Thrun up the body and blood of Jesus. I have God in me backyard. What am I goin' to do? I'll take him to the Jesuits for they know the sins of the Pope himself.\nShe dragged me through the streets of Limerick. She told the neighbors and passing strangers about God in her backyard. She pushed me into the confession box.\nIn the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's a day since my last confession.\nA day? And what sins have you committed in a day, my child?\nI overslept. I nearly missed my First Communion. My grandmother said I have standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair. I threw up my First Communion breakfast. Now Grandma says she has God in her backyard and what should she do.\nThe priest is like the First Confession priest. He has the heavy breathing and the choking sounds.\nAh... ah... tell your grandmother to wash God away with a little water and for your penance say one Hail Mary and one Our Father. Say a prayer for me and God bless you, my child.\nGrandma and Mam were waiting close to the confession box. Grandma said, Were you telling jokes to that priest in the confession box? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you were telling jokes to Jesuits I'll tear the bloody kidneys outa you. Now what did he say about God in me backyard?\nHe said wash Him away with a little water, Grandma. Holy water or ordinary water?\nHe didn't say, Grandma.\nWell, go back and ask him.\nBut, Grandma...\nShe pushed me back into the confessional.\nBless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a minute since my last\nconfession.\nA minute! Are you the boy that was just here?\nI am, Father.\nWhat is it now?\nMy grandma says, Holy water or ordinary water? Ordinary water, and\ntell your grandmother not to be bothering me again.\nI told her, Ordinary water, Grandma, and he said don't be bothering\nhim again.\nDon't be bothering him again. That bloody ignorant bogtrotter.\nI asked Mam, Can I go now and make The Collection? I want to see James Cagney.\nGrandma said, You can forget about The Collection and James Cagney because you're not a proper Catholic the way you left God on the ground. Come on, go home.\nMam said, Wait a minute. That's my son. That's my son on his First Communion day. He's going to see James Cagney.\nNo he's not.\nYes he is.\nGrandma said, Take him then to James Cagney and see if that will\nsave his Presbyterian North of Ireland American soul. Go ahead.\nShe pulled her shawl around her and walked away.\nMam said, God, it's getting very late for The Collection and you'll\nnever see James Cagney. We'll go to the Lyric Cinema and see if they'll let you in anyway in your First Communion suit.\nWe met Mikey Molloy on Barrington Street. He asked if I was going to the Lyric and I said I was trying. Trying? he said. You don't have money?\nI was ashamed to say no but I had to and he said, That's all right. I'll get you in. I'll create a diversion.\nWhat's a diversion?\nI have the money to go and when I get in I'll pretend to have the fit and the ticket man will be out of his mind and you can slip in when I let out the big scream. I'll be watching the door and when I see you in I'll have a miraculous recovery. That's a diversion. That's what I do to get my brothers in all the time.\nMam said, Oh, I don't know about that, Mikey. Wouldn't that be a sin and surely you wouldn't want Frank to commit a sin on his First Communion day.\nMikey said if there was a sin it would be on his soul and he wasn't a proper Catholic anyway so it didn't matter. He let out his scream and I slipped in and sat next to Question Quigley and the ticket man, Frank Goggin, was so worried over Mikey he never noticed. It was a thrilling film but sad in the end because James Cagney was a public enemy and when they shot him they wrapped him in bandages and threw him in the door, shocking his poor old Irish mother, and that was the end of my First Communion day.\nV\nGrandma won't talk to Mam anymore because of what I did with God in her backyard. Mam doesn't talk to her sister, Aunt Aggie, or her brother Uncle Tom. Dad doesn't talk to anyone in Mam's family and they don't talk to him because he's from the North and he has the odd manner. No one talks to Uncle Tom's wife, Jane, because she's from Galway and she has the look of a Spaniard. Everyone talks to Mam's brother Uncle Pat, because he was dropped on his head, he's simple, and he sells newspapers. Everyone calls him The Abbot or Ab Sheehan and no one knows why. Everyone talks to Uncle Pa Keating because he was gassed in the war and married Aunt Aggie and if they didn't talk to him he wouldn't give a fiddler's fart anyway and that's why the men in South's pub call him a gas man.\nThat's the way I'd like to be in the world, a gas man, not giving a fiddler's fart, and that's what I tell the Angel on the Seventh Step till I remember you're not supposed to say fart in the presence of an angel.\nUncle Tom and Galway Jane have children but we're not supposed to talk to them because our parents are not talking. They have a son and daughter, Gerry and Peggy, and Mam will yell at us for talking to them but we don't know how not to talk to our cousins.\nPeople in families in the lanes of Limerick have their ways of not talking to each other and it takes years of practice. There are people who don't talk to each other because their fathers were on opposite sides in the Civil War in 1922. If a man goes off and joins the English army his family might as well move to another part of Limerick where there are families with men in the English army. If anyone in your family was the least way friendly to the English in the last eight hundred years it will be brought up and thrown in your face and you might as well move to Dublin where no one cares. There are families that are ashamed of themselves because their forefathers gave up their religion for the sake of a bowl of Protestant soup during the Famine and those families are known ever after as soupers. It's a terrible thing to be a souper because you're doomed forever to the souper part of hell. It's even worse to be an informer. The master at school said that everytime the Irish were about to demolish the English in a fair fight a filthy informer betrayed them. A man who's discovered to be an informer deserves to be hanged or, even worse, to have no one talk to him for if no one talks to you you're better off hanging at the end of a rope.\nIn every lane there's always someone not talking to someone or everyone not talking to someone or someone not talking to everyone. You can always tell when people are not talking by the way they pass each other. The women hoist their noses, tighten their mouths and turn their faces away. If the woman is wearing a shawl she takes a corner and flings it over her shoulder as if to say, One word or look from you, you ma faced bitch, and I'll tear the countenance from the front of your head.\nIt's bad when Grandma won't talk to us because we can't run to her when we need to borrow sugar or tea or milk. There's no use going to Aunt Aggie. She'll only bite your head off. Go home, she'll say, and tell your father to get off his northern arse and get a job like the decent men of Limerick.\nThey say she's always angry because she has red hair or she has red hair because she's always angry.\nMam is friendly with Bridey Hannon, who lives next door with her mother and father. Mam and Bridey talk all the time. When my father goes for his long walk Bridey comes in and she and Mam sit by the fire drinking tea and smoking cigarettes. If Mam has nothing in the house Bridey brings tea, sugar and milk. Sometimes they use the same tea leaves over and over and Mam says the tea is stewed, coddled and boiled.\nMam and Bridey sit so close to the fire their shins turn red and purple and blue. They talk for hours and they whisper and laugh over secret things. We're not supposed to hear the secret things so we're told go out and play. I often sit on the seventh step listening and they have no notion I'm there. It might be lashing rain out but Mam says, Rain or no, out you go, and she'll tell us, If you see your father coming, run in and tell me. Mam says to Bridey, Did you ever hear that poem that someone must have made up about me and him?\nWhat poem, Angela?\n'Tis called \"The Man from the North. \" I got this poem from Minnie MacAdorey in America.\nI never heard that poem. Say it for me.\nMam says the poem but she laughs all through it and I don't know why, He came from the North so his words were few But his voice was kind and his heart was true.\nAnd I knew by his eyes that no guile had he, So I married my man from the North Country.\nOh, Garryowen may be more gay\nThan this quiet man from beside Lough Neagh And I know that the sun shines softly down\nOn the river that runs through my native town.\nBut there's not-and I say it with joy and with pride A better man in all Munster wide\nAnd Limerick town has no happier hearth\nThan mine has been with my man from the North.\nI wish that in Limerick they only knew The kind kind neighbors I came unto. Small hate or scorn would there ever be Between the South and the North Country.\nShe always repeats the third verse and laughs so hard she's crying and I don't know why. She goes into hysterics when she says, And Limerick town has no happier hearth Than mine has been with my man from the North.\nIf he comes back early and sees Bridey in the kitchen the man from the North says, Gossip, gossip, gossip, and stands there with his cap on till she leaves.\nBridey's mother and other people in our lane and lanes beyond will come to the door to ask Dad if he'll write a letter to the government or a relation in a distant place. He sits at the table with his pen and bottle of ink and when the people tell him what to write he says, Och, no, that's not what you want to say, and he writes what he feels like writing. The people tell him that's what they wanted to say in the first place, that he has a lovely way with the English language and a fine fist for the writing. They offer him sixpence for his trouble but he waves it away and they hand it to Mam because he's too grand to be taking sixpence. When the people leave he takes the sixpence and sends me to Kathleen O'Connell's shop for cigarettes.\nGrandma sleeps in a big bed upstairs with a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus over her head and a statue of the Sacred Heart on the mantel piece. She wants to switch from gaslight to electric light someday so that she'll have a little red light under the statue forever. Her devotion to the Sacred Heart is known up and down the lane and in lanes beyond.\nUncle Pat sleeps in a small bed in a corner of the same room where Grandma can make sure he comes in at a proper hour and kneels by the bed to say his prayers. He might have been dropped on his head, he may not know how to read and write, he may drink one pint too many, but there's no excuse for not saying his prayers before he goes to sleep.\nUncle Pat tells Grandma he met a man who is looking for a place to stay that will let him wash himself morning and night and give him two\nmeals a day, dinner and tea. His name is Bill Galvin and he has a good job down at the lime kiln. He's covered all the time with white lime dust but surely that's better than coal dust.\nGrandma will have to give up her bed and move into the small room. She'll take the Sacred Heart picture and leave the statue to watch over the two men. Besides, she has no place for a statue in her little room.\nBill Galvin comes after work to see the place. He's small, all white, and he snuffles like a dog. He asks Grandma if she'd mind taking down that statue because he's a Protestant and he wouldn't be able to sleep. Grandma barks at Uncle Pat for not telling her he was dragging a Protestant into the house. Jesus, she says, there will be gossip up and down the lane and beyond.\nUncle Pat says he didn't know Bill Galvin was a Protestant. You could never tell by looking at him especially the way he's covered with lime. He looks like an ordinary Catholic and you'd never imagine a Protestant would be shoveling lime.\nBill Galvin says his poor wife that just died was a Catholic and she had the walls covered with pictures of the Sacred Heart and the Virgin Mary showing their hearts. He's not against the Sacred Heart himself, it's just that seeing the statue will remind him of his poor wife and give him the heartache.\nGrandma says, Ah, God help us, why didn't you tell me that in the first place? Sure I can put the statue on the windowsill in my room and your heart won't be tormented at the sight of it.\nEvery morning Grandma cooks Bill's dinner and takes it to him at the lime kiln. Mam wonders why he can't take it with him in the morning and Grandma says, Do you expect me to get up at dawn and boil cabbage and pig's toes for his lordship to take in his dinner can?\nMam tells her, In another week school will be over and if you give Frank sixpence a week he'll surely be glad to take Bill Galvin his dinner.\nI don't want to go to Grandma's every day. I don't want to take Bill Galvin his dinner all the way down the Dock Road, but Mam says that's sixpence we could use and if I don't do it I'm going nowhere else.\nYou're staying in the house, she says. You're not playing with your\npals.\nGrandma warns me to take the dinner can directly and not be\nmeandering, looking this way and that, kicking canisters and ruining the toes of my shoes. This dinner is hot and that's the way Bill Galvin wants\nit.\nThere's a lovely smell from the dinner can, boiled bacon and\ncabbage and two big floury white potatoes. Surely he won't notice if I try half a potato. He won't complain to Grandma because he hardly ever talks outside of a snuffle or two.\nIt's better if I eat the other half potato so that he won't be asking why he got a half. I might as well try the bacon and cabbage too and if I eat the other potato he'll surely think she didn't send one at all.\nThe second potato melts in my mouth and I'll have to try another bit of cabbage, another morsel of bacon. There isn't much left now and he'll be very suspicious so I might as well finish off the rest.\nWhat am I going to do now? Grandma will destroy me, Mam will keep me in for a year. Bill Galvin will bury me in lime. I'll tell him I was\nattacked by a dog on the Dock Road and he ate the whole dinner and I'm lucky I escaped without being eaten myself.\nOh, is that so? says Bill Galvin. And what's that bit of cabbage hanging on your gansey? Did the dog lick you wit his cabbagey gob? Go home and tell your grandmother you ate me whole dinner and I'm falling down with the hunger here in this lime kiln.\nShe'll kill me.\nTell her don't kill you till she sends me some class of a dinner and if you don't go to her now and get me a dinner I'll kill you and throw your body into the lime there and there won't be much left for your mother to moan over.\nGrandma says, What are you doin' back with that can? He could bring that back by himself.\nHe wants more dinner.\nWhat do you mean more dinner? Jesus above, is it a hole he has in his leg?\nHe's falling down with the hunger below in the lime kiln. Is it coddin' me you are?\nHe says send him any class of a dinner.\nI will not. I sent him his dinner.\nHe didn't get it.\nHe didn't? Why not?\nI ate it.\nWhat?\nI was hungry and I tasted it and I couldn't stop.\nJesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph.\nShe gives me a clout on the head that brings tears to my eyes. She\nscreams at me like a banshee and jumps around the kitchen and threatens to drag me to the priest, the bishop, the Pope himself if he lived around the corner. She cuts bread and waves the knife at me and makes sandwiches of brawn and cold potatoes.\nTake these sandwiches to Bill Galvin and if you even look cross- eyed at them I'll skin your hide.\nOf course she runs to Mam and they agree the only way I can make up for my terrible sin is to deliver Bill Galvin's dinner for a fortnight without pay. I'm to bring back the can every day and that means I have to sit watching him stuff the food into his gob and he's not one that would ever ask you if you had a mouth in your head.\nEvery day I take the can back Grandma makes me kneel to the statue of the Sacred Heart and tell Him I'm sorry and all this over Bill Galvin, a Protestant.\nMam says, I'm a martyr for the fags and so is your father.\nThere may be a lack of tea or bread in the house but Mam and Dad always manage to get the fags, the Wild Woodbines. They have to have the Woodbines in the morning and anytime they drink tea. They tell us every day we should never smoke, it's bad for your lungs, it's bad for your chest, it stunts your growth, and they sit by the fire puffing away. Mam says, If 'tis a thing I ever see you with a fag in your gob I'll break your face. They tell us the cigarettes rot your teeth and you can see they're not lying. The teeth turn brown and black in their heads and fall out one by one. Dad says he has holes in his teeth big enough for a sparrow to raise a family. He has a few left but he gets them pulled at the clinic and applies for a false set. When he comes home with the new teeth he shows his big new white smile that makes him look like an\nAmerican and whenever he tells us a ghost story by the fire he pushes the lower teeth up beyond his lip to his nose and frightens the life out of us. Mam's teeth are so bad she has to go to Barrington's Hospital to have them all pulled at the same time and when she comes home she's holding at her mouth a rag bright with blood. She has to sit up all night by the fire because you can't lie down when your gums are pumping blood or you'll choke in your sleep. She says she'll give up smoking entirely when this bleeding stops but she needs one puff of a fag this minute for the comfort that's in it. She tells Malachy go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and ask her would she ever let her have five Woodbines till Dad collects the dole on Thursday. If anyone can get the fags out of Kathleen, Malachy can. Mam says he has the charm, and she tells me, There's no use sending you with your long puss and your father's odd manner.\nWhen the bleeding stops and Mam's gums heal she goes to the clinic for her false teeth. She says she'll give up the smoking when her new teeth are in but she never does. The new teeth rub on her gums and make them sore and the smoke of the Woodbines eases them. She and Dad sit by the fire when we have one and smoke their cigarettes and when they talk their teeth clack. They try to stop the clacking by moving their jaws back and forth but that only makes it worse and they curse the dentists and the people above in Dublin who made the teeth and while they curse they clack. Dad claims these teeth were made for rich people in Dublin and didn't fit so they were passed on to the poor of Limerick who don't care because you don't have much to chew when you're poor anyway and you're grateful you have any class of a tooth in your head. If they talk too long their gums get sore and the teeth have to come out. Then they sit talking by the fire with their faces collapsed. Every night they leave the teeth in the kitchen in jam jars filled with water. Malachy wants to know why and Dad tells him it cleans them. Mam says, No, you can't have teeth in your head while you're sleeping for they'll slip and choke you to death entirely.\nThe teeth are the cause of Malachy going to Barrington's Hospital and me having an operation. Malachy whispers to me in the middle of the night, Do you want to go downstairs and see if we can wear the teeth?\nThe teeth are so big we have trouble getting them into our mouths but Malachy won't give up. He forces Dad's upper teeth into his mouth and can't get them out again. His lips are drawn back and the teeth make a big grin. He looks like a monster in a film and it makes me laugh but he pulls at them and grunts, Uck, uck, and tears come to his eyes. The more he goes Uck, uck, the harder I laugh till Dad calls from upstairs, What are you boys doing? Malachy runs from me, up the stairs, and now I hear Dad and Mam laughing till they see he can choke on the teeth. They both stick their fingers in to pull out the teeth but Malachy gets frightened and makes desperate uck uck sounds. Mam says, We'll have to take him to the hospital, and Dad says he'll take him. He makes me go in case the doctor has questions because I'm older than Malachy and that means I must have started all the trouble. Dad rushes through the streets with Malachy in his arms and I try to keep up. I feel sorry for Malachy up there on Dad's shoulder, looking back at me, tears on his cheeks and Dad's teeth bulging in his mouth. The doctor at Barrington's Hospital says, No bother. He pours oil into Malachy's mouth and has the teeth out in a minute. Then he looks at me and says to Dad, Why is that child standing there with his mouth hanging open?\nDad says, That's a habit he has, standing with his mouth open.\nThe doctor says, Come here to me. He looks up my nose, in my ears, down my throat, and feels my neck.\nThe tonsils, he says. The adenoids. They have to come out. The sooner the better or he'll look like an idiot when he grows up with that gob wide as a boot.\nNext day Malachy gets a big piece of toffee as a reward for sticking in teeth he can't get out and I have to go to the hospital to have an operation that will close my mouth.\nOn a Saturday morning Mam finishes her tea and says, You're going to dance.\nDance? Why?\nYou're seven years old, you made your First Communion, and now 'tis time for the dancing. I'm taking you down to Catherine Street to Mrs. O'Connor's Irish dancing classes. You'll go there every Saturday morning and that'll keep you off the streets. That'll keep you from wandering around Limerick with hooligans.\nShe tells me wash my face not forgetting ears and neck, comb my hair, blow my nose, take the look off my face, what look? never mind, just take it off, put on my stockings and my First Communion shoes which, she says, are destroyed because I can't pass a canister or a rock without kicking it. She's worn out standing in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society begging for boots for me and Malachy so that we can wear out the toes with the kicking. Your father says it's never too early to learn the songs and dances of your ancestors.\nWhat's ancestors?\nNever mind, she says, you're going to dance.\nI wonder how I can die for Ireland if I have to sing and dance for\nIreland, too. I wonder why they never say, You can eat sweets and stay home from school and go swimming for Ireland.\nMam says, Don't get smart or I'll warm your ear.\nCyril Benson dances. He has medals hanging from his shoulders to his kneecaps. He wins contests all over Ireland and he looks lovely in his saffron kilt. He's a credit to his mother and he gets his name in the paper all the time and you can be sure he brings home the odd few pounds. You don't see him roaming the streets kicking everything in sight till the toes hang out of his boots, oh, no, he's a good boy, dancing for his poor mother.\nMam wets an old towel and scrubs my face till it stings, she wraps the towel around her finger and sticks it in my ears and claims there's enough wax there to grow potatoes, she wets my hair to make it lie down, she tells me shut up and stop the whinging, that these dancing lessons will cost her sixpence every Saturday, which I could have earned bringing Bill Galvin his dinner and God knows she can barely afford it. I try to tell her, Ah, Mam, sure you don't have to send me to dancing school when you could be smoking a nice Woodbine and having a cup of tea, but she says, Oh, aren't you clever. You're going to dance if I have to give up the fags forever.\nIf my pals see my mother dragging me through the streets to an Irish dancing class I'll be disgraced entirely. They think it's all right to dance and pretend you're Fred Astaire because you can jump all over the screen with Ginger Rogers. There is no Ginger Rogers in Irish dancing and you can't jump all over. You stand straight up and down and keep your arms against yourself and kick your legs up and around and never smile.\nMy uncle Pa Keating said Irish dancers look like they have steel rods up their arses, but I can't say that to Mam, she'd kill me.\nThere's a gramophone in Mrs. O'Connor's playing an Irish jig or a reel and boys and girls are dancing around kicking their legs out and keeping their hands to their sides. Mrs. O'Connor is a great fat woman and when she stops the record to show the steps all the fat from her chin to her ankles jiggles and I wonder how she can teach the dancing. She comes over to my mother and says, So, this is little Frankie? I think we have the makings of a dancer here. Boys and girls, do we have the makings of a dancer here?\nWe do, Mrs. O'Connor.\nMam says, I have the sixpence, Mrs. O'Connor.\nAh, yes, Mrs. McCourt, hold on a minute.\nShe waddles to a table and brings back the head of a black boy with\nkinky hair, big eyes, huge red lips and an open mouth. She tells me put the sixpence in the mouth and take my hand out before the black boy bites me. All the boys and girls watch and they have little smiles. I drop in the sixpence and pull my hand back before the mouth snaps shut. Everyone laughs and I know they wanted to see my hand caught in the mouth. Mrs. O'Connor gasps and laughs and says to my mother, Isn't that a howl, now? Mam says it's a howl. She tells me behave myself and come home dancing. I don't want to stay in this place where Mrs. O'Connor can't take the sixpence herself instead of letting me nearly lose my hand in the black boy's mouth.\nI don't want to stay in this place where you have to stand in line with boys and girls, straighten your back, hands by your sides, look ahead, don't look down, move your feet, move your feet, look at Cyril, look at Cyril, and there goes Cyril, all dressed up in his saffron kilt and the medals jingling, medals for this and medals for that and the girls love Cyril and Mrs. O'Connor loves Cyril for didn't he bring her fame and didn't she teach him every step he knows, oh, dance, Cyril, dance, oh, Jesus, he floats around the room, he's an angel out of heaven and stop the frowning, Frankie McCourt, or you'll have a puss on you like a pound of tripe, dance, Frankie, dance, pick up your feet for the love o' Jesus, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree, Maura, will you help that Frankie McCourt before he ties his two feet around his poll entirely, help him, Maura.\nMaura is a big girl about ten. She dances up to me with her white teeth and her dancer's dress with all the gold and yellow and green figures that are supposed to come from olden times and she says, Give me your hand, little boy, and she wheels me around the room till I'm dizzy and making a pure eejit of myself and blushing and foolish till I want to cry but I'm saved when the record stops and the gramophone goes hoosh hoosh.\nMrs. O'Connor says, Oh, thank you, Maura, and next week, Cyril, you can show Frankie a few of the steps that made you famous. Next week, boys and girls, and don't forget the sixpence for the little black boy.\nBoys and girls leave together. I make my own way down the stairs and out the door hoping my pals won't see me with boys who wear kilts and girls with white teeth and fancy dresses from olden times.\nMam is having tea with Bridey Hannon, her friend from next door. Mam says, What did you learn? and makes me dance around the kitchen, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree. She has a good\nlaugh with Bridey. That's not too bad for your first time. In a month you'll be like a regular Cyril Benson.\nI don't want to be Cyril Benson. I want to be Fred Astaire.\nThey turn hysterical, laughing and squirting tea out of their mouths, Jesus love him, says Bridey. Doesn't he have a great notion of himself. Fred Astaire how are you.\nMam says Fred Astaire went to his lessons every Saturday and didn't go around kicking the toes out of his boots and if I wanted to be like him I'd have to go to Mrs. O'Connor's every week.\nThe fourth Saturday morning Billy Campbell knocks at our door. Mrs. McCourt, can Frankie come out and play? Mam tells him, No, Billy. Frankie is going to his dancing lesson.\nHe waits for me at the bottom of Barrack Hill. He wants to know why I'm dancing, that everyone knows dancing is a sissy thing and I'll wind up like Cyril Benson wearing a kilt and medals and dancing all over with girls. He says next thing I'll be sitting in the kitchen knitting socks. He says dancing will destroy me and I won't be fit to play any kind of football, soccer, rugby or Gaelic football itself because the dancing teaches you to run like a sissy and everyone will laugh.\nI tell him I'm finished with the dancing, that I have sixpence in my pocket for Mrs. O'Connor that's supposed to go into the black boy's mouth, that I'm going to the Lyric Cinema instead. Sixpence will get the two of us in with tuppence left over for two squares of Cleeves' toffee, and we have a great time looking at Riders of the Purple Sage.\nDad is sitting by the fire with Mam and they want to know what steps I learned today and what they're called. I already did \"The Siege of Ennis\" and \"The Walls of Limerick, \" which are real dances. Now I have to make up names and dances. Mam says she never heard of a dance called \"The Siege of Dingle\"but if that's what I learned go ahead, dance it, and I dance around the kitchen with my hands down by my sides making my own music, diddley eye di eye di eye diddley eye do you do you, Dad and Mam clapping in time with my feet. Dad says, Och, that's a fine dance and you'll be a powerful Irish dancer and a credit to the men who died for their country. Mam says, That wasn't much for a sixpence.\nNext week it's a George Raft film and the week after that a cowboy film with George O'Brien. Then it's James Cagney and I can't take Billy because I want to get a bar of chocolate to go with my Cleeves' toffee and I'm having a great time till there's a terrible pain in my jaw and it's a tooth out of my gum stuck in my toffee and the pain is killing me. Still, I can't waste the toffee so I pull out the tooth and put it in my pocket and chew the toffee on the other side of my mouth blood and all. There's pain on one side and delicious toffee on the other and I remember what my uncle Pa Keating would say, There are times when you wouldn't know whether to shit or go blind.\nI have to go home now and worry because you can't go through the world short a tooth without your mother knowing. Mothers know everything and she's always looking into our mouths to see if there's any class of disease. She's there by the fire and Dad is there and they're asking me the same old questions, the dance and the name of the dance. I tell them I learned \"The Walls of Cork\" and I dance around the kitchen trying to hum a made up tune and dying with the pain of my tooth. Mam says, \"Walls o' Cork, \" my eye, there's no such dance, and Dad says, Come over here. Stand there before me. Tell us the truth, Did you go to your dancing classes today?\nI can't tell a lie anymore because my gum is killing me and there's blood in my mouth. Besides, I know they know everything and that's what they're telling me now. Some snake of a boy from the dancing school saw me going to the Lyric Cinema and told and Mrs. O'Connor sent a note to say she hadn't seen me in ages and was I all right because I had great promise and could follow in the footsteps of the great Cyril Benson.\nDad doesn't care about my tooth or anything. He says I'm going to confession and drags me over to the Redemptorist church because it's Saturday and confessions go on all day. He tells me I'm a bad boy, he's ashamed of me that I went to the pictures instead of learning Ireland's national dances, the jig, the reel, the dances that men and women fought and died for down those sad centuries. He says there's many a young man that was hanged and now moldering in a lime pit that would be glad to rise up and dance the Irish dance.\nThe priest is old and I have to yell my sins at him and he tells me I'm a hooligan for going to the pictures instead of my dancing lessons although he thinks himself that dancing is a dangerous thing almost as bad as the films, that it stirs up thoughts sinful in themselves, but even if dancing is an abomination I sinned by taking my mother's sixpence and lying and there's a hot place in hell for the likes of me, say a decade of the rosary and ask God's forgiveness for you're dancing at the gates of hell itself, child.\nI'm seven, eight, nine going on ten and still Dad has no work. He drinks his tea in the morning, signs for the dole at the Labour Exchange, reads the papers at the Carnegie Library, goes for his long walks far into the country. If he gets a job at the Limerick Cement Company or Rank's Flour Mills he loses it in the third week. He loses it because he goes to the pubs on the third Friday of the job, drinks all his wages and misses the half day of work on Saturday morning.\nMam says, Why can't he be like the other men from the lanes of Limerick? They're home before the Angelus rings at six o'clock, they hand over their wages, change their shirts, have their tea, get a few shillings from the wife and they're off to the pub for a pint or two.\nMam tells Bridey Hannon that Dad can't be like that and won't be like that. She says he's a right bloody fool the way he goes to pubs and stands pints to other men while his own children are home with their bellies stuck to their backbones for the want of a decent dinner. He'll brag to the world he did his bit for Ireland when it was neither popular nor profitable, that he'll gladly die for Ireland when the call comes, that he regrets he has only one life to give for his poor misfortunate country and if anyone disagrees they're invited to step outside and settle this for once and for all.\nOh, no, says Mam, they won't disagree and they won't step outside, that bunch of tinkers and knackers and begrudgers that hang around the pubs. They tell him he's a grand man, even if he's from the North, and 'twould be an honor to accept a pint from such a patriot.\nMam tells Bridey, I don't know under God what I'm going to do. The dole is nineteen shillings and sixpence a week, the rent is six and six, and that leaves thirteen shillings to feed and clothe five people and keep us warm in the winter.\nBridey drags on her Woodbine, drinks her tea and declares that God is good. Mam says she's sure God is good for someone somewhere but He hasn't been seen lately in the lanes of Limerick.\nBridey laughs. Oh, Angela, you could go to hell for that, and Mam says, Aren't I there already, Bridey?\nAnd they laugh and drink their tea and smoke their Woodbines and tell one another the fag is the only comfort they have.\n'Tis.\nQuestion Quigley tells me I have to go to the Redemptorist church on Friday and join the boys' division of the Arch Confraternity. You have to join. You can't say no. All the boys in the lanes and back streets that have fathers on the dole or working in laboring jobs have to join.\nQuestion says, Your father is a foreigner from the North and he don't matter but you still have to join.\nEveryone knows Limerick is the holiest city in Ireland because it has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family, the biggest sodality in the world. Any city can have a Confraternity, only Limerick has the Arch.\nOur Confraternity fills the Redemptorist church five nights a week, three for the men, one for the women, one for the boys. There is Benediction and hymn singing in English, Irish and Latin and best of all the big powerful sermon Redemptorist priests are famous for. It's the sermon that saves millions of Chinese and other heathens from winding up in hell with the Protestants.\nThe Question says you have to join the Confraternity so that your mother can tell the St. Vincent de Paul Society and they'll know you're a good Catholic. He says his father is a loyal member and that's how he got a good pensionable job cleaning lavatories at the railway station and when he grows up himself he'll get a good job too unless he runs away and joins the Royal Canadian Mounted Police so that he can sing \"I'll Be Calling You Ooo Ooo Ooo, \" like Nelson Eddy singing to Jeanette MacDonald expiring with consumption there on the sofa. If he brings me to the Confraternity the man in the office will write his name in a big book and some day he might be promoted to prefect of a section, which is all he wants in life next to wearing the Mountie uniform.\nThe prefect is head of a section which is thirty boys from the same lanes and streets. Every section has the name of a saint whose picture is painted on a shield stuck on top of a pole by the prefect's seat. The prefect and his assistant take the attendance and keep an eye on us so that they can give us a thump on the head in case we laugh during Benediction or commit any other sacrileges. If you miss one night the man in the office wants to know why, wants to know if you're slipping away from the Confraternity or he might say to the other man in the office, I think our little friend here has taken the soup. That's the worst thing you can say to any Catholic in Limerick or Ireland itself because of what happened in the Great Famine. If you're absent twice the man in the office sends you a yellow summons to appear and explain yourself and if you're absent three times he sends The Posse, which is five or six big boys from your section who search the streets to make sure you're not out enjoying yourself when you should be on your knees at the Confraternity praying for the Chinese and other lost souls. The Posse will go to your house and tell your mother your immortal soul is in danger. Some mothers worry but others will say, Get away from my door or I'll come out and give every one o' ye a good fong in the hole of yeer arse. These are not good Confraternity mothers and the director will say we should pray for them that they'll see the error of their ways.\nThe worst thing of all is a visit from the director of the Confraternity himself, Father Gorey. He'll stand at the top of the lane\nand roar in the voice that converted the Chinese millions, Where is the house of Frank McCourt? He roars even though he has your address in his pocket and knows very well where you live. He roars because he wants the world to know you're slipping away from the Confraternity and putting your immortal soul in danger. The mothers are terrified and the fathers will whisper, I'm not here, I'm not here, and they'll make sure you go to the Confraternity from this on out so they won't be disgraced and shamed entirely with the neighbors muttering behind their hands.\nThe Question takes me to the section St. Finbar's, and the prefect tells me sit over there and shut up. His name is Declan Collopy, he's fourteen and he has lumps on his forehead that look like horns. He has thick ginger eyebrows that meet in the middle and hang over his eyes and his arms hang down to his kneecaps. He tells me he's making this the best section in the Confraternity and if I'm ever absent he'll break my arse and send the bits to my mother. There's no excuse for absence because there was a boy in another section that was dying and still they brought him in on a stretcher. He says, If you're ever absent it better be a death, not a death in the family but your own death. Do you hear me?\nI do, Declan.\nBoys in my section tell me that prefects get rewards if there is perfect attendance. Declan wants to get out of school as soon as he can and get a job selling linoleum at Cannock's big shop on Patrick Street. His uncle, Foncey, sold linoleum there for years and made enough money to start his own shop in Dublin, where he has his three sons selling linoleum. Father Gorey, the director, can easily get Declan the reward of a job at Cannock's if he's a good prefect and has perfect attendance in his section and that's why Declan will destroy us if we're absent. He tells us, No one will stand between me and the linoleum.\nDeclan likes Question Quigley and lets him miss an occasional Friday night because the Question said, Declan, when I grow up and get married I'm going to cover my house in linoleum and I'll buy it all from you.\nOther boys in the section try this trick with Declan but he says, Bugger off, ye'll be lucky enough to have a pot to piss in never mind yards of linoleum.\nDad says when he was my age in Toome he served Mass for years and it's time for me to be an altar boy. Mam says, What's the use? The child doesn't have proper clothes for school never mind the altar. Dad says the altar boy robes will cover the clothes and she says we don't have the money for robes and the wash they need every week.\nHe says God will provide and makes me kneel on the kitchen floor. He takes the part of the priest for he has the whole Mass in his head and I have to know the responses. He says, Introibo ad altare Dei, and I have to say, Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam.\nEvery evening after tea I kneel for the Latin and he won't let me move till I'm perfect. Mam says he could at least let me sit but he says Latin is sacred and it is to be learned and recited on the knees. You won't find the Pope sitting around drinking tea while he speaks the Latin.\nThe Latin is hard and my knees are sore and scabby and I'd like to be out in the lane playing though still I'd like to be an altar boy helping the priest vest in the sacristy, up there on the altar all decked out in my red and white robes like my pal Jimmy Clark, answering the priest in Latin, moving the big book from one side of the tabernacle to\nthe other, pouring water and wine into the chalice, pouring water over the priest's hands, ringing the bell at Consecration, kneeling, bowing, swinging the censer at Benediction, sitting off to the side with the palms of my hands on my knees all serious while he gives his sermon, everyone in St. Joseph's looking at me and admiring my ways.\nIn a fortnight I have the Mass in my head and it's time to go to St. Joseph's to see the sacristan, Stephen Carey, who is in charge of altar boys. Dad polishes my boots. Mam darns my socks and throws an extra coal on the fire to heat up the iron to press my shirt. She boils water to scrub my head, neck, hands and knees and any inch of skin that shows. She scrubs till my skin burns and tells Dad she wouldn't give it to the world to say her son went on the altar dirty. She wishes I didn't have scabby knees from running around kicking canisters and falling down pretending I was the greatest footballer in the world. She wishes we had a drop of hair oil in the house but water and spit will keep my hair from sticking up like black straw in a mattress. She warns me speak up when I go to St. Joseph's and don't be mumbling in English or Latin. She says, 'Tis a great pity you grew out of your First Communion suit but you have nothing to be ashamed of, you come from good blood, McCourts, Sheehans, or my mother's family the Guilfoyles that owned acre after acre in County Limerick before the English took it away and gave it to footpads from London.\nDad holds my hand going through the streets and people look at us because of the way we're saying Latin back and forth. He knocks at the sacristy door and tells Stephen Carey, This is my son, Frank, who knows the Latin and is ready to be an altar boy.\nStephen Carey looks at him, then me. He says, We don't have room for him, and closes the door.\nDad is still holding my hand and squeezes till it hurts and I want to cry out. He says nothing on the way home. He takes off his cap, sits by the fire and lights a Woodbine. Mam is smoking, too. Well, she says, is he going to be an altar boy?\nThere's no room for him.\nOh. She puffs on her Woodbine. I'll tell you what it is, she says. 'Tis class distinction. They don't want boys from lanes on the altar. They don't want the ones with scabby knees and hair sticking up. Oh, no, they want the nice boys with hair oil and new shoes that have fathers with suits and ties and steady jobs. That's what it is and 'tis hard to hold on to the Faith with the snobbery that's in it.\nOch, aye.\nOh, och aye my arse. That's all you ever say. You could go to the priest and tell him you have a son that has a head stuffed with Latin and why can't he be an altar boy and what is he going to do with all that Latin?\nOch, he might grow up to be a priest.\nI ask him if I can go out and play. Yes, he says, go out and play. Mam says, You might as well.\nVI\nMr. O'Neill is the master in the fourth class at school. We call him Dotty because he's small like a dot. He teaches in the one classroom with\na platform so that he can stand above us and threaten us with his ash plant and peel his apple for all to see. The first day of school in September he writes on the blackboard three words which are to stay there the rest of the year, Euclid, geometry, idiot. He says if he catches any boy interfering with these words that boy will go through the rest of his life with one hand. He says anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Now, repeat after me, Anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Of course we all know what an idiot is because that's what the masters keep telling us we are.\nBrendan Quigley raises his hand. Sir, what's a theorem and what's a Euclid?\nWe expect Dotty to lash at Brendan the way all the masters do when you ask them a question but he looks at Brendan with a little smile. Ah, now, here's a boy with not one but two questions. What is your name, boy?\nBrendan Quigley, sir.\nThis is a boy who will go far. Where will he go, boys?\nFar, sir.\nIndeed and he will. The boy who wants to know something about the\ngrace, elegance and beauty of Euclid can go nowhere but up. In what direction and no other can this boy go, boys?\nUp, sir.\nWithout Euclid, boys, mathematics would be a poor doddering thing. Without Euclid we wouldn't be able to go from here to there. Without Euclid the bicycle would have no wheel. Without Euclid St. Joseph could not have been a carpenter for carpentry is geometry and geometry is carpentry. Without Euclid this very school could never have been built.\nPaddy Clohessy mutters behind me, Feckin' Euclid.\nDotty barks at him. You, boy, what is your name?\nClohessy, sir.\nAh, the boy flies on one wing. What is your Christian name? Paddy.\nPaddy what?\nPaddy, sir.\nAnd what, Paddy, were you saying to McCourt? I said we\ndown on our two knees and thank God for Euclid.\nI'm sure you did, Clohessy. I see the lie festering in\nWhat do I see, boys?\nThe lie, sir.\nAnd what is the lie doing, boys?\nFestering, sir.\nWhere, boys, where?\nIn his teeth, sir.\nEuclid, boys, was a Greek. What, Clohessy, is a Greek? Some class of a foreigner, sir.\nClohessy, you are a half-wit. Now, Brendan, surely you\nshould get\nyour teeth.\nknow what a\nGreek is?\nYes, sir. Euclid was a Greek.\nDotty gives him the little smile. He tells Clohessy he should model\nhimself on Quigley, who knows what a Greek is. He draws two lines side by side and tells us these are parallel lines and the magical and mysterious thing is that they never meet, not if they were to be extended to infinity, not if they were extended to God's shoulders and that, boys, is a long way though there is a German Jew who is upsetting the whole world with his ideas on parallel lines.\nWe listen to Dotty and wonder what all this has to do with the state of the world with the Germans marching everywhere and bombing everything that stands. We can't ask him ourselves but we can get Brendan Quigley to do it. Anyone can see Brendan is the master's pet and that means he can ask any question he likes. After school we tell Brendan he has to ask the question tomorrow, What use is Euclid and all those lines that go on forever when the Germans are bombing everything? Brendan says he doesn't want to be the master's pet, he didn't ask for it, and he doesn't want to ask the question. He's afraid if he asks that question Dotty will attack him. We tell him if he doesn't ask the question we'll attack him.\nNext day Brendan raises his hand. Dotty gives him the little smile. Sir, what use is Euclid and all the lines when the Germans are bombing everything that stands?\nThe little smile is gone. Ah, Brendan. Ah, Quigley. Oh, boys, oh, boys.\nHe lays his stick on the desk and stands on the platform with his eyes closed. What use is Euclid? he says. Use? Without Euclid the Messerschmitt could never have taken to the sky. Without Euclid the Spitfire could not dart from cloud to cloud. Euclid brings us grace and beauty and elegance. What does he bring us, boys?\nGrace, sir.\nAnd?\nBeauty, sir.\nAnd?\nElegance, sir.\nEuclid is complete in himself and divine in application. Do you\nunderstand that, boys?\nWe do, sir.\nI doubt it, boys, I doubt it. To love Euclid is to be alone in this world.\nHe opens his eyes and sighs and you can see the eyes are a little watery.\nPaddy Clohessy is leaving the school that day and he's stopped by Mr. O'Dea, who teaches the fifth class. Mr. O'Dea says, You, what's your\nname?\nClohessy, sir.\nWhat class are you in?\nFourth class, sir.\nNow tell me, Clohessy, is that master of yours talking to you about\nEuclid?\nHe is, sir.\nAnd what is he saying?\nHe's saying he's a Greek.\nOf course he is, you diddering omadhaun. What else is he saying? He's saying there would be no school without Euclid.\nAh. Now is he drawing anything on the board?\nHe's drawing lines side by side that will never meet even if they\nland on God's shoulders.\nMother o' God.\nNo, sir. God's shoulders.\nI know, you idiot. Go home.\nThe next day there's a great noise at our classroom door and Mr. O'Dea is yelling, Come out, O'Neill, you chancer, you poltroon. We can hear everything he's saying because of the broken glass over the door.\nThe new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, is saying, Now, now, Mr. O'Dea. Control yourself. No quarreling in front of our pupils.\nWell, then, Mr. O'Halloran, tell him stop teaching the geometry. The geometry is for the fifth form and not the fourth. The geometry is mine. Tell him to teach the long division and leave Euclid to me. Long division will stretch his intellect such as it is, God help us. I don't want the minds of these boys destroyed by that chancer up there on the platform, him handing out apple skins and causing diarrhea right and left. Tell him Euclid is mine, Mr. O'Halloran, or I'll put a stop to his gallop.\nMr. O'Halloran tells Mr. O'Dea to return to his classroom and asks Mr. O'Neill to step into the hall. Mr. O'Halloran says, Now, Mr. O'Neill, I have asked you before to stay away from Euclid.\nYou have, Mr. O'Halloran, but you might as well ask me to stop eating my daily apple.\nI'll have to insist, Mr. O'Neill. No more Euclid.\nMr. O'Neill comes back to the room and his eyes are watery again. He says little has changed since the time of the Greeks for the barbarians are within the gates and their names are legion. What has changed since the time of the Greeks, boys?\nIt is torture to watch Mr. O'Neill peel the apple every day, to see the length of it, red or green, and if you're up near him to catch the freshness of it in your nose. If you're the good boy for that day and you answer the questions he gives it to you and lets you eat it there at your desk so that you can eat it in peace with no one to bother you the way they would if you took it into the yard. Then they'd torment you, Gimme a piece, gimme a piece, and you'd be lucky to have an inch left for yourself.\nThere are days when the questions are too hard and he torments us by dropping the apple peel into the wastebasket. Then he borrows a boy from another class to take the wastebasket down to the furnace to burn papers and apple peel or he'll leave it for the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, to take it all away in her big canvas sack. We'd like to ask Nellie to keep the peel for us before the rats get it but she's weary from cleaning the whole school by herself and she snaps at us, I have other things to be doin' with me life besides watchin' a scabby bunch rootin' around for the skin of an apple. Go 'way.\nHe peels the apple slowly. He looks around the room with the little smile. He teases us, Do you think, boys, I should give this to the pigeons on the windowsill? We say, No, sir, pigeons don't eat apples. Paddy Clohessy calls out, 'Twill give them the runs, sir, and we'll have it on our heads abroad in the yard.\nClohessy, you are an omadhaun. Do you know what an omadhaun is?\nI don't, sir.\nIt's the Irish, Clohessy, your native tongue, Clohessy. An omadhaun\nis a fool, Clohessy. You are an omadhaun. What is he, boys? An omadhaun, sir.\nClohessy says, That's what Mr. O'Dea called me, sir, a diddering omadhaun.\nHe pauses in his peeling to ask us questions about everything in the world and the boy with the best answers wins. Hands up, he says, who is the President of the United States of America?\nEvery hand in the class goes up and we're all disgusted when he asks a question that any omadhaun would know. We call out, Roosevelt.\nThen he says, You, Mulcahy, who stood at the foot of the cross when Our Lord was crucified?\nMulcahy is slow. The Twelve Apostles, sir. Mulcahy, what is the Irish word for fool? Omadhaun, sir.\nAnd what are you, Mulcahy?\nAn omadhaun, sir.\nFintan Slattery raises his hand. I know who stood at the foot of the cross, sir.\nOf course Fintan knows who stood at the foot of the cross. Why wouldn't he? He's always running off to Mass with his mother, who is known for her holiness. She's so holy her husband ran off to Canada to cut down trees, glad to be gone and never to be heard from again. She and Fintan say the rosary every night on their knees in the kitchen and read all kinds of religious magazines: The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart, The Lantern, The Far East, as well as every little book printed by the Catholic Truth Society. They go to Mass and Communion rain or shine and every Saturday they confess to the Jesuits who are known for their interest in intelligent sins not the usual sins you hear from people in lanes who are known for getting drunk and sometimes eating meat on Fridays before it goes bad and cursing on top of it. Fintan and his mother live on Catherine Street and Mrs. Slattery's neighbors call her Mrs. Offer-It-Up because no matter what happens, a broken leg, a spilled cup of tea, a disappeared husband, she says, Well, now, I'll offer that up and I'll have no end of Indulgences to get me into heaven. Fintan is just as bad. If you push him in the schoolyard or call him names he'll smile and tell you he'll pray for you and he'll offer it up for his soul and yours. The boys in Leamy's don't want Fintan praying for them and they threaten to give him a good fong in the arse if they catch him praying for them. He says he wants to be a saint when he grows up, which is ridiculous because you can't be a saint till you're dead. He says our grandchildren will be praying to his picture. One big boy says, My grandchildren will piss on your picture, and Fintan just smiles. His sister ran away to England when she was seventeen and everyone knows he wears her blouse at home and curls his hair with hot iron tongs every Saturday night so that he'll look gorgeous at Mass on Sunday. If he meets you going to Mass he'll say, Isn't my hair gorgeous, Frankie? He loves that word, gorgeous, and no other boy will ever use it.\nOf course he knows who stood at the foot of the cross. He probably knows what they were wearing and what they had for breakfast and now he's telling Dotty O'Neill it was the three Marys. Dotty says, Come up here, Fintan, and take your reward. He takes his time going to the platform and we can't believe our eyes when he takes out a pocketknife to cut the apple peel into little bits so that he can eat them one by one and not be stuffing the whole thing into his mouth like the rest of us when we win. He raises his hand, Sir, I'd like to give some of my apple away.\nThe apple, Fintan? No, indeed. You do not have the apple, Fintan. You have the peel, the mere skin. You have not nor will you ever achieve\nheights so dizzy you'll be feasting on the apple itself. Not my apple, Fintan. Now did I hear you say you want to give away your reward?\nYou did, sir. I'd like to give three pieces, to Quigley, Clohessy and McCourt.\nWhy, Fintan?\nThey're my friends, sir.\nThe boys around the room are sneering and nudging each other and I\nfeel ashamed because they'll say I curl my hair and I'll be tormented in the schoolyard and why does he think I'm his friend? If they say I wear my sister's blouse there's no use telling them I don't have a sister because they'll say, You'd wear it if you had a sister. There's no use saying anything in the schoolyard because there's always someone with an answer and there's nothing you can do but punch them in the nose and if you were to punch everyone who has an answer you'd be punching morning noon and night.\nQuigley takes the bit of peel from Fintan. Thanks, Fintan.\nThe whole class is looking at Clohessy because he's the biggest and the toughest and if he says thanks I'll say thanks. He says, Thanks very much, Fintan, and blushes and I say, Thanks very much, Fintan, and I try to stop myself from blushing but I can't and all the boys sneer again and I'd like to hit them.\nAfter school the boys call to Fintan, Hoi, Fintan, are you goin'home to curl your gorgeous hair? Fintan smiles and climbs the steps of the schoolyard. A big boy from seventh class says to Paddy Clohessy, I suppose you'd be curlin' your hair too if you wasn't a baldy with a shaved head.\nPaddy says, Shurrup, and the boy says, Oh, an' who's goin' to make me? Paddy tries a punch but the big boy hits his nose and knocks him down and there's blood. I try to hit the big boy but he grabs me by the throat and bangs my head against the wall till I see lights and black dots. Paddy walks away holding his nose and crying and the big boy pushes me after him. Fintan is outside on the street and he says, Oh, Francis, Francis, oh, Patrick, Patrick, what's up? Why are you crying, Patrick? and Paddy says, I'm hungry. I can't fight nobody because I'm starving with the hunger an' fallin' down an' I'm ashamed of meself.\nFintan says, Come with me, Patrick. My mother will give us something, and Paddy says, Ah, no, me nose is bleedin'.\nDon't worry. She'll put something on your nose or a key on the back of your neck. Francis, you must come, too. You always look hungry.\nAh, no, Fintan.\nAh, do, Francis.\nAll right, Fintan.\nFintan's flat is like a chapel. There are two pictures, the Sacred\nHeart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Jesus is showing His heart with the crown of thorns, the fire, the blood. His head is tilted to the left to show His great sorrow. The Virgin Mary is showing her heart and it would be a pleasant heart if it didn't have that crown of thorns. Her head is tilted to the right to show her sorrow because she knows her Son will come to a sad end.\nThere's a picture on another wall of a man with a brown robe and birds sitting all over him. Fintan says, Do you know who that is, Francis? No? That's your patron, St. Francis of Assisi, and do you know what today is?\nThe fourth of October.\nThat's right and it's his feast day and special for you because you can ask St. Francis for anything and he'll surely give it to you. That's why I wanted you to come here today. Sit down, Patrick, sit down, Francis.\nMrs. Slattery comes in with her rosary beads in her hand. She's happy to meet Fintan's new friends and would we like a cheese sandwich? And look at your poor nose, Patrick. She touches his nose with the cross on her rosary beads and says a little prayer. She tells us these rosary beads were blessed by the Pope himself and would stop the flow of a river if requested never mind Patrick's poor nose.\nFintan says he won't have a sandwich because he's fasting and praying for the boy who hit Paddy and me. Mrs. Slattery gives him a kiss on the head and tells him he's a saint out of heaven and asks if we'd like mustard on our sandwiches and I tell her I never heard of mustard on cheese and I'd love it. Paddy says, I dunno. I never had a sangwidge in me life, and we all laugh and I wonder how you could live ten years like Paddy and never have a sandwich. Paddy laughs, too, and you can see his teeth are white and black and green.\nWe eat the sandwich and drink tea and Paddy wants to know where the lavatory is. Fintan takes him through the bedroom to the backyard and when they come back Paddy says, I have to go home. Me mother'll kill me. I'll wait for you outside, Frankie.\nNow I have to go to the lavatory and Fintan leads me to the backyard. He says, I have to go, too, and when I unbutton my fly I can't pee because he's looking at me and he says, You were fooling. You don't have to go at all. I like to look at you, Francis. That's all. I wouldn't want to commit any class of a sin with our Confirmation coming next year.\nPaddy and I leave together. I'm bursting and run behind a garage to pee. Paddy is waiting for me and as we walk along Hartstonge Street he says, That was a powerful sangwidge, Frankie, an' him an' his mother is very holy but I wouldn't want to go to Fintan's flat anymore because he's very odd, isn't he, Frankie?\nHe is, Paddy.\nThe way he looks at it when you take it out, that's odd, isn't it, Frankie?\n'Tis, Paddy.\nA few days later Paddy whispers, Fintan Slattery said we could come to his flat at lunchtime. His mother won't be there and she leaves his lunch for him. He might give us some too and he has lovely milk. Will we go?\nFintan sits two rows from us. He knows what Paddy is saying to me and he moves his eyebrows up and down as if to say, Will you come? I whisper yes to Paddy and he nods to Fintan and the master barks at us to stop waggling our eyebrows and our lips or the ash plant will sing across our backsides.\nBoys in the schoolyard see the three of us walk out and they pass remarks. Oh, Gawd, look at Fintan and his ingles. Paddy says, Fintan, what's an ingle? and Fintan says it's just a boy from olden times who sits in a corner, that's all. He tells us sit at the table in his kitchen and we can read his comic books if we like, Film Fun, the Beano, the Dandy, or the religious magazines or his mother's romance magazines, the Miracle and the Oracle, which always have stories about factory girls who are poor but beautiful in love with sons of earls and vice versa and the factory girl ends up throwing herself into the Thames with the\nhopelessness only to be rescued by a passing carpenter who is poor but honest and will love the factory girl for her own humble self though it turns out the passing carpenter is really the son of a duke, which is much higher than an earl, so that now the poor factory girl is a duchess and can look down her nose at the earl who spurned her because she's happy tending her roses on her twelve-thousand-acre estate in Shropshire and being kind to her poor old mother, who refuses to leave her humble little cottage for all the money in the world.\nPaddy says, I don't want to read nothing, it's all a cod, all them stories. Fintan removes the cloth covering his sandwich and glass of milk. The milk looks creamy and cool and delicious and the sandwich bread is almost as white. Paddy says, Is that a ham sangwidge? and Fintan says, 'Tis. Paddy says, That's a lovely looking sangwidge and is there mustard on it? Fintan nods and slices the sandwich in two. Mustard seeps out. He licks it off his fingers and takes a nice mouthful of milk. He cuts the sandwich again into quarters, eighths, sixteenths, takes The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart from the pile of magazines and reads while he eats his sandwich bits and drinks his milk and Paddy and I look at him and I know Paddy is wondering what we're doing here at all, at all, because that's what I'm wondering myself hoping Fintan will pass over the plate to us but he doesn't, he finishes the milk, leaves bits of sandwich on the plate, covers it with the cloth and wipes his lips in his dainty way, lowers his head, blesses himself and says grace after meals and, God, we'll be late for school, and blesses himself again on the way out with holy water from the little china font hanging by the door with the little image of the Virgin Mary showing her heart and pointing at it with two fingers as if we couldn't make it out for ourselves.\nIt's too late for Paddy and me to run and get the bun and milk from Nellie Ahearn and I don't know how I'm going to last from now till I can run home after school and get a piece of bread. Paddy stops at the school gate. He says, I can't go in there starving with the hunger. I'd fall asleep and Dotty'd kill me.\nFintan is anxious. Come on, come on, we'll be late. Come on, Francis, hurry up.\nI'm not going in, Fintan. You had your lunch. We had nothing.\nPaddy explodes. You're a feckin' chancer, Fintan. That's what you are an' a feckin' begrudger too with your feckin' sangwidge an' your feckin' Sacred Heart of Jesus on the wall an' your feckin' holy water. You can kiss my arse, Fintan.\nOh, Patrick.\nOh, Patrick my feckin' arse, Fintan. Come on, Frankie.\nFintan runs into school and Paddy and I make our way to an orchard\nin Ballinacurra. We climb a wall and a fierce dog comes at us till Paddy talks to him and tells him he's a good dog and we're hungry and go home to your mother. The dog licks Paddy's face and trots away waving his tail and Paddy is delighted with himself. We stuff apples into our shirts till we can barely get back over the wall to run into a long field and sit under a hedge eating the apples till we can't swallow another bit and we stick our faces into a stream for the lovely cool water. Then we run to opposite ends of a ditch to shit and wipe ourselves with grass and thick leaves. Paddy is squatting and saying, There's nothing in the world like a good feed of apples, a drink of water and a good shit, better than any sangwidge of cheese and mustard and Dotty O'Neill can shove his apple up his arse.\nThere are three cows in a field with their heads over a stone wall and they say moo to us. Paddy says, Bejasus, 'tis milkin' time, and he's over the wall, stretched on his back under a cow with her big udder hanging into his face. He pulls on a teat and squirts milk into his mouth. He stops squirting and says, Come on, Frankie, fresh milk. 'Tis lovely. Get that other cow, they're all ready for the milkin'.\nI get under the cow and pull on a teat but she kicks and moves and I'm sure she's going to kill me. Paddy comes over and shows me how to do it, pull hard and straight and the milk comes out in a powerful stream. The two of us lie under the one cow and we're having a great time filling ourselves with milk when there's a roar and there's a man with a stick charging across the field. We're over the wall in a minute and he can't follow us because of his rubber boots. He stands at the wall and shakes his stick and shouts that if he ever catches us we'll have the length of his boot up our arses and we laugh because we're out of harm's way and I'm wondering why anyone should be hungry in a world full of milk and apples.\nIt's all right for Paddy to say Dotty can shove the apple up his arse but I don't want to rob orchards and milk cows forever and I'll always try to win Dotty's apple peel so that I can go home and tell Dad how I answered the hard questions.\nWe're walking back through Ballinacurra. There's rain and lightning and we run but it's hard for me with the sole of my shoe flapping and threatening to trip me. Paddy can run all he wants in his long bare feet and you hear them slapping on the pavement. My shoes and stockings are soaked and they make their own sound, squish, squish. Paddy notices that and we make a song from our two sounds, slap slap, squish, squish, slap squish, squish slap. We laugh so hard over our song we have to hold on to one another. The rain gets heavier and we know we can't stand under a tree or we'll be fried entirely so we stand by a door which is opened in a minute by a big fat maid in a little white hat and a black dress with a little white apron who tells us get away from this door we're a disgrace. We run from the door and Paddy calls back, Mullingar heifer, beef to the heels, and he laughs till he chokes and has to lean against a wall with the weakness. There's no sense in standing in from the rain anymore, we're soaked to the skin, so we take our time down O'Connell Avenue. Paddy says he learned that Mullingar heifer thing from his uncle Peter, the one that was in India in the English army and they have a photo of him standing with a group of soldiers with their helmets and guns and bandoliers around their chests and there are dark men in uniform who are Indians and loyal to the King. Uncle Peter had a great time for himself in a place called Kashmir, which is lovelier than Killarney that they're always bragging about and singing. Paddy goes on again about running away and winding up in India in a silken tent with the girl with the red dot and the curry and the figs and he's making me hungry even if I'm stuffed with apples and milk.\nThe rain is clearing and there are birds honking over our heads. Paddy says they're ducks or geese or something on their way to Africa where it's nice and warm. The birds have more sense than the Irish. They come to the Shannon for their holidays and then they go back to the warm places, maybe even India. He says he'll write me a letter when he's over there and I can come to India and have my own girl with a red dot.\nWhat's that dot for, Paddy?\nIt shows they're high class, the quality.\nBut, Paddy, would the quality in India talk to you if they knew you were from a lane in Limerick and had no shoes?\nCourse they would, but the English quality wouldn't. The English quality wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.\nSteam of their piss? God, Paddy, did you think of that yourself?\nNaw, naw, that's what my father says below in the bed when he's coughin' up the gobs and blamin' the English for everything.\nAnd I think, Steam of their piss. I'll keep that for myself. I'll go around Limerick saying it, Steam of their piss, Steam of their piss, and when I go to America some day I'll be the only one who knows it.\nQuestion Quigley is wobbling toward us on a big woman's bicycle and calls to me, Hoi, Frankie McCourt, you're going to be killed. Dotty O'Neill sent a note to your house and said you didn't come back to school after lunch, that you went on the mooch with Paddy Clohessy. Your mother is going to kill you. Your father is out looking for you and he's going to kill you, too.\nOh, God, I feel cold and empty and I wish I could be in India where it's nice and warm and there's no school and my father could never find me to kill me. Paddy tells the Question, He didn't go on the mooch and I didn't either. Fintan Slattery starved us to death and we were too late for the bun and the milk. Then Paddy says to me, Don't mind 'em, Frankie, 'tis all a cod. They're always sendin' notes to our house and we wipe our arses with them.\nMy mother and father would never wipe their arses with a note from the master and I'm afraid now to go home. The Question rides off on the bicycle, laughing, and I don't know why because he once ran away from home and slept in a ditch with four goats and that's worse than mooching from school half a day anytime.\nI could turn up the Barrack Road now and go home and tell my parents I'm sorry I went on the mooch and I did it because of the hunger but Paddy says, Come on, we'll go down the Dock Road and throw rocks in the Shannon.\nWe throw rocks in the river and we swing on the iron chains along the bank. It's getting dark and I don't know where I'm going to sleep. I might have to stay there by the Shannon or find a door or I might have to go back out the country and find a ditch like Brendan Quigley with four goats. Paddy says I can go home with him, I can sleep on the floor and I'll dry out.\nPaddy lives in one of the tall houses on Arthur's Quay looking at the river. Everyone in Limerick knows these houses are old and might fall down at any minute. Mam often says, I don't want any of ye going down to Arthur's Quay and if I find ye there I'll break yeer faces. The people down there are wild and ye could get robbed and killed.\nIt's raining again and small children are playing in the hallway and up the stairs. Paddy says, Mind yourself, because some of the steps are missing and there is shit on the ones that are still there. He says that's because there's only one privy and it's in the backyard and children don't get down the stairs in time to put their little arses on the bowl, God help us.\nThere's a woman with a shawl sitting on the fourth flight smoking a cigarette. She says, Is that you, Paddy?\n'Tis, Mammy.\nI'm fagged out, Paddy. Them steps is killin' me. Did you have your tea?\nI didn't.\nWell, I don't know if there's any bread left. Go up an' see. Paddy's family live in one big room with a high ceiling and a small\nfireplace. There are two tall windows and you can see out to the Shannon. His father is in a bed in the corner, groaning and spitting into a bucket. Paddy's brothers and sisters are on mattresses on the floor, sleeping, talking, looking at the ceiling. There's a baby with no clothes crawling over to Paddy's father's bucket and Paddy pulls him away. His mother comes in, gasping, from the stairs. Jesus, I'm dead, she says.\nShe finds some bread and makes weak tea for Paddy and me. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. They don't say anything. They don't say what are you doing here or go home or anything till Mr. Clohessy says, Who's that? and Paddy tells him, 'Tis Frankie McCourt.\nMr. Clohessy says, McCourt? What class of a name is that? My father is from the North, Mr. Clohessy.\nAnd what's your mother's name?\nAngela, Mr. Clohessy.\nAh, Jaysus, 'twouldn't be Angela Sheehan, would it?\n'Twould, Mr. Clohessy. Ah, Jaysus, he says, and he has a coughing fit which brings up all kinds of stuff from his insides and has him hanging over the bucket. When the cough passes he falls back on the pillow. Ah, Frankie, I knew your mother well. Danced with her, Mother o' Christ, I'm dying inside, danced with her I did below in the Wembley Hall and a champion dancer she was too.\nHe hangs over the bucket again. He gasps for air and reaches his arms out to get it. He suffers but he won't stop talking.\nChampion dancer she was, Frankie. Not skinny mind you but a feather in my arms and there was many a sorry man when she left Limerick. Can you dance, Frankie?\nAh, no, Mr. Clohessy.\nPaddy says, He can, Dada. He had the lessons from Mrs. O'Connor and Cyril Benson.\nWell, dance, Frankie. Round the house an' mind the dresser, Frankie. Lift the foot, lad.\nI can't, Mr. Clohessy. I'm no good.\nNo good? Angela's Sheehan's son? Dance, Frankie, or I'll get outa this bed an' wheel you round the house.\nMy shoe is broken, Mr. Clohessy.\nFrankie, Frankie, you're bringin' the cough on me. Will you dance for the love o' Jesus so I can remember me youth with your mother in the Wembley Hall. Take off the feckin' shoe, Frankie, an' dance.\nI have to make up dances and tunes to go with them the way I did a long time ago when I was young. I dance around the room with one shoe because I forgot to take it off. I try to make up words, Oh, The Walls of Limerick are falling down, falling down, falling down, The Walls of Limerick falling down and the River Shannon kills us.\nMr. Clohessy is laughing in the bed. Oh, Jaysus, I never heard likes o' that on land or sea. That's a great leg for the dancing you have there, Frankie. Oh, Jaysus. He coughs and brings up ropes of green and yellow stuff. It makes me sick to look at it and I wonder if I should go home from all this sickness and this bucket and let my parents kill me if they want to.\nPaddy lies down on a mattress by the window and I lie beside him. I keep my clothes on like everybody else and I even forget to take off my\nother shoe, which is wet and squishy and stinks. Paddy falls asleep right away and I look at his mother sitting by the bit of a fire smoking another cigarette. Paddy's father groans and coughs and spits into the bucket. He says, Feckin' blood, and she says, You'll have to go into the sanatorium sooner or later.\nI will not. The day they put you in there is the end of you.\nYou could be givin'the consumption to the children. I could get the guards to take you away you're that much of a danger to the children.\nIf they were to get it they'd have it be now.\nThe fire dies and Mrs. Clohessy climbs over him into the bed. In a minute she's snoring even if he's still coughing and laughing about the days of his youth when he danced with Angela Sheehan light as a feather in the Wembley Hall.\nIt's cold in the room and I'm shivering in my wet clothes. Paddy is shivering too but he's asleep and he doesn't know he's cold. I don't know if I should stay here or get up and go home but who wants to be wandering the streets when a guard might ask you what you're doing out. It's my first time away from my family and I know I'd rather be in my own house with the smelly lavatory and stable next door. It's bad when our kitchen is a lake and we have to go up to Italy but it's worse in the Clohessys' when you have to go down four flights to the lavatory and slip on shit all the way down. I'd be better off with four goats in a ditch.\nI drift in and out of sleep but I have to wake up for good when Mrs. Clohessy goes around pulling at her family to get them up. They all went to bed with their clothes on so they don't have to get dressed and there's no fighting. They grumble and run out the door to get downstairs to the backyard lavatory. I have to go too and I run down with Paddy but his sister Peggy is on the bowl and we have to piss against a wall. She says, I'll tell Ma what ye did, and Paddy says, Shurrup or I'll push you down into that feckin' lavatory. She jumps off the lavatory, pulls her drawers up and runs up the stairs crying, I'll tell, I'll tell, and when we get back to the room Mrs. Clohessy gives Paddy a belt on the head for what he did to his poor little sister. Paddy says nothing because Mrs. Clohessy is spooning porridge into mugs and jam jars and one bowl and telling us to eat up and go to school. She sits at the table eating her porridge. Her hair is gray black and dirty. It dangles in the bowl and picks up bits of porridge and drops of milk. The children slurp the porridge and complain they didn't get enough, they're starving with the hunger. They have snotty noses and sore eyes and scabby knees. Mr. Clohessy coughs and squirms on the bed and brings up the great gobs of blood and I run out of the room and puke on the stairs where there's a step missing and there's a shower of porridge and bits of apple to the floor below where people go back and forth to the lavatory in the yard. Paddy comes down and says, Sure that's all right. Everywan gets sick an' shits on them stairs an' the whole feckin' place is falling down anyway.\nI don't know what I'm supposed to do now. If I go back to school I'll be killed and why should I go back to school or go home to get killed when I can go out the road and live on milk and apples the rest of my life till I go to America. Paddy says, Come on. School is all a cod anyway an' the masters is all madmen.\nThere's a knock at the Clohessys' door and it's Mam holding my little brother, Michael, by the hand, and Guard Dennehy, who is in charge of school attendance. Mam sees me and says, What are you doing with one shoe on? and Guard Dennehy says, Ah, now, missus, I think a more\nimportant question would be, What are you doing with one shoe off, ha,\nha.\nMichael runs to me. Mammy was crying. Mammy was crying for you,\nFrankie.\nShe says, Where were you all night?\nI was here.\nYou had me demented. Your father walked every street in Limerick\nlooking for you.\nMr. Clohessy says, Who's at the door?\nIt's my mother, Mr. Clohessy.\nGod above, is that Angela?\n'Tis, Mr. Clohessy.\nHe struggles up on his elbows. Well, for the love of God, will you\ncome in, Angela. Don't you know me?\nMam looks puzzled. It's dark in the room and she tries to make out\nwho is in the bed. He says, 'Tis me, Dennis Clohessy, Angela. Ah, no.\n'Tis, Angela.\nAh, no.\nI know, Angela. I'm changed. The cough is killin' me. But I\nremember the nights at the Wembley Hall. Aw, Jaysus, you were a great dancer. Nights at the Wembley Hall, Angela, and the fish and chips after. Oh, boys, oh, boys, Angela.\nMy mother has tears running down her face. She says, You were a great dancer yourself, Dennis Clohessy.\nWe could have won competitions, Angela. Fred and Ginger would have been lookin' over their shoulders but you had to run off to America. Aw, Jaysus.\nHe has another coughing fit and we have to stand and watch him hang over the bucket again and bring up the bad stuff from his insides. Guard Dennehy says, I think, missus, we found the by an' I'll be going. He says to me, If you ever go on the mooch again, by, we'll have you in the jail above. Are you listenin' to me, by?\nI am, Guard.\nDon't be tormentin' your mother, by. That's wan thing the guards won't put up with, the tormentin' of mothers.\nI won't, Guard. I won't torment her.\nHe leaves and Mam goes to the bed to take Mr. Clohessy's hand. His face is caved in all around his eyes and his hair is shiny black with the sweat running from the top of his head. His children stand around the bed looking at him and looking at Mam. Mrs. Clohessy sits by the fire rattling the poker in the grate and pushing the baby away from the fire. She says, 'Tis his own bloody fault for not goin' into hospital, so 'tis.\nMr. Clohessy gasps, I'd be all right if I could live in a dry place. Angela, is America a dry place?\n'Tis, Dennis.\nThe doctor told me go to Arizona. A funny man that doctor. Arizona how are you. I don't have the money to go around the corner for a pint.\nMam says, You'll be all right, Dennis. I'll light a candle for you. Save your money, Angela. My dancin' days are done.\nI have to go now, Dennis. My son has to go to school.\nBefore you go, Angela, will you do one thing for me?\nI will, Dennis, if 'tis in my power.\nWould you ever give us a verse of that song you sang the night before you went to America?\nThat's a hard song, Dennis. I wouldn't have the wind for it.\nAh, come on, Angela. I never hear a song anymore. There isn't a song in this house. The wife there doesn't have a note in her head an' no step in her foot.\nMam says, All right. I'll try.\nOh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune, Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.\nWhen the boys began to gather in the glen of a Summer night, And the Kerry piper's tuning made us long with wild delight.\nShe stops and presses her hand to her chest, Oh, God, my wind is gone. Help me, Frank, with the song, and I sing along, Oh, to think of it, Oh, to dream of it, fills my heart with tears.\nOh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.\nMr. Clohessy tries to sing with us, gone, alas, like our youth too soon, but it brings on the cough. He shakes his head and cries, I wouldn't doubt you, Angela. It takes me back. God bless you.\nGod bless you, too, Dennis, and thanks, Mrs. Clohessy, for having Frankie here off the streets.\n'Twas no trouble, Mrs. McCourt. He's quiet enough.\nQuiet enough, says Mr. Clohessy, but he's not the dancer his mother\nwas.\nMam says, 'Tis hard to dance with one shoe, Dennis.\nI know, Angela, but you'd wonder why he didn't take it off. Is he a\nbit strange?\nAh, sometimes he has the odd manner like his father. Oh, yes. The\nfather is from the North, Angela, and that would account for it. They'd think nothing of dancing with one shoe in the North.\nWe walk up Patrick Street and O'Connell Street, Paddy Clohessy and Mam and Michael and myself, and Mam sobs all the way. Michael says, Don't cry, Mammy. Frankie won't run away.\nShe lifts him up and hugs him. Oh, no, Michael, 'tisn't Frankie I'm crying about. 'Tis Dennis Clohessy and the dancing nights at the Wembley Hall and the fish and chips after.\nShe comes into the school with us. Mr. O'Neill looks cross and tells us sit down he'll be with us in a minute. He talks a long time at the door with my mother and when she leaves he walks between the seats and pats Paddy Clohessy on the head.\nI'm very sorry for the Clohessys and all their troubles but I think they saved me from getting into trouble with my mother.\nVII\nThere are Thursdays when Dad gets his dole money at the Labour Exchange and a man might say, Will we go for a pint, Malachy? and Dad will say, One, only one, and the man will say, Oh, God, yes, one, and before the night is over all the money is gone and Dad comes home singing and getting us out of bed to line up and promise to die for Ireland when the\ncall comes. He even gets Michael up and he's only three but there he is singing and promising to die for Ireland at the first opportunity. That's what Dad calls it, the first opportunity. I'm nine and Malachy is eight and we know all the songs. We sing all the verses of Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley, \"The West's Asleep, \"\n\"O'Donnell Abu, \"\n\"The Boys of Wexford. \" We sing and promise to die because you never know when Dad might have a penny or two left over from the drinking and if he gives it to us we can run to Kathleen O'Connell's next day for toffee. Some nights he says Michael is the best singer of all and he gives him the penny. Malachy and I wonder what's the use of being eight and nine and knowing all the songs and ready to die when Michael gets the penny so that he can go to the shop next day and stuff his gob with toffee galore. No one can ask him to die for Ireland at the age of three, not even Padraig Pearse, who was shot by the English in Dublin in 1916 and expected the whole world to die with him. Besides, Mikey Molloy's father said anyone who wants to die for Ireland is a donkey's arse. Men have been dying for Ireland since the beginning of time and look at the state of the country.\nIt's bad enough that Dad loses jobs in the third week but now he drinks all the dole money once a month. Mam gets desperate and in the morning she has the bitter face and she won't talk to him. He has his tea and leaves the house early for the long walk into the country. When he returns in the evening she still won't talk to him and she won't make his tea. If the fire is dead for the want of coal or turf and there's no way of boiling water for the tea, he says, Och, aye, and drinks water out of a jam jar and smacks his lips the way he would with a pint of porter. He says good water is all a man needs and Mam makes a snorting sound. When she's not talking to him the house is heavy and cold and we know we're not supposed to talk to him either for fear she'll give us the bitter look. We know Dad has done the bad thing and we know you can make anyone suffer by not talking to him. Even little Michael knows that when Dad does the bad thing you don't talk to him from Friday to Monday and when he tries to lift you to his lap you run to Mam.\nI'm nine years old and I have a pal, Mickey Spellacy, whose relations are dropping one by one of the galloping consumption. I envy Mickey because every time someone dies in his family he gets a week off from school and his mother stitches a black diamond patch on his sleeve so that he can wander from lane to lane and street to street and people will know he has the grief and pat his head and give him money and sweets for his sorrow.\nBut this summer Mickey is worried. His sister, Brenda, is wasting away with the consumption and it's only August and if she dies before September he won't get his week off from school because you can't get a week off from school when there's no school. He comes to Billy Campbell and me to ask if we'll go around the corner to St. Joseph's Church and pray for Brenda to hang on till September.\nWhat's in it for us, Mickey, if we go around the corner praying?\nWell, if Brenda hangs on and I get me week off ye can come to the wake and have ham and cheese and cake and sherry and lemonade and everything and ye can listen to the songs and stories all night.\nWho could say no to that? There's nothing like a wake for having a good time. We trot around to the church where they have statues of St. Joseph himself as well as the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and\nSt. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, the Little Flower. I pray to the Little Flower because she died of the consumption herself and she'd understand.\nOne of our prayers must have been powerful because Brenda stays alive and doesn't die till the second day of school. We tell Mickey we're sorry for his troubles but he's delighted with his week off and he gets the black diamond patch which will bring the money and sweets.\nMy mouth is watering at the thought of the feast at Brenda's wake. Billy knocks on the door and there's Mickey's aunt. Well?\nWe came to say a prayer for Brenda and Mickey said we could come to the wake.\nShe yells, Mickey! What? Come here. Did you tell this gang they could come to your sister's wake?\nNo.\nBut, Mickey, you promised...\nShe slams the door in our faces. We don't know what to do till\nBilly Campbell says, We'll go back to St. Joseph's and pray that from now on everyone in Mickey Spellacy's family will die in the middle of the summer and he'll never get a day off from school for the rest of his life.\nOne of our prayers is surely powerful because next summer Mickey himself is carried off by the galloping consumption and he doesn't get a day off from school and that will surely teach him a lesson.\nProddy Woddy ring the bell,\nNot for heaven but for hell.\nOn Sunday mornings in Limerick I watch them go to church, the Protestants, and I feel sorry for them, especially the girls, who are so lovely, they have such beautiful white teeth. I feel sorry for the beautiful Protestant girls, they're doomed. That's what the priests tell us. Outside the Catholic Church there is no salvation. Outside the Catholic Church there is nothing but doom. And I want to save them. Protestant girl, come with me to the True Church. You'll be saved and you won't have the doom. After Mass on Sunday I go with my friend Billy Campbell to watch them play croquet on the lovely lawn beside their church on Barrington Street. Croquet is a Protestant game. They hit the ball with the mallet, pock and pock again, and laugh. I wonder how they can laugh or don't they even know they're doomed? I feel sorry for them and I say, Billy, what's the use of playing croquet when you're doomed?\nHe says, Frankie, what's the use of not playing croquet when you're doomed?\nGrandma says to Mam, Your brother Pat, bad leg an' all, was selling papers all over Limerick by the time he was eight and that Frank of yours is big and ugly enough to work.\nBut he's only nine and still in school.\nSchool. 'Tis school that has him the way he is talkin' back an' goin' around with the sour puss an' the odd manner like his father. He could get out an' help poor Pat of a Friday night when the Limerick Leader is a ton weight. He could run up the long garden paths of the quality an' save Pat's poor legs an' earn a few pennies into the bargain.\nHe has to go to the Confraternity on Friday nights.\nNever mind the Confraternity. There's nothin' in the catechism about confraternities.\nI meet Uncle Pat at the Limerick Leader on Friday evening at five. The man handing out the papers says my arms are that skinny I'd be lucky to carry two stamps but Uncle Pat sticks eight papers under each arm. He tells me, I'll kill you if you drop 'em for 'tis raining abroad, pelting out of the heavens. He tells me hug the walls going up O'Connell Street to keep the papers dry. I'm to run in where there's a delivery, climb the outside steps, in the door, up the stairs, yell Paper, get the money they owe him for the week, down the stairs, give him the money and on to the next stop. Customers give him tips for his troubles and he keeps them for himself.\nWe make our way up O'Connell Avenue, out Ballinacurra, in by the South Circular Road, down Henry Street and back to the office for more papers. Uncle Pat wears a cap and a thing like a cowboy poncho to keep his papers dry but he complains his feet are killing him and we stop in a pub for a pint for his poor feet. Uncle Pa Keating is there all black and having a pint and he says to Uncle Pat, Ab, are you going to let that boy stand there with his face hanging out for the want of a lemonade?\nUncle Pat says, Wha? and Uncle Pa Keating gets impatient. Christ, he's dragging your feckin' papers all over Limerick and you can't-Oh, never mind. Timmy, give the child a lemonade. Frankie, don't you have a raincoat at home?\nNo, Uncle Pa.\nYou're not supposed to be out in this weather. You're drenched entirely. Who sent you out in this muck?\nGrandma said I had to help Uncle Pat because of his bad leg. Course she did, the oul' bitch, but don't tell them I said that. Uncle Pat is struggling off the seat and gathering up his papers.\nCome on, 'tis gettin' dark.\nHe hobbles along the streets calling, Anna Lie Sweets Lie, which\ndoesn't sound a bit like Limerick Leader and it doesn't matter because everyone knows this is Ab Sheehan that was dropped on his head. Here, Ab, give us a Leader, how's your poor leg, keep the change an' get yourself a fag for 'tis an awful feckin' night to be out sellin' the feckin' papers.\nTanks, says Ab, my uncle. Tanks, tanks, tanks, and it's hard to keep up with him on the streets bad as his leg is. He says, How many Leaders have you under your oxter?\nOne, Uncle Pat.\nTake that Leader in to Mr. Timoney. He owes me for a fortnight now. Get that money an' there's a tip. He's a good man for the tip an' don't be shovin' it in your pocket like your cousin Gerry. Shoved it in his pocket, the little bugger.\nI bang on the door with the knocker and there's a great howl from a dog so big he makes the door shake. A man's voice says, Macushla, quit the bloody racket or I'll give you a good fong in the arse for yourself. The racket stops, the door opens and the man is there, white hair, thick glasses, white sweater, a stick in his hand. He says, Who is it? Who do we have?\nThe paper, Mr. Timoney.\nWe don't have Ab Sheehan here, do we?\nI'm his nephew, sir.\nIs it Gerry Sheehan we have here?\nNo, sir. I'm Frank McCourt.\nAnother nephew? Does he make them? Is there a little nephew factory\nin the backyard? Here's the money for the fortnight and give me the paper\nor keep it. What's the use? I can't read anymore and Mrs. Minihan that's supposed to read to me didn't come. Legless with the sherry, that's what she is. What's your name?\nFrank, sir.\nCan you read?\nI can, sir.\nDo you want to earn a sixpence?\nI do, sir.\nCome here tomorrow. Your name is Francis, isn't it? Frank, sir.\nYour name is Francis. There was never a St. Frank. That's a name for gangsters and politicians. Come here tomorrow at eleven and read to me.\nI will, sir.\nAre you sure you can read?\nI am, sir.\nYou can call me Mr. Timoney.\nI will, Mr. Timoney.\nUncle Pat is mumbling at the gate, rubbing his leg. Where's me\nmoney an' you're not supposed to be chattin' with the customers an' me here with the leg destroyed be the rain. He has to stop at the pub at Punch's Cross to have a pint for the destroyed leg. After the pint he says he can't walk another inch and we get on a bus. The conductor says, Fares, please, fares, but Uncle Pat says, Go 'way an' don't be botherin' me, can't you see the state o' me leg?\nOh, all right, Ab, all right.\nThe bus stops at the O'Connell Monument and Uncle Pat goes to the Monument Fish and Chip Caf\u00e9 where the smells are so delicious my stomach beats with the hunger. He gets a shilling's worth of fish and chips and my mouth is watering but when we get to Grandma's door he gives me a threepenny bit, tells me meet him again next Friday and go home now to my mother.\nThe dog Macushla is lying outside Mr. Timoney's door and when I open the little garden gate to go up the path she rushes at me and knocks me back out on the pavement and she'd eat my face if Mr. Timoney didn't come out and flail at her with his stick and yell, Come in out of it, ye hoor, ye overgrown man eatin' bitch. Didn't you have your breakfast, you hoor? Are you all right, Francis? Come in. That dog is a right Hindu, so she is, and that's where I found her mother wandering around Bangalore. If ever you're getting a dog, Francis, make sure it's a Buddhist. Good natured dogs, the Buddhists. Never, never get a Mahommedan. They'll eat you sleeping. Never a Catholic dog. They'll eat you every day including Fridays. Sit down and read to me.\nThe Limerick Leader, Mr. Timoney?\nNo, not the bloody Limerick Leader. I wouldn't wipe the hole of my arse with the Limerick Leader. There's a book over there on the table, Gulliver's Travels. That's not what I want you to read. Look in the back for another thing, A Modest Proposal. Read that to me. It begins, It is a melancholy object to those who walk... Do you have that? I have the whole bloody thing in my head but I still want you to read to me.\nHe stops me after two or three pages. You're a good reader. And what do you think of that, Francis, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled, eh? Macushla would love a dinner of a nice plump Irish infant, wouldn't you, you oul' hoor?\nHe gives me sixpence, and tells me return next Saturday.\nMam is delighted I earned sixpence for reading to Mr. Timoney and what was it he wanted read, the Limerick Leader? I tell her I had to read A Modest Proposal from the back of Gulliver's Travels and she says, That's all right, 'tis only a children's book. You'd expect him to want something strange for he's a little off in the head after years in the sun in the English army in India and they say he was married to one of them Indian women and she was accidentally shot by a soldier during some class of a disturbance. That's the kind of thing that would drive you to children's books. She knows this Mrs. Minihan who lives next door to Mr. Timoney and used to clean house but couldn't stand it anymore the way he laughed at the Catholic Church and said one man's sin was another man's romp. Mrs. Minihan didn't mind the odd drop of sherry of a Saturday morning but then he tried to turn her into a Buddhist, which he said he was himself and the Irish would be much better off in general if they sat under a tree and watched the Ten Commandments and the Seven Deadly Sins float down the Shannon and far out to sea.\nThe next Friday Declan Collopy from the Confraternity sees me on the street delivering the papers with my uncle Pat Sheehan. Hoi, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' with Ab Sheehan?\nHe's my uncle.\nYou're supposed to be at the Confraternity.\nI'm working, Declan.\nYou're not supposed to be working. You're not even ten and you're\ndestroyin' the perfect attendance in our section. If you're not there next Friday I'll give you a good thump in the gob, do you hear me?\nUncle Pat says, Go 'way, go 'way, or I'll walk on you.\nAh, shut up, Mr. Stupid that was dropped on your head. He pushes Uncle Pat on the shoulder and knocks him back against the wall. I drop the papers and run at him but he steps aside and punches me on the back of the neck and my forehead is rammed into the wall and it puts me in such a rage I can't see him anymore. I go at him with arms and legs and if I could tear his face off with my teeth I would but he has long arms like a gorilla and he just keeps pushing me away so that I can't touch him. He says, You mad feckin' eejit. I'll destroy you in the Confraternity, and he runs away.\nUncle Pat says, You shouldn't be fightin' like that an' you dropped all me papers an' some o' them is wet an' how am I supposed to sell wet papers, and I wanted to jump on him too and hit him for talking about papers after I stood up to Declan Collopy.\nAt the end of the night he gives me three chips from his bag and sixpence instead of threepence. He complains it's too much money and it's all my mother's fault for going on to Grandma about the low pay.\nMam is delighted I'm getting sixpence on Fridays from Uncle Pat and sixpence on Saturdays from Mr. Timoney. A shilling a week makes a big difference and she gives me tuppence to see the Dead End Kids at the Lyric after I'm finished the reading.\nNext morning Mr. Timoney says, Wait till we get to Gulliver, Francis. You'll know Jonathan Swift is the greatest Irish writer that ever lived, no, the greatest man to put pen to parchment. A giant of a man, Francis. He laughs all through A Modest Proposal and you'd wonder what he's laughing at when it's all about cooking Irish babies. He says, You'll laugh when you grow up, Francis.\nYou're not supposed to talk back to grown-ups but Mr. Timoney is different and he doesn't mind when I say, Mr. Timoney, big people are\nalways telling us that. Oh, you'll laugh when you grow up. You'll understand when you grow up. Everything will come when you grow up.\nHe lets out such a roar of a laugh I think he's going to collapse. Oh, Mother o' God, Francis. You're a treasure. What's up with you? Do you have a bee up your arse? Tell me what's up.\nNothing, Mr. Timoney.\nI think you have the long puss, Francis, and I wish I could Go over to the mirror on the wall, Snow White, and tell me if you the long puss. Never mind. Just tell me what's up.\nDeclan Collopy was at me last night and I got into a fight.\nHe makes me tell him about the Confraternity and Declan and\nuncle Pat Sheehan, who was dropped on his head, and then he tells\nknows my uncle Pa Keating, who was gassed in the war and works in\nworks. He says, Pa Keating is a jewel of a man. And I'll tell you\nI'll do, Francis. I'll talk to Pa Keating and we'll go to the crawthumpers at the Confraternity. I'm a Buddhist myself and I don't hold with fighting but I haven't lost it. They're not going to interfere with my little reader, oh, by Jesus, no.\nMr. Timoney is an old man but he talks like a friend and I can say what I feel. Dad would never talk to me like Mr. Timoney. He'd say, Och, aye, and go for a long walk.\nUncle Pat Sheehan tells Grandma he doesn't want me to help with the papers anymore, he can get another boy much cheaper and he thinks I should be giving him some of my Saturday morning sixpence anyway since I'd never have the reading job without him.\nA woman next door to Mr. Timoney tells me I'm wasting my time knocking on the door, Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun on the same day and Mr. Timoney couldn't stop laughing though he cried when the dog was taken away to be put down. You can bite postmen and milkmen all you like but the case of the passing nun goes all the way to the bishop and he takes steps especially if the owner of the dog is a known Buddhist and a danger to good Catholics around him. Mr. Timoney was told this and cried and laughed so hard the doctor came and said he was gone beyond recall so they carted him off to the City Home, where they keep old people who are helpless or demented.\nThat's the end of my Saturday sixpence but I'll read to Mr. Timoney money or no money. I wait down the street till the woman next door goes in, I climb in Mr. Timoney's window for Gulliver'sTravels and walk miles to the City Home so that he won't miss his reading. The man at the gate says, What? You want to come in an' read to an oul' man? Is it coddin' me you are? Get outa here before I call the guards.\nCould I leave the book for someone else to read to Mr. Timoney? Leave it. Leave it for Jaysus sake an' don't be botherin' me. I'll send it up to him.\nAnd he laughs.\nMam says, What's up with you? Why are you moping? And I tell her how Uncle Pat doesn't want me anymore and how they put Mr. Timoney in the City Home for laughing just because Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun. She laughs too and I'm sure the world is gone mad. Then she says, Ah, I'm sorry and it's a pity you lost two jobs. You might as well start going to the Confraternity again to keep The Posse away and, worse, the director, Father Gorey.\nDeclan tells me sit in front of him and if there's any blaguarding he'll break my feckin' neck for he'll be watching me as long as he's\nsee it. have\nmy\nme he\nthe gas\nwhat\nprefect and no little shit like me is going to keep him from a life in linoleum.\nMam says she has trouble climbing the stairs and she's moving her bed to the kitchen. She laughs, I'll come back up to Sorrento when the walls are damp and the rain runs under the door. School is over and she can stay in bed in the kitchen as long as she likes because she doesn't have to get up for us. Dad lights the fire, makes the tea, cuts the bread, makes sure we wash our faces and tells us go out and play. He lets us stay in bed if we like but you never want to stay in bed when there's no school. We're ready to run out and play in the lane the minute we wake.\nThen one day in July he says we can't go downstairs. We have to stay up here and play.\nWhy, Dad?\nNever mind. Play here with Malachy and Michael and you can go down later when I tell you.\nHe stands at the door in case we might get a notion to wander down the stairs. We push our blanket up in the air with our feet and pretend we're in a tent, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. We hunt fleas and squash them between our thumbnails.\nThen there's a baby's cry and Malachy says, Dad, did Mam get a new\nbaby?\nOch, aye, son.\nI'm older so I tell Malachy the bed is in the kitchen so that the angel can fly down and leave the baby on the seventh step but Malachy doesn't understand because he's only eight going on nine and I'll be ten next month.\nMam is in the bed with the new baby. He has a big fat face and he's red all over. There's a woman in the kitchen in a nurse's uniform and we know she's there to wash new babies who are always dirty from the long journey with the angel. We want to tickle the baby but she says, No, no, ye can look at him but don't lay a finger.\nDon't lay a finger. That's the way nurses talk.\nWe sit at the table with our tea and bread looking at our new brother but he won't even open his eyes to look back at us so we go out and play.\nIn a few days Mam is out of the bed holding the baby on her lap by the fire. His eyes are open and when we tickle him he makes a gurgling sound, his belly shakes and that makes us laugh. Dad tickles him and sings a Scottish song, Oh, oh, stop your ticklin', Jock, Stop your ticklin', Jock.\nStop your ticklin',\nIckle ickle icklin\nStop your ticklin', Jock.\nDad has a job so Bridey Hannon is able to visit Mam and the baby any time she likes and for once Mam doesn't tell us go out and play so they can talk about secret things. They sit by the fire smoking and talking about names. Mam says she likes the names Kevin and Sean but Bridey says, Ah, no, there's too many of them in Limerick. Jesus, Angela, if you stuck your head out the door and called, Kevin or Sean, come in for your tea, you'd have half o' Limerick running to your door.\nBridey says if she had a son which please God she will some day she'll call him Ronald because she's mad about Ronald Colman that you see in the Coliseum Cinema. Or Errol, now that's another lovely name, Errol Flynn.\nMam says, Will you go way outa that, Bridey. I'd never be able to stick my head out the door and say, Errol, Errol, come in for your tea. Sure the poor child would be a laughingstock.\nRonald, says Bridey, Ronald. He's gorgeous.\nNo, says Mam, it has to be Irish. Isn't that what we fought for all these years? What's the use of fighting the English for centuries if we're going to call our children Ronald?\nJesus, Angela, you're starting to talk like himself with his Irish this and his English that.\nStill an' all, Bridey, he's right.\nSuddenly Bridey is gasping, Jesus, Angela, there's something wrong with that child. Mam is out of the chair, hugging the child, moaning. Oh, Jesus, Bridey, he's choking.\nBridey says, I'll run for my mother, and she's back in a minute with Mrs. Hannon. Castor oil, says Mrs. Hannon. Do you have it? Any oil. Cod liver oil? That'll do.\nShe pours the oil into the baby's mouth, turns him over, presses on his back, turns him back over, sticks a spoon down his throat and brings up a white ball. That's it now, she says. The milk. It collects and gets hard in their little throats so you have to ease it with any class of an oil.\nMam is crying, Jesus, I nearly lost him. Oh, I'd die so I would.\nShe's clutching the baby and crying and trying to thank Mrs. Hannon.\nYerra, don't mention it, missus. Take the child and get back into that bed for the two o' ye had a great shock.\nWhile Bridey and Mrs. Hannon are helping Mam to the bed I notice spots of blood on her chair. Is my mother bleeding to death? Is it all right to say, Look, there's blood on Mam's chair? No, you can't say anything because they always have secrets. I know if you say anything the grown-up people will tell you, Never mind, you're always gawking, none of your business, go out and play.\nI have to keep it inside or I can talk to the angel. Mrs. Hannon and Bridey leave and I sit on the seventh step. I try to tell the angel Mam is bleeding to death. I want him to tell me, Fear not, but the step is cold and there's no light, no voice. I'm sure he's gone forever and I wonder if that happens when you go from nine to ten.\nMam doesn't bleed to death. She's out of the bed next day getting the baby ready for baptism, telling Bridey she could never forgive herself if the baby died and went to Limbo, a place for unbaptized babies, where it may be nice and warm but, still, dark forever and no hope of escape even on the Judgment Day.\nGrandma is there to help and she says, That's right, no hope in heaven for the infant that's not baptized.\nBridey says it would be a hard God that would do the likes of that.\nHe has to be hard, says Grandma, otherwise you'd have all kinds of babies clamorin' to get into heaven, Protestants an' everything, an' why should they get in after what they did to us for eight hundred years?\nThe babies didn't do it, says Bridey. They're too small.\nThey would if they got the chance, says Grandma. They're trained for it.\nThey dress the baby in the Limerick lace dress we were all baptized in. Mam says we can all go to St. Joseph's and we're excited because there will be lemonade and buns after.\nMalachy says, Mam, what's the baby's name?\nAlphonsus Joseph.\nThe words fly out of my mouth, That's a stupid name. It's not even\nIrish.\nGrandma glares at me with her old red eyes. She says, That fella\nneeds a good clitther on the gob. Mam slaps me across the face and sends me flying across the kitchen. My heart is pounding and I want to cry but I can't because my father isn't there and I'm the man of the family. Mam says, You go upstairs with your big mouth and don't move from that room.\nI stop at the seventh step but it's still cold, no light, no voice.\nThe house is quiet with everyone gone to the chapel. I sit and wait upstairs, knocking the fleas off my arms and legs, wishing I had Dad here, thinking of my little brother and his foreign name, Alphonsus, an affliction of a name.\nIn awhile there are voices downstairs and there is talk of tea, sherry, lemonade, buns, and isn't that child the loveliest little fella in the world, little Alphie, foreign name but still an' all still an' all not a sound outa him the whole time he's that good-natured God bless him sure he'll live forever with the sweetness that's in him the little dote spittin' image of his mother his father his grandma his little brothers dead an' gone.\nMam calls from the bottom of the stairs, Frank, come down and have lemonade and a bun.\nI don't want it. You can keep it.\nI said come down this minute for if I have to climb these stairs I'll warm your behind and you'll rue the day.\nRue? What's rue?\nNever mind what's rue. Come down here at once.\nHer voice is sharp and rue sounds dangerous. I'll go down.\nIn the kitchen Grandma says, Look at the long puss on him. You'd\nthink he'd be happy for his little brother except that a boy that's going from nine to ten is always a right pain in the arse an' I know for didn't I have two of 'em.\nThe lemonade and bun are delicious and Alphie the new baby is chirping away enjoying his baptism day too innocent to know his name is an affliction.\nGrandpa in the North sends a telegram money order for five pounds for the baby Alphie. Mam wants to cash it but she can't go far from the bed. Dad says he'll cash it at the post office. She tells Malachy and me to go with him. He cashes it and tells us, All right, boys, go home and tell your mother I'll be home in a few minutes.\nMalachy says, Dad, you're not to go to the pub. Mam said you're to bring home the money. You're not to drink the pint.\nNow, now, son. Go home to your mother. Dad, give us the money. That money is for the baby.\nNow, Francis, don't be a bad boy. Do what your father tells you.\nHe walks away from us and into South's pub. Mam is sitting by the fireplace with Alphie in her arms. She shakes her head. He went to the pub, didn't he? He did. I want ye to go back down to that pub and read\nhim out of it. I want ye to stand in the middle of the pub and tell every man your father is drinking the money for the baby. Ye are to tell the world there isn't a scrap of food in this house, not a lump of coal to start the fire, not a drop of milk for the baby's bottle.\nWe walk through the streets and Malachy practices his speech at the top of his voice, Dad, Dad, that five pounds is for the new baby. That's not for the drink. The child is above in the bed bawling and roaring for his milk and you're drinking the pint.\nHe's gone from South's pub. Malachy still wants to stand and make his speech but I tell him we have to hurry and look in other pubs before Dad drinks the whole five pounds. We can't find him in other pubs either. He knows Mam would come for him or send us and there are so many pubs at this end of Limerick and beyond we could be looking for a month. We have to tell Mam there's no sign of him and she tells us we're pure useless. Oh, Jesus, I wish I had my strength and I'd search every pub in Limerick. I'd tear the mouth out of his head, so I would. Go on, go back down and try all the pubs around the railway station and try Naughton's fish and chip shop.\nI have to go by myself because Malachy has the runs and can't stray far from the bucket. I search all the pubs on Parnell Street and around. I look into the snugs where the women drink and in all the men's lavatories. I'm hungry but I'm afraid to go home till I find my father. He's not in Naughton's fish and chip shop but there's a drunken man asleep at a table in the corner and his fish and chips are on the floor in their Limerick Leader wrapping and if I don't get them the cat will so I shove them under my jersey and I'm out the door and up the street to sit on the steps at the railway station eat my fish and chips watch the drunken soldiers pass by with the girls that giggle thank the drunken man in my mind for drowning the fish and chips in vinegar and smothering them in salt and then remember that if I die tonight I'm in a state of sin for stealing and I could go straight to hell stuffed with fish and chips but it's Saturday and if the priests are still in the confession boxes I can clear my soul after my feed.\nThe Dominican church is just up Glentworth Street.\nBless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession. I tell him the usual sins and then, I stole fish and chips from a drunken man.\nWhy, my child?\nI was hungry, Father.\nAnd why were you hungry?\nThere was nothing in my belly, Father.\nHe says nothing and even though it's dark I know he's shaking his\nhead. My dear child, why can't you go home and ask your mother for something? Because she sent me out looking for my father in the pubs, Father, and I couldn't find him and she hasn't a scrap in the house because he's drinking the five pounds Grandpa sent from the North for the new baby and she's raging by the fire because I can't find my father.\nI wonder if this priest is asleep because he's very quiet till he says, My child, I sit here. I hear the sins of the poor. I assign the penance. I bestow absolution. I should be on my knees washing their feet. Do you understand me, my child?\nI tell him I do but I don't.\nGo home, child. Pray for me.\nNo penance, Father?\nNo, my child.\nI stole the fish and chips. I'm doomed.\nYou're forgiven. Go. Pray for me. He blesses me in Latin, talks to\nhimself in English and I wonder what I did to him. I wish I could find my father so I could say to Mam, Here he is and he has three pounds left in his pocket. I'm not hungry now so I can go up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and search pubs on the side streets and there he is in Gleeson's, how could I miss him with his singing, 'Tis alone my concern if the grandest surprise Would be shining at me out of somebody's eyes.\n'Tis my private affair what my feelings would be While the Green Glens of Antrim were welcoming me.\nMy heart is banging away in my chest and I don't know what to do because I know I'm raging inside like my mother by the fire and all I can think of doing is running in and giving him a good kick in the leg and running out again but I don't because we have the mornings by the fire when he tells me about Cuchulain and De Valera and Roosevelt and if he's there drunk and buying pints with the baby's money he has that look in his eyes Eugene had when he searched for Oliver and I might as well go home and tell my mother a lie that I never saw him couldn't find him.\nShe's in the bed with the baby. Malachy and Michael are up in Italy asleep. I know I don't have to tell Mam anything, that soon when the pubs close he'll be home singing and offering us a penny to die for Ireland and it will be different now because it's bad enough to drink the dole or the wages but a man that drinks the money for a new baby is gone beyond the beyonds as my mother would say.\nVIII\nI'm ten years old and ready to go to St. Joseph's Church for my Confirmation. In school the master, Mr. O'Dea, prepares us. We have to know all about Sanctifying Grace, a pearl of great price, bought for us by Jesus in His dying. Mr. O'Dea's eyes roll in his head when he tells us that with Confirmation we will become part of Divinity. We will have the Gifts of the Holy Ghost: Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, the Fear of the Lord. Priests and masters tell us Confirmation means you're a true soldier of the Church and that entitles you to die and be a martyr in case we're invaded by Protestants or Mahommedans or any other class of a heathen. More dying. I want to tell them I won't be able to die for the Faith because I'm already booked to die for Ireland.\nMikey Molloy says, Is it jokin' you are? That thing about dying for the Faith is all a cod. 'Tis only a saying they made up to frighten you. Ireland too. No one dies for anything anymore. All the dying is done. I wouldn't die for Ireland or the Faith. I might die for my mother but that's all.\nMikey knows everything. He's going on fourteen. He gets the fits. He has visions.\nThe grown-ups tell us it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith, only we're not ready for that yet because Confirmation day is like First Communion day, you make the rounds of lanes and back streets and you get cakes and sweets and money, The Collection.\nThat's where poor Peter Dooley comes in. We call him Quasimodo because he has a hump on his back like the one on the hunchback of Notre Dame, whose real name we know is Charles Laughton.\nQuasimodo has nine sisters and it is said his mother never wanted him but that was what the angel brought her and it's a sin to question what's sent. Quasimodo is old, he's fifteen. His red hair sticks up in all directions. He has green eyes and one rolls around in his head so much he's constantly tapping his temple to keep it where it's supposed to be. His right leg is short and twisted and when he walks he does a little twirly dance and you never know when he'll fall. That's when you're surprised. He curses his leg, he curses the world, but he curses in a lovely English accent which he got from the radio, the BBC. Before he leaves his house he always sticks his head out the door and tells the lane, Here's me head, me arse is coming. When he was twelve Quasimodo decided that with the way he looked and the way the world looked at him the best thing would be to prepare for a job where he could be heard and not seen and what better than sitting behind a microphone at the BBC in London reading the news?\nBut you can't get to London without money and that's why he hobbles up to us that Friday, the day before Confirmation. He has an idea for Billy and me. He knows the next day we'll be getting Confirmation money and if we promise to pay him a shilling each he'll let us climb up the rainspout behind his house this very night to look in the window and see his sisters' naked bodies when they take their weekly wash. I sign right away. Billy says, I have my own sister. Why should I pay to see your naked sisters?\nQuasimodo says that looking at your own sister's naked body is the worst sin of all and he's not sure if there's a priest in the world can forgive you, that you might have to go to the bishop, who everyone knows is a holy terror.\nBilly signs.\nFriday night we climb the wall of Quasimodo's backyard. It's a lovely night with the June moon floating high over Limerick and you can feel a warm breeze off the Shannon River. Quasimodo is about to let Billy up the spout and who comes clambering over the wall but Mikey Molloy the Fit himself hissing at Quasimodo, Here's a shilling, Quasimodo. Let me up the spout. Mikey is fourteen now, bigger than any of us and strong from his job delivering coal. He's black from the coal like Uncle Pa Keating and all you can see are the whites of his eyes and the white froth on his lower lip, which means he could have the fit anytime.\nQuasimodo says, Wait, Mikey. They're first. Wait, my arse, says Mikey, and he's away up the spout. Billy complains but Quasimodo shakes his head, I can't help it. He comes every week with the shilling. I have to let him up the spout or he'll beat me up and tell my mother and the next thing she locks me in the coal hole all day with the rats. The Fit is up hanging on to the spout with one hand. The other hand is in his pocket moving, moving and when the spout itself starts to move and creak Quasimodo hisses, Molloy, there's to be no whankin' up the spout. He hops around the yard cackling. His BBC accent is gone and he's pure Limerick. Jaysus, Molloy, come down off that spout or I'll tell me mother. Mikey's hand goes faster in his pocket, so fast the spout gives a lurch and collapses and Mikey is rolling on the ground yelping, I'm dead. I'm destroyed. Oh, God. You can see the froth on his lips and the blood that comes from biting his tongue.\nQuasimodo's mother comes screaming through the door, What in the name of Jesus! and the kitchen light fills the yard. The sisters are squawking from the window above. Billy tries to escape and she drags him off the wall. She tells him run to O'Connor the chemist around the corner to ring up an ambulance or a doctor or something for Mikey. She screams at us to get into the kitchen. She kicks Quasimodo into the hall. He's on his hands and knees and she drags him to the coal hole under the stairs and locks him in. Stay there till you come to your senses.\nHe's crying and calling to her in a pure Limerick accent. Ah, Mamma, Mamma, let me out. The rats is here. I only want to go to the BBC, Mamma. Aw, Jasus, Mamma, Jasus. I'll never let anyone up the spout again. I'll send money from London, Mamma. Mamma!\nMikey is still on his back, jerking and twisting around the yard. The ambulance takes him off to the hospital with a broken shoulder and his tongue in ribbons.\nOur mothers are there in no time. Mrs. Dooley says, I'm disgraced, so I am, disgraced. My daughters can't wash theirselves of a Friday night without the whole world gawking in the window and them boys there are in a state of sin and should be taken to the priest for confession before their Confirmation tomorrow.\nBut Mam says, I don't know about the rest of the world but I saved a whole year for Frank's Confirmation suit and I'm not going to the priest to have him tell me my son is not fit for Confirmation so that I'll have to wait another year when he grows out of this suit and all because he climbed a spout for an innocent gawk at the scrawny arse of Mona Dooley.\nShe drags me home by the ear and makes me kneel before the Pope. Swear, she says, swear to that Pope that you didn't look at Mona Dooley in her pelt.\nI swear.\nIf you're lying you won't be in a state of grace for Confirmation tomorrow and that's the worst kind of sacrilege.\nI swear.\nOnly the bishop himself could forgive a sacrilege like that.\nI swear.\nAll right. Go to bed and from this day out stay far away from that\nmisfortunate Quasimodo Dooley.\nWe are all confirmed the next day. The bishop asks me a catechism\nquestion, What is the Fourth Commandment? and I tell him, Honor thy father and thy mother. He pats my cheek and that makes me a soldier of the True Church. I kneel in the pew and think of Quasimodo locked in the coal hole under the stairs and I wonder, Should I give him the shilling anyway for his career at the BBC?\nBut I forget all about Quasimodo because my nose starts bleeding and I feel dizzy. Confirmation boys and girls are outside St. Joseph's with their parents and there is hugging and kissing in the bright sun and I don't care. My father is working and I don't care. My mother kisses me and I don't care. The boys talk about The Collection and I don't care. My nose won't stop and Mam is worried I'll ruin my suit. She runs into the church to see if Stephen Carey, the sacristan, would spare her a rag and he gives her some kind of canvas cloth that makes my nose sore. She says, Do you want to make your collection? and I tell her I don't care. Malachy says, Do, do, Frankie, and he's sad because I promised I'd take him to the Lyric Cinema to see the film and stuff ourselves with sweets. I want\nto lie down. I could lie down there on the steps of St. Joseph's and sleep forever. Mam says, Grandma is making a nice breakfast, and the mention of food makes me so sick I run to the edge of the pavement to throw up and the whole world is looking at me and I don't care. Mam says she'd better take me home and put me to bed and my pals look surprised that anyone can go to bed when there's a collection to be made.\nShe helps me take off my Confirmation suit and puts me to bed. She wets a rag and places it under my neck and after awhile the bleeding stops. She brings tea but the look of it makes me sick and I have to throw up in the bucket. Mrs. Hannon comes in from next door and I can hear her say that's a very sick child and he should have a doctor. Mam says it's Saturday, the Dispensary is closed and where would you get a doctor?\nDad comes home from his job at Rank's Flour Mills and tells Mam I'm going through a stage, growing pains. Grandma comes up and says the same thing. She says when boys go from the one number year, which is nine, to the two number year, which is ten, they're changing and prone to the nosebleed. She says I might have too much blood in me anyway and a good cleaning out wouldn't do me one bit of harm.\nThe day passes and I'm in and out of sleep. Malachy and Michael come into the bed at night and I can hear Malachy say, Frankie is very hot. Michael says, He's bleeding on my leg. Mam puts the wet rag on my nose and a key on my neck but it won't stop the bleeding. On Sunday morning there's blood on my chest and all around me. Mam tells Dad I'm bleeding through my bottom and he says I might have a case of the runs, which is common with the growing pains.\nDr. Troy is our doctor but he's away on holiday and the man that comes to see me on Monday has a smell of whiskey on him. He examines me and tells my mother I have a bad cold and keep me in bed. Days pass and I sleep and bleed. Mam makes tea and beef tea and I don't want it. She even brings ice cream and the look of it makes me sick. Mrs. Hannon comes in again and says that doctor doesn't know what he's talking about, see if Dr. Troy is back.\nMam comes with Dr. Troy. He feels my forehead, rolls up my eyelids, turns me over to see my back, picks me up and runs to his motor car. Mam runs after him and he tells her I have typhoid fever. Mam cries, Oh, God, oh, God, am I to lose the whole family? Will it ever end? She gets into the car, holds me in her lap and moans all the way to the Fever Hospital at the City Home.\nThe bed has cool white sheets. The nurses have clean white uniforms and the nun, Sister Rita, is all in white. Dr. Humphrey and Dr. Campbell have white coats and things hanging from their necks which they stick against my chest and all over. I sleep and sleep but I'm awake when they bring in jars of bright red stuff that hang from tall poles above my bed and they stick tubes into my ankles and the back of my right hand. Sister Rita says, You're getting blood, Francis. Soldier's blood from the Sarsfield Barracks.\nMam is sitting by the bed and the nurse is saying, You know, missus, this is very unusual. No one is ever allowed into the Fever Hospital for fear they'd catch something but they made an exception for you with his crisis coming. If he gets over this he'll surely recover.\nI fall asleep. Mam is gone when I wake but there's movement in the room and it's the priest, Father Gorey, from the Confraternity saying Mass at a table in the corner. I drift off again and now they're waking\nme and pulling down the bedclothes. Father Gorey is touching me with oil and praying in Latin. I know it's Extreme Unction and that means I'm going to die and I don't care. They wake me again to receive Communion. I don't want it, I'm afraid I might get sick. I keep the wafer on my tongue and fall asleep and when I wake up again it's gone.\nIt's dark and Dr. Campbell is sitting by my bed. He's holding my wrist and looking at his watch. He has red hair and glasses and he always smiles when he talks to me. He sits now and hums and looks out the window. His eyes close and he snores a little. He tilts over on the chair and farts and smiles to himself and I know now I'm going to get better because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy.\nSister Rita's white habit is bright in the sun that comes in the window. She's holding my wrist, looking at her watch, smiling. Oh, she says, we're awake, are we? Well, Francis, I think we've come through the worst. Our prayers are answered and all the prayers of those hundreds of little boys at the Confraternity. Can you imagine that? Hundreds of boys saying the rosary for you and offering up their communion.\nMy ankles and the back of my hand are throbbing from the tubes bringing in the blood and I don't care about boys praying for me. I can hear the swish of Sister Rita's habit and the click of her rosary beads when she leaves the room. I fall asleep and when I wake it's dark and Dad is sitting by the bed with his hand on mine.\nSon, are you awake?\nI try to talk but I'm dry, nothing will come out and I point to my mouth. He holds a glass of water to my lips and it's sweet and cool. He presses my hand and says I'm a great old soldier and why wouldn't I? Don't I have the soldier's blood in me?\nThe tubes are not in me anymore and the glass jars are gone.\nSister Rita comes in and tells Dad he has to go. I don't want him to go because he looks sad. He's like Paddy Clohessy the day I gave him the raisin. When he looks sad it's the worst thing in the world and I start crying. Now what's this? says Sister Rita. Crying with all that soldier blood in you? There's a big surprise for you tomorrow, Francis. You'll never guess. Well, I'll tell you, we're bringing you a nice biscuit with your tea in the morning. Isn't that a treat? And your father will be back in a day or two, won't you, Mr. McCourt?\nDad nods and puts his hand on mine again. He looks at me, steps away, stops, comes back, kisses me on the forehead for the first time in my life and I'm so happy I feel like floating out of the bed.\nThe other two beds in my room are empty. The nurse says I'm the only typhoid patient and I'm a miracle for getting over the crisis.\nThe room next to me is empty till one morning a girl's voice says, Yoo hoo, who's there?\nI'm not sure if she's talking to me or someone in the room beyond. Yoo hoo, boy with the typhoid, are you awake?\nI am.\nAre you better?\nI am.\nWell, why are you here?\nI don't know. I'm still in the bed. They stick needles in me and\ngive me medicine.\nWhat do you look like?\nI wonder, What kind of a question is that? I don't know what to tell her.\nYoo hoo, are you there, typhoid boy?\nI am.\nWhat's your name?\nFrank.\nThat's a good name. My name is Patricia Madigan. How old are you? Ten. Oh. She sounds disappointed.\nBut I'll be eleven in August, next month.\nWell, that's better than ten. I'll be fourteen in September. Do you\nwant to know why I'm in the Fever Hospital? I do.\nI have diphtheria and something else.\nWhat's something else?\nThey don't know. They think I have a disease from foreign parts\nbecause my father used to be in Africa. I nearly died. Are you going to tell me what you look like?\nI have black hair.\nYou and millions.\nI have brown eyes with bits of green that's called hazel.\nYou and thousands.\nI have stitches on the back of my right hand and my two feet where\nthey put in the soldier's blood.\nOh, God, did they?\nThey did.\nYou won't be able to stop marching and saluting.\nThere's a swish of habit and click of beads and then Sister Rita's\nvoice. Now, now, what's this? There's to be no talking between two rooms especially when it's a boy and a girl. Do you hear me, Patricia?\nI do, Sister.\nDo you hear me, Francis?\nI do, Sister.\nYou could be giving thanks for your two remarkable recoveries. You\ncould be saying the rosary. You could be reading The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart that's beside your beds. Don't let me come back and find you talking.\nShe comes into my room and wags her finger at me. Especially you, Francis, after thousands of boys prayed for you at the Confraternity. Give thanks, Francis, give thanks.\nShe leaves and there's silence for awhile. Then Patricia whispers, Give thanks, Francis, give thanks, and say your rosary, Francis, and I laugh so hard a nurse runs in to see if I'm all right. She's a very stern nurse from the County Kerry and she frightens me. What's this, Francis? Laughing? What is there to laugh about? Are you and that Madigan girl talking? I'll report you to Sister Rita. There's to be no laughing for you could be doing serious damage to your internal apparatus.\nShe plods out and Patricia whispers again in a heavy Kerry accent, No laughing, Francis, you could be doin' serious damage to your internal apparatus. Say your rosary, Francis, and pray for your internal apparatus.\nMam visits me on Thursdays. I'd like to see my father, too, but I'm out of danger, crisis time is over, and I'm allowed only one visitor. Besides, she says, he's back at work at Rank's Flour Mills and please God this job will last a while with the war on and the English desperate for flour. She brings me a chocolate bar and that proves Dad is working. She could never afford it on the dole. He sends me notes. He tells me my\nbrothers are all praying for me, that I should be a good boy, obey the doctors, the nuns, the nurses, and don't forget to say my prayers. He's sure St. Jude pulled me through the crisis because he's the patron saint of desperate cases and I was indeed a desperate case.\nPatricia says she has two books by her bed. One is a poetry book and that's the one she loves. The other is a short history of England and do I want it? She gives it to Seamus, the man who mops the floors every day, and he brings it to me. He says, I'm not supposed to be bringing anything from a dipteria room to a typhoid room with all the germs flying around and hiding between the pages and if you ever catch dipteria on top of the typhoid they'll know and I'll lose my good job and be out on the street singing patriotic songs with a tin cup in my hand, which I could easily do because there isn't a song ever written about Ireland's sufferings I don't know and a few songs about the joy of whiskey too.\nOh, yes, he knows Roddy McCorley. He'll sing it for me right enough but he's barely into the first verse when the Kerry nurse rushes in. What's this, Seamus? Singing? Of all the people in this hospital you should know the rules against singing. I have a good mind to report you to Sister Rita.\nAh, God, don't do that, nurse.\nVery well, Seamus. I'll let it go this one time. You know the singing could lead to a relapse in these patients.\nWhen she leaves he whispers he'll teach me a few songs because singing is good for passing the time when you're by yourself in a typhoid room. He says Patricia is a lovely girl the way she often gives him sweets from the parcel her mother sends every fortnight. He stops mopping the floor and calls to Patricia in the next room, I was telling Frankie you're a lovely girl, Patricia, and she says, You're a lovely man, Seamus. He smiles because he's an old man of forty and he never had children but the ones he can talk to here in the Fever Hospital. He says, Here's the book, Frankie. Isn't it a great pity you have to be reading all about England after all they did to us, that there isn't a history of Ireland to be had in this hospital.\nThe book tells me all about King Alfred and William the Conqueror and all the kings and queens down to Edward, who had to wait forever for his mother, Victoria, to die before he could be king. The book has the first bit of Shakespeare I ever read.\nI do believe, induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy.\nThe history writer says this is what Catherine, who is a wife of Henry the Eighth, says to Cardinal Wolsey, who is trying to have her head cut off. I don't know what it means and I don't care because it's Shakespeare and it's like having jewels in my mouth when I say the words. If I had a whole book of Shakespeare they could keep me in the hospital for a year.\nPatricia says she doesn't know what induced means or potent circumstances and she doesn't care about Shakespeare, she has her poetry book and she reads to me from beyond the wall a poem about an owl and a pussycat that went to sea in a green boat with honey and money and it makes no sense and when I say that Patricia gets huffy and says that's the last poem she'll ever read to me. She says I'm always reciting the lines from Shakespeare and they make no sense either. Seamus stops mopping again and tells us we shouldn't be fighting over poetry because we'll have enough to fight about when we grow up and get married.\nPatricia says she's sorry and I'm sorry too so she reads me part of another poem which I have to remember so I can say it back to her early in the morning or late at night when there are no nuns or nurses about, The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees, The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, And the highwayman came riding Riding riding The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn door.\nHe'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,\nA coat of the claret velvet,\nand breeches of brown doe skin,\nThey fitted with never a wrinkle,\nhis boots were up to the thigh.\nAnd he rode with a jewelled twinkle,\nHis pistol butts a-twinkle,\nHis rapier hilt a-twinkle,\nunder the jewelled sky.\nEvery day I can't wait for the doctors and nurses to leave me alone so I can learn a new verse from Patricia and find out what's happening to the highwayman and the landlord's red lipped daughter. I love the poem because it's exciting and almost as good as my two lines of Shakespeare. The redcoats are after the highwayman because they know he told her, I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.\nI'd love to do that myself, come by moonlight for Patricia in the next room not giving a fiddler's fart though hell should bar the way. She's ready to read the last few verses when in comes the nurse from Kerry shouting at her, shouting at me, I told ye there was to be no talking between rooms. Dipthteria is never allowed to talk to typhoid and visa versa. I warned ye. And she calls out, Seamus, take this one. Take the by. Sister Rita said one more word out of him and upstairs with him. We gave ye a warning to stop the blathering but ye wouldn't. Take the by, Seamus, take him.\nAh, now, nurse, sure isn't he harmless. 'Tis only a bit o' poetry. Take that by, Seamus, take him at once.\nHe bends over me and whispers, Ah, God, I'm sorry, Frankie. Here's\nyour English history book. He slips the book under my shirt and lifts me from the bed. He whispers that I'm a feather. I try to see Patricia when we pass through her room but all I can make out is a blur of dark head on a pillow.\nSister Rita stops us in the hall to tell me I'm a great disappointment to her, that she expected me to be a good boy after what God had done for me, after all the prayers said by hundreds of boys at the Confraternity, after all the care from the nuns and nurses of the Fever Hospital, after the way they let my mother and father in to see me, a thing rarely allowed, and this is how I repaid them lying in the bed reciting silly poetry back and forth with Patricia Madigan knowing very well there was a ban on all talk between typhoid and diphtheria. She says I'll have plenty of time to reflect on my sins in the big ward upstairs and I should beg God's forgiveness for my disobedience reciting a pagan English poem about a thief on a horse and a maiden with red lips who commits a terrible sin when I could have been praying or reading the life\nof a saint. She made it her business to read that poem so she did and I'd be well advised to tell the priest in confession.\nThe Kerry nurse follows us upstairs gasping and holding on to the banister. She tells me I better not get the notion she'll be running up to this part of the world every time I have a little pain or a twinge.\nThere are twenty beds in the ward, all white, all empty. The nurse tells Seamus put me at the far end of the ward against the wall to make sure I don't talk to anyone who might be passing the door, which is very unlikely since there isn't another soul on this whole floor. She tells Seamus this was the fever ward during the Great Famine long ago and only God knows how many died here brought in too late for anything but a wash before they were buried and there are stories of cries and moans in the far reaches of the night. She says 'twould break your heart to think of what the English did to us, that if they didn't put the blight on the potato they didn't do much to take it off. No pity. No feeling at all for the people that died in this very ward, children suffering and dying here while the English feasted on roast beef and guzzled the best of wine in their big houses, little children with their mouths all green from trying to eat the grass in the fields beyond, God bless us and save us and guard us from future famines.\nSeamus says 'twas a terrible thing indeed and he wouldn't want to be walking these halls in the dark with all the little green mouths gaping at him. The nurse takes my temperature, 'Tis up a bit, have a good sleep for yourself now that you're away from the chatter with Patricia Madigan below who will never know a gray hair.\nShe shakes her head at Seamus and he gives her a sad shake back.\nNurses and nuns never think you know what they're talking about. If you're ten going on eleven you're supposed to be simple like my uncle Pat Sheehan who was dropped on his head. You can't ask questions. You can't show you understand what the nurse said about Patricia Madigan, that she's going to die, and you can't show you want to cry over this girl who taught you a lovely poem which the nun says is bad.\nThe nurse tells Seamus she has to go and he's to sweep the lint from under my bed and mop up a bit around the ward. Seamus tells me she's a right oul' bitch for running to Sister Rita and complaining about the poem going between the two rooms, that you can't catch a disease from a poem unless it's love ha ha and that's not bloody likely when you're what? ten going on eleven? He never heard the likes of it, a little fella shifted upstairs for saying a poem and he has a good mind to go to the Limerick Leader and tell them print the whole thing except he has this job and he'd lose it if ever Sister Rita found out. Anyway, Frankie, you'll be outa here one of these fine days and you can read all the poetry you want though I don't know about Patricia below, I don't know about Patricia, God help us.\nHe knows about Patricia in two days because she got out of the bed to go to the lavatory when she was supposed to use a bedpan and collapsed and died in the lavatory. Seamus is mopping the floor and there are tears on his cheeks and he's saying, 'Tis a dirty rotten thing to die in a lavatory when you're lovely in yourself. She told me she was sorry she had you reciting that poem and getting you shifted from the room, Frankie. She said 'twas all her fault.\nIt wasn't, Seamus.\nI know and didn't I tell her that.\nPatricia is gone and I'll never know what happened to the highwayman and Bess, the landlord's daughter. I ask Seamus but he doesn't know any poetry at all especially English poetry. He knew an Irish poem once but it was about fairies and had no sign of a highwayman in it. Still he'll ask the men in his local pub where there's always someone reciting something and he'll bring it back to me. Won't I be busy meanwhile reading my short history of England and finding out all\ntheir perfidy. That's what Seamus says, perfidy, and I don't know\nmeans and he doesn't know what it means but if it's something the\ndo it must be terrible.\nHe comes three times a week to mop the floor and the nurse is there every morning to take my temperature and pulse. The doctor listens to my chest with the thing hanging from his neck. They all say, And how's our little soldier today? A girl with a blue dress brings meals three times a day and never talks to me. Seamus says she's not right in the head so don't say a word to her.\nThe July days are long and I fear the dark. There are only two ceiling lights in the ward and they're switched off when the tea tray is taken away and the nurse gives me pills. The nurse tells me go to sleep but I can't because I see people in the nineteen beds in the ward all dying and green around their mouths where they tried to eat grass and moaning for soup Protestant soup any soup and I cover my face with the pillow hoping they won't come and stand around the bed clawing at me and howling for bits of the chocolate bar my mother brought last week.\nNo, she didn't bring it. She had to send it in because I can't have any more visitors. Sister Rita tells me a visit to the Fever Hospital is a privilege and after my bad behavior with Patricia Madigan and that poem I can't have the privilege anymore. She says I'll be going home in a few weeks and my job is to concentrate on getting better and learn to walk again after being in bed for six weeks and I can get out of bed tomorrow after breakfast. I don't know why she says I have to learn how to walk when I've been walking since I was a baby but when the nurse stands me by the side of the bed I fall to the floor and the nurse laughs, See, you're a baby again.\nI practice walking from bed to bed back and forth back and forth. I don't want to be a baby. I don't want to be in this empty ward with no Patricia and no highwayman and no red lipped landlord's daughter. I don't want the ghosts of children with green mouths pointing bony fingers at me and clamoring for bits of my chocolate bar.\nSeamus says a man in his pub knew all the verses of the highwayman poem and it has a very sad end. Would I like him to say it because he never learned how to read and he had to carry the poem in his head? He stands in the middle of the ward leaning on his mop and recites, Tlot- tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot in the echoing night!\nNearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!\nHer eyes grew wide for a moment, she drew one last deep breath, Then her finger moved in the moonlight, Her musket shattered the moonlight, Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him-with her death.\nHe hears the shot and escapes but when he learns at dawn how Bess died he goes into a rage and returns for revenge only to be shot down by the redcoats.\nBlood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine red was his velvet coat, When they shot him down on the highway, Down like a dog on\nabout\nwhat it\nEnglish\nthe highway, And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.\nSeamus wipes his sleeve across his face and sniffles. He says, There was no call at all to shift you up here away from Patricia when you didn't even know what happened to the highwayman and Bess. 'Tis a very sad story and when I said it to my wife she wouldn't stop crying the whole night till we went to bed. She said there was no call for them redcoats to shoot that highwayman, they are responsible for half the troubles of the world and they never had any pity on the Irish, either. Now if you want to know any more poems, Frankie, tell me and I'll get them from the pub and bring 'em back in my head.\nThe girl with the blue dress who's not right in the head suddenly says one day, Would you like a book for to read? and she brings me The Amazing Quest of Mr. Ernest Bliss by E. Phillips Oppenheim, which is all about an Englishman who is fed up and doesn't know what to do with himself every day even though he's so rich he can't count his money. His manservant brings him the morning paper the tea the egg the toast and marmalade and he says, Take it away, life is empty. He can't read his paper, he can't eat his egg, and he pines away. His doctor tells him go and live among the poor in the East End of London and he'll learn to love life, which he does and falls in love with a girl who is poor but honest and very intelligent and they get married and move into his house in the West End which is the rich part because it's easier to help the poor and not be fed up when you're nice and comfortable.\nSeamus likes me to tell him what I'm reading. He says that story about Mr. Ernest Bliss is a made-up story because no one in his right mind would have to go to a doctor over having too much money and not eating his egg though you never know. It might be like that in England. You'd never find the likes of that in Ireland. If you didn't eat your egg here you'd be carted off to the lunatic asylum or reported to the bishop.\nI can't wait to go home and tell Malachy about this man who won't eat his egg. Malachy will fall down on the floor laughing because such a thing could never happen. He'll say I'm making it up but when I tell him this story is about an Englishman he'll understand.\nI can't tell the girl in the blue dress that this story was silly because she might have a fit. She says if you're finished with that book I'll bring you another one because there's a whole box of books left behind by patients from the old days. She brings me a book called Tom Brown's School-Days, which is hard to read, and no end of books by P. G. Wodehouse, who makes me laugh over Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and Jeeves and all the Mulliners. Bertie Wooster is rich but he eats his egg every morning for fear of what Jeeves might say. I wish I could talk to the girl in the blue dress or anyone about the books but I'm afraid the Kerry nurse or Sister Rita might find out and they'd move me to a bigger ward upstairs with fifty empty beds and Famine ghosts galore with green mouths and bony fingers pointing. At night I lie in bed thinking about Tom Brown and his adventures at Rugby School and all the characters in P. G. Wodehouse. I can dream about the red lipped landlord's daughter and the highwayman, and the nurses and nuns can do nothing about it. It's lovely to know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head.\nIt's August and I'm eleven. I've been in this hospital for two months and I wonder if they'll let me out for Christmas. The Kerry nurse tells me I should get down on my two knees and thank God I'm alive at all at all and not be complaining.\nI'm not complaining, nurse, I'm only wondering if I'll be home for Christmas.\nShe won't answer me. She tells me behave myself or she'll send Sister Rita up to me and then I'll behave myself.\nMam comes to the hospital on my birthday and sends up a package with two chocolate bars and a note with names of people in the lane telling me get better and come home and you're a great soldier, Frankie. The nurse lets me talk to her through the window and it's hard because the windows are high and I have to stand on Seamus's shoulders. I tell Mam I want to go home but she says I'm a bit too weak and surely I'll be out in no time. Seamus says, 'Tis a grand thing to be eleven because any day now you'll be a man shaving and all and ready to get out and get a job and drink your pint good as any man.\nAfter fourteen weeks Sister Rita tells me I can go home and aren't I a lucky boy that the day will be the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. She tells me I was a very good patient, except for that little problem with the poem and Patricia Madigan, God rest her, and I'm invited to come back and have a big Christmas dinner in the hospital. Mam comes for me and with my weak legs it takes us a long time to walk to the bus at Union Cross. She says, Take your time. After three and a half months we can spare an hour.\nPeople are at their doors on Barrack Road and Roden Lane telling me it's grand to see me back, that I'm a great soldier, a credit to my father and mother. Malachy and Michael run up to me in the lane and say, God, you're walking very slow. Can't you run anymore?\nIt's a bright day and I'm happy till I see Dad sitting in the kitchen with Alphie on his lap and there's an empty feeling in my heart because I know he's out of work again. All along I was sure he had a job, Mam told me he did, and I thought there would be no shortage of food and shoes. He smiles at me and tells Alphie, Och, there's your big brother home from the hospital.\nMam tells him what the doctor said, that I'm to have plenty of nourishing food and rest. The doctor said beef would be the right thing for building me up again. Dad nods. Mam makes beef tea from a cube and Malachy and Mike watch me drink it. They say they'd like some too but Mam says go away, ye didn't have the typhoid. She says the doctor wants me to go to bed early. She tried to get rid of the fleas but they're worse than ever with the warm weather we're having. Besides, she says, they won't get much out of you all bones and little skin.\nI lie in bed and think of the hospital where the white sheets were changed every day and there wasn't a sign of a flea. There was a lavatory where you could sit and read your book till someone asked if you were dead. There was a bath where you could sit in hot water as long as you liked and say, I do believe, Induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy, And saying that helps me fall asleep.\nWhen Malachy and Michael get up for school in the morning Mam tells me I can stay in bed. Malachy is in fifth class now with Mr. O'Dea and he likes to tell everyone he's learning the big red catechism for Confirmation and Mr. O'Dea is telling them all about state of grace and Euclid and how the English tormented the Irish for eight hundred long years.\nI don't want to stay in bed anymore. The October days are lovely and I want to sit outside looking up the lane at the way the sun slants along the wall opposite our house. Mikey Moloney brings me P. G.\nWodehouse books his father gets from the library and I have great days with Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and all the Mulliners. Dad lets me read his favorite book, John Mitchel's Jail Journal, which is all about a great Irish rebel the English condemned to exile in Van Diemen's land in Australia. The English tell John Mitchel he's free to come and go as he pleases all over Van Diemen's land if he gives his word of honor as a gentleman he won't try to escape. He gives his word till a ship comes to help him escape and he goes to the office of the English magistrate and says, I'm escaping, jumps on his horse and winds up in New York. Dad says he doesn't mind if I read silly English books by P. G. Wodehouse as long as I don't forget the men who did their bit and gave their lives for Ireland.\nI can't stay at home forever and Mam takes me back to Leamy's School in November. The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, says he's sorry, I've missed over two months of school and I have to be put back in fifth class. Mam says surely I'm ready for sixth class. After all, she says, he's missed only a few weeks. Mr. O'Halloran says he's sorry, take the boy next door to Mr. O'Dea.\nWe walk along the hallway and I tell Mam I don't want to be in fifth class. Malachy is in that class and I don't want to be in a class with my brother who is a year younger. I made my Confirmation last year. He didn't. I'm older. I'm not bigger anymore because of the typhoid but I'm older.\nMam says, It won't kill you.\nShe doesn't care and I'm put into that class with Malachy and I know all his friends are there sneering at me because I was put back. Mr. O'Dea makes me sit in the front and tells me get that sour look off my puss or I'll feel the end of his ash plant.\nThen a miracle happens and it's all because of St. Francis of Assisi, my favorite saint, and Our Lord Himself. I find a penny in the street that first day back at school and I want to run to Kathleen O'Connell's for a big square of Cleeves' toffee but I can't run because my legs are still weak from the typhoid and sometimes I have to hold on to a wall. I'm desperate for the Cleeves'toffee but I'm also desperate to get out of fifth class.\nI know I have to go to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi. He's the only one who will listen but he's at the other end of Limerick and it takes me an hour to walk there, sitting on steps, holding on to walls. It's a penny to light a candle and I wonder if I should just light the candle and keep the penny. No, St. Francis would know. He loves the bird in the air and the fish in the stream but he's not a fool. I light the candle, I kneel at his statue and beg him to get me out of fifth class where I'm stuck with my brother, who is probably going around the lane now bragging that his big brother was kept back. St. Francis doesn't say a word but I know he's listening and I know he'll get me out of that class. It's the least he could do after all my trouble coming to his statue, sitting on steps, holding on to walls, when I could have gone to St. Joseph's Church and lit a candle to the Little Flower or the Sacred Heart of Jesus Himself. What's the use of being named after him if he's going to desert me in my hour of need?\nI have to sit in Mr. O'Dea's class listening to the catechism and all the other stuff he taught last year. I'd like to raise my hand and give the answers but he says, Be quiet, let your brother answer. He gives them tests in arithmetic and makes me sit there and correct them. He\ndictates to them in Irish and makes me correct what they've written. Then he gives me special compositions to write and makes me read them to the class because of all I learned from him last year. He tells the class, Frank McCourt is going to show you how well he learned to write in this class last year. He's going to write a composition on Our Lord, aren't you, McCourt? He's going to tell us what it would be like if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick which has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family and is the holiest city in Ireland. We know that if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick He would never have been crucified because the people of Limerick were always good Catholics and not given to crucifixion. So, McCourt, you are to go home and write that composition and bring it in tomorrow.\nDad says Mr. O'Dea has a great imagination but didn't Our Lord suffer enough on the cross without sticking Him in Limerick on top of it with the damp from the River Shannon. He puts on his cap and goes for a long walk and I have to think about Our Lord by myself and wonder what I'm going to write tomorrow.\nThe next day Mr. O'Dea says, All right, McCourt, read your composition to the class.\nThe name of my composition is-\nThe title, McCourt, the title.\nThe title of my composition is, \"Jesus and the Weather. \"\nWhat?\n\"Jesus and the Weather. \"\nAll right, read it.\nThis is my composition. I don't think Jesus Who is Our Lord would\nhave liked the weather in Limerick because it's always raining and the Shannon keeps the whole city damp. My father says the Shannon is a killer river because it killed my two brothers. When you look at pictures of Jesus He's always wandering around ancient Israel in a sheet. It never rains there and you never hear of anyone coughing or getting consumption or anything like that and no one has a job there because all they do is stand around and eat manna and shake their fists and go to crucifixions.\nAnytime Jesus got hungry all He had to do was walk up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have His fill. If He wanted a pint He could wave His hand over a big glass and there was the pint. Or He could visit Mary Magdalene and her sister, Martha, and they'd give Him His dinner no questions asked and He'd get his feet washed and dried with Mary Magdalene's hair while Martha washed the dishes, which I don't think is fair. Why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with Our Lord? It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place because if he was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have to learn the catechism and write compositions about Him. The End.\nMr. O'Dea is quiet and gives me a strange look and I'm worried because when he's quiet like that it means someone is going to suffer. He says, McCourt, who wrote that composition?\nI did, sir.\nDid your father write that composition? He didn't, sir.\nCome here, McCourt.\nI follow him out the door, along the hall to the headmaster's room. Mr. O'Dea shows him my composition and Mr. O'Halloran gives me the strange look, too. Did you write this composition?\nI did, sir.\nI'm taken out of the fifth class and put into Mr. O'Halloran's sixth class with all the boys I know, Paddy Clohessy, Fintan Slattery, The Question Quigley, and when school is over that day I have to go back down to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi to thank him even if my legs are still weak from the typhoid and I have to sit on steps and hold on to walls and I wonder was it something good I said in that composition or something bad.\nMr. Thomas L. O'Halloran teaches three classes in one room, sixth, seventh, eighth. He has a head like President Roosevelt and he wears gold glasses. He wears suits, navy blue or gray, and there's a gold watch chain that hangs across his belly from pocket to pocket in his waistcoat. We call him Hoppy because he has a short leg and hops when he walks. He knows what we call him and he says, Yes, I'm Hoppy and I'll hop on you. He carries a long stick, a pointer, and if you don't pay attention or give a stupid answer he gives you three slaps on each hand or whacks you across the backs of your legs. He makes you learn everything by heart, everything, and that makes him the hardest master in the school. He loves America and makes us know all the American states in alphabetical order. He makes charts of Irish grammar, Irish history and algebra at home, hangs them on an easel and we have to chant our way through the cases, conjugations and declensions of Irish, famous names and battles, proportions, ratios, equations. We have to know all the important dates in Irish history. He tells us what is important and why. No master ever told us why before. If you asked why you'd be hit on the head. Hoppy doesn't call us idiots and if you ask a question he doesn't go into a rage. He's the only master who stops and says, Do ye understand what I'm talking about? Do ye want to ask a question?\nIt's a shock to everyone when he says, the Battle of Kinsale in sixteen nought one was the saddest moment in Irish history, a close battle with cruelty and atrocities on both sides.\nCruelty on both sides? The Irish side? How could that be? All the other masters told us the Irish always fought nobly, they always fought the fair fight. He recites and makes us remember, They went forth to battle, but they always fell, Their eyes were fixed above the sullen shields.\nNobly they fought and bravely, but not well, And sank heart wounded by a subtle spell.\nIf they lost it was because of traitors and informers. But I want to know about these Irish atrocities.\nSir, did the Irish commit atrocities at the Battle of Kinsale?\nThey did, indeed. It is recorded that they killed prisoners but they were no better nor worse than the English.\nMr. O'Halloran can't lie. He's the headmaster. All these years we were told the Irish were always noble and they made brave speeches before the English hanged them. Now Hoppy O'Halloran is saying the Irish did bad things. Next thing he'll be saying the English did good things. He says, You have to study and learn so that you can make up your own mind about history and everything else but you can't make up an empty mind. Stock your mind, stock your mind. It is your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it. If you won the Irish Sweepstakes and\nbought a house that needed furniture would you fill it with bits and pieces of rubbish? Your mind is your house and if you fill it with rubbish from the cinemas it will rot in your head. You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace.\nHe calls us one by one to the front of the room and looks at our shoes. He wants to know why they're broken or why we have no shoes at all. He tells us this is a disgrace and he's going to have a raffle to raise money so that we can have strong warm boots for the winter. He gives us books of tickets and we swarm all over Limerick for Leamy's School boot fund, first prize five pounds, five prizes of a pound each. Eleven boys with no boots get new boots. Malachy and I don't get any because we have shoes on our feet even if the soles are worn away and we wonder why we ran all over Limerick selling tickets so that other boys could get boots. Fintan Slattery says we gain plenary Indulgences for works of charity and Paddy Clohessy says, Fintan, would you ever go and have a good shit for yourself.\nI know when Dad does the bad thing. I know when he drinks the dole money and Mam is desperate and has to beg at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and ask for credit at Kathleen O'Connell's shop but I don't want to back away from him and run to Mam. How can I do that when I'm up with him early every morning with the whole world asleep? He lights the fire and makes the tea and sings to himself or reads the paper to me in a whisper that won't wake up the rest of the family. Mikey Molloy stole Cuchulain, the Angel on the Seventh Step is gone someplace else, but my father in the morning is still mine. He gets the Irish Press early and tells me about the world, Hitler, Mussolini, Franco. He says this war is none of our business because the English are up to their tricks again. He tells me about the great Roosevelt in Washington and the great De Valera in Dublin. In the morning we have the world to ourselves and he never tells me I should die for Ireland. He tells me about the old days in Ireland when the English wouldn't let the Catholics have schools because they wanted to keep the people ignorant, that the Catholic children met in hedge schools in the depths of the country and learned English, Irish, Latin and Greek. The people loved learning. They loved stories and poetry even if none of this was any good for getting a job. Men, women and children would gather in ditches to hear those great masters and everyone wondered at how much a man could carry in his head. The masters risked their lives going from ditch to ditch and hedge to hedge because if the English caught them teaching they might be transported to foreign parts or worse. He tells me school is easy now, you don't have to sit in a ditch learning your sums or the glorious history of Ireland. I should be good in school and some day I'll go back to America and get an inside job where I'll be sitting at a desk with two fountain pens in my pocket, one red and one blue, making decisions. I'll be in out of the rain and I'll have a suit and shoes and a warm place to live and what more could a man want? He says you can do anything in America, it's the land of opportunity. You can be a fisherman in Maine or a farmer in California. America is not like Limerick, a gray place with a river that kills.\nWhen you have your father to yourself by the fire in the morning you don't need Cuchulain or the Angel on the Seventh Step or anything.\nAt night he helps us with our exercises. Mam says they call it homework in America but here it's exercises, the sums, the English, the Irish, the history. He can't help us with Irish because he's from the North and lacking in the native tongue. Malachy offers to teach him all\nthe Irish words he knows but Dad says it's too late, you can't teach an old dog a new bark. Before bed we sit around the fire and if we say, Dad, tell us a story, he makes up one about someone in the lane and the story will take us all over the world, up in the air, under the sea and back to the lane. Everyone in the story is a different color and everything is upside down and backward. Motor cars and planes go under water and submarines fly through the air. Sharks sit in trees and giant salmon sport with kangaroos on the moon. Polar bears wrestle with elephants in Australia and penguins teach Zulus how to play bagpipes. After the story he takes us upstairs and kneels with us while we say our prayers. We say the Our Father, three Hail Marys, God bless the Pope. God bless Mam, God bless our dead sister and brothers, God bless Ireland, God bless De Valera, and God bless anyone who gives Dad a job. He says, Go to sleep, boys, because holy God is watching you and He always knows if you're not good.\nI think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland.\nI feel sad over the bad thing but I can't back away from him because the one in the morning is my real father and if I were in America I could say, I love you, Dad, the way they do in the films, but you can't say that in Limerick for fear you might be laughed at. You're allowed to say you love God and babies and horses that win but anything else is a softness in the head.\nDay and night we're tormented in that kitchen with people emptying their buckets. Mam says it's not the River Shannon that will kill us but the stink from that lavatory outside our door. It's bad enough in the winter when everything flows over and seeps under our door but worse in the warm weather when there are flies and bluebottles and rats.\nThere is a stable next to the lavatory where they keep the big horse from Gabbett's coal yard. His name is Finn the Horse and we all love him but the stable man from the coal yard doesn't take proper care of the stable and the stink travels to our house. The stink from the lavatory and the stable attracts rats and we have to chase them with our new dog, Lucky. He loves to corner the rats and then we smash them to bits with rocks or sticks or stab them with the hay fork in the stable. The horse himself is frightened by the rats and we have to be careful when he rears up. He knows we're not rats because we bring him apples when we rob an orchard out the country.\nSometimes the rats escape and run into our house and into the coal hole under the stairs where it's pitch dark and you can't see them. Even when we bring in a candle we can't find them because they dig holes everywhere and we don't know where to look. If we have a fire we can boil water and pour it slowly in from the kettle spot and that will drive them out of the hole between our legs and out the door again unless Lucky is there to catch them in his teeth and shake the life out of them. We expect him to eat the rats but he'll leave them in the lane with their guts hanging out and run to my father for a piece of bread dipped in tea. People in the lane say that's a peculiar way for a dog to behave but then what would you expect from a dog of the McCourts.\nThe minute there's a sign of a rat or a mention of one Mam is out the door and up the lane. She'd rather walk the streets of Limerick forever than stay one minute in a house that has a rat in it and she can\nnever rest because she knows that with the stable and the lavatory there's always a rat nearby with his family waiting for their dinner.\nWe fight the rats and we fight the stink from that lavatory. We'd like to keep our door open in the warm weather but you can't when people are trotting down the lane to empty their brimming buckets. Some families are worse than others and Dad hates all of them even though Mam tells him it's not their fault if the builders a hundred years ago put up houses with no lavatories but this one outside our door. Dad says the people should empty their buckets in the middle of the night when we are asleep so that we won't be disturbed by the stink.\nThe flies are nearly as bad as the rats. On warm days they swarm to the stable and when a bucket is emptied they swarm to the lavatory. If Mam cooks anything they swarm into the kitchen and Dad says it's disgusting to think the fly sitting there on the sugar bowl was on the toilet bowl, or what's left of it, a minute ago. If you have an open sore they find it and torment you. By day you have the flies, by night you have the fleas. Mam says there's one good thing about fleas, they're clean, but flies are filthy, you never know where they came from and they carry diseases galore. We can chase the rats and kill them.\nWe can slap at the flies and the fleas and kill them but there's nothing we can do about the neighbors and their buckets. If we're out in the lane playing and we see someone with a bucket we call to our own house, Bucket coming, close the door, close the door, and whoever is inside runs to the door. In warm weather we run to close the door all day because we know which families have the worst buckets. There are families whose fathers have jobs and if they get into the habit of cooking with curry we know their buckets will stink to the heavens and make us sick. Now with the war on and men sending money from England more and more families are cooking with curry and our house is filled with the stink day and night. We know the families with the curry, we know the ones with the cabbage. Mam is sick all the time, Dad takes longer and longer walks into the country, and we play outside as much as we can and far from the lavatory. Dad doesn't complain about the River Shannon anymore. He knows now the lavatory is worse and he takes me with him to the Town Hall to complain. The man there says, Mister, all I can tell you is you can move. Dad says we can't afford to move and the man says there's nothing he can do. Dad says, This is not India. This is a Christian country. The lane needs more lavatories. The man says, Do you expect Limerick to start building lavatories in houses that are falling down anyway, that will be demolished after the war? Dad says that lavatory could kill us all. The man says we live in dangerous times.\nMam says it's hard enough keeping a fire going to cook the Christmas dinner but if I'm going to Christmas dinner at the hospital I'll have to wash myself from top to bottom. She wouldn't give it to Sister Rita to say I was neglected or ripe for another disease. She boils a pot of water early in the morning before Mass and nearly scalds the scalp off me. She scours my ears and scrubs my skin so hard it tingles. She can afford tuppence for the bus out to the hospital but I'll have to walk back and that will be good for me because I'll be stuffed with food and now she has to get the fire going again for the pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes which she got once again through the kindness of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and she's determined this will be the last time we celebrate the birth of Our Lord with pig's head.\nNext year we'll have a goose or a nice ham and why wouldn't we, isn't Limerick famous the world over for the ham?\nSister Rita says, Now would you look at this, our little soldier looking so healthy. No meat on the bones but still. Now tell me, did you go to Mass this morning?\nI did, Sister.\nAnd did you receive?\nI did, Sister.\nShe takes me into an empty ward and tells me sit there on that\nchair it won't be long now till I get my dinner. She leaves and I wonder if I'll be eating with nuns and nurses or will I be in a ward with children having their Christmas dinner. In awhile my dinner is brought in by the girl in the blue dress who brought me the books. She places the tray on the side of a bed and I pull up a chair. She frowns at me and screws up her face. You, she says, that's your dinner an' I'm not bringin' you any books.\nThe dinner is delicious, turkey, mashed potatoes, peas, jelly and custard, and a pot of tea. The jelly and custard dish looks delicious and I can't resist it so I'll have it first there's no one there to notice but when I'm eating it the girl in the blue dress comes in with bread and says, What are you doin'?\nNothing.\nYes, you are. You're atin' the sweet before the dinner, and she runs out calling, Sister Rita, Sister Rita, come in quick, and the nun rushes in, Francis, are you all right?\nI am, Sister.\nHe's not all right, Sister. He do be atin' his jelly an custard before his dinner. That's a sin, Sister.\nAh, now, dear, you run along and I'll talk to Francis about that.\nDo, Sister, talk to him or all the childer in the hospital will be atin' their sweet before their dinner an' then where will we be?\nIndeed, indeed, where will we be? Run along now.\nThe girl leaves and Sister Rita smiles at me. God love her, she doesn't miss a thing even in her confusion. We have to be patient with her, Francis, the way she's touched.\nShe leaves and it's quiet in that empty ward and when I'm finished I don't know what to do because you're not supposed to do anything till they tell you. Hospitals and schools always tell you what to do. I wait a long time till the girl in the blue dress comes in for the tray. Are you finished? she says.\nand I tells\nI am.\nWell, that's all you're gettin' an' now you can go home.\nSurely girls who are not right in the head can't tell you go home\nwonder if I should wait for Sister Rita. A nurse in the hallway\nme Sister Rita is having her dinner and is not to be bothered. It's a long walk from Union Cross to Barrack Hill and when I get\nhome my family are up in Italy and well into their pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes. I tell them about my Christmas dinner. Mam wants to know if I had it with the nurses and nuns and she gets a bit angry when I tell her I ate alone in a ward and that's no way to treat a child. She tells me sit down and have some pig's head and I force it into my mouth and I'm so stuffed I have to lie on the bed with my belly sticking out a mile.\nIt's early in the morning and there's a motor car outside our door, the first one we've ever seen in the lane. There are men in suits looking in the door of the stable of Finn the Horse and there must be something wrong because you never see men with suits in the lane.\nIt's Finn the Horse. He's lying on the floor of the stable looking up the lane and there's white stuff like milk around his mouth. The stable man who takes care of Finn the Horse says he found him like that this morning and it's strange because he's always up and ready for his feed. The men are shaking their heads. My brother Michael says to one of the men, Mister, what's up with Finn?\nSick horse, son. Go home.\nThe stable man who takes care of Finn has the whiskey smell on him. He says to Michael, That horse is a goner. We have to shoot him.\nMichael pulls at my hand. Frank, they're not to shoot him. Tell them. You're big.\nThe stable man says, Go home, boy. Go home.\nMichael attacks him, kicks him, scrawbs the back of his hand, and the man sends Michael flying. Hould that brother of yours, he tells me, hould him.\nOne of the other men takes something yellow and brown from a bag, goes to Finn, puts it to his head and there's a sharp crack. Finn shivers. Michael screams at the man and attacks him too but the man says, The horse was sick, son. He's better off.\nThe men in suits drive away and the stable man says he has to wait for the lorry to take Finn away, he can't leave him alone or the rats will be at him. He wants to know if we'd keep an eye on the horse with our dog Lucky while he goes to the pub, he's blue mouldy for a pint.\nNo rat has a chance to get near Finn the Horse the way Michael is there with a stick small as he is. The man comes back smelling of porter and then there's the big lorry to take the horse away, a big lorry with three men and two great planks that slope from the back of the lorry to Finn's head. The three men and the stable man tie ropes around Finn and pull him up the planks and the people in the lane yell at the men because of the nails and broken wood in the planks that catch at Finn and tear out bits of his hide and streak the planks with bright pink horse blood.\nYe are destroyin' that horse.\nCan't ye have respect for the dead?\nGo easy with that poor horse.\nThe stable man says, For the love o' Jaysus what are ye squawkin'\nabout? 'Tis only a dead horse, and Michael runs at him again with his head down and his small fists flying till the stable man gives him a shove that sends him on his back and Mam goes at the stable man in such a rage he runs up the planks and over Finn's body to escape. He comes back drunk in the evening to sleep it off and after he leaves there's a smoldering in the hay and the stable burns down the rats running up the lane with every boy and dog chasing them till they escape into the streets of respectable people.\nIX\nMam says, Alphie is enough. I'm worn out. That's the end of it. No more children.\nDad says, The good Catholic woman must perform her wifely duties and submit to her husband or face eternal damnation.\nMam says, As long as there are no more children eternal damnation sounds attractive enough to me.\nWhat is Dad to do? There's a war on. English agents are recruiting Irishmen to work in their munitions factories, the pay is good, there are no jobs in Ireland, and if the wife turns her back to you there's no shortage of women in England where the able men are off fighting Hitler and Mussolini and you can do anything you like as long as you remember you're Irish and lower class and don't try to rise above your station.\nFamilies up and down the lane are getting telegram money orders from their fathers in England. They rush to the post office to cash the money orders so they can shop and show the world their good fortune on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The boys get their hair cut on Saturdays, the women curl their hair with iron tongs hot from the fire. They're very grand now the way they pay sixpence or even a shilling for seats at the Savoy Cinema where you'll meet a better class of people than the lower classes who fill the tuppenny seats in the gods at the Lyric Cinema and are never done shouting at the screen, the kind of people if you don't mind who are liable to cheer on the Africans when they throw spears at Tarzan or the Indians when they're scalping the United States Cavalry. The new rich people go home after Mass on Sundays all airs and stuff themselves with meat and potatoes, sweets and cakes galore, and they think nothing of drinking their tea from delicate little cups which stand in saucers to catch the tea that overflows and when they lift the cups they stick out their little fingers to show how refined they are. Some stop going to fish and chip shops altogether because you see nothing in those places but drunken soldiers and night girls and men that drank their dole and their wives screeching at them to come home. The brave new rich will be seen at the Savoy Restaurant or the Stella drinking tea, eating little buns, patting their lips with serviettes if you don't mind, coming home on the bus and complaining the service is not what it used to be. They have electricity now so they can see things they never saw before and when darkness falls they turn on the new wireless to hear how the war is going. They thank God for Hitler because if he hadn't marched all over Europe the men of Ireland would still be at home scratching their arses on the queue at the Labour Exchange.\nSome families sing,\nYip aye aidy aye ay aye oh\nYip aye aidy aye ay,\nWe don't care about England or France, All we want is the German advance.\nIf there's a chill in the air they'll turn on the electric fire for the comfort that's in it and sit in their kitchens listening to the news declaring how sorry they are for the English women and children dying under the German bombs but look what England did to us for eight hundred years.\nThe families with fathers in England are able to lord it over the families that don't. At dinnertime and teatime the new rich mothers stand at their doors and call to their children, Mikey, Kathleen, Paddy, come in for yeer dinner. Come in for the lovely leg o'lamb and the gorgeous green peas and the floury white potatoes.\nSean, Josie, Peggy, come in for yeer tea, come in at wanst for the fresh bread and butter and the gorgeous blue duck egg what no one else in the lane have.\nBrendan, Annie, Patsy, come in for the fried black puddin', the sizzlin' sausages and the lovely trifle soaked in the best of Spanish sherry.\nAt times like this Mam tells us to stay inside. We have nothing but bread and tea and she doesn't want the tormenting neighbors to see us with our tongues hanging out, suffering over the lovely smells floating up and down the lane. She says 'tis easy to see they're not used to having anything the way they brag about everything. 'Tis a real low-class mind that will call out the door and tell the world what they're having for the supper. She says 'tis their way of getting a rise out of us because Dad is a foreigner from the North and he won't have anything to do with any of them. Dad says all that food comes from English money and no luck will come to those who took it but what could you expect from Limerick anyway, people who profit from Hitler's war, people who will work and fight for the English. He says he'll never go over there and help England win a war. Mam says, No, you'll stay here where there's no work and hardly a lump of coal to boil water for the tea. No, you'll stay here and drink the dole when the humor is on you. You'll watch your sons going around with broken shoes and their arses hanging out of their trousers. Every house in the lane has electricity and we're lucky if we have a candle. God above, if I had the fare I'd be off to England myself for I'm sure they need women in the factories.\nDad says a factory is no place for a woman.\nMam says, Sitting on your arse by the fire is no place for a man. I say to him, Why can't you go to England, Dad, so we can have\nelectricity and a wireless and Mam can stand at the door and tell the world what we're having at dinnertime?\nHe says, Don't you want to have your father here at home with you?\nI do but you can come back at the end of the war and we can all go to America.\nHe sighs, Och, aye, och, aye. All right he'll go to England after Christmas because America is in the war now and the cause must be just. He'd never go if the Americans hadn't gone in. He tells me I'll have to be the man of the house, and he signs up with an agent to work in a factory in Coventry which, everyone says, is the most bombed city in England. The agent says, There's plenty of work for willing men. You can work overtime till you drop and if you save it up, mate, you'll be Rockefeller at the end of the war.\nWe're up early to see Dad off at the railway station. Kathleen O'Connell at the shop knows Dad is off to England and money will be flowing back so she's happy to let Mam have credit for tea, milk, sugar, bread, butter and an egg.\nAn egg.\nMam says, This egg is for your father. He needs the nourishment for the long journey before him.\nIt's a hard-boiled egg and Dad peels off the shell. He slices the egg five ways and gives each of us a bit to put on our bread. Mam says, Don't be such a fool. Dad says, What would a man be doing with a whole egg to himself? Mam has tears on her eyelashes. She pulls her chair over to the fireplace. We all eat our bread and egg and watch her cry till she says, What are ye gawkin' at? and turns away to look into the ashes. Her\nbread and egg are still on the table and I wonder if she has any plans for them. They look delicious and I'm still hungry but Dad gets up and brings them to her with the tea. She shakes her head but he presses them on her and she eats and drinks, snuffling and crying. He sits opposite her a while, silent, till she looks up at the clock and says, 'Tis time to go. He puts on his cap and picks up his bag. Mam wraps Alphie in an old blanket and we set off through the streets of Limerick.\nThere are other families in the streets. The going away fathers walk ahead, the mothers carry babies or push prams. A mother with a pram will say to other mothers, God above, missus, you must be fagged out carrying that child. Sure, why don't you stick him into the pram here and rest your poor arms.\nPrams might be packed with four or five babies squalling away because the prams are old and the wheels bockety and the babies are rocked till they get sick and throw up their goody.\nThe men call to each other. Grand day, Mick. Lovely day for the journey, Joe. 'Tis, indeed, Mick. Arrah, we might as well have a pint before we go, Joe. We might as well, Mick. Might as well be drunk as the way we are, Joe.\nThey laugh and the women behind them are teary eyed and red nosed.\nIn the pubs around the railway station the men are packed in drinking the money the agents gave them for travel food. They're having the last pint, the last drop of whiskey on Irish soil, For God knows it might be the last we'll ever have, Mick, the way the Jerries are bombing the bejesus outa England and not a minute too soon after what they did to us and isn't it a tragic thing entirely the way we have to go over there and save the arse of the ancient foe.\nThe women stay outside the pubs talking. Mam tells Mrs. Meehan, The first telegram money order I get I'll be in the shop buying a big breakfast so that we can all have our own egg of a Sunday morning.\nI look at my brother Malachy. Did you hear that? Our own egg of a Sunday morning. Oh, God, I already had plans for my egg. Tap it around the top, gently crack the shell, lift with a spoon, a dab of butter down into the yolk, salt, take my time, a dip of the spoon, scoop, more salt, more butter, into the mouth, oh, God above, if heaven has a taste it must be an egg with butter and salt, and after the egg is there anything in the world lovelier than fresh warm bread and a mug of sweet golden tea?\nSome men are already too drunk to walk and the English agents are paying sober men to drag them out of the pubs and throw them on a great horse drawn float to be hauled to the station and dumped into the train. The agents are desperate to get everyone out of the pubs. Come on, men. Miss this train and you'll miss a good job. Come on, men, we have the Guinness in England. We have the Jameson. Now, men, please, men. You're drinking your food money and you'll get no more.\nThe men tell the agents to kiss their Irish arses, that the agents are lucky they're alive, lucky they're not hanging from the nearest lamppost after what they did to Ireland. And the men sing, On Mountjoy one Monday morning High upon the gallows tree, Kevin Barry gave his young life For the cause of liberty.\nThe train wails in the station and the agents beg the women to get their men out of the pubs and the men stumble out singing and crying and hugging their wives and children and promising to send so much money Limerick will be turned into another New York. The men climb the station\nsteps and the women and children call after them, Kevin, love, mind yourself and don't be wearing damp shirts.\nDry your socks, Michael, or the bunions will destroy you entirely. Paddy, go easy on the drink, are you listenin', Paddy?\nDad, Dad, don't go, Dad.\nTommy, don't forget to send the money. The children are skin and\nbones.\nPeter, don't forget to be takin' the medicine for your weak chest,\nGod help us.\nLarry, mind them bloody bombs.\nChristy, don't be talkin' to them Englishwomen. They're full of\ndiseases.\nJackie, come back. Sure we'll manage somehow. Don't go, Jack-e-e,\nJack-e-e, oh, Jesus, don't go.\nDad pats our heads. He tells us remember our religious duties but,\nabove all, obey our mother. He stands before her. She has the baby Alphie in her arms. She says, Mind yourself. He drops the bag and puts his arms around her. They stay that way a moment till the baby yelps between them. He nods, picks up his bag, climbs the steps to the station, turns to wave and he's gone.\nBack at home Mam says, I don't care. I know it sounds extravagant but I'm going to light the fire and make more tea for it isn't every day your father goes to England.\nWe sit around the fire and drink our tea and cry because we have no father, till Mam says, Don't cry, don't cry. Now that your father is gone to England surely our troubles will be over.\nSurely.\nMam and Bridey Hannon sit by the fire upstairs in Italy smoking Woodbines, drinking tea, and I sit on the stairs listening. We have a father in England so that we can get all we want from Kathleen O'Connell's shop and pay when he starts sending the money in a fortnight. Mam tells Bridey she can't wait to get out of this bloody lane to a place with a decent lavatory that we don't have to share with half the world. We'll all have new boots and coats to keep off the rain so we won't be coming home from school famished. We'll have eggs and rashers on Sunday for breakfast and ham and cabbage and potatoes for dinner. We'll have electric light and why shouldn't we? Weren't Frank and Malachy born to it in America where everyone has it?\nAll we have to do now is wait for two weeks till the telegram boy knocks at the door. Dad will have to settle into his job in England, buy work clothes and get a place to stay, so the first money order won't be big, three pounds or three pounds ten, but soon we'll be like other families in the lane, five pounds a week, paying off debts, buying new clothes, putting something in the savings against the time we'll pack up and move to England entirely and save there to go to America. Mam herself could get a job in an English factory making bombs or something and God knows we wouldn't know ourselves with the money pouring in. She wouldn't be happy if we grew up with English accents but better an English accent than an empty belly.\nBridey says it doesn't matter what class of an accent an Irishman has for he'll never forget what the English did to us for eight hundred long years.\nWe know what Saturdays are in the lane. We know some families like the Downeses across from us get their telegram early because Mr. Downes\nis a steady man who knows how to have a pint or two on a Friday and go home to his bed. We know men like him run to the post office the minute they're paid so their families won't know a minute of waiting or worry. Men like Mr. Downes send their sons RAF wings to wear on their coats. That's what we want and that's what we told Dad before he left, Don't forget the RAF badges, Dad.\nWe see the telegram boys on their bicycles swing into the lane. They're happy telegram boys because the tips they get in the lanes are bigger than anything they get in the grand streets and avenues where rich people will begrudge you the steam of their piss.\nThe families that get the early telegrams have that contented look. They'll have all day Saturday to enjoy the money. They'll shop, they'll eat, they'll have all day to think about what they'll do that night and that's almost as good as the thing itself because Saturday night when you have a few shillings in your pocket is the most delicious night of the week.\nThere are families don't get the telegram every week and you know them by the anxious look. Mrs. Meagher has waited at her door every Saturday for two months. My mother says she'd be ashamed of her life to wait at the door like that. All the children play in the lane and keep an eye out for the telegram boy. Hoi, telegram boy, do you have anything for Meagher? and when he says no they say, Are you sure? and he'll say, Course I'm sure. I know what I have in my feckin' pouch.\nEveryone knows the telegram boys stop coming when the Angelus rings at six and darkness brings desperation to the women and children.\nTelegram boy, will you look in your pouch again? Please. Aw, God. I did. I have nothing for ye.\nAw, God, please look. Our name is Meagher. Will you look?\nI know bloody well yeer name is Meagher and I looked.\nThe children claw at him up on his bicycle and he kicks at them, Jesus, will ye get away from me.\nOnce the Angelus rings at six in the evening the day is over. The ones with the telegrams are having their supper with the electric light blazing away and the ones that didn't get the telegrams have to light candles and see if Kathleen O'Connell might let them have tea and bread till this time next week when surely with the help of God and His Blessed Mother the telegram will come.\nMr. Meehan at the top of the lane went to England with Dad and when the telegram boy stops at Meehan's we know we'll be next. Mam has her coat ready to go to the post office but she won't leave the chair by the fire in Italy till she has the telegram in her hand. The telegram boy rides down the lane and swings over to Downeses'. He hands them their telegram, takes the tip and turns his bicycle around to head back up the lane. Malachy calls, Telegram boy, do you have something for McCourt? Ours is coming today. The telegram boy shakes his head and rides away.\nMam puffs on her Woodbine. Well, we have all day though I'd like to do a bit of shopping early before the best hams are gone at Barry the butcher. She can't leave the fire and we can't leave the lane for fear the telegram boy might come and find no one at home. Then we'd have to wait till Monday to cash the money order and that would destroy the weekend entirely. We'd have to watch the Meehans and everyone else parading around in their new clothes and staggering home with eggs and potatoes and sausages for Sunday and sailing off to the films on Saturday night. No, we can't move an inch till that telegram boy comes. Mam says\ndon't be too worried between noon and two because so many telegram boys go for their dinner and there will surely be a big rush between two and the Angelus. We don't have a thing to worry about till six. We stop every telegram boy. We tell them our name is McCourt, that this is our first telegram, it should be three pounds or more, they might have forgotten to put our name on it or our address, is he sure? is he sure? One boy tells us he'll inquire at the post office. He says he knows what 'tis like to wait for the telegram because his own father is a drunken oul' shit over in England that never sent a penny. Mam hears him inside and tells us you should never talk about your father like that. The same telegram boy comes back just before the Angelus at six and tells us he asked Mrs. O'Connell at the post office if they had anything for McCourt all day and they didn't. Mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the Woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger. Michael who is only five and won't understand anything till he's eleven like me wants to know if we're having fish and chips tonight because he's hungry. Mam says, Next week, love, and he goes back out to play in the lane.\nYou don't know what to do with yourself when the first telegram doesn't come. You can't stay out in the lane playing with your brothers all night because everyone else is gone in and you'd be ashamed to stay out in the lane to be tormented with smells of sausages and rashers and fried bread. You don't want to look at electric light coming through the windows after dark and you don't want to hear the news from the BBC or Radio Eireann from other people's wirelesses. Mrs. Meagher and her children are gone in and there's only the dim light of a candle from their kitchen. They're ashamed too. They stay inside on Saturday nights and they don't even go to Mass on Sunday mornings. Bridey Hannon told Mam that Mrs. Meagher is in a constant state of shame over the rags they wear and so desperate she goes down to the Dispensary for the public assistance. Mam says that's the worst thing that could happen to any family. It's worse than going on the dole, it's worse than going to the St. Vincent de Paul Society, it's worse than begging on the streets with the tinkers and the knackers. It's the last thing you'd do to keep yourself out of the poor house and the children from the orphanage.\nThere's a sore at the top of my nose between my eyebrows, gray and red and itching. Grandma says, Don't touch that sore and don't put water near it or it'll spread. If you broke your arm she'd say don't touch that with water it'll spread. The sore spreads into my eyes anyway and now they're red and yellow from the stuff that oozes and makes them stick in the morning. They stick so hard I have to force my eyelids open with my fingers and Mam has to scrub off that yellow stuff with a damp rag and boric powder. The eyelashes fall off and every bit of dust in Limerick blows into my eyes on windy days. Grandma tells me I have naked eyes and she says it's my own fault, all that eye trouble comes from sitting up there at the top of the lane under the light pole in all kinds of weather with my nose stuck in books and the same thing will happen to Malachy if he doesn't give over with the reading. You can see little Michael is getting just as bad sticking his nose in books when he should be out playing like a healthy child. Books, books, books, says Grandma, ye will ruin yeer eyes entirely.\nShe's having tea with Mam and I hear her whisper, The thing to do is give him St. Anthony's spit.\nWhat's that? says Mam.\nYour fasting spit in the morning. Go to him before he wakes and spit on his eyes for the spit of a fasting mother has powerful cures in\nit.\nBut I'm always awake before Mam. I force my eyes open long before\nshe stirs. I can hear her coming across the floor and when she stands over me for the spit I open my eyes. God, she says, your eyes are open.\nI think they're getting better.\nThat's good, and she goes back to bed.\nThe eyes don't heal and she takes me to the Dispensary where the\npoor people see doctors and get their medicines. It's the place to apply for public assistance when a father is dead or disappeared and there's no dole money, no wages.\nThere are benches along the walls by the doctors' offices. The benches are always packed with people talking about their ailments. Old men and women sit and groan and babies scream and mothers say hush, love, hush. There's a high platform in the middle of the Dispensary with a counter circling it chest high. When you want anything you stand in a queue before that platform to see Mr. Coffey or Mr. Kane. The women in the queue are like the women at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. They wear shawls and they're respectful to Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane because if they're not they might be told go away and come back next week when it's this minute you need the public assistance or a docket to see the doctor. Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane love to have a good laugh with the women. They'll decide if you're desperate enough for the public assistance or if you're sick enough to see a doctor. You have to tell them in front of everyone what's wrong with you and they often have a good laugh with that. They'll say, And what is it you want, Mrs. O'Shea? A docket for the doctor, is it? And what is your trouble, Mrs. O'Shea? A pain, is it? A touch of the wind, maybe. Or maybe too much cabbage. Oh, the cabbage will do it right enough. They laugh and Mrs. O'Shea laughs and all the women laugh and say Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane are funny men, they'd give Laurel and Hardy a run for their money.\nMr. Coffey says, Now, woman, what's your name? Angela McCourt, sir.\nAnd what's up with you?\n'Tis my son, sir. He has two bad eyes.\nOh, by God, he does, woman. They're desperate looking eyes altogether. They look like two rising suns. The Japs could use him on their flag, ha ha ha. Did he pour acid on his face or what?\n'Tis some class of infection, sir. He had the typhoid last year and then this came.\nAll right, all right, we don't need the life story. Here's your docket to Dr. Troy.\nTwo long benches are filled with patients for Dr. Troy. Mam sits next to a woman who has a big sore on her nose that won't go away. I tried everything, missus, every known cure on God's lovely earth. I'm eighty-three years of age and I'd like to go to my grave healthy. Is it too much to ask that I meet my Redeemer with a healthy nose? And what's up with yourself, missus?\nMy son. The eyes.\nAh, God bless us and save us, look at them eyes. They're the sorest two eyes I ever seen in me life. I never seen that color red before.\n'Tis an infection, missus.\nSure there's a cure for that. You need the caul.\nWhat's that now?\nBabies are born with this thing on their heads, a class of a hood, rare and magical. Get a caul and put that on his head any day that has a three in it, make him hold his breath for three minutes even if you have to clap your hand over his face, sprinkle him with holy water three times head to toenail and his two eyes will shine in the dawn.\nAnd where would I get a caul?\nDon't all the midwives have cauls, missus. What's a midwife without a caul? It cures all classes of disease and keeps off more.\nMam says she'll talk to Nurse O'Halloran and see if she has a spare caul.\nDr. Troy looks at my eyes. Into the hospital with this boy at once. Take him to the eye ward at the City Home. Here's the docket to get him\nin.\nWhat does he have, Doctor?\nThe worst case of conjunctivitis I've ever seen in my life and\nsomething else in there I can't make out. He needs the eye man.\nHow long will he be in, Doctor?\nOnly God knows that. I should have seen this child weeks ago. There are twenty beds in the ward and there are men and boys with\nbandages around their heads, black patches on their eyes, thick glasses. Some walk around tapping at beds with sticks. A man cries all the time that he'll never see again, he's too young, his children are babies, he'll never see them again. Jesus Christ, oh, Jesus Christ, and the nuns are shocked at the way he takes the name of the Lord in vain. Stop that, Maurice, stop the blasphemy. You have your health. You're alive. We all have our problems. Offer it up and think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the nails in His poor hands and feet, the wound in His side. Maurice says, Oh, Jesus, look down and have pity on me. Sister Bernadette warns him if he doesn't mind his language they'll put him in a ward alone and he says, Heavenly God, and that isn't as bad as Jesus Christ so she's satisfied.\nIn the morning I have to go downstairs for drops. The nurse says, Sit in this high chair and here's a nice sweet. The doctor has a bottle with brown stuff in it. He tells me put my head back, that's right, now open up, open your eyes and he pours the stuff into my right eye and it's a flame going through my skull. The nurse says, Open the other eye, come on be a good boy, and she has to force the eyelids open so the doctor can set fire to the other side of my skull. She wipes my cheeks and tells me run along upstairs but I can barely see and I want to stick my face into an icy stream. The doctor says, Run along, be a man, be a good trooper.\nThe whole world is brown and blurry on the stairs. The other patients are sitting by their beds with dinner trays and mine is there too but I don't want it with the way my skull is raging. I sit by my bed and a boy across the way says, Hoi, don't you want your dinner? I'll take it, and he comes for it.\nI try to lie on the bed but a nurse says, Now, now, no lying on the bed in the middle of the day. Your case isn't that serious.\nI have to sit with my eyes closed and everything going brown and black, black and brown and I'm sure I must be having a dream because Lord God above, is that the little fella with the typhoid, little Frankie, the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, is that yourself, Frankie, for wasn't I promoted out of the Fever Hospital, thank God, where there's every class of disease and you never know what germs you\nmight be bringing home to the wife in your clothes and what's up with you, Frankie, and the two eyes in your head all gone brown?\nI have an infection, Seamus.\nYerra, you'll be over that before you're married, Frankie. The eyes need exercise. The blink is great value for the eyes. I had an uncle with bad eyes and the blink saved him. He sat an hour ever day and blinked and it stood to him in the end. Wound up with powerful eyes, so he did.\nI want to ask him more about the blink and the powerful eyes but he says, Now do you remember the poem, Frankie, the lovely poem of Patricia? He stands in the aisle between the beds with his mop and his bucket\nand says the highwayman poem and all the patients stop their moaning and the nuns and nurses stand and listen and on and on goes Seamus till he comes to the end and everyone goes mad clapping and cheering him and he tells the world he loves that poem he'll have it in his head forever no matter where he goes and if it wasn't for Frankie McCourt and his typhoid there and poor Patricia Madigan with the dipteria that's gone God rest her he'd never know the poem and there I am famous in the eye ward of the City Home Hospital and all because of Seamus.\nMam can't come to visit every day, it's a long way out, she doesn't always have the money for the bus and the walk is hard on her corns. She thinks my eyes look better though you can't tell with all that brown stuff, which looks and smells like iodine and if it's anything like iodine it must burn. Still, they say the bitterer the medicine the quicker the cure. She gets permission to take me for a walk around the grounds when the weather clears and there's a strange sight, Mr. Timoney standing against the wall where the old people are with his eyes raised to the sky. I want to talk to him and I have to ask Mam because you never know what's right or wrong in a hospital.\nMr. Timoney.\nWho is it? Who do we have?\nFrank McCourt, sir.\nFrancis, ah, Francis.\nMam says, I'm his mother, Mr. Timoney.\nWell, then, the two of ye are blessed. I have neither kith nor kin\nnor Macushla my dog. And what are you doing in this place, Francis?\nI have an infection in my eyes.\nAh, Jesus, Francis, not the eyes, not the eyes. Mother of Christ,\nyou're too young for that.\nMr. Timoney, would you like me to read to you?\nWith them eyes, Francis? Ah, no, son, Save the eyes. I'm beyond\nreading. In my head I have everything I need. I was smart enough to put things in my head in my youth and now I have a library in my head. The English shot my wife. The Irish put down my poor innocent Macushla. Isn't it a joke of a world?\nMam says, Terrible world but God is good.\nIndeed, missus. God made the world, it's a terrible world, but God is good. Good-bye, Francis. Rest your eyes and then read till they fall out of your head. We had good times with old Jonathan Swift, didn't we, Francis?\nWe did, Mr. Timoney.\nMam takes me back to the eye ward. She tells me, Don't be crying over Mr. Timoney, he's not even your father. Besides you'll be ruining your eyes.\nSeamus comes to the ward three times a week and brings new poems in his head. He says, You made Patricia sad, Frankie, when you didn't like the one about the owl and the pussycat.\nI'm sorry, Seamus.\nI have it in my head, Frankie, and I'll say it for you if you don't say 'tis foolish.\nI won't, Seamus.\nHe says the poem and everyone in the ward loves it. They want the words and he says it three more times till the whole ward is saying, The Owl and the Pussy cat went to sea In a beautiful pea-green boat.\nThey took some honey, and plenty of money Wrapped up in a five-pound note.\nThe Owl looked up to the stars above,\nAnd sang to a small guitar,\nO lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are,\nYou are,\nYou are.\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are.\nThey say it along with Seamus now and when it's finished they cheer and clap and Seamus laughs, delighted with himself. When he's gone with his mop and bucket you can hear them at all hours of the day and night O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are.\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are.\nThen Seamus comes with no mop and no bucket and I'm afraid he's sacked over the poetry but he's smiling and telling me he's off to England to work in a factory and earn decent wages for a change. He'll work for two months and bring the wife over and God might be pleased to send them children for he has to do something with all the poems in his head and what better than saying them to small ones in memory of that sweet Patricia Madigan dead of the dipteria.\nGood-bye, Francis. If I had the right fist I'd write to you but I'll get the wife to write when she comes over. I might even learn to read and write myself so that the child that comes won't have a fool for a father.\nI want to cry but you can't cry in the eye ward with brown stuff in your eyes and nurses saying, What's this what's this be a man, and nuns going on, Offer it up, think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the lance in the side, the hands and feet torn to bits with nails.\nI'm a month in the hospital and the doctor says I can go home even if there's still a bit of infection but if I keep the eyes clean with soap and clean towels and build up my health with nourishing food plenty of beef and eggs I'll have a pair of sparkling eyes in no time ha ha.\nMr. Downes across the way comes back from England for his mother's funeral. He tells Mrs. Downes about my father. She tells Bridey Hannon and Bridey tells my mother. Mr. Downes says that Malachy McCourt is gone pure mad with the drink, that he squanders his wages in pubs all over Coventry, that he sings Irish rebel songs which the English don't mind because they're used to the way the Irish carry on about the hundreds of years of suffering, but they won't put up with any man that stands up in\na pub and insults the King and Queen of England, their two lovely daughters and the Queen Mother herself. Insulting the Queen Mother is going beyond the beyonds. What did she ever do to anyone, that poor old lady? Time after time Malachy drinks away his rent money and winds up sleeping in parks when the landlord throws him out. He's a regular disgrace, so he is, and Mr. Downes is glad McCourt is not a Limerickman bringing shame to this ancient city. The magistrates in Coventry are losing their patience and if Malachy McCourt doesn't stop the bloody nonsense he'll be kicked out of the country entirely.\nMam tells Bridey she doesn't know what she's going to do with these stories from England, she never felt so desperate in her life. She can see Kathleen O'Connell doesn't want to give any more credit at the shop and her own mother barks at her if she asks for the loan of a shilling and the St. Vincent de Paul Society want to know when she'll stop asking for charity especially with a husband in England. She's ashamed of the way we look with the dirty old torn shirts, raggedy ganseys, broken shoes, holes in our stockings. She lies awake at night thinking the most merciful thing of all would be to put the four boys in an orphanage so that she could go to England herself and find some type of work where she could bring us all over in a year for the better life. There might be bombs but she'd prefer bombs anytime to the shame of begging from this one and that one.\nNo, no matter what she can't bear the thought of putting us in the orphanage. That might be all right if you had the likes of Boys' Town in America with a nice priest like Spencer Tracy but you could never trust the Christian Brothers out in Glin who get their exercise beating boys and starving the life out of them.\nMam says there's nothing left but the Dispensary and the public assistance, the relief, and she's ashamed of her life to go and ask for it. It means you're at the end of your rope and maybe one level above tinkers, knackers and street beggars in general. It means you have to crawl before Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane and thank God the Dispensary is at the other end of Limerick so that people in our lane won't know we're getting the relief.\nShe knows from other women it's wise to be there early in the morning when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane might be in a good mood. If you go late in the morning they're liable to be cranky after seeing hundreds of men women and children sick and asking for help. She will take us with her to prove she has four children to feed. She gets us up early and tells us for once in our lives don't wash our faces, don't comb our hair, dress in any old rag. She tells me give my sore eyes a good rub and make them as red as I can for the worse you look at the Dispensary the more pity you get and the better your chances of getting the public assistance. She complains that Malachy Michael and Alphie look too healthy and you'd wonder why on this day of days they couldn't have their usual scabby knees or the odd cut bruise or black eye. If we meet anyone in the lane or the streets of Limerick we are not to tell them where we're going. She feels ashamed enough without telling the whole world and wait till her own mother hears.\nThere is a queue already outside the Dispensary. There are women like Mam with children in their arms, babies like Alphie, and children playing on the pavement. The women comfort the babies against the cold and scream at the ones playing in case they run into the street and get hit by a motor car or a bicycle. There are old men and women huddled\nagainst the wall talking to themselves or not talking at all. Mam warns us not to wander from her and we wait half an hour for the big door to open. A man tells us move inside in proper order and queue up before the platform, that Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane will be there in a minute when they finish their tea in the room beyond. A woman complains her children are freezing with the cold and couldn't Coffey and Kane bloody well hurry up with their tea. The man says she's a troublemaker but he won't take her name this time with the cold that's in the morning but if there's another word she'll be a sorry woman.\nMr. Coffey and Mr. Kane get up on the platform and pay no attention to the people. Mr. Kane puts on his glasses, takes them off, polishes them, puts them on, looks at the ceiling. Mr. Coffey reads papers, writes something, passes papers to Mr. Kane. They whisper to each other. They take their time. They don't look at us.\nThen Mr. Kane calls the first old man to the platform. What's your\nname?\nTimothy Creagh, sir.\nCreagh, hah? A fine old Limerick name you have there.\nI do, sir. Indeed I do.\nAnd what do you want, Creagh?\nAh, sure, I do be havin' them pains in me stomach again an' I'd\nlike to see Dr. Feeley.\nWell, now, Creagh, are you sure it's not the pints of porter that\nare going against your stomach.\nAh, no, indeed, sir. Sure I hardly touch the pint at all with the\npains. My wife is home in the bed and I have to take care of her too. There's great laziness in the world, Creagh. And Mr. Kane says to\nthe people on the queue, Did ye hear that, ladies? Great laziness, isn't there?\nAnd the women say, Oh, there is, indeed, Mr. Kane, great laziness. Mr. Creagh gets his docket to see the doctor, the queue moves ahead\nand Mr. Kane is ready for Mam.\nThe public assistance, is\n'Tis, Mr. Kane.\nAnd where's your husband?\nOh, he's in England, but-\nEngland, is it? And where\nthat what you want, woman, the relief?\nis the weekly telegram, the big five\npounds?\nHe didn't send us a penny in months, Mr. Kane.\nIs that a fact? Well, we know why, don't we? We know what the men\nof Ireland are up to in England. We know there's the occasional Limerickman seen trotting around with a Piccadilly tart, don't we?\nHe looks out at the people on the queue and they know they're supposed to say, We do, Mr. Kane, and they know they're supposed to smile and laugh or things will go hard with them when they reach the platform. They know he might turn them over to Mr. Coffey and he's notorious for saying no to everything.\nMam tells Mr. Kane that Dad is in Coventry and nowhere near Piccadilly and Mr. Kane takes off his glasses and stares at her. What's this? Are we having a little contradiction here?\nOh, no, Mr. Kane, God no.\nI want you to know, woman, that it is the policy here to give no relief to women with husbands in England. I want you to know you're\ntaking the bread from the mouths of more deserving people who stayed in this country to do their bit.\nOh, yes, Mr. Kane.\nAnd what's your name?\nMcCourt, sir.\nThat's not a Limerick name. Where did you get a name like that? My husband, sir. He's from the North.\nHe's from the North and he leaves you here to get the relief from\nthe Irish Free State. Is this what we fought for, is it? I don't know, sir.\nWhy don't you go up to Belfast and see what the Orangemen will do for you, ah?\nI don't know, sir.\nYou don't know. Of course you don't know. There's great ignorance in the world.\nHe looks out at the people, I said there's great ignorance in the world, and the people nod their heads and agree there's great ignorance in the world.\nHe whispers to Mr. Coffey and they look at Mam, they look at us. He tells Mam at last that she can have the public assistance but if she gets a single penny from her husband she's to drop all claims and give the money back to the Dispensary. She promises she will and we leave.\nWe follow her to Kathleen O'Connell's shop to get tea and bread and a few sods of turf for the fire. We climb the stairs to Italy and get the fire going and it's cozy when we have our tea. We're all very quiet, even the baby Alphie, because we know what Mr. Kane did to our mother.\nX\nIt's cold and wet down in Ireland but we're up in Italy. Mam says we should bring the poor Pope up to hang on the wall opposite the window. After all he's a friend of the workingman, he's Italian, and they're a warm weather people. Mam sits by the fire, shivering, and we know something is wrong when she makes no move for a cigarette. She says she feels a cold coming and she'd love to have a tarty drink, a lemonade. But there's no money in the house, not even for bread in the morning. She drinks tea and goes to bed.\nThe bed creaks all night with her twistings and turnings and she keeps us awake with her moaning for water. In the morning, she stays in bed, still shivering, and we keep quiet. If she sleeps long enough Malachy and I will be too late for school. Hours pass and still she makes no move and when I know it's well past school time I start the fire for the kettle. She stirs and calls for lemonade but I give her a jam jar of water. I ask her if she'd like some tea and she acts like a woman gone deaf. She looks flushed and it's odd she doesn't even mention cigarettes.\nWe sit quietly by the fire, Malachy, Michael, Alphie, myself. We drink our tea while Alphie chews the last bit of bread covered with sugar. He makes us laugh the way he smears the sugar all over his face and grins at us with his fat sticky cheeks. But we can't laugh too much or Mam will jump out of the bed and order Malachy and me off to school where we'll be killed for being late. We don't laugh long, there is no more bread and we're hungry, the four of us. We can get no more credit at\nO'Connell's shop. We can't go near Grandma, either. She yells at us all the time because Dad is from the North and he never sends money home from England where he is working in a munitions factory. Grandma says we could starve to death for all he cares. That would teach Mam a lesson for marrying a man from the North with sallow skin, an odd manner and a look of the Presbyterian about him.\nStill, I'll have to try Kathleen O'Connell once more. I'll tell her my mother is sick above in the bed, my brothers are starving and we'll all be dead for the want of bread.\nI put on my shoes and run quickly through the streets of Limerick to keep myself warm against the February frost. You can look in people's windows and see how cozy it is in their kitchens with fires glowing or ranges black and hot everything bright in the electric light cups and saucers on the tables with plates of sliced bread pounds of butter jars of jam smells of fried eggs and rashers coming through the windows enough to make the water run in your mouth and families sitting there digging in all smiling the mother crisp and clean in her apron everyone washed and the Sacred Heart of Jesus looking down on them from the wall suffering and sad but still happy with all that food and light and good Catholics at their breakfast.\nI try to find music in my own head but all I can find is my mother moaning for lemonade.\nLemonade. There's a van pulling away from South's pub leaving crates of beer and lemonade outside and there isn't a soul on the street. In a second I have two bottles of lemonade up under my jersey and I saunter away trying to look innocent.\nThere's a bread van outside Kathleen O'Connell's shop. The back door is open on shelves of steaming newly baked bread. The van driver is inside the shop having tea and a bun with Kathleen and it's no trouble for me to help myself to a loaf of bread. It's wrong to steal from Kathleen with the way she's always good to us but if I go in and ask her for bread she'll be annoyed and tell me I'm ruining her morning cup of tea, which she'd like to have in peace ease and comfort thank you. It's easier to stick the bread up under my jersey with the lemonade and promise to tell everything in confession.\nMy brothers are back in bed playing games under the overcoats but they jump when they see the bread. We tear at the loaf because we're too hungry to slice it and we make tea from this morning's leaves. When my mother stirs Malachy holds the lemonade bottle to her lips and she gasps till she finishes it. If she likes it that much I'll have to find more lemonade.\nWe put the last of the coal on the fire and sit around telling stories which we make up the way Dad did. I tell my brothers about my adventures with the lemonade and bread and I make up stories about how I was chased by pub owners and shopkeepers and how I ran into St. Joseph's Church where no one can follow you if you're a criminal, not even if you killed your own mother. Malachy and Michael look shocked over the way I got the bread and lemonade but then Malachy says it was only what Robin Hood would have done, rob the rich and give to the poor. Michael says I'm an outlaw and if they catch me they'll hang me from the highest tree in the People's Park the way outlaws are hanged in films at the Lyric Cinema. Malachy says I should make sure I'm in a state of grace because it might be hard to find a priest to come to my hanging. I tell him a priest would have to come to the hanging. That's what priests are for.\nRoddy McCorley had a priest and so did Kevin Barry. Malachy says there were no priests at the hanging of Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry because they're not mentioned in the songs and he starts singing the songs to prove it till my mother groans in the bed and says shut up.\nAlphie the baby is asleep on the floor by the fire. We put him into the bed with Mam so that he'll be warm though we don't want him to catch her disease and die. If she wakes up and finds him dead in the bed beside her there will be no end to the lamentations and she'll blame me on top of it.\nThe three of us get back into our own bed, huddling under the overcoats and trying not to roll into the hole in the mattress. It's pleasant there till Michael starts to worry over Alphie getting Mam's disease and me getting hanged for an outlaw. He says it isn't fair because that would leave him with only one brother and everyone in the world has brothers galore. He falls asleep from the worry and soon Malachy drifts off and I lie there thinking of jam. Wouldn't it be lovely to have another loaf of bread and a jar of strawberry jam or any kind of jam. I can't remember ever seeing a jam van making a delivery and I wouldn't want to be like Jesse James blasting my way into a shop demanding jam. That would surely lead to a hanging.\nThere's a cold sun coming through the window and I'm sure it must be warmer outside and wouldn't my brothers be surprised if they woke and found me there with more bread and jam. They'd gobble everything and then go on about my sins and the hanging.\nMam is still asleep though her face is red and there's a strangling sound when she snores.\nI have to be careful going through the street because it's a school day and if Guard Dennehy sees me he'll drag me off to school and Mr. O'Halloran will knock me all over the classroom. The guard is in charge of school attendance and he loves chasing you on his bicycle and dragging you off to school by the ear.\nThere's a box sitting outside the door of one of the big houses on Barrington Street. I pretend to knock on the door so that I can see what's in the box, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, cheese, tomatoes and, oh, God, a jar of marmalade. I can't shove all that under my jersey. Oh, God. Should I take the whole box? The people passing by pay me no attention. I might as well take the whole box. My mother would say you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I lift the box and try to look like a messenger boy making a delivery and no one says a word.\nMalachy and Michael are beside themselves when they see what's in the box and they're soon gobbling thick cuts of bread slathered with golden marmalade. Alphie has the marmalade all over his face and hair and a good bit on his legs and belly. We wash down the food with cold tea because we have no fire to heat it.\nMam mumbles again for lemonade and I give her half the second bottle to keep her quiet. She calls for more and I mix it with water to stretch it because I can't be spending my life running around lifting lemonade from pubs. We're having a fine time of it till Mam begins to rave in the bed about her lovely little daughter taken from her and her twin boys gone before they were three and why couldn't God take the rich for a change and is there any lemonade in the house? Michael wants to know if Mam will die and Malachy tells him you can't die till a priest comes. Then Michael wonders if we'll ever have a fire and hot tea again because he's freezing in the bed even with the overcoats left over from\nolden times. Malachy says we should go from house to house asking for turf and coal and wood and we could use Alphie's pram to carry the load. We should take Alphie with us because he's small and he smiles and people will see him and feel sorry for him and us. We try to wash all the dirt and lint and feathers and sticky marmalade but when we touch him with water he howls. Michael says he'll only get dirty again in the pram so what's the use of washing him. Michael is small but he's always saying remarkable things like that.\nWe push the pram out to the rich avenues and roads but when we knock on the doors the maids tell us go away or they'll call the proper authorities and it's a disgrace to be dragging a baby around in a wreck of a pram that smells to the heavens a filthy contraption that you wouldn't use to haul a pig to the slaughterhouse and this is a Catholic country where babies should be cherished and kept alive to hand down the faith from generation to generation. Malachy tells one maid to kiss his arse and she gives him such a clout the tears leap to his eyes and he says he'll never in his life ask the rich for anything again. He says there's no use asking anymore, that we should go around the backs of the houses and climb over the walls and take what we want. Michael can ring the front doorbells to keep the maids busy and Malachy and I can throw coal and turf over the walls and fill the pram all around Alphie.\nWe collect that way from three houses but then Malachy throws a piece of coal over a wall and hits Alphie and he starts screaming and we have to run forgetting Michael, still ringing doorbells and getting abuse from maids. Malachy says we should take the pram home first and then go back for Michael. We can't stop now with Alphie bawling and people giving us dirty looks and telling us we're a disgrace to our mother and Ireland in general.\nWhen we're back home it takes a while to dig Alphie out from under the load of coal and turf and he won't stop screaming till I give him bread and marmalade. I'm afraid Mam will leap from her bed but she only mumbles on about Dad and drink and babies dead.\nMalachy is back with Michael, with stories of his adventures ringing doorbells. One rich woman answered the door herself and invited him into the kitchen for cake and milk and bread and jam. She asked him all about his family and he told her his father had a big job in England but his mother is in the bed with a desperate disease and calling for lemonade morning noon and night. The rich woman wanted to know who was taking care of us and Michael bragged we were taking care of ourselves, that there was no shortage of bread and marmalade. The rich woman wrote down Michael's name and address and told him be a good boy and go home to his brothers and his mother in the bed.\nMalachy barks at Michael for being such a fool as to tell a rich woman anything. She'll go now and tell on us and before we know it we'll have the priests of the world banging on the door and disturbing us.\nThere's the banging on the door already. But it isn't a priest, it's Guard Dennehy. He calls up, Hello, hello, is anybody home? Are you there, Mrs. McCourt?\nMichael knocks on the window and waves at the guard. I give him a good kick for himself and Malachy thumps him on the head and he yells, I'll tell the guard. I'll tell the guard. They're killing me, guard. They're thumping and kicking.\nHe won't shut up and Guard Dennehy shouts at us to open the door. I call out the window and tell him I can't open the door because my mother is in bed with a terrible disease.\nWhere's your father?\nHe's in England.\nWell, I'm coming in to talk to your mother.\nYou can't. You can't. She has the disease. We all have the disease.\nIt might be the typhoid. It might be the galloping consumption. We're getting spots already. The baby has a lump. It could kill.\nHe pushes in the door and climbs the stairs to Italy just as Alphie crawls out from under the bed covered with marmalade and dirt. He looks at him and my mother and us, takes off his cap and scratches his head. He says, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, this is a desperate situation. How did your mother get sick like that?\nI tell him he shouldn't go near her and when Malachy says we might not be able to go to school for ages the guard says we'll go to school no matter what, that we're on the earth to go to school the way he's on the earth to make sure we go to school. He wants to know if we have any relations and he sends me off to tell Grandma and Aunt Aggie to come to our house.\nThey scream at me and tell me I'm filthy. I try to explain that Mam has the disease and I'm worn out trying to make ends meet, keeping the home fires burning, getting lemonade for Mam and bread for my brothers. There's no use telling them about the marmalade for they'll only scream again. There's no use telling them about the nastiness of rich people and their maids.\nThey push me all the way back to the lane, barking at me and disgracing me on the streets of Limerick. Guard Dennehy is still scratching his poll. He says, Look at this, a disgrace. You wouldn't see the likes of this in Bombay or the Bowery of New York itself.\nGrandma is wailing at my mother, Mother o' God, Angela, what's up with you in the bed? What did they do to you?\nMy mother runs her tongue over her dry lips and gasps for more lemonade.\nShe wants lemonade, says Michael, and we got it for her and bread and marmalade and we're all outlaws now. Frankie was the first outlaw till we went raiding for coal all over Limerick.\nGuard Dennehy looks interested and takes Michael downstairs by the hand and in a few minutes we hear him laughing. Aunt Aggie says that's a disgraceful way to behave with my mother sick in the bed. The guard comes back and tells her go for a doctor. He keeps covering his face with his cap whenever he looks at me or my brothers. Desperadoes, he says, desperadoes.\nThe doctor comes with Aunt Aggie in his motor car and he has to rush my mother to the hospital with her pneumonia. We'd all like to go riding in the doctor's car but Aunt Aggie says, No, ye are all coming to my house till yeer mother comes home from the hospital.\nI tell her not to bother. I'm eleven and I can easily look after my brothers. I'd be glad to stay at home from school and make sure everyone is fed and washed. But Grandma screams I will do no such a thing and Aunt Aggie gives me a thump for myself. Guard Dennehy says I'm too young yet to be an outlaw and a father but I have a promising future in both departments.\nGet your clothes, says Aunt Aggie, ye are coming to my house till yeer mother is out of the hospital. Jesus above, that baby is a disgrace.\nShe finds a rag and ties it around Alphie's bottom for fear he might shit all over the pram. Then she looks at us and wants to know why we're standing there with our faces hanging out after she told us get our clothes. I'm afraid she'll hit me or yell at me when I tell her it's all right, we have our clothes, they're on us. She stares at me and shakes her head. Here, she says, put some sugar and water in the child's bottle. She tells me I have to push Alphie through the streets, she can't manage the pram with that bockety wheel that makes it rock back and forth and besides 'tis a disgraceful looking object she'd be ashamed to put a mangy dog in. She takes the three old coats from our bed and piles them on the pram till you can hardly see Alphie at all.\nGrandma comes with us and barks at me all the way from Roden Lane to Aunt Aggie's flat in Windmill Street. Can't you push that pram properly? Jesus, you're going to kill that child. Stop goin' from side to side or I'll give you a good clitther on the gob. She won't come into Aunt Aggie's flat. She can't stand the sight of us one more minute. She's fed up with the whole McCourt clan from the days when she had to send six fares to bring us all back from America, dishing out more money for funerals for dead children, giving us food every time our father drank the dole or the wages, helping Angela carry on while that blaguard from the North drinks his wages all over England. Oh, she's fed up, so she is, and off she goes across Henry Street with her black shawl pulled up around her white head, limping along in her black high laced boots.\nWhen you're eleven and your brothers are ten, five and one, you don't know what to do when you go to someone's house even if she's your mother's sister. You're told to leave the pram in the hall and bring the baby into the kitchen but if it's not your house you don't know what to do once you get into the kitchen for fear the aunt will yell at you or hit you on the skull. She takes off her coat and takes it to the bedroom and you stand with the baby in your arms waiting to be told. If you take one step forward or one step to the side she might come out and say where are you going and you don't know what to answer because you don't know yourself. If you say anything to your brothers she might say who do you think you're talking to in my kitchen? We have to stand and be quiet and that's hard when there's a tinkling sound from the bedroom and we know she's on the chamber pot peeing away. I don't want to look at Malachy. If I do I'll smile and he'll smile and Michael will smile and there's danger we'll start laughing and if we do we won't be able to stop for days at the picture in our heads of Aunt Aggie's big white bum perched on a flowery little chamber pot. I'm able to control myself. I won't laugh. Malachy and Michael won't laugh and it's easy to see we're all proud of ourselves for not laughing and getting into trouble with Aunt Aggie till Alphie in my arms smiles and says Goo goo and that sets us off. The three of us burst out laughing and Alphie grins with his dirty face and says Goo goo again till we're helpless and Aunt Aggie roars out of the room pulling her dress down and gives me a thump on the head that sends me against the wall baby and all. She hits Malachy too and she tries to hit Michael but he runs to the other side of her round table and she can't get at him. Come over here, she says, and I'll wipe that grin off your puss, but Michael keeps running around the table and she's too fat to catch him. I'll get you later, she says, I'll warm your arse, and you, Lord Muck, she says to me, put that child down on the floor over there by\nthe range. She puts the old coats from the pram on the floor and Alphie lies there with his sugary water and says Goo goo and smiles. She tells us take off every scrap of our clothes, get out to the tap in the backyard and scrub every inch of our bodies. We are not to come back into this house till we're spotless. I want to tell her it's the middle of February, it's freezing outside, we could all die, but I know if I open my mouth I might die right here on the kitchen floor.\nWe're out in the yard naked dousing ourselves with icy water from the tap. She opens the kitchen window and throws out a scrub brush and a big bar of brown soap like the one they used on Finn the Horse. She orders us to scrub each other's backs and don't stop till she tells us. Michael says his hands and feet are falling off with the cold but she doesn't care. She keeps telling us we're still dirty and if she has to come out to scrub us we'll rue the day. Another rue. I scrub myself harder. We all scrub till we're pink and our jaws chatter. It's not enough for Aunt Aggie. She comes out with a bucket and sloshes cold water all over us. Now, she says, get inside and dry yeerselves. We stand in the little shed next to her kitchen drying ourselves with one towel. We stand and shiver and wait because you can't go marching into her kitchen till she tells you. We hear her inside starting the fire, rattling the poker in the range, then yelling at us, Are ye goin' to stand in there all day? Come in here and put on yeer clothes.\nShe gives us mugs of tea and cuts of fried bread and we sit at the table eating quietly because you're not supposed to say a word unless she tells you. Michael asks her for a second cut of fried bread and we expect her to knock him off the chair for his cheek but she just grumbles, 'Tis far from two cuts of fried bread ye were brought up, and gives each of us another cut. She tries to feed Alphie bread soaked in tea but he won't eat it till she sprinkles it with sugar and when he's finished he smiles and pees all over her lap and we're delighted. She runs out to the shed to dab at herself with a towel and we're able to grin at each other at the table and tell Alphie he's the champion baby in the world. Uncle Pa Keating comes in the door all black from his job at the gas works. Oh, bejay, he says, what's this?\nMichael says, My mother is in the hospital, Uncle Pa. Is that so? What's up with her?\nPneumonia, says Malachy.\nWell, now, that's better than oldmonia.\nWe don't know what he's laughing at and Aunt Aggie comes in from the shed and tells him how Mam is in the hospital and we're to stay with them till she gets out. He says, Grand, grand, and goes to the shed to wash himself though when he comes back you'd never know he touched himself with water at all he's that black.\nHe sits at the table and Aunt Aggie gives him his supper, which is fried bread and ham and sliced tomatoes. She tells us get away from the table and stop gawking at him having his tea and tells him to stop giving us bits of ham and tomato. He says, Arrah, for Jaysus sake, Aggie, the children are hungry, and she says, 'Tis none of your business. They're not yours. She tells us go out and play and be home for bed by half-past eight. We know it's freezing outside and we'd like to stay in by that warm range but it's easier to be in the streets playing than inside with Aunt Aggie and her nagging.\nShe calls me in later and sends me upstairs to borrow a rubber sheet from a woman who had a child that died. The woman says tell your\naunt I'd like that rubber sheet back for the next child. Aunt Aggie says, Twelve years ago that child died and she still keeps the rubber sheet. Forty-five she is now and if there's another child we'll have to look for a star in the East. Malachy says, What's that? and she tells him mind his own business, he's too young.\nAunt Aggie places the rubber sheet on her bed and puts Alphie on it between herself and Uncle Pa. She sleeps inside against the wall and Uncle Pa outside because he has to get up in the morning for work. We are to sleep on the floor against the opposite wall with one coat under us and two over. She says if she hears a word out of us during the night she'll warm our arses and we're to be up early in the morning because it's Ash Wednesday and it wouldn't do us any harm to go to Mass and pray for our poor mother and her pneumonia.\nThe alarm clock shocks us out of our sleep. Aunt Aggie calls from her bed, The three of ye are to get up and go to Mass. Do ye hear me? Up. Wash yeer faces and go to the Jesuits.\nHer backyard is all frost and ice and our hands sting from the tap water. We throw a little on our faces and dry with the towel that's still damp from yesterday. Malachy whispers our wash was a lick and a promise, that's what Mam would say.\nThe streets are frosty and icy, too, but the Jesuit church is warm. It must be grand to be a Jesuit, sleeping in a bed with sheets blankets pillows and getting up to a nice warm house and a warm church with nothing to do but say Mass hear confessions and yell at people for their sins have your meals served up to you and read your Latin office before you go to sleep. I'd like to be a Jesuit some day but there's no hope of that when you grow up in a lane. Jesuits are very particular. They don't like poor people. They like people with motor cars who stick out their little fingers when they pick up their teacups.\nThe church is crowded with people at seven o'clock Mass getting the ashes on their foreheads. Malachy whispers that Michael shouldn't get the ashes because he won't be making his First Communion till May and it would be a sin. Michael starts to cry, I want the ashes, I want the ashes. An old woman behind us says, What are ye doin' to that lovely child? Malachy explains the lovely child never made his First Communion and he's not in a state of grace. Malachy is getting ready for Confirmation himself, always showing off his knowledge of the catechism, always going on about state of grace. He won't admit I knew all about the state of grace a year ago, so long ago I'm starting to forget it. The old woman says you don't have to be in a state of grace to get a few ashes on your forehead and tells Malachy stop tormenting his poor little brother. She pats Michael on the head and tells him he's a lovely child and go up there and get your ashes. He runs to the altar and when he comes back the woman gives him a penny to go with his ashes.\nAunt Aggie is still in the bed with Alphie. She tells Malachy to fill Alphie's bottle with milk and bring it to him. She tells me to start the fire in the range, that there's paper and wood in a box and coal in the coal scuttle. If the fire won't start sprinkle it with a little paraffin oil. The fire is slow and smoky and I sprinkle it with the paraffin oil, it flares up, whoosh, and nearly takes my eyebrows off. There is smoke everywhere and Aunt Aggie rushes into the kitchen. She shoves me away from the range. Jesus above, can't you do anything right? You're supposed to open the damper, you eejit.\nI don't know anything about dampers. In our house we have a fireplace in Ireland downstairs and a fireplace in Italy upstairs and no sign of a damper. Then you go to your aunt's house and you're supposed to know all about dampers. There's no use telling her this is the first time you ever lit a fire in a range. She'll just give you another thump on the skull and send you flying. It's hard to know why grown people get so angry over little things like dampers. When I'm a man I won't go around thumping small children over dampers or anything else. Now she yells at me, Look at Lord Muck standing there. Would you ever think of opening the window and letting out the smoke? Of course you wouldn't. You have a puss on you like your father from the North. Do you think now you can boil the water for the tea without burning the house down?\nShe cuts three slices from a loaf, smears them with margarine for us and goes back to bed. We have the tea and bread and it's one morning we're glad to go to school where it's warm and there are no yelling aunts.\nAfter school she tells me sit at the table and write my father a letter about Mam in the hospital and how we're all at Aunt Aggie's till Mam comes home. I'm to tell him we're all happy and in the best of health, send money, food is very dear, growing boys eat a lot, ha ha, Alphie the baby needs clothes and nappies.\nI don't know why she's always angry. Her flat is warm and dry. She has electric light in the house and her own lavatory in the backyard. Uncle Pa has a steady job and he brings home his wages every Friday. He drinks his pints at South's pub but never comes home singing songs of Ireland's long woeful history. He says, A pox on all their houses, and he says the funniest thing in the world is that we all have arses that have to be wiped and no man escapes that. The minute a politician or a Pope starts his blather Uncle Pa thinks of him wiping his arse. Hitler and Roosevelt and Churchill all wipe their arses. De Valera, too. He says the only people you can trust in that department are the Mahommedans for they eat with one hand and wipe with the other. The human hand itself is a sneaky bugger and you never know what it's been up to.\nThere are good times with Uncle Pa when Aunt Aggie goes to the Mechanics' Institute to play cards, forty-five. He says, To hell with the begrudgers. He gets himself two bottles of stout from South's, six buns and a half pound of ham from the shop on the corner. He makes tea and we sit by the range drinking it, eating our ham sandwiches and buns and laughing over Uncle Pa and the way he goes on about the world. He says, I swallowed the gas, I drink the pint, I don't give a fiddler's fart about the world and its cousin. If little Alphie gets tired and cranky and cries Uncle Pa pulls his shirt back from his chest and tells him, Here, have a suck of diddy momma. The sight of that flat chest and the nipple shocks Alphie and makes him good again.\nBefore Aunt Aggie comes home we have to wash the mugs and clean up so she won't know we were stuffing ourselves with buns and ham sandwiches. She'd nag Uncle Pa for a month if she ever found out and that's what I don't understand. Why does he let her nag him like that? He went to the Great War, he was gassed, he's big, he has a job, he makes the world laugh. It's a mystery. That's what the priests and the masters tell you, everything is a mystery and you have to believe what you're told.\nI could easily have Uncle Pa for a father. We'd have great times sitting by the fire in the range drinking tea and laughing over the way he farts and says, Light a match. That's a present from the Germans.\nAunt Aggie torments me all the time. She calls me scabby eyes. She says I'm the spitting image of my father, I have the odd manner, I have the sneaky air of a northern Presbyterian, I'll probably grow up and build an altar to Oliver Cromwell himself, I'll run off and marry an English tart and cover my house with pictures of the royal family.\nI want to get away from her and I can think of only one way, to make myself sick and go to the hospital. I get up in the middle of the night and go to her backyard. I can pretend I'm going to the lavatory. I stand out in the open in the freezing weather and hope I'll catch pneumonia or the galloping consumption so that I'll go to the hospital with the nice clean sheets and the meals in the bed and books brought by the girl in the blue dress. I might meet another Patricia Madigan and learn a long poem. I stand in the backyard for ages in my shirt and bare feet looking up at the moon which is a ghostly galleon riding upon cloudy seas and go back to bed shivering hoping I'll wake up in the morning with a terrible cough and flushed cheeks. But I don't. I feel fresh and lively and I'd be in great form if I could be at home with my mother and brothers.\nThere are days when Aunt Aggie tells us she can't stand the sight of us another minute, Get away from me. Here, scabby eyes, take Alphie out in his pram, take your brothers, go to the park and play, do anything ye like and don't come back till teatime when the Angelus is ringing, not a minute later, do ye hear me, not a minute later. It's cold but we don't care. We push the pram up O'Connell Avenue out to Ballinacurra or the Rosbrien Road. We let Alphie crawl around in fields to look at cows and sheep and we laugh when the cows nuzzle him. I get under the cows and squirt the milk into Alphie's mouth till he's full and throws it up. Farmers chase us till they see how small Michael and Alphie are. Malachy laughs at the farmers. He says, Hit me now with the child in me arms. Then he has a great notion, Why can't we go to our own house and play a while? We find twigs and bits of wood in the fields and rush to Roden Lane. There are matches by the fireplace in Italy and we have a good fire going in no time. Alphie falls asleep and soon the rest of us drift off till the Angelus booms out of the Redemptorist church and we know we're in trouble with Aunt Aggie for being late.\nWe don't care. She can yell at us all she wants but we had a grand time out the country with the cows and the sheep and then the lovely fire above in Italy.\nYou can tell she never has grand times like that. Electric light and a lavatory but no grand times.\nGrandma comes for her on Thursdays and Sundays and they take the bus to the hospital to see Mam. We can't go because children are not allowed and if we say, How's Mam? they look cranky and tell us she's all right, she'll live. We'd like to know when she's getting out of hospital so that we can all go back home but we're afraid to open our mouths.\nMalachy tells Aunt Aggie one day he's hungry and could he have a piece of bread. She hits him with a rolled up Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart and there are tears on his eyelashes. He doesn't come home from school the next day and he's still gone at bedtime. Aunt Aggie says, Well, I suppose he ran away. Good riddance. If he was hungry he'd be here. Let him find comfort in a ditch.\nNext day Michael runs in from the street, Dad's here, Dad's here, and runs back out and there's Dad sitting on the hall floor hugging Michael, crying, Your poor mother, your poor mother, and there's a smell of drink on him. Aunt Aggie is smiling, Oh, you're here, and she makes tea and eggs and sausages. She sends me out for a bottle of stout for Dad and I wonder why she's so pleasant and generous all of a sudden. Michael says, Are we going to our own house, Dad?\nWe are, son.\nAlphie is back in the pram with the three old coats and coal and wood for the fire. Aunt Aggie stands at her door and tells us be good boys, come back for tea anytime, and there's a bad word for her in my head, Oul' bitch. It's in my head and I can't help it and I'll have to tell the priest in confession.\nMalachy isn't in a ditch, he's there in our own house eating fish and chips a drunken soldier dropped at the gate of the Sarsfield Barracks.\nMam comes home in two days. She's weak and white and walks slowly. She says, The doctor told me keep warm, have plenty of rest and nourishing food, meat and eggs three times a week. God help us, those poor doctors don't have a notion of not having. Dad makes tea and toasts bread for her on the fire. He fries bread for the rest of us and we have a lovely night up in Italy where it's warm. He says he can't stay forever, he has to go back to work in Coventry. Mam wonders how he'll get to Coventry without a penny in his pocket. He's up early on Holy Saturday and I have tea with him by the fire. He fries four cuts of bread and wraps them in pages of the Limerick Chronicle, two cuts in each coat pocket. Mam is still in bed and he calls to her from the bottom of the stairs, I'm going now. She says, All right. Write when you land. My father is going to England and she won't even get out of the bed. I ask if I can go with him to the railway station. No, he's not going there. He's going to the Dublin road to see if he can get a lift. He pats my head, tells me take care of my mother and brothers and goes out the door. I watch him go up the lane till he turns the corner. I run up the lane to see him go down Barrack Hill and down St. Joseph's Street. I run down the hill and follow him as far as I can. He must know I'm following him because he turns and calls to me, Go home, Francis. Go home to your mother.\nIn a week there's a letter to say he arrived safely, that we are to be good boys, attend to our religious duties and above all obey our mother. In another week there's a telegram money order for three pounds and we're in heaven. We'll be rich, there will be fish and chips, jelly and custard, films every Saturday at the Lyric, the Coliseum, the Carlton, the Atheneum, the Central and the fanciest of all, the Savoy. We might even wind up having tea and cakes at the Savoy Caf\u00e9 with the nobs and toffs of Limerick. We'll be sure to hold our teacups with our little fingers sticking out.\nThe next Saturday there's no telegram nor the Saturday after nor any Saturday forever. Mam begs again at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and smiles at the Dispensary when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane have their bit of a joke about Dad having a tart in Piccadilly. Michael wants to know what a tart is and she tells him it's something you have with tea. She spends most of the day by the fire with Bridey Hannon puffing on her Woodlbines, drinking weak tea. The bread crumbs from the morning are always on the table when we come home from school. She never washes the\njam jars or mugs and there are flies in the sugar and wherever there is sweetness.\nShe says Malachy and I have to take turns looking after Alphie, taking him out in the pram for a bit of fresh air. The child can't be kept in Italy from October to April. If we tell her we want to play with our pals she might let fly with a right cross to the head that stings the ears.\nWe play games with Alphie and the pram. I stand at the top of Barrack Hill and Malachy is at the bottom. When I give the pram a push down the hill Malachy is supposed to stop it but he's looking at a pal on roller skates and it speeds by him across the street and through the doors of Leniston's pub where men are having a peaceful pint and not expecting a pram with a dirty faced child saying Goo goo goo goo. The barman shouts this is a disgrace, there must be a law against this class of behavior, babies roaring through the door in bockety prams, he'll call the guards on us, and Alphie waves at him and smiles and he says, all right, all right, the child can have a sweet and a lemonade, the brothers can have lemonade too, that raggedy pair, and God above, 'tis a hard world, the minute you think you're getting ahead a pram comes crashing through the door and you're dishing out sweets and lemonade right and left, the two of ye take that child and go home to yeer mother.\nMalachy has another powerful idea, that we could go around Limerick like tinkers pushing Alphie in his pram into pubs for the sweets and lemonade, but I don't want Mam finding out and hitting me with her right cross. Malachy says I'm not a sport and runs off. I push the pram over to Henry Street and up by the Redemptorist church. It's a gray day, the church is gray and the small crowd of people outside the door of the priests' house is gray. They're waiting to beg for any food left over from the priests' dinner.\nThere in the middle of the crowd in her dirty gray coat is my mother.\nThis is my own mother, begging. This is worse than the dole, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Dispensary. It's the worst kind of shame, almost as bad as begging on the streets where the tinkers hold up their scabby children, Give us a penny for the poor child, mister, the poor child is hungry, missus.\nMy mother is a beggar now and if anyone from the lane or my school sees her the family will be disgraced entirely. My pals will make up new names and torment me in the schoolyard and I know what they'll say, Frankie McCourt beggar woman's boy scabby-eyed dancing blubber-gob Jap.\nThe door of the priests' house swings open and the people rush with their hands out. I can hear them, Brother, brother, here, brother, ah, for the love o' God, brother. Five children at home, brother. I can see my own mother pushed along. I can see the tightness of her mouth when she snatches at a bag and turns from the door and I push the pram up the street before she can see me.\nI don't want to go home anymore. I push the pram down to the Dock Road, out to Corkanree where all the dust and garbage of Limerick is dumped and burned. I stand a while and look at boys chase rats. I don't know why they have to torture rats that are not in their houses. I'd keep going on into the country forever if I didn't have Alphie bawling with the hunger, kicking his chubby legs, waving his empty bottle.\nMam has the fire going and something boiling in a pot. Malachy smiles and says she brought home corned beef and a few spuds from\nKathleen O'Connell's shop. He wouldn't be so happy if he knew he was the son of a beggar. She calls us in from the lane and when we sit at the table it's hard for me to look at my mother the beggar. She lifts the pot to the table, spoons out the potatoes one each and uses a fork to lift out the corned beef.\nIt isn't corned beef at all. It's a great lump of quivering gray fat and the only sign of corned beef is a little nipple of red meat on top. We stare at that bit of meat and wonder who will get it. Mam says, That's for Alphie. He's a baby, he's growing fast, he needs it. She puts it on a saucer in front of him. He pushes it away with his finger, then pulls it back. He lifts it to his mouth, looks around the kitchen, sees Lucky the dog and throws it to him.\nThere's no use saying anything. The meat is gone. We eat our potatoes with plenty of salt and I eat my fat and pretend it's that nipple of red meat.\nXI\nMam warns us, Ye are to keep yeer paws out of that trunk for there's nothing in there that's of the slightest interest or any of yeer business.\nAll she has in that trunk is a lot of papers, certificates of birth and baptism, her Irish passport, Dad's English passport from Belfast, our American passports and her bright red flapper dress with spangles and black frills she brought all the way from America. She wants to keep that dress forever to remind herself she was young and dancing.\nI don't care what she has in the trunk till I start a football team with Billy Campbell and Malachy. We can't afford uniforms or boots and Billy says, How will the world know who we are? We don't even have a name.\nI remember the red dress and a name comes to me, The Red Hearts of Limerick. Mam never opens the trunk so what does it matter if I cut off a piece of the dress to make seven red hearts we can stick on our chests? What you don't know won't bother you, she always says herself.\nThe dress is buried under the papers. I look at my passport picture when I was small and I can see why they call me Jap. There's a paper that says Marriage Certificate, that Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan were joined in Holy Matrimony on the twenty-eighth of March, 1930. How could that be? I was born on the nineteenth of August and Billy Campbell told me the father and mother have to be married nine months before there's a sign of a child. Here I am born into the world in half the time. That means I must be a miracle and I might grow up to be a saint with people celebrating the feast of St. Francis of Limerick.\nI'll have to ask Mikey Molloy, still the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.\nBilly says if we're to be great soccer players we have to practice and we're to meet over in the park. The boys complain when I hand out the hearts and I tell them if they don't like it they can go home and cut up their own mother's dresses and blouses.\nWe have no money for a proper ball so one of the boys brings a sheep's bladder stuffed with rags. We kick the bladder up and down the meadow till there are holes and rags start falling out and we get fed up\nkicking a bladder that's hardly there anymore. Billy says we're to meet tomorrow morning which is Saturday and go out Ballinacurra to see if we can challenge rich Crescent College boys to a proper game, seven a side. He says we're to pin our red hearts to our shirts even if they're red rags.\nMalachy is going home for tea but I can't go because I have to see Mikey Molloy and find out why I was born in half the time. Mikey is coming out of his house with his father, Peter. It's Mikey's sixteenth birthday and his father is taking him to Bowles's pub for his first pint. Nora Molloy is inside screeching after Peter that if they go they can stay gone, she's done baking bread, she's never going to the lunatic asylum again, if he brings that child home drunk she'll go to Scotland and disappear from the face of the earth.\nPeter tells Mikey, Pay no attention to her, Cyclops. The mothers of Ireland are always enemies of the first pint. My own mother tried to kill my father with a frying pan when he took me for the first pint.\nMikey asks Peter if I can come with them and have a lemonade.\nPeter tells everyone in the pub that Mikey is there for his first pint and when all the men want to stand Mikey a pint Peter says, Ah, no, 'twould be a terrible thing if he had too much and turned against it entirely.\nThe pints are drawn and we sit against the wall, the Molloys with their pints and I with my lemonade. The men wish Mikey all the best in the life to come and wasn't it a gift from God that he fell off that spout years ago and never had the fit since and wasn't it a great pity about that poor little bugger, Quasimodo Dooley, carried off with the consumption after all his trouble talking for years like an Englishman so he could be on the BBC which is no fit place for an Irishman anyway.\nPeter is talking to the men and Mikey, sipping his first pint, whispers to me, I don't think I like it, but don't tell my father. Then he tells me how he practices the English accent in secret so that he can be a BBC announcer, Quasimodo's dream. He tells me I can have Cuchulain back, that he's no use to you when you're reading the news on the BBC. Now that he's sixteen he wants to go to England and if ever I get a wireless that will be him on the BBC Home Service.\nI tell him about the marriage certificate, how Billy Campbell said it has to be nine months but I was born in half the time and would he know if I was some class of a miracle.\nNaw, he says, naw. You're a bastard. You're doomed.\nYou don't have to be cursing me, Mikey.\nI'm not. That's what they call people who aren't born inside the\nnine months of the marriage, people conceived beyond the blanket. What's that?\nWhat's what?\nConceived.\nThat's when the sperm hits the egg and it grows and there you are\nnine months later.\nI don't know what you're talking about.\nHe whispers, The thing between your legs is the excitement. I don't\nlike the other names, the dong, the prick, the dick, the langer. So your father shoves his excitement into your mother and there's a spurt and these little germs go up into your mother where there's an egg and that grows into you.\nI'm not an egg.\nYou are an egg. Everyone was an egg once.\nWhy am I doomed? 'Tisn't my fault I'm a bastard.\nAll bastards are doomed. They're like babies that weren't baptized.\nThey're sent to Limbo for eternity and there's no way out and it's not their fault. It makes you wonder about God up there on His throne with no mercy for the little unbaptized babies. That's why I don't go near the chapel anymore. Anyway, you're doomed. Your father and mother had the excitement and they weren't married so you're not in a state of grace.\nWhat am I going to do?\nNothing. You're doomed.\nCan't I light a candle or something.\nYou could try the Blessed Virgin. She's in charge of the doom.\nBut I don't have a penny for the candle.\nAll right, all right, here's a penny. You can give it back when you\nget a job a million years from now. 'Tis costing me a fortune to be the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.\nThe barman is doing a crossword puzzle and he says to Peter, What's the opposite of advance?\nRetreat, says Peter.\nThat's it, says the barman. Everything has an opposite. Mother o' God, says Peter.\nWhat's up with you, Peter? says the barman.\nWhat was that you said before, Tommy?\nEverything has an opposite.\nMother o' God.\nAre you all right, Peter? Is the pint all right?\nThe pint is grand, Tommy, and I'm the champion of all pint\ndrinkers, amn't I?\nBegod an' you are, Peter. No denyin' that to you.\nThat means I could be the champion in the opposite department. What are you talking about, Peter?\nI could be the champion of no pints at all.\nAh, now, Peter, I think you're going a bit far. Is the wife all\nright at home?\nTommy, take this pint away from me. I'm the champion of no pints at\nall.\nPeter turns and takes the glass from Mikey. We're going home to\nyour mother, Mikey.\nYou didn't call me Cyclops, Dad.\nYou're Mikey. You're Michael. We're going to England. No more pints\nfor me, no pints for you, no more bread baking for your mother. Come on. We're leaving the pub and Tommy the barman calls after us, You know\nwhat 'tis, Peter. 'Tis all them bloody books you're reading. They have your head destroyed.\nPeter and Mikey turn to go home. I have to go to St. Joseph's to light the candle that will save me from the doom but I look in the window of Counihan's shop and there in the middle is a great slab of Cleeves' toffee and a sign, TWO PIECES FOR A PENNY. I know I'm doomed but the water is running along the sides of my tongue and when I put my penny on the counter for Miss Counihan I promise the Virgin Mary the next penny I get I'll be lighting a candle and would she please talk to her Son and delay the doom for awhile.\nA penn'orth of Cleeves' toffee doesn't last forever and when it's gone I have to think of going home to a mother who let my father push his\nexcitement into her so that I could be born in half the time and grow up to be a bastard. If she ever says a word about the red dress or anything I'll tell her I know all about the excitement and she'll be shocked.\nSaturday morning I meet The Red Hearts of Limerick and we wander out the road looking for a football challenge. The boys are still grousing that the bits of red dress don't look like hearts till Billy tells them if they don't want to play football go home and play with their sisters' dolls.\nThere are boys playing football in a field in Ballinacurra and Billy challenges them. They have eight players and we have only seven but we don't mind because one of them has one eye and Billy tells us stay on his blind side. Besides, he says, Frankie McCourt is nearly blind with his two bad eyes and that's worse. They're all togged out in blue and white jerseys and white shorts and proper football boots. One of them says we look like something the cat brought in and Malachy has to be held back from fighting them. We agree to play half an hour because the Ballinacurra boys say they have to go to lunch. Lunch. The whole world has dinner in the middle of the day but they have lunch. If no one scores in half an hour it's a draw. We play back and forth till Billy gets the ball and goes speeding and dancing up the sideline so fast no one can catch him and in goes the ball for a goal. The half hour is nearly up but the Ballinacurra boys want another half hour and they manage to score well into the second half hour. Then the ball goes over the line for touch. It's our ball. Billy stands on the touch line with the ball over his head. He pretends to look at Malachy but throws the ball to me. It comes to me as if it's the only thing that exists in the whole world. It comes straight to my foot and all I have to do is swivel to the left and swing that ball straight into the goal. There's a whiteness in my head and I feel like a boy in heaven. I'm floating over the whole field till The Red Hearts of Limerick clap me on the back and tell me that was a great goal, Frankie, you too, Billy.\nWe walk back along O'Connell Avenue and I keep thinking of the way the ball came to my foot and surely it was sent by God or the Blessed Virgin Mary who would never send such a blessing to one doomed for being born in half the time and I know as long as I live I'll never forget that ball coming from Billy Campbell, that goal.\nMam meets Bridey Hannon and her mother going up the lane and they tell her about Mr. Hannon's poor legs. Poor John, it's a trial for him to cycle home every night after delivering coal and turf all day on the great float for the coal merchants on the Dock Road. He's paid from eight in the morning till half five in the evening though he has to get the horse ready well before eight and settle him for the night well after half five. He's up and down on that float all day hoisting bags of coal and turf, desperate to keep the bandages in place on his legs so the dirt won't get into the open sores. The bandages are forever sticking and have to be ripped away and when he comes home she washes the sores with warm water and soap, covers them with ointment and wraps them in clean bandages. They can't afford new bandages every day so she keeps washing the old ones over and over till they're gray.\nMam says Mr. Hannon should see the doctor and Mrs. Hannon says, Sure, he seen the doctor a dozen times and the doctor says he has to stay off them legs. That's all. Stay off them legs. Sure how can he stay off them legs? He has to work. What would we live on if he didn't work?\nMam says maybe Bridey could get some kind of a job herself and Bridey is offended. Don't you know I have a weak chest, Angela? Don't you know I had rheumatic fever an' I could go at any time? I have to be careful.\nMam often talks about Bridey and her rheumatic fever and weak chest. She says, That one is able to sit here by the hour and complain about her ailments but it doesn't stop her from puffing away on the Woodbines.\nMam tells Bridey she's very sorry over the weak chest and it's terrible the way her father suffers. Mrs. Hannon tells my mother that John is getting worse every day, And what would you think, Mrs. McCourt, if your boy Frankie went on the float with him a few hours a week and helped him with the bags? We can barely afford it but Frankie could earn a shilling or two and John could rest his poor legs.\nMam says, I don't know, he's only eleven and he had that typhoid and the coal dust wouldn't be good for his eyes.\nBridey says, He'd be out in the air and there's nothing like fresh air for someone with bad eyes or getting over the typhoid, isn't that right, Frankie?\n'Tis, Bridey.\nI'm dying to go around with Mr. Hannon on the great float like a real workingman. If I'm good at it they might let me stay at home from school forever but Mam says, He can do it as long as it doesn't interfere with school and he can start on a Saturday morning.\nI'm a man now so I light the fire early on Saturday morning and make my own tea and fried bread. I wait next door for Mr. Hannon to come out with his bicycle and there's a lovely smell of rashers and eggs coming through the window. Mam says Mr. Hannon gets the best of food because Mrs. Hannon is as mad about him as she was the day she married him. They're like two lovers out of an American film the way they go on. Here he is pushing the bicycle and puffing away on the pipe in his mouth. He tells me climb up on the bar of his bike and off we go to my first job as a man. His head is over mine on the bike and the smell of the pipe is lovely. There's a coal smell on his clothes and that makes me sneeze.\nMen are walking or cycling toward the coal yards and Rank's Flour Mills and the Limerick Steamship Company on the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon takes his pipe from his mouth and tells me this is the best morning of all, Saturday, half day. We'll start at eight and be finished by the time the Angelus rings at twelve.\nFirst we get the horse ready, give him a bit of a rub, fill the wooden tub with oats and the bucket with water. Mr. Hannon shows me how to put on the harness and lets me back the horse into the shafts of the float. He says, Jaysus, Frankie, you have the knack of it.\nThat makes me so happy I want to jump up and down and drive a float the rest of my life.\nThere are two men filling bags with coal and turf and weighing them on the great iron scale, a hundredweight in each bag. It's their job to stack the bags on the float while Mr. Hannon goes to the office for the delivery dockets. The bag men are fast and we're ready for our rounds. Mr. Hannon sits up on the left side of the float and flicks the whip to show where I'm to sit on the right side. It's hard to climb up the way the float is so high and packed with bags and I try to get up by climbing the wheel. Mr. Hannon says I should never do the likes of that again. Never put your leg or hand near a wheel when the horse is harnessed in\nthe shafts. A horse might take a notion to go for a walk for himself and there you are with the leg or the arm caught in the wheel and twisted off your body and you looking at it. He says to the horse, G'up ower that, and the horse shakes his head and rattles the harness and Mr. Hannon laughs. That fool of a horse loves to work, he says. He won't be rattling his harness in a few hours.\nWhen the rain starts we cover ourselves with old coal bags and Mr. Hannon turns his pipe upside down in his mouth to keep the tobacco dry. He says the rain makes everything heavier but what's the use of complaining. You might as well complain about the sun in Africa.\nWe cross the Sarsfield Bridge for deliveries to the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road. Rich people, says Mr. Hannon, and very slow to put their hands in their pockets for a tip.\nWe have sixteen bags to deliver. Mr. Hannon says we're lucky today because some houses get more than one and he doesn't have to be climbing on and off that float destroying his legs. When we stop he gets down and I pull the bag to the edge and lay it on his shoulders. Some houses have areas outside where you pull up a trap door and tip the bag till it empties and that's easy. There are other houses with long backyards and you can see Mr. Hannon suffering with his legs when he has to carry the bags from the float to the sheds near the back doors. Ah, Jaysus, Frankie, ah, Jaysus, is the only complaint out of him and he asks me to give him a hand to climb back on the float. He says if he had a handcart he could wheel the bags from float to house and that would be a blessing but a handcart would cost two weeks' wages and who could afford that?\nThe bags are delivered and the sun is out, the float is empty, and the horse knows his workday is over. It's lovely to sit on the float looking along the length of the horse from his tail to his head rocking along the Ennis Road over the Shannon and up the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon says the man who delivered sixteen hundredweights of coal and turf deserves a pint and the boy who helped him deserves a lemonade. He tells me I should go to school and not be like him working away with the two legs rotting under him. Go to school, Frankie, and get out of Limerick and Ireland itself. This war will be over some day and you can go to America or Australia or any big open country where you can look up and see no end to the land. The world is wide and you can have great adventures. If I didn't have these two legs I'd be over in England making a fortune in the factories like the rest of the Irishmen, like your father. No, not like your father. I hear he left you high and dry, eh? I don't know how a man in his right mind can go off and leave a wife and family to starve and shiver in a Limerick winter. School, Frankie, school. The books, the books, the books. Get out of Limerick before your legs rot and your mind collapses entirely.\nThe horse clops along and when we get to the coal yard we feed and water him and give him a rubdown. Mr. Hannon talks to him all the time and calls him Me oul' segosha, and the horse snuffles and pushes his nose against Mr. Hannon's chest. I'd love to bring this horse home and let him stay downstairs when we're up in Italy but even if I could get him in the door my mother would yell at me that the last thing we need in this house is a horse.\nThe streets going up from the Dock Road are too hilly for Mr. Hannon to ride the bicycle and carry me, so we walk. His legs are sore from the day and it takes a long time to get up to Henry Street. He leans\non the bicycle or sits on the steps outside houses, grinding down on the pipe in his mouth.\nI'm wondering when I'll get the money for the day's work because Mam might let me go to the Lyric Cinema if I get home in time with my shilling or whatever Mr. Hannon gives me. Now we're at the door of South's pub and he tells me come in, didn't he promise me a lemonade?\nUncle Pa Keating is sitting in the pub. He's all black as usual and he's sitting next to Bill Galvin, all white as usual, snuffling and taking great slugs out of his black pint. Mr. Hannon says, How're you? and sits on the other side of Bill Galvin and everyone in the pub laughs. Jaysus, says the barman, look at that, two lumps of coal and a snowball. Men come in from other parts of the pub to see the two coal black men with the lime white man in the middle and they want to send down to the Limerick Leader for a man with a camera.\nUncle Pa says, What are you doing all black yourself, Frankie? Did you fall down a coal mine?\nI was helping Mr. Hannon on the float.\nYour eyes look atrocious, Frankie. Piss holes in the snow. 'Tis the coal dust, Uncle Pa.\nWash them when you go home.\nI will, Uncle Pa.\nMr. Hannon buys me a lemonade, gives me the shilling for my\nmorning's work and tells me I can go home now, I'm a great worker and I can help him again next week after school.\nOn the way home I see myself in the glass of a shop window all black from the coal, and I feel like a man, a man with a shilling in his pocket, a man who had a lemonade in a pub with two coal men and a lime man. I'm not a child anymore and I could easily leave Leamy's School forever. I could work with Mr. Hannon every day and when his legs got too bad I could take over the float and deliver coal to the rich people the rest of my life and my mother wouldn't have to be a beggar at the Redemptorist priests' house.\nPeople on the streets and lanes give me curious looks. Boys and girls laugh and call out, Here's the chimney sweep. How much do you want for cleaning our chimney? Did you fall into a coal hole? Were you burned by the darkness?\nThey're ignorant. They don't know I spent the day delivering hundredweights of coal and turf. They don't know I'm a man.\nMam is sleeping up in Italy with Alphie and there's a coat over the window to keep the room dark. I tell her I earned a shilling and she says I can go to the Lyric, I deserve it. Take tuppence and leave the rest of the shilling on the mantelpiece downstairs so that she can send out for a loaf of bread for the tea. The coat suddenly drops from the window and the room is bright. Mam looks at me, God above, look at your eyes. Go downstairs and I'll be down in a minute to wash them.\nShe heats water in the kettle and dabs at my eyes with boric acid powder and tells me I can't go to the Lyric Cinema today or any day till my eyes clear up though God knows when that will be. She says, You can't be delivering coal with the state of your eyes. The dust will surely destroy them.\nI want the job. I want to bring home the shilling. I want to be a man.\nYou can be a man without bringing home a shilling. Go upstairs and lie down and rest your two eyes or it's a blind man you'll be.\nI want that job. I wash my eyes three times a day with the boric acid powder. I remember Seamus in the hospital and how his uncle's eyes were cured with the blink exercise and I make sure to sit and blink for an hour every day. You can't beat the blink for the strong eye, he said. And now I blink and blink till Malachy runs to my mother, talking out in the lane with Mrs. Hannon, Mam, something is up with Frankie, he's upstairs blinking and blinking.\nShe comes running up. What's wrong with you? I'm making my eyes strong with the exercise. What exercise?\nThe blinking.\nBlinking is not exercise.\nSeamus in the hospital says you can't beat the blink for the strong eye. His uncle had powerful eyes from the blinking. She says I'm getting odd and goes back to the lane and her chat with Mrs. Hannon and I blink and bathe my eyes with the boric acid powder in warm water. I can hear Mrs. Hannon through the window, Your little Frankie is a godsend to John for 'tis the climbing up and down on that float that was ruining his legs entirely.\nMam doesn't say anything and that means she feels so sorry for Mr. Hannon she'll let me help him again on his heavy delivery day, Thursday. I wash my eyes three times a day and I blink till I get a pain in my eyebrows. I blink in school when the master isn't looking and all the boys in my class are calling me Blinky and adding that to the list of names.\nBlinky McCourt beggar woman's son scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing\nJap.\nI don't care what they call me anymore as long as my eyes are\nclearing up and I have a regular job lifting hundredweights of coal on a float. I wish they could see me on Thursday after school when I'm on the float and Mr. Hannon hands me the reins so that he can smoke his pipe in comfort. Here you are, Frankie, nice and gentle for this is a good horse and he doesn't need to be pulled at.\nHe hands me the whip too but you never need the whip with this horse. It's all for show and I just flick it at the air like Mr. Hannon or I might knock a fly off the horse's great golden rump swinging between the shafts.\nSurely the world is looking at me and admiring the way I rock with the float, the cool way I have with the reins and the whip. I wish I had a pipe like Mr. Hannon and a tweed cap. I wish I could be a real coal man with black skin like Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa Keating so that people would say, There goes Frankie McCourt that delivers all the coal in Limerick and drinks his pint in South's pub. I'd never wash my face. I'd be black every day of the year even Christmas when you're supposed to give yourself a good wash for the coming of the Infant Jesus. I know He wouldn't mind because I saw the Three Wise Men in the Christmas crib at the Redemptorist church and one of them was blacker than Uncle Pa Keating, the blackest man in Limerick, and if a Wise Man is black it means that everywhere you go in the world someone is delivering coal.\nThe horse lifts his tail and great lumps of steaming yellow shit drop from his behind. I start to pull on the reins so that he can stop and have a bit of comfort for himself but Mr. Hannon says, No, Frankie, let him trot. They always shit on the trot. That's one of the blessings horses have, they shit on the trot, and they're not dirty and stinking\nlike the human race, not at all, Frankie. The worst thing in the world is to go into a lavatory after a man that had a feed of pig's feet and a night of pints. The stink from that could twist the nostrils of a strong man. Horses are different. All they have is oats and hay and what they drop is clean and natural.\nI work with Mr. Hannon after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the half day on Saturday morning and that means three shillings for my mother though she worries all the time over my eyes. The minute I get home she washes them and makes me rest them for half an hour.\nMr. Hannon says he'll wait near Leamy's School for me on Thursdays after his deliveries on Barrington Street. Now the boys will see me. Now they'll know I'm a workingman and more than a scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing Jap. Mr. Hannon says, Up you get, and I climb up on the float like any workingman. I look at the boys gawking at me. Gawking. I tell Mr. Hannon if he wants to smoke his pipe in comfort I'll take the reins and when he hands them over I'm sure I hear the boys gasping. I tell the horse, G'up ower that, like Mr. Hannon. We trot away and I know dozens of Leamy's boys are committing the deadly sin of envy. I tell the horse again, G'up ower that, to make sure everyone heard, to make sure they know I'm driving that float and no one else, to make sure they'll never forget it was me they saw on that float with the reins and the whip. It's the best day of my life, better than my First Communion day, which Grandma ruined, better than my Confirmation day when I had the typhoid.\nThey don't call me names anymore. They don't laugh at my scabby eyes. They want to know how I got such a good job at eleven years of age and what I'm paid and if I'll have that job forever. They want to know if there are any other good jobs going in the coal yards and would I put in a good word for them.\nThen there are big boys of thirteen who stick their faces in mine and say they should have that job because they're bigger and I'm nothing but a scrawny little runt with no shoulders. They can talk as much as they like. I have the job and Mr. Hannon tells me I'm powerful.\nThere are days his legs are so bad he can hardly walk at all and you can see Mrs. Hannon worries. She gives me a mug of tea and I watch her roll up his trouser legs and peel away the dirty bandages. The sores are red and yellow and clogged with coal dust. She washes them with soapy water and smears them with a yellow ointment. She props the legs up on a chair and that's where he stays the rest of the night reading the paper or a book from the shelf above his head.\nThe legs are getting so bad he has to get up an hour earlier in the morning to get the stiffness out, to put on another dressing. It's still dark one Saturday morning when Mrs. Hannon knocks at our door and asks me if I'd go to a neighbor and borrow their handcart to take on the float for Mr. Hannon will never be able to carry the bags today and maybe I'd just roll them on the handcart for him. He won't be able to carry me on his bicycle so I can meet him at the yard with the handcart.\nThe neighbor says, Anything for Mr. Hannon, God bless him.\nI wait at the gate of the coal yard and watch him cycle toward me, slower than ever. He's so stiff he can hardly get off the bike and he says, You're a great man, Frankie. He lets me get the horse ready though I still have trouble getting on the harness. He lets me handle the float out of the yard and into the frosty streets and I wish I could drive forever and never go home. Mr. Hannon shows me how to pull the bags to the edge of the float and drop them on the ground so that I can pull them\non to the handcart and push them to the houses. He tells me how to lift and push the bags without straining myself and we have the sixteen bags delivered by noon.\nI wish the boys at Leamy's could see me now, the way I drive the horse and handle the bags, the way I do everything while Mr. Hannon rests his legs. I wish they could see me pushing the handcart to South's pub and having my lemonade with Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa and me all black and Bill Galvin all white. I'd like to show the world the tips Mr. Hannon lets me keep, four shillings, and the shilling he gives me for the morning's work, five shillings altogether.\nMam is sitting by the fire and when I hand her the money she looks at me, drops it in her lap and cries. I'm puzzled because money is supposed to make you happy. Look at your eyes, she says. Go to that glass and look at your eyes.\nMy face is black and the eyes are worse than ever. The whites and the eyelids are red, and the yellow stuff oozes to the corners and out over the lower lids. If the ooze sits a while it forms a crust that has to be picked off or washed away.\nMam says that's the end of it. No more Mr. Hannon. I try to explain that Mr. Hannon needs me. He can barely walk anymore. I had to do everything this morning, drive the float, wheel the handcart with the bags, sit in the pub, drink lemonade, listen to the men discussing who is the best, Rommel or Montgomery.\nShe says she's sorry for Mr. Hannon's troubles but we have troubles of our own and the last thing she needs now is a blind son stumbling through the streets of Limerick. Bad enough you nearly died of typhoid, now you want to go blind on top of it.\nAnd I can't stop crying now because this was my one chance to be a man and bring home the money the telegram boy never brought from my father. I can't stop crying because I don't know what Mr. Hannon is going to do on Monday morning when he has no one to help him pull the bags to the edge of the float, to push the bags into the houses. I can't stop crying because of the way he is with that horse he calls sweet because he's so gentle himself and what will the horse do if Mr. Hannon isn't there to take him out, if I'm not there to take him out? Will that horse fall down hungry for the want of oats and hay and the odd apple?\nMam says I shouldn't be crying, it's bad for the eyes. She says, We'll see. That's all I can tell you now. We'll see.\nShe washes my eyes and gives me sixpence to take Malachy to the Lyric to see Boris Karloff in The Man They Could Not Hang and have two pieces of Cleeves' toffee. It's hard to see the screen with the yellow stuff oozing from my eyes and Malachy has to tell me what's happening. People around us tell him shut up, they'd like to hear what Boris Karloff is saying, and when Malachy talks back to them and tells them he's only helping his blind brother they call the man in charge, Frank Goggin, and he says if he hears another word out of Malachy he'll throw the two of us out.\nI don't mind. I have a way of squeezing the stuff out of one eye and clearing it so that I can see the screen while the other eye fills up and I go back and forth, squeeze, look, squeeze, look, and everything I see is yellow.\nMonday morning Mrs. Hannon is knocking on our door again. She asks Mam if Frank would ever go down to the coal yard and tell the man in the office that Mr. Hannon can't come in today, that he has to see a doctor\nabout his legs, that he'll surely be in tomorrow and what he can't deliver today he will tomorrow. Mrs. Hannon always calls me Frank now. Anyone that delivers hundredweights of coal is not a Frankie.\nThe man in the office says, Humph. I think we're very tolerant with Hannon. You, what's your name?\nMcCourt, sir.\nTell Hannon we'll need a note from the doctor. Do you understand\nthat?\nI do, sir.\nThe doctor tells Mr. Hannon he has to go to the hospital or it's a case of gangrene he'll have and the doctor won't be responsible. The ambulance takes Mr. Hannon away and my big job is gone. Now I'll be white like everyone else in Leamy's, no float, no horse, no shillings to bring home to my mother.\nIn a few days Bridey Hannon comes to our door. She says her mother would like me to come and see her, have a cup of tea with her. Mrs. Hannon is sitting by the fire with her hand on the seat of Mr. Hannon's chair. Sit down, Frank, she says, and when I go to sit on one of the ordinary kitchen chairs she says, No, sit here. Sit here on the chair of himself. Do you know how old he is, Frank?\nOh, he must be very old, Mrs. Hannon. He must be thirty-five.\nShe smiles. She has lovely teeth. He's forty-nine, Frank, and a man that age shouldn't have legs like that.\nHe shouldn't, Mrs. Hannon.\nDid you know you were a joy to him going around on that float?\nI didn't, Mrs. Hannon.\nYou were. We had two daughters, Bridey that you know, and Kathleen,\nthe nurse above in Dublin. But no son and he said you gave him the feeling of a son.\nI feel my eyes burning and I don't want her to see me crying especially when I don't know why I'm crying. That's all I do lately. Is it the job? Is it Mr. Hannon? My mother says, Oh, your bladder is near your eye.\nI think I'm crying because of the quiet way Mrs. Hannon is talking and she's talking like that because of Mr. Hannon.\nLike a son, she says, and I'm glad he had that feeling. His working days are over, you know. He has to stay at home from this out. There might be a cure and if there is sure he might be able to get a job as a watchman where he doesn't have to be lifting and hauling.\nI won't have a job anymore, Mrs. Hannon.\nYou have a job, Frank. School. That's your job.\nThat's not a job, Mrs. Hannon.\nYou'll never have another job like it, Frank. It breaks Mr.\nHannon's heart to think of you dragging bags of coal off a float and it breaks your mother's heart and 'twill destroy your eyes. God knows I'm sorry I ever got you into this for it had your poor mother caught between your eyes and Mr. Hannon's legs.\nCan I go to the hospital to see Mr. Hannon?\nThey might not let you in but surely you can come here to see him. God knows he won't be doing much but reading and looking out the window.\nMam tells me at home, You shouldn't cry but then again tears are salty and they'll wash the bad stuff from your eyes.\nXII\nThere's a letter from Dad. He's coming home two days before Christmas. He says everything will be different, he's a new man, he hopes we're good boys, obeying our mother, attending to our religious duties, and he's bringing us all something for Christmas.\nMam takes me to the railway station to meet him. The station is always exciting with all the coming and going, people leaning from carriages, crying, smiling, waving good-bye, the train hooting and calling, chugging away in clouds of steam, people sniffling on the platform, the railway tracks silvering into the distance, on to Dublin and the world beyond.\nNow it's near midnight and cold on the empty platform. A man in a railway cap asks us if we'd like to wait in a warm place. Mam says, Thank you very much, and laughs when he leads us to the end of the platform where we have to climb a ladder to the signal tower. It takes her a while because she's heavy and she keeps saying, Oh, God, oh, God.\nWe're above the world and it's dark in the signal tower except for the lights that blink red and green and yellow when the man bends over the board. He says, I'm just having a bit of supper and you're welcome.\nMam says, Ah, no, thanks, we couldn't take your supper from you.\nHe says, The wife always makes too much for me and if I was up in this tower for a week I wouldn't be able to eat it. Sure it's not hard work looking at lights and pulling on the odd lever.\nHe takes the top off a flask and pours cocoa into a mug. Here, he says to me, put yourself outside that cocoa.\nHe hands Mam half a sandwich. Ah, no, she says, surely you could take that home to your children.\nI have two sons, missus, and they're off there fighting in the forces of His Majesty, the King of England. One did his bit with Montgomery in Africa and the other is over in Burma or some other bloody place, excuse the language. We get our freedom from England and then we fight her wars. So here, missus, take the bit of sandwich.\nLights on the board are clicking and the man says, Your train is coming, missus.\nThank you very much and Happy Christmas.\nHappy Christmas to yourself, missus, and a Happy New Year, too. Mind yourself on that ladder, young fella. Help your mother.\nThank you very much, sir.\nWe wait again on the platform while the train rumbles into the station. Carriage doors open and a few men with suitcases step to the platform and hurry toward the gate. There is a clanking of milk cans dropped to the platform. A man and two boys are unloading newspapers and magazines.\nThere is no sign of my father. Mam says he might be asleep in one of the carriages but we know he hardly sleeps even in his own bed. She says the boat from Holyhead might have been late and that would make him miss the train. The Irish Sea is desperate at this time of the year.\nHe's not coming, Mam. He doesn't care about us. He's just drunk over there in England.\nDon't talk about your father like that.\nI say no more to her. I don't tell her I wish I had a father like the man in the signal tower who gives you sandwiches and cocoa.\nNext day Dad walks in the door. His top teeth are missing and there's a bruise under his left eye. He says the Irish Sea was rough and when he leaned over the side his teeth dropped out. Mam says, It wouldn't be the drink, would it? It wouldn't be a fight?\nOch, no, Angela.\nMichael says, You said you'd have something for us, Dad.\nOh, I do.\nHe takes a box of chocolates from his suitcase and hands it to Mam.\nShe opens the box and shows us the inside where half the chocolates are\ngone.\nCould you spare it? she says.\nShe shuts the box and puts it on the mantelpiece. We'll have\nchocolates after our Christmas dinner tomorrow.\nMam asks him if he brought any money. He tells her times are hard,\njobs are scarce, and she says, Is it coddin' me you are? There's a war on and there's nothing but jobs in England. You drank the money, didn't you?\nYou drank the money, Dad.\nYou drank the money, Dad.\nYou drank the money, Dad.\nWe're shouting so loud Alphie begins to cry. Dad says, Och, boys,\nnow boys. Respect for your father.\nHe puts on his cap. He has to see a man. Mam says, Go see your man\nbut don't come drunk to this house tonight singing Roddy McCorley or anything else.\nHe comes home drunk but he's quiet and passes out on the floor next to Mam's bed.\nWe have a Christmas dinner next day because of the food voucher Mam got from the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We have sheep's head, cabbage, floury white potatoes, and a bottle of cider because it's Christmas.\nDad says he's not hungry, he'll have tea, borrows a cigarette from Mam. She says, Eat something. It's Christmas.\nHe tells her again he's not hungry but if no one else wants them he'll eat the sheep's eyes. He says there's great nourishment in the eye and we all make sounds of disgust. He washes them down with his tea and smokes the rest of his Woodbine. He puts on his cap and goes upstairs for his suitcase.\nMam says, Where are you going?\nLondon.\nOn this day of Our Lord? Christmas Day?\nIt's the best day for travel. People in motor cars will always give\nthe workingman a lift to Dublin. They think of the hard times of the Holy Family.\nAnd how will you get on the boat to Holyhead without a penny in your pocket?\nThe way I came. There's always a time when they're not looking.\nHe kisses each of us on the forehead, tells us be good boys, obey Mam, say our prayers. He tells Mam he'll write and she says, Oh, yes, the way you always did. He stands before her with his suitcase. She gets up, takes down the box of chocolates and hands them around. She puts a chocolate in her mouth and takes it out again because it's too hard and she can't chew it. I have a soft one and I offer it for the hard one, which will last longer. It's creamy and rich and there's a nut in the middle. Malachy and Michael complain they didn't get a nut and why is it\nFrank always gets the nut? Mam says, What do you mean, always? This is the first time we ever had a box of chocolates.\nMalachy says, He got the raisin in the bun at school and all the boys said he gave it to Paddy Clohessy, so why couldn't he give us the nut?\nMam says, Because 'tis Christmas and he has sore eyes and the nut is good for the sore eyes.\nMichael says, Will the nut make his eyes better?\n'Twill.\nWill it make one eye better or will it make two eyes better?\nThe two eyes, I think.\nMalachy says, If I had another nut I'd give it to him for his eyes. Mam says, I know you would.\nDad watches us a moment eating our chocolates. He lifts the latch,\ngoes out the door and pulls it shut.\nMam tells Bridey Hannon, Days are bad but nights are worse and will\nthis rain ever stop? She tries to ease the bad days by staying in bed and letting Malachy and me light the fire in the morning while she sits up in the bed passing Alphie bits of bread and holding the mug to his mouth for the tea that's in it. We have to go downstairs to Ireland to wash our faces in the basin under the tap and try to dry ourselves in the old damp shirt that hangs over the back of a chair. She makes us stand by the bed to see if we left rings of dirt around our necks and if we did it's back down to the tap and the damp shirt. When there's a hole in a pair of pants she sits up and patches it with any rag she can find. We wear short pants till we're thirteen or fourteen and our long stockings always have holes to be darned. If she has no wool for the darning and the stockings are dark we can blacken our ankles with shoe polish for the respectability that's in it. It's a terrible thing to walk the world with skin showing through the holes of our stockings. When we wear them week after week the holes grow so big we have to pull the stocking forward under the toes so that the hole in the back is hidden in the shoe. On rainy days the stockings are soggy and we have to hang them before the fire at night and hope they'll dry by morning. Then they're hard with dirt cake and we're afraid to pull them on our feet for fear they'll fall on the floor in bits before our eyes. We might be lucky enough to get our stockings on but then we have to block the holes in our shoes and I fight with my brother, Malachy, over any scrap of cardboard or paper in the house. Michael is only six and he has to wait for anything left over unless Mam threatens us from the bed that we're to help our small brother. She says, If ye don't fix yeer brother's shoes an' I have to get out of this bed there will be wigs on the green. You'd have to feel sorry for Michael because he's too old to play with Alphie and too young to play with us and he can't fight with anyone for the same reasons.\nThe rest of the dressing is easy, the shirt I wore to bed is the shirt I wear to school. I wear it day in day out. It's the shirt for football, for climbing walls, for robbings orchards. I go to Mass and the Confraternity in that shirt and people sniff the air and move away. If Mam gets a docket for a new one at the St. Vincent de Paul the old shirt is promoted to towel and hangs damp on the chair for months or Mam might use bits of it to patch other shirts. She might even cut it up and let Alphie wear it a while before it winds up on the floor pushed against the bottom of the door to block the rain from the lane.\nWe go to school through lanes and back streets so that we won't meet the respectable boys who go to the Christian Brothers'School or the rich ones who go to the Jesuit school, Crescent College. The Christian Brothers' boys wear tweed jackets, warm woolen sweaters, shirts, ties and shiny new boots. We know they're the ones who will get jobs in the civil service and help the people who run the world. The Crescent College boys wear blazers and school scarves tossed around their necks and over their shoulders to show they're cock o' the walk. They have long hair which falls across their foreheads and over their eyes so that they can toss their quiffs like Englishmen. We know they're the ones who will go to university, take over the family business, run the government, run the world. We'll be the messenger boys on bicycles who deliver their groceries or we'll go to England to work on the building sites. Our sisters will mind their children and scrub their floors unless they go off to England, too. We know that. We're ashamed of the way we look and if boys from the rich schools pass remarks we'll get into a fight and wind up with bloody noses or torn clothes. Our masters will have no patience with us and our fights because their sons go to the rich schools and, Ye have no right to raise your hands to a better class of people so ye don't.\nYou never know when you might come home and find Mam sitting by the fire chatting with a woman and a child, strangers. Always a woman and child. Mam finds them wandering the streets and if they ask, Could you spare a few pennies, miss? her heart breaks. She never has money so she invites them home for tea and a bit of fried bread and if it's a bad night she'll let them sleep by the fire on a pile of rags in the corner. The bread she gives them always means less for us and if we complain she says there are always people worse off and we can surely spare a little from what we have.\nMichael is just as bad. He brings home stray dogs and old men. You never know when you'll find a dog in the bed with him. There are dogs with sores, dogs with no ears, no tails. There's a blind greyhound he found in the park tormented by children. Michael fought off the children, picked up the greyhound that was bigger than himself and told Mam the dog could have his supper. Mam says, What supper? We're lucky if there's a cut of bread in the house. Michael tells her the dog can have his bread. Mam says that dog has to go tomorrow and Michael cries all night and cries worse in the morning when he finds the dog dead in the bed beside him. He won't go to school because he has to dig a grave outside where the stable was and he wants all of us to dig with him and say the rosary. Malachy says it's useless saying prayers for a dog, how do you know he was even a Catholic? Michael says, Of course he was a Catholic dog. Didn't I have him in my arms? He cries so hard over the dog Mam lets us all stay at home from school. We're so delighted we don't mind helping Michael with the grave and we say three Hail Marys. We're not going to stand there wasting a good day off from school saying the rosary for a dead greyhound. Michael is only six but when he brings old men home he manages to get the fire going and give them tea. Mam says it's driving her crazy to come home and find these old men drinking out of her favorite mug and mumbling and scratching by the fire. She tells Bridey Hannon that Michael has a habit of bringing home old men all a bit gone in the head and if he doesn't have a bit of bread for them he knocks on neighbors' doors and has no shame begging for it. In the end she tells\nMichael, No more old men. One of them left us with lice and we're plagued.\nThe lice are disgusting, worse than rats. They're in our heads and ears and they sit in the hollows of our collarbones. They dig into our skin. They get into the seams of our clothes and they're everywhere in the coats we use as blankets. We have to search every inch of Alphie's body because he's a baby and helpless.\nThe lice are worse than the fleas. Lice squat and suck and we can see our blood through their skins. Fleas jump and bite and they're clean and we prefer them. Things that jump are cleaner than things that squat.\nWe all agree there will be no more stray women and children, dogs and old men. We don't want any more diseases and infections.\nMichael cries.\nGrandma's next-door neighbor, Mrs. Purcell, has the only wireless in her lane. The government gave it to her because she's old and blind. I want a radio. My grandmother is old but she's not blind and what's the use of having a grandmother who won't go blind and get a government radio?\nSunday nights I sit outside on the pavement under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to plays on the BBC and Radio Eireann, the Irish station. You can hear plays by O'Casey, Shaw, Ibsen and Shakespeare himself, the best of all, even if he is English. Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes, you can never get enough of him. And you can hear strange plays about Greeks plucking out their eyes because they married their mothers by mistake.\nOne night I'm sitting under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to Macbeth. Her daughter, Kathleen, sticks her head out the door. Come in, Frankie. My mother says you'll catch the consumption sitting on the ground in this weather.\nAh, no, Kathleen. It's all right.\nNo. Come in.\nThey give me tea and a grand cut of bread slathered with blackberry\njam. Mrs. Purcell says, Do you like the Shakespeare, Frankie?\nI love the Shakespeare, Mrs. Purcell.\nOh, he's music, Frankie, and he has the best stories in the world.\nI don't know what I'd do with meself of a Sunday night if I didn't have the Shakespeare.\nWhen the play finishes she lets me fiddle with the knob on the radio and I roam the dial for distant sounds on the shortwave band, strange whispering and hissing, the whoosh of the ocean coming and going and the Morse Code dit dit dit dot. I hear mandolins, guitars, Spanish bagpipes, the drums of Africa, boatmen wailing on the Nile. I see sailors on watch sipping mugs of hot cocoa. I see cathedrals, skyscrapers, cottages. I see Bedouins in the Sahara and the French Foreign Legion, cowboys on the American prairie. I see goats skipping along the rocky coast of Greece where the shepherds are blind because they married their mothers by mistake. I see people chatting in caf\u00e9s, sipping wine, strolling on boulevards and avenues. I see night women in doorways, monks chanting vespers, and here is the great boom of Big Ben, This is the BBC Overseas Service and here is the news.\nMrs. Purcell says, Leave that on, Frankie, so we'll know the state of the world.\nAfter the news there is the American Armed Forces Network and it's lovely to hear the American voices easy and cool and here is the music,\noh, man, the music of Duke Ellington himself telling me take the A train to where Billie Holiday sings only to me, I can't give you anything but love, baby.\nThat's the only thing I've plenty of, baby.\nOh, Billie, Billie, I want to be in America with you and all that music, where no one has bad teeth, people leave food on their plates, every family has a lavatory, and everyone lives happily ever after.\nAnd Mrs. Purcell says, Do you know what, Frankie?\nWhat, Mrs. Purcell?\nThat Shakespeare is that good he must have been an Irishman. The rent man is losing his patience. He tells Mam, Four weeks\nbehind you are, missus. That's one pound two shillings. This has to stop for I have to go back to the office and report to Sir Vincent Nash that the McCourts are a month behind. Where am I then, missus? Out on my arse jobless and a mother to support that's ninety-two and a daily communicant in the Franciscan church. The rent man collects the rents, missus, or he loses the job. I'll be back next week and if you don't have the money, one pound eight shillings and sixpence total, 'tis out on the pavement you'll be with the skies dripping on your furniture.\nMam comes back up to Italy and sits by the fire wondering where in God's name she'll get the money for a week's rent never mind the arrears. She'd love a cup of tea but there's no way of boiling the water till Malachy pulls a loose board off the wall between the two upstairs rooms. Mam says, Well, 'tis off now and we might as well chop it up for the fire. We boil the water and use the rest of the wood for the morning tea but what about tonight and tomorrow and ever after? Mam says, One more board from that wall, one more and not another one. She says that for two weeks till there's nothing left but the beam frame. She warns us we are not to touch the beams for they hold up the ceiling and the house itself.\nOh, we'd never touch the beams.\nShe goes to see Grandma and it's so cold in the house I take the hatchet to one of the beams. Malachy cheers me on and Michael claps his hands with excitement. I pull on the beam, the ceiling groans and down on Mam's bed there's a shower of plaster, slates, rain. Malachy says, Oh, God, we'll all be killed, and Michael dances around singing, Frankie broke the house, Frankie broke the house.\nWe run through the rain to tell Mam the news. She looks puzzled with Michael chanting, Frankie broke the house, till I explain there's a hole in the house and it's falling down. She says, Jesus, and runs through the streets with Grandma trying to keep up.\nMam sees her bed buried under plaster and slates and pulls at her hair, What'll we do at all, at all? and screams at me for interfering with the beams. Grandma says, I'll go to the landlord's office and tell them fix this before ye are all drowned entirely.\nShe's back in no time with the rent man. He says, Great God in heaven, where's the other room?\nGrandma says, What room?\nI rented ye two rooms up here and one is gone. Where is that room? Mam says, What room?\nThere were two rooms up here and now there's one. And what happened\nto the wall? There was a wall. Now there's no wall. I distinctly remember a wall because I distinctly remember a room. Now where is that wall? Where is that room?\nGrandma says, I don't remember a wall and if I don't remember a wall how can I remember a room?\nYe don't remember? Well, I remember. Forty years a landlord's agent and I never seen the likes of this. By God, 'tis a desperate situation altogether when you can't turn your back but tenants are not paying their rent and making walls and rooms disappear on top of it. I want to know where that wall is and what ye did with the room, so I do.\nMam turns to us. Do any of ye remember a wall?\nMichael pulls at her hand. Is that the wall we burned in the fire? The rent man says, Dear God in heaven, this beats Banagher, this\ntakes the bloody biscuit, this is goin' beyond the beyonds. No rent and what am I to tell Sir Vincent below in the office? Out, missus, I'm puttin' ye out. One week from today I'll knock on this door and I want to find nobody at home, everybody out never to return. Do you have me, missus?\nMam's face is tight. 'Tis a pity you weren't alive in the times when the English were evicting us and leaving us on the side of the road.\nNo lip, missus, or I'll send the men to put ye out tomorrow.\nHe goes out the door and leaves it open to show what he thinks of us. Mam says, I don't know in God's name what I'm going to do. Grandma says, Well, I don't have room for ye but your cousin, Gerard Griffin, is living out the Rosbrien Road in that little house of his mother's and he'd surely be able to take ye in till better times come. 'Tis all hours of the night but I'll go up and see what he says and Frank can come with me.\nShe tells me put on a coat but I don't have one and she says, I suppose there's no use in asking if ye have an umbrella either. Come on.\nShe pulls the shawl over her head and I follow her out the door, up the lane, through the rain to Rosbrien Road nearly two miles away. She knocks on the door of a little cottage in a long row of little cottages. Are you there, Laman? I know you're in there. Open the door.\nGrandma, why are you calling him Laman? Isn't his name Gerard?\nHow would I know? Do I know why the world calls your uncle Pat Ab? Everyone calls this fella Laman. Open the door. We'll go in. He might be working overtime.\nShe pushes the door. It's dark and there's a damp sweet smell in the room. This room looks like the kitchen and there's a smaller room next to it. There's a little loft above the bedroom with a skylight where the rain is beating. There are boxes everywhere, newspapers, magazines, bits of food, mugs, empty tins. We can see two beds taking up all the space in the bedroom, a great acre of a bed and a smaller one near the window. Grandma pokes at a lump in the big bed. Laman, is that you? Get up, will you, get up.\nWhat? What? What? What?\nThere's trouble. Angela is gettin' evicted with the children an' 'tis delvin'out of the heavens. They need a bit of shelter till\nthey get on their feet an' I have no room for them. You can put them up in the loft if you like but that wouldn't do because the small ones wouldn't be able to climb and they'd fall down an' get killed so you go up there an' they can move in here.\nAll right, all right, all right, all right.\nHe hoists himself from the bed and there's a whiskey smell. He goes to the kitchen and pulls the table to the wall for his climb to the loft.\nGrandma says, That's fine now. Ye can move up here tonight an' ye won't have the eviction men coming after ye.\nGrandma tells Mam she's going home. She's tired and drenched and she's not twenty-five anymore. She says there's no need to be taking beds or furniture with all the stuff that's up in Laman Griffin's. We put Alphie in the pram and pile around him the pot, the pan, the kettle, the jam jars and mugs, the Pope, two bolsters and the coats from the beds. We drape the coats over our heads and push the pram through the streets. Mam tells us be quiet going up the lane or the neighbors will know we got the eviction and there will be shame. The pram has a bockety wheel which tilts it and makes it go in different directions. We try to keep it straight and we're having a great time because it must be after midnight and surely Mam won't make us go to school tomorrow. We're moving so far from Leamy's School now maybe we'll never have to go again. Once we get away from the lane Alphie bangs on the pot with the spoon and Michael sings a song he heard in a film with Al Jolson, Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya, my dear ol'Swanee. He makes us laugh the way he tries to sing in a deep voice like Al Jolson.\nMam says she's glad it's late and there's no one on the streets to see our shame.\nOnce we get to the house we take Alphie and everything else from the pram so that Malachy and I can run back down to Roden Lane for the trunk. Mam says she'd die if she lost that trunk and everything in it.\nMalachy and I sleep at opposite ends of the small bed. Mam takes the big bed with Alphie beside her and Michael at the bottom. Everything is damp and musty and Laman Griffin snores over our heads. There are no stairs in this house and that means no angel ever on the seventh step.\nBut I'm twelve going on thirteen and I might be too old for angels.\nIt's still dark when the alarm goes off in the morning and Laman Griffin snorts and blows his nose and hawks the stuff from his chest. The floor creaks under him and when he pisses for ages into the chamber pot we have to stuff our mouths with coats to stop the laughing and Mam hisses at us to be quiet. He grumbles away above us before he climbs down to get his bicycle and bang his way out the door. Mam whispers, The coast is clear, go back to sleep. Ye can stay at home today.\nWe can't sleep. We're in a new house, we have to pee and we want to explore. The lavatory is outside, about ten steps from the back door, our own lavatory, with a door you can close and a proper seat where you can sit and read squares of the Limerick Leader Laman Griffin left behind for wiping himself. There is a long backyard, a garden with tall grass and weeds, an old bicycle that must have belonged to a giant, tin cans galore, old papers and magazines rotting into the earth, a rusted sewing machine, a dead cat with a rope around his neck that somebody must have thrown over the fence.\nMichael gets a notion in his head that this is Africa and keeps asking, Where's Tarzan? Where's Tarzan? He runs up and down the backyard with no pants on trying to imitate Tarzan yodeling from tree to tree. Malachy looks over the fences into the other yards and tells us, They have gardens. They're growing things. We can grow things. We can have our own spuds and everything.\nMam calls from the back door, See if ye can find anything to start the fire in here.\nThere's a wooden shed built against the back of the house. It's collapsing and surely we could use some of the wood for the fire. Mam is\ndisgusted with the wood we bring in. She says it's rotten and full of white maggots but beggars can't be choosers. The wood sizzles above the burning paper and we watch the white maggots try to escape. Michael says he feels sorry for the white maggots but we know he's sorry for everything in the world.\nMam tells us this house used to be a shop, that Laman Griffin's mother sold groceries through the little window and that's how she was able to send Laman away to Rockwell College so that he could wind up as an officer in the Royal Navy. Oh, he was, indeed. An officer in the Royal Navy, and here's a picture of him with other officers all having dinner with a famous American film star Jean Harlow. He was never the same after he met Jean Harlow. He fell madly in love with her but what was the use? She was Jean Harlow and he was nothing but an officer in the Royal Navy and it drove him to drink and they threw him out of the Navy. Now look at him, a common laborer for the Electricity Supply Board and a house that's a disgrace. You'd look at this house and never know there was a human being living in it. You can see Laman never moved a thing since his mother died and now we have to clean up so that we can live in this place.\nThere are boxes packed with bottles of purple hair oil. While Mam is out in the lavatory we open a bottle and smear it on our heads. Malachy says the smell is gorgeous but when Mam comes back she says, What's that horrible stink? and wants to know why our heads are suddenly greasy. She makes us stick our heads under the tap outside and dry ourselves with an old towel pulled out from under a pile of magazines called The Illustrated London News so old they have pictures of Queen Victoria and Prince Edward waving. There are bars of Pear's soap and a thick book called Pear's Encyclopedia, which keeps me up day and night because it tells you everything about everything and that's all I want to know.\nThere are bottles of Sloan's Liniment, which Mam says will come in handy when we get cramps and pains from the damp. The bottles say, Here's the pain, Where's the Sloan's? There are boxes of safety pins and bags packed with women's hats that crumble when you touch them. There are bags with corsets, garters, women's high button shoes and different laxatives that promise glowing cheeks, bright eyes and a curl in your hair. There are letters from General Eoin O'Duffy to Gerard Griffin, Esq., saying welcome to the ranks of the National Front, the Irish Blueshirts, that it is a privilege to know a man like Gerard Griffin is interested in the movement with his excellent education, his Royal Navy training, his reputation as a great rugby player on the Young Munster team that won the national championship, the Bateman Cup. General O'Duffy is forming an Irish Brigade that will soon sail off to Spain to fight with that great Catholic Generalissimo Franco himself, and Mr. Griffin would be a powerful addition to the Brigade.\nMam says Laman's mother wouldn't let him go. She didn't spend all those years slaving away in a little shop to send him to college so that he could go gallivanting off to Spain for Franco so he stayed at home and got that job digging holes for the poles of the Electricity Supply Board along country roads and his mother was happy to have him home to herself every night but Friday when he drank his pint and moaned over Jean Harlow.\nMam is happy we'll have loads of paper for lighting the fire though the wood we burn from that collapsing shed leaves a sickening smell and she worries the white maggots will escape and breed.\nWe work all day moving boxes and bags to the shed outside. Mam opens all the windows to air the house and let out the smell of the hair oil and the years of no air. She says it's a relief to be able to see the floor again and now we can sit down and have a nice cup of tea in peace, ease and comfort, and won't it be lovely when the warm weather comes and we might be able to have a garden and sit outside with our tea the way the English do.\nLaman Griffin comes home at six every night but Friday, has his tea and goes to bed till next morning. Saturdays he goes to bed at one in the afternoon and stays there till Monday morning. He pulls the kitchen table over to the wall under the loft, climbs up on a chair, pulls the chair up to the table, climbs up on the chair again, catches a leg of the bed, pulls himself up. If he's too drunk on Fridays he makes me climb up for his pillow and blankets and sleeps on the kitchen floor by the fire or falls into bed with me and my brothers and snores and farts all night.\nWhen we first moved in he complained over how he gave up his room downstairs for the loft and he's worn out climbing up and down to go to the lavatory in the backyard. He calls down, Bring the table, the chair, I'm coming down, and we have to clear off the table and pull it to the wall. He's fed up, he's finished with the climbing, he's going to use his mother's lovely chamber pot. He lies in bed all day reading books from the library, smoking Gold Flake cigarettes and throwing Mam a few shillings to send one of us to the shop so that he can have scones with his tea or a nice bit of ham and sliced tomato. Then he calls to Mam, Angela, this chamber pot is full, and she drags chair and table to climb for the chamber pot, empty it in the lavatory outside, rinse it and climb back to the loft. Her face gets tight and she says, Is there anything else your lordship would like this day? and he laughs, Woman's work, Angela, woman's work and free rent.\nLaman throws down his library card from the loft and tells me get him two books, one on angling, one on gardening. He writes a note to the librarian to say his legs are killing him from digging holes for the Electricity Supply Board and from now on Frank McCourt will be getting his books. He knows the boy is only thirteen going on fourteen and he knows the rules are strict about allowing children into the adult part of the library but the boy will wash his hands and behave himself and do what he's told, thank you.\nThe librarian reads the note and says 'tis an awful pity about Mr. Griffin, he's a true gentleman and a man of great learning, you wouldn't believe the books he reads, sometimes four a week, that one day he took home a book in French, French, if you don't mind, on the history of the rudder, the rudder, if you don't mind, she'd give anything for a look inside his head for it must be packed with all sorts of learning, packed, if you don't mind.\nShe picks out a gorgeous book with colored pictures about English gardens. She says, I know what he likes in the fishing department, and chooses a book called In Search of the Irish Salmon by Brigadier General Hugh Colton. Oh, says the librarian, he reads hundreds of books about English officers fishing in Ireland. I've read some myself out of pure curiosity and you can see why those officers are glad to be in Ireland after all they put up with in India and Africa and other desperate\nplaces. At least the people here are polite. We're known for that, the politeness, not running around throwing spears at people.\nLaman lies in the bed, reads his books, talks down from the loft about the day his legs will heal and he'll be out there in the back planting a garden which will be famous far and wide for color and beauty and when he's not gardening he'll be roaming the rivers around Limerick and bringing home salmon that will make your mouth water. His mother left a recipe for salmon that's a family secret and if he had the time and his legs weren't killing him he'd find it someplace in this house. He says now that I'm reliable I can get a book for myself every week but don't be bringing home filth. I want to know what the filth is but he won't tell me so I'll have to find out for myself.\nMam says she wants to join the library too but it's a long walk from Laman's house, two miles, and would I mind getting her a book every week, a romance by Charlotte M. Brame or any other nice writer. She doesn't want any books about English officers looking for salmon or books about people shooting each other. There's enough trouble in the world without reading about people bothering fish and each other.\nGrandma caught a chill the night we had the trouble in the house in Roden Lane and the chill turned into pneumonia. They shifted her to the City Home Hospital and now she's dead.\nHer oldest son, my uncle Tom, thought he'd go to England to work like other men in the lanes of Limerick but his consumption got worse and he came back to Limerick and now he's dead.\nHis wife, Galway Jane, followed him, and four of their six children had to be put into orphanages. The oldest boy, Gerry, ran away and joined the Irish army, deserted and crossed to the English army. The oldest girl, Peggy, went to Aunt Aggie and lives in misery.\nThe Irish army is looking for boys who are musical and would like to train in the Army School of Music. They accept my brother, Malachy, and he goes off to Dublin to be a soldier and play the trumpet.\nNow I have only two brothers at home and Mam says her family is disappearing before her very eyes.\nXIII\nBoys from my class at Leamy's School are going on a weekend cycling trip to Killaloe. They tell me I should borrow a bicycle and come. All I need is a blanket, a few spoons of tea and sugar and a few cuts of bread to keep me going. I'll learn to cycle on Laman Griffin's bicycle every night after he goes to bed and he'll surely let me borrow it for the two days in Killaloe.\nThe best time to ask him for anything is Friday night when he's in a good mood after his night of drinking and his dinner. He brings home the same dinner in his overcoat pockets, a big steak dripping blood, four potatoes, an onion, a bottle of stout. Mam boils the potatoes and fries the steak with sliced onion. He keeps his overcoat on, sits at the table and eats the steak out of his hands. The grease and blood roll down his chin and on to the overcoat where he wipes his hands. He drinks his stout and laughs that there's nothing like a great bloody steak of a Friday night and if that's the worst sin he ever commits he'll float to heaven body and soul, ha ha ha.\nOf course you can have my bike, he says. Boy should be able to get out and see the countryside. Of course. But you have to earn it. You can't be getting something for nothing, isn't that right?\n'Tis.\nAnd I have a job for you. You don't mind doing a bit of a job, do\nyou?\nI don't.\nAnd you'd like to help your mother?\nI would.\nWell, now, that very chamber pot is full since this morning. I want\nyou to climb up and get it and take it to the lavatory and rinse it under the tap abroad and climb back up with it.\nI don't want to empty his chamber pot but I dream of cycling miles on the road to Killaloe, fields and sky far from this house, a swim in the Shannon, a night sleeping in a barn. I pull the table and chair to the wall. I climb up and under the bed there's the plain white chamber pot streaked brown and yellow, brimming with piss and shit. I lay it gently at the edge of the loft so that it won't spill, climb down to the chair, reach for the chamber pot, bring it down, turn my face away, hold it while I step down to the table, place it on the chair, step to the floor, take the chamber pot to the lavatory, empty it, and get sick behind the lavatory till I get used to this job.\nLaman says I'm a good boy and the bike is mine anytime I want it as long as the chamber pot is empty and I'm there to run to the shop for his cigarettes, go to the library for books and do whatever else he wants. He says, You have a great way with a chamber pot. He laughs and Mam stares into the dead ashes in the fireplace.\nIt's raining so hard one day, Miss O'Riordan the librarian says, Don't go out in that or you'll ruin the books you're carrying. Sit down over there and behave yourself. You can read all about the saints while you're waiting.\nThere are four big books, Butler's Lives of the Saints. I don't want to spend my life reading about saints but when I start I wish the rain would last forever. Whenever you see pictures of saints, men or women, they're always looking up to heaven where there are clouds filled with little fat angels carrying flowers or harps giving praise. Uncle Pa Keating says he can't think of a single saint in heaven he'd want to sit down and have a pint with. The saints in these books are different. There are stories about virgins, martyrs, virgin martyrs and they're worse than any horror film at the Lyric Cinema.\nI have to look in the dictionary to find out what a virgin is. I know the Mother of God is the Virgin Mary and they call her that because she didn't have a proper husband, only poor old St. Joseph. In the Lives of the Saints the virgins are always getting into trouble and I don't know why. The dictionary says, Virgin, woman (usually a young woman) who is and remains in a state of inviolate chastity.\nNow I have to look up inviolate and chastity and all I can find here is that inviolate means not violated and chastity means chaste and that means pure from unlawful sexual intercourse. Now I have to look up intercourse and that leads to intromission, which leads to intromittent, the copulatory organ of any male animal. Copulatory leads to copulation, the union of the sexes in the art of generation and I don't know what that means and I'm too weary going from one word to another in this heavy dictionary which leads me on a wild goose chase from this word to that\nword and all because the people who wrote the dictionary don't want the likes of me to know anything.\nAll I want to know is where I came from but if you ask anyone they tell you ask someone else or send you from word to word.\nAll these virgin martyrs are told by Roman judges they have to give up their faith and accept the Roman gods but they say, Nay, and the judges have them tortured and killed. My favorite is St. Christina the Astonishing who takes ages to die. The judge says, Cut off her breast, and when they do she throws it at him and he goes deaf dumb and blind. Another judge is brought on the case and he says, Cut off the other breast, and the same thing happens. They try to kill her with arrows but they just bounce off her and kill the soldiers who shot them. They try to boil her in oil but she rocks in the vat and takes a nap for herself. Then the judges get fed up and have her head cut off and that does the job. The feast of St. Christina the Astonishing is the twenty-fourth of July and I think I'll keep that for myself along with the feast of St. Francis of Assisi on the fourth of October. The librarian says, You have to go home now, the rain is stopped, and when I'm going out the door she calls me back. She wants to write a note to my mother and she doesn't mind one bit if I read it. The note says, Dear Mrs. McCourt, Just when you think Ireland is gone to the dogs altogether you find a boy sitting in the library so absorbed in the Lives of the Saints he doesn't realize the rain has stopped and you have to drag him away from the aforesaid Lives. I think, Mrs. McCourt, you might have a future priest on your hands and I will light a candle in hopes it comes true. I remain, Yours truly, Catherine O'Riordan, Asst. Librarian.\nHoppy O'Halloran is the only master in Leamy's National School who ever sits. That's because he's the headmaster or because he has to rest himself from the twisting walk that comes from the short leg. The other masters walk back and forth in the front of the room or up and down the aisles and you never know when you'll get a whack of a cane or a slap of a strap for giving the wrong answer or writing something sloppy. If Hoppy wants to do anything to you he calls you to the front of the room to punish you before three classes.\nThere are good days when he sits at the desk and talks about America. He says, My boys, from the frozen wastes of North Dakota to the fragrant orange groves of Florida, Americans enjoy all climates. He talks about American history, If the American farmer, with flintlock and musket, could wrest from the English a continent, surely we, warriors ever, can recover our island.\nIf we don't want him tormenting us with algebra or Irish grammar all we have to do is ask him a question about America and that gets him so excited he might go on for the whole day.\nHe sits at his desk and recites the tribes and chiefs he loves. Arapaho, Cheyenne, Chippewa, Sioux, Apache, Iroquois. Poetry, my boys, poetry. And listen to the chiefs, Kicking Bear, Rain-in-the-Face, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and the genius, Geronimo.\nIn seventh class he hands out a small book, a poem that goes on for pages and pages, The Deserted Village, by Oliver Goldsmith. He says that this seems to be a poem about England but it is a lament for the poet's native land, our own native land, Ireland. We are to get this poem by heart, twenty lines a night to be recited every morning. Six boys are called to the front of the room for reciting and if you miss a line you are slapped twice on each hand. He tells us put the books under the desks\nand the whole class chants the passage on the schoolmaster in the village.\nBeside yon straggling fence that skirts the way, With blossomed furze unprofitably gay,\nThere, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule\nThe village master taught his little school.\nA man severe he was and stern to view, I knew him well, and every truant knew.\nFull well the boding tremblers learned to trace The day's disaster in his morning face.\nFull well they laughed with counterfeited glee At all his jokes for many a joke had he.\nFull well the busy whisper circling round Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned.\nHe always closes his eyes and smiles when we reach the last lines of the passage, Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught, The love he bore to learning was in fault.\nThe village all declared how much he knew.\n'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too. Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage, And even the story ran that he could gauge.\nIn arguing, too, the parson owned his skill, For, even though vanquished, he could argue still, While words of learned length and thundering sound Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around.\nAnd still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, That one small head could carry all he knew.\nWe know he loves these lines because they're about a schoolmaster, about him, and he's right because we wonder how one small head could carry all he knows and we will remember him in these lines. He says, Ah, boys, boys, You can make up your own minds but first stock them. Are you listening to me? Stock your minds and you can move through the world resplendent. Clarke, define resplendent.\nI think it's shining, sir.\nPithy, Clarke, but adequate. McCourt, give us a sentence with pithy.\nClarke is pithy but adequate, sir.\nAdroit, McCourt. You have a mind for the priesthood, my boy, or politics. Think of that.\nI will, sir.\nTell your mother come and see me.\nI will, sir.\nMam says, No, I could never go near Mr. O'Halloran. I don't have a\ndecent dress or a proper coat. What does he want to see me for? I don't know.\nWell, ask him.\nI can't. He'll kill me. If he says bring your mother you have to bring your mother or out comes the stick.\nShe comes to see him and he talks to her in the hallway. He tells her that her son Frank must continue school. He must not fall into the\nmessenger boy trap. That leads nowhere. Take him up to the Christian Brothers, tell them I sent you, tell them he is a bright boy and ought to be going to secondary school and beyond that, university.\nHe tells her he did not become headmaster of Leamy's National School to preside over an academy of messenger boys.\nMam says, Thank you, Mr. O'Halloran.\nI wish Mr. O'Halloran would mind his own business. I don't want to go to the Christian Brothers. I want to quit school forever and get a job, get my wages every Friday, go to the pictures on Saturday nights like everyone.\nA few days later Mam tells me give my face and hands a good wash, we're going to the Christian Brothers. I tell her I don't want to go, I want to work, I want to be a man. She tells me stop the whining, I'm going to secondary school and we'll all manage somehow. I'm going to school if she has to scrub floors and she'll practice on my face.\nShe knocks on the door at the Christian Brothers and says she wants to see the superior, Brother Murray. He comes to the door, looks at my mother and me and says, What?\nMam says, This is my son, Frank. Mr. O'Halloran at Leamy's says he's bright and would there be any chance of getting him in here for secondary school?\nWe don't have room for him, says Brother Murray and closes the door in our faces.\nMam turns away from the door and it's a long silent walk home. She takes off her coat, makes tea, sits by the fire. Listen to me, she says. Are you listening?\nI am.\nThat's the second time a door was slammed in your face by the Church.\nIs it? I don't remember.\nStephen Carey told you and your father you couldn't and closed the door in your face. Do you remember that?\nI do.\nAnd now Brother Murray slams the door in your face. I don't mind. I want to get a job.\nHer face tightens and she's angry. You are never to\nbe an altar boy\nlet anybody\nslam the door in your face again. Do you hear me?\nShe starts to cry by the fire, Oh, God, I didn't bring ye into the\nworld to be a family of messenger boys.\nI don't know what to do or say, I'm so relieved I don't have to\nstay in school for five or six more years. I'm free.\nI'm thirteen going on fourteen and it's June, the last month of school forever. Mam takes me to see the priest, Dr. Cowpar, about getting a job as telegram boy. The supervisor in the post office, Mrs. O'Connell, says, Do you know how to cycle, and I lie that I do. She says I can't start till I'm fourteen so come back in August.\nMr. O'Halloran tells the class it's a disgrace that boys like McCourt, Clarke, Kennedy, have to hew wood and draw water. He is disgusted by this free and independent Ireland that keeps a class system foisted on us by the English, that we are throwing our talented children on the dungheap.\nYou must get out of this country, boys. Go to America, McCourt. Do you hear me?\nI do, sir.\nPriests come to the school to recruit us for the foreign missions, Redemptorists, Franciscans, Holy Ghost Fathers, all converting the distant heathen. I ignore them. I'm going to America till one priest catches my attention. He says he comes from the order of the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic Bedouin tribes and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.\nI ask for the application.\nI will need a letter from the parish priest and a physical examination by my family doctor. The parish priest writes the letter on the spot. He would have been glad to see me go last year. The doctor says, What's this?\nThat's an application to join the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic tribes of the Sahara and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.\nOh, yeh? French Foreign Legion, is it? Do you know the preferred form of transportation in the Sahara Desert?\nTrains?\nNo. It's the camel. Do you know what a camel is?\nIt has a hump. It has more than a hump. It has a nasty, mean\ndisposition and its teeth are green with gangrene and it bites. Do you know where it bites?\nIn the Sahara?\nNo, you omadhaun. It bites your shoulder, rips it right off. Leaves you standing there tilted in the Sahara. How would you like that, eh? And what class of a spectacle you'd be strolling down the street, lopsided in Limerick. What girl in her right mind will look at an ex-White Father with one miserable scrawny shoulder? And look at your eyes. They're bad enough here in Limerick. In the Sahara they'll fester and rot and fall out of your head. How old are you?\nThirteen.\nGo home to your mother.\nIt's not our house and we don't feel free in it the way we did in\nRoden Lane, up in Italy or down in Ireland. When Laman comes home he wants to read in his bed or sleep and we have to be quiet. We stay in the streets till after dark and when we come inside there's nothing to do but go to bed and read a book if we have a candle or paraffin oil for the lamp.\nMam tells us go to bed, she'll be after us in a minute as soon as she climbs to the loft with Laman's last mug of tea. We often fall asleep before she goes up but there are nights we hear them talking, grunting, moaning. There are nights when she never comes down and Michael and Alphie have the big bed to themselves. Malachy says she stays up there because it's too hard for her to climb down in the dark.\nHe's only twelve and he doesn't understand.\nI'm thirteen and I think they're at the excitement up there.\nI know about the excitement and I know it's a sin but how can it be\na sin if it comes to me in a dream where American girls pose in swimming suits on the screen at the Lyric Cinema and I wake up pushing and pumping? It's a sin when you're wide awake and going at yourself the way the boys talked about it in Leamy's schoolyard after Mr. O'Dea roared the Sixth Commandment at us, Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery, which means impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, and that's what adultery is, Dirty Things in General.\nOne Redemptorist priest barks at us all the time about the Sixth Commandment. He says impurity is so grave a sin the Virgin Mary turns her face away and weeps.\nAnd why does she weep, boys? She weeps because of you and what you are doing to her Beloved Son. She weeps when she looks down the long dreary vista of time and beholds in horror the spectacle of Limerick boys defiling themselves, polluting themselves, interfering with themselves, abusing themselves, soiling their young bodies, which are the temples of the Holy Ghost. Our Lady weeps over these abominations knowing that every time you interfere with yourself you nail to the cross her Beloved Son, that once more you hammer into His dear head the crown of thorns, that you reopen those ghastly wounds. In an agony of thirst He hangs on the cross and what is He offered by those perfidious Romans? A lavatory sponge plunged into vinegar and gall and thrust into His poor mouth, a mouth that moves rarely except to pray, to pray even for you, boys, even for you who nailed Him to that cross. Consider Our Lord's suffering. Consider the crown of thorns. Consider a small pin driven into your skull, the agony of the piercing. Consider then twenty thorns driven into your head. Reflect, meditate on the nails tearing His hands, His feet. Could you endure a fraction of that agony? Take that pin again, that mere pin. Force it into your side. Enlarge that sensation a hundredfold and you are penetrated by that awful lance. Oh, boys, the devil wants your souls. He wants you with him in hell and know this, that every time you interfere with yourself, every time you succumb to the vile sin of self- abuse you not only nail Christ to the cross you take another step closer to hell itself. Retreat from the abyss, boys. Resist the devil and keep your hands to yourself.\nI can't stop interfering with myself. I pray to the Virgin Mary and tell her I'm sorry I put her Son back on the cross and I'll never do it again but I can't help myself and swear I'll go to confession and after that, surely after that, I'll never never do it again. I don't want to go to hell with devils chasing me for eternity jabbing me with hot pitchforks.\nThe priests of Limerick have no patience with the likes of me. I go to confession and they hiss that I'm not in a proper spirit of repentance, that if I were I'd give up this hideous sin. I go from church to church looking for an easy priest till Paddy Clohessy tells me there's one in the Dominican church who's ninety years old and deaf as a turnip. Every few weeks the old priest hears my confession and mumbles that I should pray for him. Sometimes he falls asleep and I don't have the heart to wake him up so I go to Communion the next day without penance or absolution. It's not my fault if priests fall asleep on me and surely I'm in a state of grace just for going to confession. Then one day the little panel in the confession box slides back and it's not my man at all, it's a young priest with a big ear like a seashell. He'll surely hear everything.\nBless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession.\nAnd what have you done since then, my child?\nI hit my brother, I went on the mooch from school, I lied to my mother.\nYes, my child, and what else?\nI \u2013 I - I did dirty things, Father.\nAh, my child, was that with yourself or with another or with some class of beast?\nSome class of beast. I never heard of a sin like that before. This priest must be from the country and if he is he's opening up new worlds to me.\nThe night before I'm to go to Killaloe Laman Griffin comes home drunk and eats a great bag of fish and chips at the table. He tells Mam boil water for tea and when she says she has no coal or turf he yells at her and calls her a great lump living free under his roof with her pack of brats. He throws money at me to go to the shop for a few sods of turf and wood for kindling. I don't want to go. I want to hit him for the way he treats my mother but if I say anything he won't let me have the bicycle tomorrow after I've waited three weeks.\nWhen Mam gets the fire going and boils the water I remind him of his promise to loan me the bike.\nDid you empty the chamber pot today?\nOh, I forgot. I'll do it this minute.\nHe shouts, You didn't empty my damn chamber pot. I promise you the\nbike. I give you tuppence a week to run messages for me and empty the chamber pot and you stand there with your thick gob hanging out and tell me you didn't do it.\nI'm sorry. I forgot. I'll do it now.\nYou will, will you? And how do you think you'll get up to the loft? Are you going to pull the table out from under my fish and chips?\nMam says, Sure, he was at school all day and he had to go to the doctor for his eyes.\nWell, you can bloody well forget about the bicycle. You didn't live up to the bargain.\nBut he couldn't do it, says Mam.\nHe tells her shut up and mind her own business and she goes quiet by the fire. He goes back to his fish and chips but I tell him again, You promised me. I emptied that chamber pot and did your messages for three weeks.\nShut up and go to bed.\nYou can't tell me go to bed. You're not my father, and you promised\nme.\nI'm telling you, as sure as God made little apples, that if I get\nup from this table you'll be calling for your patron saint. You promised me.\nHe pushes the chair back from the table. He stumbles toward me and sticks his finger between my eyes. I'm telling you shut your gob, scabby\neyes.\nI won't. You promised me.\nHe punches my shoulders and when I won't stop moves to my head. My\nmother jumps up, crying, and tries to pull him away. He punches and kicks me into the bedroom but I keep saying, You promised me. He knocks me to my mother's bed and punches till I cover my face and head with my arms.\nI'll kill you, you little shit.\nMam is screaming and pulling at him till he falls backward into the kitchen. She says, Come on, oh, come on. Eat your fish and chips. He's only a child. He'll get over it. I hear him go back to his chair and pull it to the table.\nI hear him snuffle and slurp when he eats and drinks. Hand me the matches, he says. By Jesus, I need a fag after that. There's a put-put sound when he puffs on the cigarette and a whimper from my mother.\nHe says, I'm going to bed, and with the drink in him it takes him a while to climb the chair to the table, pull up the chair, climb to the loft. The bed squeaks under him and he grunts when he pulls off his boots and drops them to the floor.\nI can hear Mam crying when she blows into the globe of the paraffin oil lamp and everything goes dark. After what happened she'll surely want to get into her own bed and I'm ready to go to the small one against the wall. Instead, there's the sound of her climbing the chair, the table, the chair, crying up into the loft and telling Laman Griffin, He's only a boy, tormented with his eyes, and when Laman says, He's a little shit and I want him out of the house, she cries and begs till there's whispering and grunting and moaning and nothing.\nIn awhile they're snoring in the loft and my brothers are asleep around me. I can't stay in this house for if Laman Griffin comes at me again I'll take a knife to his neck. I don't know what to do or where to go.\nI leave the house and follow the streets from the Sarsfield Barracks to the Monument Caf\u00e9. I dream of how I'll get back at Laman some day. I'll go to America and see Joe Louis. I'll tell him my troubles and he'll understand because he comes from a poor family. He'll show me how to build up my muscles, how to hold my hands and use my feet. He'll show me how to dig my chin into my shoulder the way he does and how to let go with a right uppercut that will send Laman flying. I'll drag Laman to the graveyard at Mungret where his family and Mam's family are buried and I'll cover him with earth all the way to his chin so that he won't be able to move and he'll beg for his life and I'll say, End of the road, Laman, you're going to meet your Maker, and he'll beg and beg while I trickle dirt on his face till it's covered completely and he's gasping and asking God for forgiveness for not giving me the bike and punching me all over the house and doing the excitement with my mother and I'll be laughing away because he's not in a state of grace after the excitement and he's going to hell as sure as God made little apples as he used to say himself.\nThe streets are dark and I have to keep an eye out in case I might be lucky like Malachy long ago and find fish and chips dropped by drunken soldiers. There's nothing on the ground. If I find my uncle, Ab Sheehan, he might give me some of his Friday night fish and chips, but they tell me in the caf\u00e9 he came and went already. I'm thirteen now so I don't call him Uncle Pat anymore. I call him Ab or The Abbot like everybody else. Surely if I go to Grandma's house he'll give me a piece of bread or something and maybe he'll let me stay the night. I can tell him I'll be working in a few weeks delivering telegrams and getting big tips at the post office and ready to pay my own way.\nHe's sitting up in bed finishing his fish and chips, dropping to the floor the Limerick Leader they were wrapped in, wiping his mouth and hands with the blanket. He looks at me, That face is all swole. Did you fall on that face?\nI tell him I did because there's no use telling him anything else. He wouldn't understand. He says, You can stay in me mother's bed tonight. You can't walk the streets with that face and them two red eyes in your head.\nHe says there's no food in the house, not a scrap of bread, and when he falls asleep I take the greasy newspaper from the floor. I lick the front page, which is all advertisements for films and dances in the city. I lick the headlines. I lick the great attacks of Patton and Montgomery in France and Germany. I lick the war in the Pacific. I lick the obituaries and the sad memorial poems, the sports pages, the market prices of eggs butter and bacon. I suck the paper till there isn't a smidgen of grease.\nI wonder what I'll do tomorrow.\nXIV\nIn the morning The Abbot gives me the money to go to Kathleen O'Connell's for bread, margarine, tea, milk. He boils water on the gas ring and tells me I can have a mug of tea and, Go aisy with the sugar, I'm not a millionaire. You can have a cut o' bread but don't make it too thick.\nIt's July and school is over forever. In a few weeks I'll be delivering telegrams at the post office, working like a man. In the weeks I'm idle I can do anything I like, get up in the morning, stay in bed, take long walks out the country like my father, wander around Limerick. If I had the money I'd go over to the Lyric Cinema, eat sweets, see Errol Flynn conquering everyone in sight. I can read the English and Irish papers The Abbot brings home or I can use the library cards of Laman Griffin and my mother till I'm found out.\nMam sends Michael with a milk bottle of warm tea, a few cuts of bread smeared with dripping, a note to say Laman Griffin isn't angry anymore and I can come back. Michael says, Are you coming home, Frankie?\nNo.\nAh, do, Frankie. Come on.\nI live here now. I'm never going back.\nBut Malachy is gone to the army and you're here and I have no big\nbrother. All the boys have big brothers and I only have Alphie. He's not even four and can't talk right.\nI can't go back. I'm never going back. You can come here any time you like.\nHis eyes glint with tears and that gives me such a pain in my heart I want to say, All right, I'll come with you. I'm only saying that. I know I'll never be able to face Laman Griffin again and I don't know if I can look at my mother. I watch Michael go up the lane with the sole of his shoe broken and clacking along the pavement. When I start that job at the post office I'll buy him shoes so I will. I'll give him an egg and take him to the Lyric Cinema for the film and the sweets and then we'll go to Naughton's and eat fish and chips till our bellies are sticking out a mile. I'll get money some day for a house or a flat with electric light and a lavatory and beds with sheets blankets pillows like the rest of the world. We'll have breakfast in a bright kitchen with flowers dancing in a garden beyond, delicate cups and saucers, eggcups, eggs soft in the yolk and ready to melt the rich creamery butter, a teapot with a cozy on it, toast with butter and marmalade galore. We'll take our time and listen to music from the BBC or the American Armed Forces Network. I'll buy proper clothes for the whole family so our arses won't be hanging out of our pants and we won't have the shame. The thought of the shame brings a pain\nin my heart and starts me sniffling. The Abbot says, What's up with you? Didn't you have your bread? Didn't you have your tay? What more do you want? 'Tis an egg you'll be lookin' for next.\nThere's no use talking to someone who was dropped on his head and sells papers for a living.\nHe complains he can't be feeding me forever and I'll have to get my own bread and tea. He doesn't want to come home and find me reading in the kitchen with the electric lightbulb blazing away. He can read numbers so he can and when he goes out to sell papers he reads the electric meter so he'll know how much I used and if I don't stop turning on that light he'll take the fuse out and carry it in his pocket and if I put another fuse in he'll have the electricity pulled out altogether and go back to gas, which was good enough for his poor dead mother and will surely suit him for all he does is sit up in the bed to eat his fish and chips and count his money before he goes to sleep.\nI get up early like Dad and go on long walks into the country. I walk around the graveyard in the old abbey at Mungret where my mother's relations are buried and I go up the boreen to the Norman castle at Carrigogunnell where Dad brought me twice. I climb to the top and Ireland is spread out before me, the Shannon shining its way to the Atlantic. Dad told me this castle was built hundreds of years ago and if you wait for the larks to stop their singing over there you can hear the Normans below hammering and talking and getting ready for battle. Once he brought me here in the dark so that we could hear Norman and Irish voices down through the centuries and I heard them. I did.\nSometimes I'm up there alone on the heights of Carrigogunnell and there are voices of Norman girls from olden times laughing and singing in French and when I see them in my mind I'm tempted and I climb to the very top of the castle where once there was a tower and there in full view of Ireland I interfere with myself and spurt all over Carrigogunnell and fields beyond.\nThat's a sin I could never tell a priest. Climbing to great heights and going at yourself before all of Ireland is surely worse than doing it in a private place with yourself or with another or with some class of a beast. Somewhere down there in the fields or along the banks of the Shannon a boy or a milkmaid might have looked up and seen me in my sin and if they did I'm doomed because the priests are always saying that anyone who exposes a child to sin will have a millstone tied around his neck and be cast into the sea.\nStill, the thought of someone watching me brings on the excitement again. I wouldn't want a small boy to be watching me. No, no, that would surely lead to the millstone, but if there was a milkmaid gawking up she'd surely get excited and go at herself though I don't know if girls can go at themselves when they don't have anything to go at. No equipment, as Mikey Molloy used to say.\nI wish that old deaf Dominican priest would come back so that I could tell him my troubles with the excitement but he's dead now and I'll have to face a priest who'll go on about the millstone and the doom.\nDoom. That's the favorite word of every priest in Limerick.\nI walk back along O'Connell Avenue and Ballinacurra where people have their bread and milk delivered early to their doorsteps and surely there's no harm if I borrow a loaf or a bottle with every intention of giving it back when I get my job at the post office. I'm not stealing, I'm borrowing, and that's not a mortal sin. Besides, I stood on top of a\ncastle this morning and committed a sin far worse than stealing bread and milk and if you commit one sin you might as well commit a few more because you get the same sentence in hell. One sin, eternity. A dozen sins, eternity.\nMight as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, as my mother would say. I drink the odd pint of milk and leave the bottle so that the milkman won't be blamed for not delivering. I like milkmen because one of them gave me two broken eggs which I swallowed raw with bits of shells and all. He said I'd grow up powerful if I had nothing else but two eggs in a pint of porter every day. Everything you need is in the egg and everything you want is in the pint.\nSome houses get better bread than others. It costs more and that's what I take. I feel sorry for the rich people who will get up in the morning and go to the door and find their bread missing but I can't let myself starve to death. If I starve I'll never have the strength for my telegram boy job at the post office, which means I'll have no money to put back all that bread and milk and no way of saving to go to America and if I can't go to America I might as well jump into the River Shannon. It's only a few weeks till I get my first wages in the post office and surely these rich people won't collapse with the hunger till then. They can always send the maid out for more. That's the difference between the poor and the rich. The poor can't send out for more because there's no money to send out for more and if there was they wouldn't have a maid to send. It's the maids I have to worry about. I have to be careful when I borrow the milk and the bread and they're at the front doors polishing knobs, knockers and letter boxes. If they see me they'll be running to the woman of the house, Oh, madam, madam, there's an urchin beyant that's makin' off with all the milk and bread.\nBeyant. Maids talk like that because they're all from the country, Mullingar heifers, says Paddy Clohessy's uncle, beef to the heels, and they wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.\nI bring home the bread and even if The Abbot is surprised he doesn't say, Where did you get it? because he was dropped on his head and that knocks the curiosity out of you. He just looks at me with his big eyes that are blue in the middle and yellow all around and slurps his tea from the great cracked mug his mother left behind. He tells me, That's me mug and don't be drinkin' your tay oush of ish.\nOush of ish. That's the Limerick slum talk that always worried Dad. He said, I don't want my sons growing up in a Limerick lane saying, Oush of ish. It's common and low-class. Say out of it properly.\nAnd Mam said, I hope it keeps fine for you but you're not doing much to get us oush of ish.\nOut beyond Ballinacurra I climb orchard walls for apples. If there's a dog I move on because I don't have Paddy Clohessy's way of talking to them. Farmers come at me but they're always slow in their rubber boots and even if they jump on a bicycle to chase me I jump over walls where they can't take a bike.\nThe Abbot knows where I got the apples. If you grow up in the lanes of Limerick you're bound to rob the odd orchard sooner or later. Even if you hate apples you have to rob orchards or your pals will say you're a sissy.\nI always offer The Abbot an apple but he won't eat it because of the scarcity of teeth in his head. He has five left and he won't risk leaving them in an apple. If I cut the apple into slices he still won't\neat it because that's not the proper way to eat an apple. That's what he says and if I say, You slice bread before you eat it, don't you? he says, Apples is apples and bread is bread.\nThat's how you talk when you're dropped on your head.\nMichael comes again with warm tea in a milk bottle and two cuts of fried bread. I tell him I don't need it anymore. Tell Mam I'm taking care of myself and I don't need her tea and fried bread, thank you very much. Michael is delighted when I give him an apple and I tell him come every second day and he can have more. That stops him from asking me to go back to Laman Griffin's and I'm glad it stops his tears.\nThere's a market down in Irishtown where the farmers come on Saturdays with their vegetables, hens, eggs, butter. If I'm there early they'll give me a few pennies for helping unload their carts or motor cars. At the end of the day they'll give me vegetables they can't sell, anything crushed, bruised or rotten in parts. One farmer's wife always gives me cracked eggs and tells me, Fry them eggs tomorrow when you come back from Mass in a state of grace for if you ate them eggs with a sin on your sowl they'll stick in your gullet, so they will.\nShe's a farmer's wife and that's how they talk.\nI'm not much better than a beggar now myself the way I stand at the doors of fish and chip shops when they're closing in hopes they might have burnt chips left over or bits of fish floating around in the grease. If they're in a hurry the shop owners will give me the chips and a sheet of paper for wrapping.\nThe paper I like is the News of the World. It's banned in Ireland but people sneak it in from England for the shocking pictures of girls in swimming suits that are almost not there. Then there are stories of people committing all kinds of sins you wouldn't find in Limerick, getting divorces, committing adultery.\nAdultery. I still have to find out what that word means, look it up in the library. I'm sure it's worse than what the masters taught us, bad thoughts, bad words, bad deeds. I take my chips home and get into bed like The Abbot. If he has a few pints taken he sits up eating his chips from the Limerick Leader and singing \"The Road to Rasheen. \" I eat my chips. I lick the News of the World. I lick the stories about people doing shocking things. I lick the girls in their bathing suits and when there's nothing left to lick I look at the girls till The Abbot blows out the light and I'm committing a mortal sin under the blanket.\nI can go to the library any time with Mam's card or Laman Griffin's. I'll never be caught because Laman is too lazy to get out of bed on a Saturday and Mam will never go near a library with the shame of her clothes.\nMiss O'Riordan smiles. The Lives of the Saints are waiting for you, Frank. Volumes and volumes. Butler, O'Hanlon, Baring Gould. I've told the head librarian all about you and she's so pleased she's ready to give you your own grown-up card. Isn't that wonderful?\nThanks, Miss O'Riordan.\nI'm reading all about St. Brigid, virgin, February first. She was so beautiful that men from all over Ireland panted to marry her and her father wanted her to marry someone important. She didn't want to marry anyone so she prayed to God for help and He caused her eye to melt in her head so that it dribbled down her cheek and left such a great welt the men of Ireland lost interest.\nThen there's St. Wilgefortis, virgin martyr, July twentieth. Her mother had nine children, all at the same time, four sets of twins and Wilgefortis the odd one, all winding up martyrs for the faith. Wilgefortis was beautiful and her father wanted to marry her off to the King of Sicily. Wilgefortis was desperate and God helped her by allowing a beard and a mustache to grow on her face, which made the King of Sicily think twice but sent her father into such a rage he had her crucified beard and all.\nSt. Wilgefortis is the one you pray to if you're an Englishwoman with a troublesome husband.\nThe priests never tell us about virgin martyrs like St. Agatha, February fifth. February is a powerful month for virgin martyrs. Sicilian pagans ordered Agatha to give up her faith in Jesus and like all the virgin martyrs she said, Nay. They tortured her, stretched her on the rack, tore her sides with iron hooks, burned her with blazing torches, and she said, Nay, I will not deny Our Lord. They crushed her breasts and cut them off but when they rolled her over hot coals it was more than she could bear so she expired, giving praise.\nVirgin martyrs always died singing hymns and giving praise not minding one bit if lions tore big chunks from their sides and gobbled them on the spot.\nHow is it the priests never told us about St. Ursula and her eleven thousand maiden martyrs, October twenty-first? Her father wanted her to marry a pagan king but she said, I'll go away for awhile, three years, and think about it. So off she goes with her thousand noble ladies-in- waiting and their companions, ten thousand. They sailed around for awhile and traipsed through various countries till they stopped in Cologne where the chief of the Huns asked Ursula to marry him. Nay, she said, and the Huns killed her and the maidens with her. Why couldn't she say yes and save the lives of eleven thousand virgins? Why did virgin martyrs have to be so stubborn?\nI like St. Moling, an Irish bishop. He didn't live in a palace like the bishop of Limerick. He lived in a tree and when other saints visited him for dinner they would sit around on branches like birds having a grand time with their water and dry bread. He was walking along one day and a leper said, Hoy, St. Moling, where are you going? I'm going to Mass, says St. Moling. Well, I'd like to go to Mass too, so why don't you hoist me up on your back and carry me? St. Moling did but he no sooner had the leper up on his back than the leper started to complain. Your hair shirt, he said, is hard on my sores, take it off. St. Moling took off the shirt and off they went again. Then the leper says, I need to blow my nose. St. Moling says, I don't have any class of a handkerchief, use your hand. The leper says, I can't hold on to you and blow my nose at the same time. All right, says St. Moling, you can blow into my hand. That won't do, says the leper, I barely have a hand left with the leprosy and I can't hold on and blow into your hand. If you were a proper saint you'd twist around here and suck the stuff out of my head. St. Moling didn't want to suck the leper's snot but he did and offered it up and praised God for the privilege.\nI could understand my father sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head when he was a baby and desperate but I don't understand why God wanted St. Moling to go around sucking the snot out of lepers' heads. I don't understand God at all and even if I'd like to be a saint and have\neveryone adore me I'd never suck the snot of a leper. I'd like to be a saint but if that's what you have to do I think I'll stay the way I am.\nStill, I'm ready to spend my life in this library reading about virgins and virgin martyrs till I get into trouble with Miss O'Riordan over a book someone left on the table. The author is Lin Y\u00fctang. Anyone can tell this is a Chinese name and I'm curious to know what the Chinese talk about. It's a book of essays about love and the body and one of his words sends me to the dictionary. Turgid. He says, The male organ of copulation becomes turgid and is inserted into the receptive female orifice.\nTurgid. The dictionary says swollen and that's what I am, standing there looking at the dictionary because I know now what Mikey Molloy was talking about all along, that we're no different from the dogs that get stuck in each other in the streets and it's shocking to think of all the mothers and fathers doing the likes of this.\nMy father lied to me for years about the Angel on the Seventh Step.\nMiss O'Riordan wants to know what word I'm looking for. She always looks worried when I'm at the dictionary so I tell her I'm looking for canonize or beatific or any class of a religious word.\nAnd what's this? she says. This is not the Lives of the Saints.\nShe picks up Lin Y\u00fctang and starts reading the page where I left the book face down on the table.\nMother o' God. Is this what you were reading? I saw this in your hand.\nWell, I-I-only wanted to see if the Chinese, if the Chinese, ah, had any saints.\nOh, indeed, you did. This is disgraceful. Filth. No wonder the Chinese are the way they are. But what could you expect of slanty eyes and yellow skin and you, now that I look at you, have a bit of the slanty eye yourself. You are to leave this library at once.\nBut I'm reading the Lives of the Saints.\nOut or I'll call the head librarian and she'll have the guards on you. Out. You should be running to the priest and confessing your sins. Out, and before you go hand me the library cards of your poor mother and Mr. Griffin. I have a good mind to write to your poor mother and I would if I thought it wouldn't destroy her entirely. Lin Y\u00fctang, indeed. Out.\nThere's no use trying to talk to librarians when they're in that state. You could stand there for an hour telling them all you've read about Brigid and Wilgefortis and Agatha and Ursula and the maiden martyrs but all they think about is one word on one page of Lin Y\u00fctang.\nThe People's Park is behind the library. It's a sunny day, the grass is dry, and I'm worn out begging for chips and putting up with librarians who get into a state over turgid and I'm looking at the clouds drifting above the monument and drifting off myself all turgid till I'm having a dream about virgin martyrs in bathing suits in the News of the World pelting Chinese writers with sheeps' bladders and I wake up in a state of excitement with something hot and sticky pumping out of me oh God my male organ of copulation sticking out a mile people in the park giving me curious looks and mothers telling their children come over here love come away from that fella someone should call the guards on him.\nThe day before my fourteenth birthday I see myself in the glass in Grandma's sideboard. The way I look how can I ever start my job at the post office. Everything is torn, shirt, gansey, short pants, stockings, and my shoes are ready to fall off my feet entirely. Relics of oul'\ndecency, my mother would call them. If my clothes are bad I'm worse. No matter how I drench my hair under the tap it sticks out in all directions. The best cure for standing up hair is spit, only it's hard to spit on your own head. You have to let go with a good one up in the air and duck to catch it on your poll. My eyes are red and oozing yellow, there are matching red and yellow pimples all over my face and my front teeth are so black with rot I'll never be able to smile in my life.\nI have no shoulders and I know the whole world admires shoulders. When a man dies in Limerick the women always say, Grand man he was, shoulders that big and wide he wouldn't come in the door for you, had to come in sideways. When I die they'll say, Poor little divil, died without a sign of a shoulder. I wish I had some sign of a shoulder so that people would know I was at least fourteen years of age. All the boys in Leamy's had shoulders except for Fintan Slattery and I don't want to be like him with no shoulders and knees worn away from prayer. If I had any money left I'd light a candle to St. Francis and ask him if there's any chance God could be persuaded to perform a miracle on my shoulders. Or if I had a stamp I could write to Joe Louis and say, Dear Joe, Is there any chance you could tell me where you got your powerful shoulders even though you were poor?\nI have to look decent for my job so I take off all my clothes and stand naked in the backyard washing them under the tap with a bar of carbolic soap. I hang them on Grandma's clothesline, shirt, gansey, pants, stockings, and pray to God it won't rain, pray they'll be dry for tomorrow, which is the start of my life.\nI can't go anywhere in my pelt so I stay in bed all day reading old newspapers, getting excited with the girls in the News of the World and thanking God for the drying sun. The Abbot comes home at five and makes tea downstairs and even though I'm hungry I know he'll grumble if I ask him for anything. He knows the one thing that worries me is he might go to Aunt Aggie and complain I'm staying in Grandma's house and sleeping in her bed and if Aunt Aggie hears that she'll come over and throw me into the street.\nHe hides the bread when he's finished and I can never find it. You would think that one who was never dropped on his head would be able to find the hidden bread of one who was dropped on his head. Then I realize if the bread is not in the house he must take it with him in the pocket of the overcoat he wears winter and summer. The minute I hear him clumping from the kitchen to the backyard lavatory I run downstairs, pull the loaf from the pocket, cut off a thick slice, back into the pocket, up the stairs and into bed. He can never say a word, never accuse me. You'd have to be a thief of the worst class to steal one slice of bread and no one would ever believe him, not even Aunt Aggie. Besides, she'd bark at him and say, What are you doing anyway going around with a loaf of bread in your pocket? That's no place for a loaf of bread.\nI chew the bread slowly. One mouthful every fifteen minutes will make it last and if I wash it down with water the bread will swell in my belly and give me the full feeling.\nI look out the back window to make sure the evening sun is drying my clothes. Other backyards have lines with clothes that are bright and colorful and dance in the wind. Mine hang from the line like dead dogs.\nThe sun is bright but it's cold and damp in the house and I wish I had something to wear in the bed. I have no other clothes and if I touch anything of The Abbot's he'll surely run to Aunt Aggie. All I can find in\nthe wardrobe is Grandma's old black woolen dress. You're not supposed to wear your Grandmother's old dress when she's dead and you're a boy but what does it matter if it keeps you warm and you're in bed under the blankets where no one will ever know. The dress has the smell of old dead grandmother and I worry she might rise from the grave and curse me before the whole family and all assembled. I pray to St. Francis, ask him to keep her in the grave where she belongs, promise him a candle when I start my job, remind him the robe he wore himself wasn't too far from a dress and no one ever tormented him over it and fall asleep with the image of his face in my dream.\nThe worst thing in the world is to be sleeping in your dead grandmother's bed wearing her black dress when your uncle The Abbot falls on his arse outside South's pub after a night of drinking pints and people who can't mind their own business rush to Aunt Aggie's house to tell her so that she gets Uncle Pa Keating to help her carry The Abbot home and upstairs to where you're sleeping and she barks at you, What are you doin' in this house, in that bed? Get up and put on the kettle for tea for your poor uncle Pat that fell down, and when you don't move she pulls the blankets and falls backward like one seeing a ghost and yelling Mother o' God what are you doin' in me dead mother's dress?\nThat's the worst thing of all because it's hard to explain that you're getting ready for the big job in your life, that you washed your clothes, they're drying abroad on the line, and it was so cold you had to wear the only thing you could find in the house, and it's even harder to talk to Aunt Aggie when The Abbot is groaning in the bed, Me feet is like a fire, put water on me feet, and Uncle Pa Keating is covering his mouth with his hand and collapsing against the wall laughing and telling you that you look gorgeous and black suits you and would you ever straighten your hem. You don't know what to do when Aunt Aggie tells you, Get out of that bed and put the kettle on downstairs for tea for your poor uncle. Should you take off the dress and put on a blanket or should you go as you are? One minute she's screaming, What are you doin' in me poor mother's dress? the next she's telling you put on that bloody kettle. I tell her I washed my clothes for the big job.\nWhat big job?\nTelegram boy at the post office.\nShe says if the post office is hiring the likes of you they must be\nin a desperate way altogether, go down and put on that kettle.\nThe next worse thing is to be out in the backyard filling the\nkettle from the tap with the moon beaming away and Kathleen Purcell from next door perched up on the wall looking for her cat. God, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' in your grandmother's dress? and you have to stand there in the dress with the kettle in your hand and explain how you washed your clothes which are hanging there on the line for all to see and you were so cold in the bed you put on your grandmother's dress and your uncle Pat, The Abbot, fell down and was brought home by Aunt Aggie and her husband, Pa Keating, and she drove you into the backyard to fill this kettle and you'll take off this dress as soon as ever your clothes are dry because you never had any desire to go through life in your dead grandmother's dress.\nNow Kathleen Purcell lets out a scream, falls off the wall, forgets the cat, and you can hear her giggling into her blind mother, Mammy, Mammy, wait till I tell you about Frankie McCourt abroad in the backyard in his dead grandmother's dress. You know that once Kathleen Purcell gets\na bit of scandal the whole lane will know it before morning and you might as well stick your head out the window and make a general announcement about yourself and the dress problem.\nBy the time the kettle boils The Abbot is asleep from the drink and Aunt Aggie says she and Uncle Pa will have a drop of tea themselves and she doesn't mind if I have a drop myself. Uncle Pa says on second thought the black dress could be the cassock of a Dominican priest and he goes down on his knees and says, Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Aunt Aggie says, Get up, you oul' eejit, and stop makin' a feck of religion. Then she says, And you what are you doin' in this house?\nI can't tell her about Mam and Laman Griffin and the excitement in the loft. I tell her I was thinking of staying here a while because of the great distance from Laman Griffin's house to the post office and as soon as I get on my feet we'll surely find a decent place and we'll all move on, my mother and brothers and all.\nWell, she says, that's more than your father would do.\nXV\nIt's hard to sleep when you know the next day you're fourteen and starting your first job as a man. The Abbot wakes at dawn moaning. Would I ever make him some tay and if I do I can have a big cut of bread from the half loaf in his pocket which he was keeping there out of the way of the odd rat and if I look in Grandma's gramophone where she used to keep the records I'll find a jar of jam.\nHe can't read, he can't write, but he knows where to hide the jam.\nI bring The Abbot his tea and bread and make some for myself. I put on my damp clothes and get into the bed hoping that if I stay there the clothes will dry from my own heat before I go to work. Mam always says it's the damp clothes that give you the consumption and an early grave. The Abbot is sitting up telling me he has a terrible pain in his head from a dream where I was wearing his poor mother's black dress and she flying around screaming, Sin, sin, 'tis a sin. He finishes his tea and falls into a snore sleep and I wait for his clock to say half-past eight, time to get up and be at the post office at nine even if the clothes are still damp on my skin.\nOn my way out I wonder why Aunt Aggie is coming down the lane. She must be coming to see if The Abbot is dead or needing a doctor. She says, What time do you have to be at that job?\nNine.\nAll right.\nShe turns and walks with me to the post office on Henry Street. She\ndoesn't say a word and I wonder if she's going to the post office to denounce me for sleeping in my grandmother's bed and wearing her black dress. She says, Go up and tell them your aunt is down here waiting for you and you'll be an hour late. If they want to argue I'll go up and argue.\nWhy do I have to be an hour late?\nDo what you're bloody well told.\nThere are telegram boys sitting on a bench along a wall. There are\ntwo women at a desk, one fat, one thin. The thin one says, Yes? My name is Frank McCourt, miss, and I'm here to start work.\nWhat kind of work would that be now?\nTelegram boy, miss.\nThe thin one cackles, Oh, God, I thought you were here to clean the\nlavatories.\nNo, miss. My mother brought a note from the priest, Dr. Cowpar, and\nthere's supposed to be a job.\nOh, there is, is there? And do you know what day this is?\nI do, miss. 'Tis my birthday. I'm fourteen.\nIsn't that grand, says the fat woman. Today is Thursday, says the\nthin woman.\nYour job starts on Monday. Go away and wash yourself and come back then.\nThe telegram boys along the wall are laughing. I don't know why but I feel my face turning hot. I tell the women, Thank you, and on the way out I hear the thin one, Jesus above, Maureen, who dragged in that specimen? and they laugh along with the telegram boys.\nAunt Aggie says, Well? and I tell her I don't start till Monday. She says my clothes are a disgrace and what did I wash them in.\nCarbolic soap.\nThey smell like dead pigeons and you're making a laughingstock of the whole family.\nShe takes me to Roche's Stores and buys me a shirt, a gansey, a pair of short pants, two pairs of stockings and a pair of summer shoes on sale. She gives me two shillings to have tea and a bun for my birthday. She gets on the bus to go back up O'Connell Street too fat and lazy to walk. Fat and lazy, no son of her own, and still she buys me the clothes for my new job.\nI turn toward Arthur's Quay with the package of new clothes under my arm and I have to stand at the edge of the River Shannon so that the whole world won't see the tears of a man the day he's fourteen.\nMonday morning I'm up early to wash my face and flatten my hair with water and spit. The Abbot sees me in my new clothes. Jaysus, he says, is it gettin' married you are? and goes back to sleep.\nMrs. O'Connell, the fat woman, says, Well, well, aren't we the height of fashion, and the thin one, Miss Barry, says, Did you rob a bank on the weekend? and there's a great laugh from the telegram boys sitting on the bench along the wall.\nI'm told to sit at the end of the bench and wait for my turn to go out with telegrams. Some telegram boys in uniforms are the permanent ones who took the exam. They can stay in the post office forever if they like, take the next exam for postman and then the one for clerk that lets them work inside selling stamps and money orders behind the counter downstairs. The post office gives permanent boys big waterproof capes for the bad weather and they get two weeks holiday every year. Everyone says these are good jobs, steady and pensionable and respectable, and if you get a job like this you never have to worry again in your whole life, so you don't.\nTemporary telegram boys are not allowed to stay in the job beyond the age of sixteen. There are no uniforms, no holidays, the pay is less, and if you stay out sick a day you can be fired. No excuses. There are no waterproof capes. Bring your own raincoat or dodge the raindrops.\nMrs. O'Connell calls me to her desk to give me a black leather belt and pouch. She says there's a great shortage of bicycles so I'll have to walk my first batch of telegrams. I'm to go to the farthest address\nfirst, work my way back, and don't take all day. She's long enough in the post office to know how long it takes to deliver six telegrams even by foot. I'm not to be stopping in pubs or bookies or even home for a cup of tea and if I do I'll be found out. I'm not to be stopping in chapels to say a prayer. If I have to pray do it on the hoof or on the bicycle. If it rains pay no attention. Deliver the telegrams and don't be a sissy.\nOne telegram is addressed to Mrs. Clohessy of Arthur's Quay and that couldn't be anyone but Paddy's mother.\nIs that you, Frankie McCourt? she says. God, I wouldn't know you you're that big. Come in, will you.\nShe's wearing a bright frock with flowers all over and shiny new shoes. There are two children on the floor playing with a toy train. On the table there is a teapot, cups with saucers, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, butter, jam. There are two beds over by the window where there were none before. The big bed in the corner is empty and she must know what I'm wondering. He's gone, she says, but he's not dead. Gone t' England with Paddy. Have a cup o' tay an' a bit o' bread. You need it, God help us. You look like one left over from the Famine itself. Ate that bread an' jam an' build yourself up. Paddy always talked about you and Dennis, my poor husband that was in the bed, never got over the day your mother came an' sang the song about the Kerry dancing. He's over in England now making sandwiches in a canteen and sending me a few bob every week. You'd wonder what the English are thinking about when they take a man that has the consumption and give him a job making sandwiches. Paddy has a grand job in a pub in Cricklewood, which is in England. Dennis would still be here if it wasn't for Paddy climbin' the wall for the tongue.\nTongue?\nDennis had the craving, so he did, for a nice sheep's head with a bit of cabbage and a spud so up with me to Barry the butcher with the last few shillings I had. I boiled that head an' sick an' all as he was Dennis couldn't wait for it to be done. He was a demon there in the bed callin' for the head an' when I gave it to him on the plate he was delighted with himself suckin' the marrow outa every inch of that head. Then he finishes an' he says, Mary, where is the tongue?\nWhat tongue? says I.\nThe tongue of this sheep. Every sheep is born with a tongue that lets him go ba ba ba and there's a great lack of tongue in this head. Go up to Barry the butcher and demand it.\nSo up with me to Barry the butcher and he said, That bloody sheep came in here bleatin'an'cryin'so much we cut the tongue from her and thrun it to the dog who gobbled it up and ever since ba bas like a sheep and if he doesn't quit I'll cut his tongue and throw it to the cat.\nBack I go to Dennis and he gets frantic in the bed. I want that tongue, he says. All the nourishment is in the tongue. And what do you think happens next but my Paddy, that was your friend, goes up to Barry the butcher after dark, climbs the wall, cuts the tongue of a sheep's head that's on a hook on the wall and brings it back to his poor father in the bed. Of course I have to boil that tongue with salt galore and Dennis, God love him, ates it, lies back in the bed a minute, throws back the blanket and stands out on his two feet announcing to the world that consumption or no consumption, he's not going to die in that bed, if he's going to die at all it might as well be under a German bomb with him\nmaking a few pounds for his family instead of whining in the bed there beyond.\nShe shows me a letter from Paddy. He's working in his uncle Anthony's pub twelve hours a day, twenty-five shillings a week and every day soup and a sandwich. He's delighted when the Germans come over with the bombs so that he can sleep while the pub is closed. At night he sleeps on the floor of the hallway upstairs. He will send his mother two pounds every month and he's saving the rest to bring her and the family to England where they'll be much better off in one room in Cricklewood than ten rooms in Arthur's Quay. She'll be able to get a job no bother. You'd have to be a sad case not to be able to get a job in a country that's at war especially with Yanks pouring in and spending money right and left. Paddy himself is planning to get a job in the middle of London where Yanks leave tips big enough to feed an Irish family of six for a week.\nMrs. Clohessy says, We have enough money for food and shoes at last, thanks be to God and His Blessed Mother. You'll never guess who Paddy met over there in England fourteen years of age an' workin' like a man. Brendan Kiely, the one ye used to call Question. Workin' he is an' savin' so he can go an' join the Mounties an' ride all over Canada like Nelson Eddy singin' I'll be callin' you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. If it wasn't for Hitler we'd all be dead an' isn't that a terrible thing to say. And how's your poor mother, Frankie?\nShe's grand, Mrs. Clohessy.\nNo, she's not. I seen her in the Dispensary and she looks worse than my Dennis did in the bed. You have to mind your poor mother. You look desperate too, Frankie, with them two red eyes starin' outa your head. Here's a little tip for you. Thruppence. Buy yourself a sweet.\nI will, Mrs. Clohessy.\nDo.\n***\nAt the end of the week Mrs. O'Connell hands me the first wages of\nmy life, a pound, my first pound. I run down the stairs and up to O'Connell Street, the main street, where the lights are on and people are going home from work, people like me with wages in their pockets. I want them to know I'm like them, I'm a man, I have a pound. I walk up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and hope they'll notice me. They don't. I want to wave my pound note at the world so they'll say, There he goes, Frankie McCourt the workingman, with a pound in his pocket.\nIt's Friday night and I can do anything I like. I can have fish and chips and go to the Lyric Cinema. No, no more Lyric. I don't have to sit up in the gods anymore with people all around me cheering on the Indians killing General Custer and the Africans chasing Tarzan all over the jungle. I can go to the Savoy Cinema now, pay sixpence for a seat down front where there's a better class of people eating boxes of chocolates and covering their mouths when they laugh. After the film I can have tea and buns in the restaurant upstairs.\nMichael is across the street calling me. He's hungry and wonders if there's any chance he could go to The Abbot's for a bit of bread and stay there for the night instead of going all the way to Laman Griffin's. I tell him he doesn't have to worry about a bit of bread. We'll go to the Coliseum Caf\u00e9 and have fish and chips, all he wants, lemonade galore, and then we'll go to see Yankee Doodle Dandy with James Cagney and eat two big bars of chocolate. After the film we have tea and buns and we sing\nand dance like Cagney all the way to The Abbot's. Michael says it must be great to be in America where people have nothing else to do but sing and dance. He's half asleep but he says he's going there some day to sing and dance and would I help him go and when he's asleep I start thinking about America and how I have to save money for my fare instead of squandering it on fish and chips and tea and buns. I'll have to save a few shillings from my pound because if I don't I'll be in Limerick forever. I'm fourteen now and if I save something every week surely I should be able to go to America by the time I'm twenty. There are telegrams for offices, shops, factories where there's no hope of a tip. Clerks take the telegrams without a look at you or a thank you. There are telegrams for the respectable people with maids along the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road where there's no hope of a tip. Maids are like clerks, they don't look at you or say thank you. There are telegrams for the houses of priests and nuns and they have maids, too, even if they say poverty is noble. If you waited for tips from priests or nuns you'd die on their doorstep.\nThere are telegrams for people miles outside the city, farmers with muddy yards and dogs who want to eat your legs. There are telegrams for rich people in big houses with gate lodges and miles of land surrounded by walls. The gatekeeper waves you in and you have to cycle for miles up long drives past lawns, flower beds, fountains to reach the big house. If the weather is fine people are playing croquet, the Protestant game, or strolling around, talking and laughing, all decked out in flowery dresses and blazers with crests and golden buttons and you'd never know there was a war on. There are Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked outside the great front door where a maid tells you go around to the servants' entrance don't you know any better.\nPeople in the big houses have English accents and they don't tip telegram boys.\nThe best people for tips are widows, Protestant ministers' wives and the poor in general. Widows know when the telegram money order is due from the English government and they wait by the window. You have to be careful if they ask you in for a cup of tea because one of the temporary boys, Scrawby Luby, said an old widow of thirty-five had him in for tea and tried to take down his pants and he had to run out of the house though he was really tempted and had to go to confession the next Saturday. He said it was very awkward hopping up on the bike with his thing sticking out but if you cycle very fast and think of the sufferings of the Virgin Mary you'll go soft in no time.\nProtestant ministers' wives would never carry on like Scrawby Luby's old widow unless they're widows themselves. Christy Wallace, who is a permanent telegram boy and ready to be a postman any day, says Protestants don't care what they do even if they're ministers' wives. They're doomed anyway, so what does it matter if they have a bit of a romp with a telegram boy. All the telegram boys like Protestant ministers' wives. They might have maids but they answer doors themselves and say, One moment, please, and give you sixpence. I'd like to talk to them and ask them how it feels to be doomed but they might get offended and take back the sixpence.\nThe Irishmen working in England send their telegram money orders on Friday nights and all day Saturday and that's when we get the good tips. The minute we deliver one batch we're out with another.\nThe worst lanes are in the Irishtown, off High Street or Mungret Street, worse than Roden Lane or O'Keeffe's Lane or any lane I lived in. There are lanes with channels running down the middle. Mothers stand at doors and yell gardyloo when they empty their slop buckets. Children make paper boats or float matchboxes with little sails on the greasy water.\nWhen you ride into a lane the children call out, Here's the telegram boy, here's the telegram boy. They run to you and the women wait at the door. If you give a small child a telegram for his mother he's the hero of the family. Little girls know they're supposed to wait till the boys get their chance though they can get the telegram if they have no brothers. Women at the door will call to you that they have no money now but if you're in this lane tomorrow knock on the door for your tip, God bless you an' all belongin' to you.\nMrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry at the post office tell us every day our job is to deliver telegrams and nothing else. We are not to be doing things for people, going to the shop for groceries or any other kind of message. They don't care if people are dying in the bed. They don't care if people are legless, lunatic or crawling on the floor. We are to deliver the telegram and that's all. Mrs. O'Connell says, I know everything ye do, everything, for the people of Limerick have their eye on ye and there are reports which I have here in my drawers.\nA fine place to keep reports, says Toby Mackey under his breath.\nBut Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry don't know what it's like in the lane when you knock on a door and someone says come in and you go in and there's no light and there's a pile of rags on a bed in a corner the pile saying who is it and you say telegram and the pile of rags tells you would you ever go to the shop for me I'm starving with the hunger and I'd give me two eyes for a cup of tea and what are you going to do say I'm busy and ride off on your bike and leave the pile of rags there with a telegram money order that's pure useless because the pile of rags is helpless to get out of the bed to go to the post office to cash the bloody money order.\nWhat are you supposed to do?\nYou're told never never go to the post office to cash one of those money orders for anyone or you'll lose your job forever. But what are you supposed to do when an old man that was in the Boer War hundreds of years ago says his legs are gone and he'd be forever grateful if you'd go to Paddy Considine in the post office and tell him the situation and Paddy will surely cash the money order and keep two shillings for yourself grand boy that you are. Paddy Considine says no bother but don't tell anyone or I'd be out on my arse and so would you, son. The old man from the Boer War says he knows you have telegrams to deliver now but would you ever come back tonight and maybe go to the shop for him for he doesn't have a thing in the house and he's freezing on top of it. He sits in an old armchair in the corner covered with bits of blankets and a bucket behind the chair that stinks enough to make you sick and when you look at that old man in the dark corner you want to get a hose with hot water and strip him and wash him down and give him a big feed of rashers and eggs and mashed potatoes with loads of butter salt and onions.\nI want to take the man from the Boer War and the pile of rags in the bed and put them in a big sunny house in the country with birds chirping away outside the window and a stream gurgling.\nMrs. Spillane in Pump Lane off Carey's Road has two crippled twin children with big blond heads, small bodies, and bits of legs that dangle\nover the edges of the chairs. They look into the fire all day and say, Where's Daddy? They speak English like everybody else but they babble away to one another in a language they made up, Hung sup tea tea sup hung. Mrs. Spillane says that means, When are we getting our supper? She tells me she's lucky if her husband sends four pounds a month and she's beside herself with the abuse she gets from the Dispensary over him being in England. The children are only four and they're very bright even if they can't walk or take care of themselves. If they could walk, if they were any way normal, she'd pack up and move to England out of this godforsaken country that fought so long for freedom and look at the state of us, De Valera in his mansion above in Dublin the dirty oul' bastard and the rest of the politicians that can all go to hell, God forgive me. The priests can go to hell too and I won't ask God to forgive me for saying the likes of that. There they are, the priests and the nuns telling us Jesus was poor and 'tis no shame, lorries driving up to their houses with crates and barrels of whiskey and wine, eggs galore and legs of ham and they telling us what we should give up for Lent. Lent, my arse. What are we to give up when we have Lent all year long?\nI want to take Mrs. Spillane and her two blond crippled children and put them in that house in the country with the pile of rags and the man from the Boer War and wash everyone and let them all sit in the sun with the birds singing and the streams gurgling.\nI can't leave the pile of rags alone with a useless money order because the pile is an old woman, Mrs. Gertrude Daly, all twisted with every class of disease you can get in a Limerick lane, arthritis, rheumatism, falling hair, a nostril half gone from her jabbing at it with her finger, and you wonder what kind of a world is it when this old woman sits up from the rags and smiles at you with teeth that gleam white in the dark, her own teeth and perfect.\nThat's right, she says, me own teeth, and when I rot in the grave they'll find me teeth a hundred years from now all white an' shiny an' I'll be declared a saint.\nThe telegram money order, three pounds, is from her son. It has a message, Happy Birthday, Mammy, Your fond son, Teddy. She says, A wonder he can spare it, the little shit, trottin' around with every tart in Piccadilly. She asks if I'd ever do her a favor and cash the money order and get her a little Baby Powers whiskey at the pub, a loaf of bread, a pound of lard, seven potatoes, one for each day of the week. Would I boil\na potato for\nbread, bring\nO'Connor the\nsome soap so\ngrateful and\nmy troubles.\nher, mash it up with a lump of lard, give her a cut of\nher a drop of water to go with the whiskey? Would I go to chemist for ointment for her sores and while I'm at it bring she can give her body a good scrub and she'll be forever\nsay a prayer for me and here's a couple of shillings for all\nAh, no thanks, ma'am.\nTake the money. Little tip. You did me great favors.\nI couldn't, ma'am, the way you are.\nTake the money or I'll tell the post office you're not to deliver\nmy telegram anymore.\nOh, all right, ma'am. Thanks very much.\nGood night, son. Be good to your mother.\nGood night, Mrs. Daly.\nSchool starts in September and some days Michael stops at The\nAbbot's before the walk home to Laman Griffin's. On rainy days he says,\nCan I stay here tonight? and soon he doesn't want to go back to Laman Griffin's at all. He's worn out and hungry with two miles out and two miles back.\nWhen Mam comes looking for him I don't know what to say to her. I don't know how to look at her and I keep my eyes off to one side. She says, How's the job? as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's and I say, Grand, as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's. If the rain is too heavy for her to go home she stays in the small room upstairs with Alphie. She goes back to Laman's the next day but Michael stays and soon she's moving in herself bit by bit till she stops going to Laman's altogether.\nThe Abbot pays the rent every week. Mam gets the relief and the food dockets till someone informs on her and she's cut off from the Dispensary. She's told that if her son is bringing in a pound a week that's more than some families get on the dole and she should be grateful he has a job. Now I have to hand over my wages. Mam says, A pound? Is that all you get for riding around in all kinds of weather? This would be four dollars in America. Four dollars. And you couldn't feed a cat for four dollars in New York. If you were delivering telegrams for Western Union in New York you'd be earning twenty-five dollars a week and living in luxury. She always translates Irish money into American so that she won't forget and tries to convince everyone times were better over there. Some weeks she lets me keep two shillings but if I go to a film or buy a secondhand book there's nothing left, I won't be able to save for my fare, and I'll be stuck in Limerick till I'm an old man of twenty-five.\nMalachy writes from Dublin to say he's fed up and doesn't want to spend the rest of his life blowing a trumpet in the army band. He's home in a week and complains when he has to share the big bed with Michael, Alphie and me. He had his own army cot up there in Dublin with sheets and blankets and a pillow. Now he's back to overcoats and a bolster that sends up a cloud of feathers when you touch it. Mam says, Pity about you. I'm sorry for your troubles. The Abbot has his own bed, and my mother has the small room. We're all together again, no Laman tormenting us. We make tea and fried bread and sit on the kitchen floor. The Abbot says you're not supposed to be sitting on kitchen floors, what are tables and chairs for? He tells Mam that Frankie is not right in the head and Mam says we'll all catch our death from the damp of the floor. We sit on the floor and sing and Mam and The Abbot sit on chairs. She sings \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" and the Abbot sings \"The Road to Rasheen\" and we still don't know what his song is about. We sit on the floor and tell stories about things that happened, things that never happened and things that will happen when we all go to America.\nThere are slow days at the post office and we sit on the bench and talk. We can talk but we are not to laugh. Miss Barry says we should be grateful we're getting paid to sit there, bunch of idlers and streetboys that we are, and that there is to be no laughing. Getting paid for sitting and chatting is no laughing matter and the first titter out of any of us and out we go till we come to our senses and if the tittering continues we'll be reported to the proper authorities.\nThe boys talk about her under their breath. Toby Mackey says, What that oul' bitch needs is a good rub o' the relic, a good rub o' the brush. Her mother was a streetwalking flaghopper and her father escaped from a lunatic asylum with bunions on his balls and warts on his wank.\nThere is laughing along the bench and Miss Barry calls to us, I warned ye against the laughing. Mackey, what is it you're prattling about over there?\nI said we'd all be better off out in the fresh air on this fine day delivering telegrams, Miss Barry.\nI'm sure you did, Mackey. Your mouth is a lavatory. Did you hear\nme?\nI did, Miss Barry.\nYou have been heard on the stairs, Mackey. Yes, Miss Barry.\nShut up, Mackey.\nI will, Miss Barry.\nNot another word, Mackey.\nNo, Miss Barry.\nI said shut up, Mackey.\nAll right, Miss Barry.\nThat's the end of it, Mackey. Don't try me. I won't, Miss Barry.\nMother o' God give me patience.\nYes, Miss Barry.\nTake the last word, Mackey. Take it, take it, take it.\nI will, Miss Barry.\nToby Mackey is a temporary telegram boy like me. He saw a film\ncalled The Front Page and now he wants to go to America some day and be a tough newspaper reporter with a hat and a cigarette. He keeps a notebook in his pocket because a good reporter has to write down what happens. Facts. He has to write down facts not a lot of bloody poetry, which is all you hear in Limerick with men in pubs going on about our great sufferings under the English. Facts, Frankie. He writes down the number of telegrams he delivers and how far he travels. We sit on the bench making sure we don't laugh and he tells me that if we deliver forty telegrams a day that's two hundred a week and that's ten thousand a year and twenty thousand in our two years at the job. If we cycle one hundred and twenty-five miles in a week that's thirteen thousand miles in two years and that's halfway around the world, Frankie, and no wonder there isn't a scrap of flesh on our arses.\nToby says nobody knows Limerick like the telegram boy. We know every avenue, road, street, terrace, mews, place, close, lane. Jasus, says Toby, there isn't a door in Limerick we don't know. We knock on all kinds of doors, iron, oak, plywood. Twenty thousand doors, Frankie. We rap, kick, push. We ring and buzz bells. We shout and whistle, Telegram boy, telegram boy. We drop telegrams in letter boxes, shove them under doors, throw them over the transom. We climb in windows where people are bedridden. We fight off every dog who wants to turn us into dinner. You never know what's going to happen when you hand people their telegrams. They laugh and sing and dance and cry and scream and fall down in a weakness and you wonder if they'll wake up at all and give you the tip. It's not a bit like delivering telegrams in America where Mickey Rooney rides around in a film called The Human Comedy and people are pleasant and falling over themselves to give you a tip, inviting you in, giving you a cup of tea and a bun.\nToby Mackey says he has facts galore in his notebook and he doesn't give a fiddler's fart about anything and that's the way I'd like to be myself.\nMrs. O'Connell knows I like the country telegrams and if a day is sunny she gives me a batch of ten that will keep me away all morning and I don't have to return till after the dinner hour at noon. There are fine autumn days when the Shannon sparkles and the fields are green and glinting with silver morning dew. Smoke blows across fields and there's the sweet smell of turf fires. Cows and sheep graze in the fields and I wonder if these are the beasts the priest was talking about. I wouldn't be surprised because there's no end to the bulls climbing on cows, rams on sheep, stallions on mares, and they all have such big things it makes me break out in a sweat to look at them and I feel sorry for all the female creatures in the world who have to suffer like that though I wouldn't mind being a bull myself because they can do what they like and it's never a sin for an animal. I wouldn't mind going at myself here but you never know when a farmer might come along the road driving cows and sheep to a fair or to another field raising his stick and bidding you, Good day, young fella, grand morning, thank God and His Blessed Mother. A farmer that religious might be offended if he saw you breaking the Sixth Commandment forninst his field. Horses like to stick their heads over fences and hedges to see what's passing by and I stop and talk to them because they have big eyes and long noses that show how intelligent they are. Sometimes two birds will be singing to each other across a field and I have to stop and listen to them and if I stay long enough more birds will join till every tree and bush is alive with birdsong. If there's a stream gurgling under a bridge on the road, birds singing and cows mooing and lambs baaing, that's better than any band in a film. The smell of dinner bacon and cabbage wafting from a farmhouse makes me so weak with the hunger I climb into a field and stuff myself with blackberries for half an hour. I stick my face into the stream and drink icy water that's better than the lemonade in any fish and chip shop.\nWhen I'm finished delivering the telegrams there's enough time to go to the ancient monastery graveyard where my mother's relations are buried, the Guilfoyles and the Sheehans, where my mother wants to be buried. I can see from here the high ruins of Carrigogunnell Castle and there's plenty of time to cycle there, sit up on the highest wall, look at the Shannon flowing out to the Atlantic on its way to America and dream of the day I'll be sailing off myself.\nThe boys at the post office tell me I'm lucky to get the Carmody family telegram, a shilling tip, one of the biggest tips you'll ever get in Limerick. So why am I getting it? I'm the junior boy. They say, Well, sometimes Theresa Carmody answers the door. She has the consumption and they're afraid of catching it from her. She's seventeen, in and out of the sanatorium, and she'll never see eighteen. The boys at the post office say sick people like Theresa know there's little time left and that makes them mad for love and romance and everything. Everything. That's what the consumption does to you, say the boys at the post office.\nI cycle through wet November streets thinking of that shilling tip, and as I turn into the Carmody street the bicycle slides out from under me and I skid along the ground scraping my face and tearing open the back of my hand. Theresa Carmody opens the door. She has red hair. She had green eyes like the fields beyond Limerick. Her cheeks are bright pink and her skin is a fierce white. She says, Oh, you're all wet and bleeding.\nI skidded on my bike.\nCome in and I'll put something on your cuts.\nI wonder, Should I go in? I might get the consumption and that will be the end of me. I want to be alive when I'm fifteen and I want the shilling tip. Come in. You'll perish standing there.\nShe puts on the kettle for the tea. Then she dabs iodine on my cuts and I try to be a man and not whimper. She says, Oh, you're a great bit of a man. Go into the parlor and dry yourself before the fire. Look, why don't you take off your pants and dry them on the screen of the fire?\nAh, no.\nAh, do.\nI will.\nI drape my pants over the screen. I sit there watching the steam\nrise and I watch myself rise and I worry she might come in and see me in my excitement.\nThere she is with a plate of bread and jam and two cups of tea. Lord, she says, you might be a scrawny bit of a fellow but that's a fine boyo you have there.\nShe puts the plate and the cups on a table by the fire and there they stay. With her thumb and forefinger she takes the tip of my excitement and leads me across the room to a green sofa against the wall and all the time my head is filled with sin and iodine and fear of consumption and the shilling tip and her green eyes and she's on the sofa don't stop or I'll die and she's crying and I'm crying for I don't know what's happening to me if I'm killing myself catching consumption from her mouth I'm riding to heaven I'm falling off a cliff and if this is a sin I don't give a fiddler's fart.\nWe take our ease on the sofa a while till she says, Don't you have more telegrams to deliver? and when we sit up she gives a little cry, Oh, I'm bleeding.\nWhat's up with you?\nI think it's because it's the first time.\nI tell her, Wait a minute. I bring the bottle from the kitchen and\nsplash the iodine on her injury. She leaps from the sofa, dances around the parlor like a wild one and runs into the kitchen to douse herself with water. After she dries herself she says, Lord, you're very innocent. You're not supposed to be pouring iodine on girls like that.\nI thought you were cut.\nFor weeks after that I deliver the telegram. Sometimes we have the excitement on the sofa but there are other days she has the cough and you can see the weakness on her. She never tells me she has the weakness. She never tells me she has the consumption. The boys at the post office say I must have been having a great time with the shilling tip and Theresa Carmody. I never tell them I stopped taking the shilling tip. I never tell them about the green sofa and the excitement. I never tell them of the pain that comes when she opens the door and I can see the weakness on her and all I want to do then is make tea for her and sit with my arms around her on the green sofa.\nOne Saturday I'm told to deliver the telegram to Theresa's mother at her job in Woolworth's. I try to be casual. Mrs. Carmody, I always deliver the telegram to your, I think your daughter, Theresa?\nYes, she's in the hospital.\nIs she in the sanatorium?\nI said she's in the hospital.\nShe's like everyone else in Limerick, ashamed of the TB, and she\ndoesn't give me a shilling or any kind of tip. I cycle out to the\nsanatorium to see Theresa. They say you have to be a relation and you have to be adult. I tell them I'm her cousin and I'll be fifteen in August. They tell me go away. I cycle to the Franciscan church to pray for Theresa. St. Francis, would you please talk to God. Tell Him it wasn't Theresa's fault. I could have refused that telegram Saturday after Saturday. Tell God Theresa was not responsible for the excitement on the sofa because that's what the consumption does to you. It doesn't matter anyway, St. Francis, because I love Theresa. I love her as much as you love any bird or beast or fish and will you tell God take the consumption away and I promise I'll never go near her again.\nThe next Saturday they give me the Carmody telegram. From halfway up the street I can see the blinds are drawn. I can see the black crepe wreath on the door. I can see the white purple-lined mourning card. I can see beyond the door and walls where Theresa and I tumbled naked and wild on the green sofa and I know now she is in hell and all because of me.\nI slip the telegram under the door and cycle back down to the Franciscan church to beg for the repose of Theresa's soul. I pray to every statue, to the stained glass windows, the Stations of the Cross. I swear I'll lead a life of faith, hope and charity, poverty, chastity and obedience.\nNext day, Sunday, I go to four Masses. I do the Stations of the Cross three times. I say rosaries all day. I go without food and drink and wherever I find a quiet place I cry and beg God and the Virgin Mary to have mercy on the soul of Theresa Carmody.\nOn Monday I follow the funeral to the graveyard on my post office bicycle. I stand behind a tree a distance from the grave. Mrs. Carmody weeps and moans. Mr. Carmody snuffles and looks puzzled. The priest recites the Latin prayers and sprinkles the coffin with holy water.\nI want to go to the priest, to Mr. and Mrs. Carmody. I want to tell them how I'm the one who sent Theresa to hell. They can do whatever they like with me. Abuse me. Revile me. Throw grave dirt at me. But I stay behind the tree till the mourners leave and the grave diggers fill in the grave.\nFrost is already whitening the fresh earth on the grave and I think of Theresa cold in the coffin, the red hair, the green eyes. I can't understand the feelings going through me but I know that with all the people who died in my family and all the people who died in the lanes around me and all the people who left I never had a pain like this in my heart and I hope I never will again.\nIt's getting dark. I walk my bicycle out of the graveyard. I have telegrams to deliver.\nXVI\nMrs. O'Connell gives me telegrams to deliver to Mr. Harrington, the Englishman with the dead wife that was born and bred in Limerick. The boys at the post office say sympathy telegrams are a waste of time. People just cry and moan with the grief and they think they're excused from the tip. They'll ask you if you'd like to come in for a look at the departed and a prayer by the bed. That wouldn't be so bad if they offered you a drop of sherry and a ham sandwich. Oh, no, they're happy to get your prayer but you're only a telegram boy and you're lucky if you get a\ndry biscuit. Older boys at the post office say you have to play your cards right to get the grief tip. If you're asked in to say a prayer you have to kneel by the corpse, give a powerful sigh, bless yourself, drop your forehead to the bedclothes so they won't see your face, let your shoulders shake like one collapsing with sorrow, hold on to the bed with your two hands as if they're going to have to tear you away to deliver the rest of your telegrams, make sure your cheeks are glinting with tears or the spit you dabbed on, and if you don't get a tip after all that push the next batch of telegrams under the door or fire them over the transom and leave them to their grief.\nThis isn't my first time delivering telegrams to the Harrington house. Mr. Harrington is always away on business for the insurance company and Mrs. Harrington is generous with the tip. But she's gone and Mr. Harrington answers the doorbell. His eyes are red and he sniffles. He says, Are you Irish?\nIrish? What else would I be standing there on his doorstep in Limerick with a batch of telegrams in my hand? I am, sir. He says, Come in. Put the telegrams on the hall stand. He shuts the hall door, locks it, puts the key in his pocket and I think, Aren't Englishmen very peculiar.\nYou'll want to see her, of course. You'll want to see what you people have done to her with your damn tuberculosis. Race of ghouls. Follow me.\nHe leads me first to the kitchen where he picks up a plate of ham sandwiches and two bottles, and then upstairs. Mrs. Harrington looks lovely in the bed, blond, pink, peaceful.\nThis is my wife. She may be Irish but she doesn't look it, thank God. Like you. Irish. You'll need a drink, of course. You Irish quaff at every turn. Barely weaned before you clamor for the whiskey bottle, the pint of stout. You'll have what, whiskey, sherry?\nAh, a lemonade will be lovely.\nI am mourning my wife not celebrating the bloody citrus. You'll have a sherry. Swill from bloody Catholic fascist Spain.\nI gulp the sherry. He refills my glass and goes to refill his own with whiskey. Damn. Whiskey all gone. Stay here. Do you hear me? I'm going to the pub for another bottle of whiskey. Stay till I come back. Don't move.\nI'm confused, dizzy from the sherry. I don't know what you're supposed to do with grieving Englishmen. Mrs. Harrington, you look lovely in the bed. But you're a Protestant, already doomed, in hell, like Theresa. Priest said, Outside the Church there is no salvation. Wait, I might be able to save your soul. Baptize you Catholic. Make up for what I did to Theresa. I'll get some water. Oh, God, the door is locked. Why? Maybe you're not dead at all? Watching me. Are you dead, Mrs. Harrington? I'm not afraid. Your face is icy. Oh, you're dead all right. I'll baptize you with sherry from bloody Catholic fascist Spain. I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son, the- What the bloody hell are you doing? Get off my wife, you wretched Papist twit. What primitive Paddy ritual is this? Did you touch her? Did you? I'll wring your scrawny neck.\nI - I, -\nOi, Oi, speak English, you scrap.\nI was just, a little sherry to get her into heaven.\nHeaven? We had heaven, Ann, I, our daughter, Emily. You'll never lay your pink piggy eyes on her. Oh, Christ, I can't stand it. Here, more sherry.\nAh, no, thanks.\nAh, no thanks. That puny Celtic whine. You people love your alcohol. Helps you crawl and whine better. Of course you want food. You have the collapsed look of a starving Paddy. Here. Ham. Eat.\nAh, no thanks.\nAh, no thanks. Say that again and I'll ram the ham up your arse. He waves a ham sandwich at me, with the heel of his hand pushes it\ninto my mouth.\nHe collapses into a chair. Oh, God, God, what am I to do? Must rest\na moment.\nMy stomach heaves. I rush to the window, stick my head out and\nthrow up. He leaps from the chair and charges me.\nYou, you, God blast you to hell, you vomited on my wife's rosebush. He lunges at me, misses, falls to the floor. I climb out the\nwindow, hang on to the ledge. He's at the window, grabbing at my hands. I let go, drop to the rosebush, into the ham sandwich and sherry I've just thrown up. I'm pricked by rose thorns, stung, my ankle is twisted. He's at the window, barking, Come back here, you Irish runt. He'll report me to the post office. He hits me in the back with the whiskey bottle, pleads, Will you not watch one hour with me?\nHe pelts me with sherry glasses, whiskey glasses, assorted ham sandwiches, items from his wife's dressing table, powders, creams, brushes.\nI climb on my bike and wobble through the streets of Limerick, dizzy with sherry and pain. Mrs. O'Connell attacks me, Seven telegrams, one address, and you're gone all day.\nI was, I was,\nYou was. You was. Drunk is what you was. Drunk is what you are. Reeking. Oh, we heard. That nice man rang, Mr. Harrington, lovely Englishman that sounds like James Mason. Lets you in to say a prayer for his poor wife and next thing you're out the window with the sherry and the ham. Your poor mother. What she brought into the world.\nHe made me eat the ham, drink the sherry.\nMade you? Jesus, that's a good one. Made you. Mr. Harrington is a refined Englishman and there is no reason for him to lie and we don't want your kind in this post office, people that can't keep their hands off the ham and sherry, so hand in your telegram pouch and bicycle for your days are done in this post office.\nBut I need the job. I have to save and go to America.\nAmerica. Sad day when America lets in the likes of you.\nI hobble through the streets of Limerick. I'd like to go back and\nthrow a brick through Mr. Harrington's window. No. Respect for the dead. I'll go across the Sarsfield Bridge and out the riverbank where I can lie down somewhere in the bushes. I don't know how I can go home and tell my mother I lost my job. Have to go home. Have to tell her. Can't stay out the riverbank all night. She'd be frantic.\nMam begs the post office to take me back. They say no. They never heard the likes. Telegram boy mauling corpse. Telegram boy fleeing scene with ham and sherry. He will never set foot in the post office again. No.\nShe gets a letter from the parish priest. Take the boy back, says the parish priest. Oh, yes, Father, indeed, says the post office. They'll\nlet me stay till my sixteenth birthday, not a minute longer. Besides, says Mrs. O'Connell, when you think of what the English did to us for eight hundred years that man had no right to complain over a little ham and sherry. Compare a little ham and sherry to the Great Famine and where are you? If my poor husband was alive and I told him what you did he'd say you struck a blow, Frank McCourt, struck a blow.\nEvery Saturday morning I swear I'll go to confession and tell the priest of my impure acts at home, on lonely boreens around Limerick with cows and sheep gawking, on the heights of Carrigogunnell with the world looking up.\nI'll tell him about Theresa Carmody and how I sent her to hell, and that will be the end of me, driven from the Church.\nTheresa is a torment to me. Every time I deliver a telegram to her street, every time I pass the graveyard I feel the sin growing in me like an abscess and if I don't go to confession soon I'll be nothing but an abscess riding around on a bicycle with people pointing and telling each other, There he is, there's Frankie McCourt, the dirty thing that sent Theresa Carmody to hell.\nI look at people going to Communion on Sundays, everyone in a state of grace, returning to their seats with God in their mouths, peaceful, easy, ready to die at any moment and go straight to heaven or go home to their rashers and eggs without a worry in the world.\nI'm worn out from being the worst sinner in Limerick. I want to get rid of this sin and have rashers and eggs and no guilt, no torment. I want to be ordinary.\nThe priests tell us all the time that God's mercy is infinite but how can any priest give absolution to someone like me who delivers telegrams and winds up in a state of excitement on a green sofa with a girl dying of the galloping consumption.\nI cycle all around Limerick with telegrams and stop at every church. I ride from Redemptorists to Jesuits to Augustinians to Dominicans to Franciscans. I kneel before the statue of St. Francis of Assisi and beg him to help me but I think he's too disgusted with me. I kneel with people in the pews next to confessionals but when my turn comes I can't breathe, my heart pounds, my forehead turns cold and clammy and I run from the church.\nI swear I'll go to confession at Christmas. I can't. Easter. I can't. Weeks and months pass and it's a year since Theresa died. I'll go on her anniversary but I can't. I'm fifteen now and I pass churches without stopping. I'll have to wait till I go to America where there are priests like Bing Crosby in Going My Way who won't kick me out of the confessional like Limerick priests.\nI still have the sin in me, the abscess, and I hope it doesn't kill me entirely before I see the American priest.\nThere's a telegram for an old woman, Mrs. Brigid Finucane. She says, How old are you, by?\nFifteen and a half, Mrs. Finucane.\nYoung enough to make a fool of yourself and ould enough to know better. Are you shmart, by? Are you anyway intelligent?\nI can read and write, Mrs. Finucane.\nArrah, there are people above in the lunatic asylum can read and write. Can you write a letter?\nI can.\nShe wants me to write letters to her customers. If you need a suit or dress for your child you can go to her. She gives you a ticket to a shop and they give you the clothes. She gets a discount and charges you the full price and interest on top. You pay her back weekly. Some of her customers fall behind in their payments and they need threatening letters. She says, I'll give you threepence for every letter you write and another threepence if it brings a payment. If you want the job come here on Thursday and Friday nights, and bring your own paper and envelopes.\nI'm desperate for that job. I want to go to America. But I have no money for paper and envelopes. Next day I'm delivering a telegram to Woolworth's and there is the answer, a whole section packed with paper and envelopes. I have no money so I have to help myself. But how? Two dogs save the day for me, two dogs at the door of Woolworth's stuck together after the excitement. They yelp and run in circles. Customers and sales clerks giggle and pretend to be looking someplace else and while they're busy pretending I slip paper and envelopes under my sweater, out the door and off on my bike far from stuck dogs.\nMrs. Finucane looks suspicious. That's very fancy stationery you have there, by. Is that your mother's? You'll give that back when you get the money, won't you, by?\nOh, I will.\nFrom now on I'm never to come to her front door. There's a lane behind her house and I'm to come in the back door for fear someone might see me.\nIn a large ledger she gives me the names and addresses of six customers behind in their payments. Threaten 'em, by. Frighten the life out of 'em.\nMy first letter,\nDear Mrs. O'Brien,\nInasmuch as you have not seen fit to pay me what you owe me I may be forced to resort to legal action. There's your son, Michael, parading around the world in his new suit which I paid for while I myself have barely a crust to keep body and soul together. I am sure you don't want to languish in the dungeons of Limerick jail far from friends and family.\nI remain, yours in litigious anticipation, Mrs. Brigid Finucane She tells me, That's a powerful letter, by, better than anything you'd read in the Limerick Leader. That word, inasmuch, that's a holy terror of a word. What does it mean?\nI think it means this is your last chance.\nI write five more letters and she gives me money for stamps. On my way to the post office I think, Why should I squander money on stamps when I have two legs to deliver the letters myself in the dead of night? When you're poor a threatening letter is a threatening letter no matter how it comes in the door.\nI run through the lanes of Limerick shoving letters under doors, praying no one will see me.\nThe next week Mrs. Finucane is squealing with joy. Four of 'em paid. Oh, sit down now and write more, by. Put the fear of God in 'em.\nWeek after week my threatening letters grow sharper and sharper. I begin to throw in words I hardly understand myself.\nDear Mrs. O'Brien,\nInasmuch as you have not succumbed to the imminence of litigation in our previous epistle be advised that we are in consultation with our barrister above in Dublin.\nNext week Mrs. O'Brien pays. She came in tremblin' with tears in her eyes, by, and she promised she'd never miss another payment.\nOn Friday nights Mrs. Finucane sends me to a pub for a bottle of sherry. You're too young for sherry, by. You can make yourself a nice cup of tea but you have to use the tea leaves left over from this morning. No, you can't have a piece of bread with the prices they're charging. Bread is it? Next thing you'll be asking for an egg.\nShe rocks by the fire, sipping her sherry, counting the money in the purse on her lap, entering payments in her ledger before she locks everything in the trunk under her bed upstairs. After a few sherries she tells me what a lovely thing it is to have a little money so you can leave it to the Church for Masses to be said for the repose of your soul. It makes her so happy to think of priests saying Masses for her years and years after she's dead and buried.\nSometimes she falls asleep and if the purse drops to the floor I help myself to an extra few shillings for the overtime and the use of all the big new words. There will be less money for the priests and their Masses but how many Masses does a soul need and surely I'm entitled to a few pounds after the way the Church slammed doors in my face? They wouldn't let me be an altar boy, a secondary school pupil, a missionary with the White Fathers. I don't care. I have a post office savings account and if I keep writing successful threatening letters, helping myself to the odd few shillings from her purse and keeping the stamp money, I'll have my escape money to America. If my whole family dropped from the hunger I wouldn't touch this money in the post office.\nOften I have to write threatening letters to neighbors and friends of my mother and I worry they might discover me. They complain to Mam, That oul' bitch, Finucane, below in Irishtown, sent me a threatening letter. What kind of a demon outa hell would torment her own kind with a class of a letter that I can't make head nor tail of anyway with words never heard on land or sea. The person that would write that letter is worse than Judas or any informer for the English.\nMy mother says anyone that writes such letters should be boiled in oil and have his fingernails pulled out by blind people.\nI'm sorry for their troubles but there's no other way for me to save the money for America. I know that someday I'll be a rich Yank and send home hundreds of dollars and my family will never have to worry about threatening letters again.\n***\nSome of the temporary telegram boys are taking the permanent exam in August. Mrs. O'Connell says, You should take that exam, Frank McCourt. You have a bit of a brain in your head and you'd pass it no bother. You'd be a postman in no time and a great help to your poor mother.\nMam says I should take it, too, become a postman, save up, go to America and be a postman over there and wouldn't that be a lovely life.\nI'm delivering a telegram to South's pub on a Saturday and Uncle Pa Keating is sitting there, all black as usual. He says, Have a lemonade there, Frankie, or is it a pint you want now that you're near sixteen?\nLemonade, Uncle Pa, thanks.\nYou'll want your first pint the day you're sixteen, won't you? I will but my father won't be here to get it for me.\nDon't worry about that. I know 'tis not the same without your\nfather but I'll get you the first pint. 'Tis what I'd do if I had a son. Come here the night before you're sixteen.\nI will, Uncle Pa.\nI hear you're taking that exam for the post office?\nI am.\nWhy would you do a thing like that? 'Tis a good job and I'd be a\npostman in no time and it has the pension.\nAh, pension my arse. Sixteen years of age an' talking about the\npension. Is it coddin' me you are? Do you hear what I said, Frankie? Pension my arse. If you pass the exam you'll stay in the post office nice and secure the rest of your life. You'll marry a Brigid and have five little Catholics and grow little roses in your garden. You'll be dead in your head before you're thirty and dried in your ballocks the year before. Make up your own bloody mind and to hell with the safeshots and the begrudgers. Do you hear me, Frankie McCourt?\nI do, Uncle Pa. That's what Mr. O'Halloran said.\nWhat did he say?\nMake up your own mind.\nTrue for Mr. O'Halloran. 'Tis your life, make your own decisions\nand to hell with the begrudgers, Frankie. In the heel o' the hunt you'll be going to America anyway, won't you?\nI will, Uncle Pa.\nThe day of the exam I'm excused from work. There's a sign in an office window on O'Connell Street, SMART BOY WANTED, NEAT HANDWRITING, GOOD AT SUMS, APPLY HERE TO MANAGER, MR. MCCAFFREY, EASONS LTD.\nI stand outside the place of the exam, the house of the Limerick Protestant Young Men's Association. There are boys from all over Limerick climbing the steps to take the exam and a man at the door is handing them sheets of paper and pencils and barking at them to hurry up, hurry up. I look at the man at the door, I think of Uncle Pa Keating and what he said, I think of the sign in Easons' office, SMART BOY WANTED. I don't want to go in that door and pass that exam for if I do I'll be a permanent telegram boy with a uniform, then a postman, then a clerk selling stamps for the rest of my life. I'll be in Limerick forever, growing roses with my head dead and my ballocks all dried up.\nThe man at the door says, You, are you coming in here or are you goin' to stand there with your face hanging out?\nI want to say to the man, Kiss my arse, but I still have a few weeks left in the post office and he might report me. I shake my head and walk up the street where a smart boy is wanted.\nThe manager, Mr. McCaffrey, says, I would like to see a specimen of your handwriting, to see, in short, if you have a decent fist. Sit down there at that table. Write your name and address and write me a paragraph explaining why you came here for this job and how you propose to rise in the ranks of Eason and Son, Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assiduity where there is great opportunity in this company for a boy that will keep his eye on the guidon ahead and guard his flanks from the siren call of sin.\nI write,\nFrank McCourt,\n4 Little Barrington Street,\nLimerick City,\nCounty Limerick,\nIreland\nI am applying for this job so that I can rise to the highest ranks of Easons Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assadooty knowing that if I keep my eyes ahead and protect my flanks I'll be safe from all temptation and a credit to Easons and Ireland in general.\nWhat's this? says Mr. McCaffrey. Do we have here a twisting of the truth?\nI don't know, Mr. McCaffrey.\nLittle Barrington Street. That's a lane. Why are you calling it a street? You live in a lane, not a street.\nThey call it a street, Mr. McCaffrey.\nDon't be getting above yourself, boy.\nOh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.\nYou live in a lane and that means you have nowhere to go but up. Do\nyou understand that, McCourt?\nI do, sir.\nYou have to work your way out of the lane, McCourt. I do, Mr. McCaffrey.\nYou have the cut and jib of a lane boy, McCourt. Yes, Mr. McCaffrey.\nYou have the look of the lane all over you. All over you from poll to toe cap. Don't try to fool the populace, McCourt. You'd have to rise early in the morning to fool the likes of me.\nOh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.\nThen there's the eyes. Very sore eyes you have there. Can you see? I can, Mr. McCaffrey.\nYou can read and write but can you do addition and subtraction?\nI can, Mr. McCaffrey.\nWell, I don't know what the policy is on sore eyes. I would have to\nring Dublin and see where they stand on sore eyes. But your writing is clear, McCourt. A good fist. We'll take you on pending the decision on the sore eyes. Monday morning. Half six at the railway station.\nIn the morning? In the morning. We don't give out the bloody morning papers at night, do we?\nNo, Mr. McCaffrey.\nAnother thing. We distribute The Irish Times, a Protestant paper, run by the freemasons in Dublin. We pick it up at the railway station. We count it. We take it to the newsagents. But we don't read it. I don't want to see you reading it. You could lose the Faith and by the look of those eyes you could lose your sight. Do you hear me, McCourt?\nI do, Mr. McCaffrey.\nNo IrishTimes, and when you come in next week I'll tell you about all the English filth you're not to read in this office. Do you hear me?\nI do, Mr. McCaffrey.\nMrs. O'Connell has the tight mouth and she won't look at me. She says to Miss Barry, I hear a certain upstart from the lanes walked away from the post office exam. Too good for it, I suppose.\nTrue for you, says Miss Barry.\nToo good for us, I suppose.\nTrue for you.\nDo you think he'd ever tell us why he didn't take the exam?\nOh, he might, says Miss Barry, if we went down on our two knees. I tell her, I want to go to America, Mrs. O'Connell.\nDid you hear that, Miss Barry?\nI did, indeed, Mrs. O'Connell.\nHe spoke.\nHe did, indeed.\nHe will rue the day, Miss Barry.\nRue he will, Mrs. O'Connell.\nMrs. O'Connell talks past me to the boys waiting on the bench for\ntheir telegrams, This is Frankie McCourt who thinks he's too good for the post office.\nI don't think that, Mrs. O'Connell.\nAnd who asked you to open your gob, Mr. High and Mighty? Too grand for us, isn't he, boys?\nHe is, Mrs. O'Connell.\nAnd after all we did for him, giving him the telegrams with the good tips, sending him to the country on fine days, taking him back after his disgraceful behavior with Mr. Harrington, the Englishman, disrespecting the body of poor Mrs. Harrington, stuffing himself with ham sandwiches, getting fluthered drunk on sherry, jumping out the window and destroying every rosebush in sight, coming in here three sheets to the wind, and who knows what else he did delivering telegrams for two years, who knows indeed, though we have a good idea, don't we, Miss Barry?\nWe do, Mrs. O'Connell, though 'twouldn't be a fit subject to be talking about.\nShe whispers to Miss Barry and they look at me and shake their heads.\nA disgrace he is to Ireland and his poor mother. I hope she never finds out. But what would you expect of one born in America and his father from the North. We put up with all that and still took him back.\nShe keeps talking past me again to the boys on the bench.\nGoing to work for Easons he is, working for that pack of freemasons and Protestants above in Dublin. Too good for the post office but ready and willing to deliver all kinds of filthy English magazines all over Limerick. Every magazine he touches will be a mortal sin. But he's leaving now, so he is, and a sorry day it is for his poor mother that prayed for a son with a pension to take care of her in her latter days. So here, take your wages and go from the sight of us.\nMiss Barry says, He's a bad boy, isn't he, boys?\nHe is, Miss Barry.\nI don't know what to say. I don't know what I did wrong. Should I\nsay I'm sorry? Good-bye?\nI lay my belt and pouch on Mrs. O'Connell's desk. She glares at me,\nGo on. Go to your job at Easons. Go from us. Next boy, come up for your telegrams.\nThey're back at work and I'm down the stairs to the next part of my life.\nXVII\nI don't know why Mrs. O'Connell had to shame me before the whole world, and I don't think I'm too good for the post office or anything else. How could I with my hair sticking up, pimples dotting my face, my eyes red and oozing yellow, my teeth crumbling with the rot, no shoulders, no flesh on my arse after cycling thirteen thousand miles to deliver twenty thousand telegrams to every door in Limerick and regions beyond?\nMrs. O'Connell said a long time ago she knew everything about every telegram boy. She must know about the times I went at myself on top of Carrigogunnell, milkmaids gawking, little boys looking up.\nShe must know about Theresa Carmody and the green sofa, how I got her into a state of sin and sent her to hell, the worst sin of all, worse than Carrigogunnell a thousand times. She must know I never went to confession after Theresa, that I'm doomed to hell myself.\nA person that commits a sin like that is never too good for the post office or anything else.\nThe barman at South's remembers me from the time I sat with Mr. Hannon, Bill Galvin, Uncle Pa Keating, black white black. He remembers my father, how he spent his wages and his dole while singing patriotic songs and making speeches from the dock like a condemned rebel.\nAnd what is it you'd like? says the barman.\nI'm here to meet Uncle Pa Keating and have my first pint.\nOh, begod, is that a fact? He'll be here in a minute and sure\nthere's no reason why I shouldn't draw his pint and maybe draw your first pint, is there now?\nThere isn't, sir.\nUncle Pa comes in and tells me sit next to him against the wall. The barman brings the pints, Uncle Pa pays, lifts his glass, tells the men in the pub, This is my nephew, Frankie McCourt, son of Angela Sheehan, the sister of my wife, having his first pint, here's to your health and long life, Frankie, may you live to enjoy the pint but not too much.\nThe men lift their pints, nod, drink, and there are creamy lines on their lips and mustaches. I take a great gulp of my pint and Uncle Pa tells me, Slow down for the love o' Jasus, don't drink it all, there's more where that came from as long as the Guinness family stays strong and healthy.\nI tell him I want to stand him a pint with my last wages from the post office but he says, No, take the money home to your mother and you can stand me a pint when you come home from America flushed with success and the heat from a blonde hanging on your arm.\nThe men in the pub are talking about the terrible state of the world and how in God's name Hermann Goering escaped the hangman an hour before the hanging. The Yanks are over there in Nuremberg declaring they don't know how the Nazi bastard hid that pill. Was it in his ear? Up his nostril? Up his arse? Surely the Yanks looked in every hole and cranny of every Nazi they captured and still Hermann wiped their eye. There you are. It shows you can sail across the Atlantic, land in Normandy, bomb Germany off the face of the earth, but when all's said and done they can't find a little pill planted in the far reaches of Goering's fat arse.\nUncle Pa buys me another pint. It's harder to drink because it fills me and makes my belly bulge. The men are talking about\nconcentration camps and the poor Jews that never harmed a soul, men, women, children crammed into ovens, children, mind you, what harm could they do, little shoes scattered everywhere, crammed in, and the pub is misty and the voices fading in and out. Uncle Pa says, Are you all right? You're as white as a sheet. He takes me to the lavatory and the two of us have a good long piss against the wall which keeps moving back and forth. I can't go into the pub again, cigarette smoke, stale Guinness, Goering's fat arse, small shoes scattered, can't go in again, good night, Uncle Pa, thanks, and he tells me go straight home to my mother, straight home, oh, he doesn't know about the excitement in the loft or the excitement on the green sofa or me in such a state of doom that if I died now I'd be in hell in a wink.\nUncle Pa goes back to his pint. I'm out on O'Connell Street and why shouldn't I take the few steps to the Jesuits and tell all my sins this last night I'll be fifteen. I ring the bell at the priests'house and a big man answers, Yes? I tell him, I want to go to confession, Father. He says, I'm not a priest. Don't call me father. I'm a brother.\nAll right, Brother. I want to go to confession before I'm sixteen tomorrow. State o' grace on my birthday.\nHe says, Go away. You're drunk. Child like you drunk as a lord ringing for a priest at this hour. Go away or I'll call the guards.\nAh, don't. Ah, don't. I only want to go to confession. I'm doomed. You're drunk and you're not in a proper spirit of repentance.\nHe closes the door in my face. Another door closed in the face, but\nI'm sixteen tomorrow and I ring again. The brother opens the door, swings me around, kicks my arse and sends me tripping down the steps.\nHe says, Ring this bell again and I'll break your hand.\nJesuit brothers are not supposed to talk like that. They're supposed to be like Our Lord, not walking the world threatening people's hands.\nI'm dizzy. I'll go home to bed. I hold on to railings along Barrington Street and keep to the wall going down the lane. Mam is by the fire smoking a Woodbine, my brothers upstairs in the bed. She says, That's a nice state to come home in.\nIt's hard to talk but I tell her I had my first pint with Uncle Pa. No father to get me the first pint.\nYour Uncle Pa should know better.\nI stagger to a chair and she says, Just like your father. I try to control the way my tongue moves in my mouth. I'd rather be, I'd rather, rather be like my father than Laman Griffin.\nShe turns away from me and looks into the ashes in the range but I won't leave her alone because I had my pint, two pints, and I'm sixteen tomorrow, a man.\nDid you hear me? I'd rather be like my father than Laman Griffin. She stands up and faces me. Mind your tongue, she says.\nMind your own bloody tongue.\nDon't talk to me like that. I'm your mother.\nI'll talk to you any bloody way I like.\nYou have a mouth like a messenger boy.\nDo I? Do I? Well, I'd rather be a messenger boy than the likes of\nLaman Griffin oul' drunkard with the snotty nose and his loft and people climbing up there with him.\nShe walks away from me and I follow her upstairs to the small room. She turns, Leave me alone, leave me alone, and I keep barking at her,\nLaman Griffin, Laman Griffin, till she pushes me, Get out of this room, and I slap her on the cheek so that tears jump in her eyes and there's a small whimpering sound from her, You'll never have the chance to do that again, and I back away from her because there's another sin on my long list and I'm ashamed of myself.\nI fall into my bed, clothes and all, and wake up in the middle of the night puking on my pillow, my brothers complaining of the stink, telling me clean up, I'm a disgrace. I hear my mother crying and I want to tell her I'm sorry but why should I after what she did with Laman Griffin.\nIn the morning my small brothers are gone to school, Malachy is out looking for a job, Mam is at the fire drinking tea. I place my wages on the table by her elbow and turn to go. She says, Do you want a cup of tea?\nNo.\n'Tis your birthday.\nI don't care.\nShe calls up the lane after me, You should have something in your\nstomach, but I give her my back and turn the corner without answering. I still want to tell her I'm sorry but if I do I'll want to tell her she's the cause of it all, that she should not have climbed to the loft that night and I don't give a fiddler's fart anyway because I'm still writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane and saving to go to America.\nI have the whole day before I go to Mrs. Finucane to write the threatening letters and I wander down Henry Street till the rain drives me into the Franciscan church where St. Francis stands with his birds and lambs. I look at him and wonder why I ever prayed to him. No, I didn't pray, I begged.\nI begged him to intercede for Theresa Carmody but he never did a thing, stood up there on his pedestal with the little smile, the birds, the lambs, and didn't give a fiddler's fart about Theresa or me.\nI'm finished with you, St. Francis. Moving on. Francis. I don't know why they ever gave me that name. I'd be better off if they called me Malachy, one a king, the other a great saint. Why didn't you heal Theresa? Why did you let her go to hell? You let my mother climb to the loft. You let me get into a state of doom. Little children's shoes scattered in concentration camps. I have the abscess again. It's in my chest and I'm hungry.\nSt. Francis is no help, he won't stop the tears bursting out of my two eyes, the sniffling and choking and the God oh Gods that have me on my knees with my head on the back of the pew before me and I'm so weak with the hunger and the crying I could fall on the floor and would you please help me God or St. Francis because I'm sixteen today and I hit my mother and sent Theresa to hell and wanked all over Limerick and the county beyond and I dread the millstone around my neck.\nThere is an arm around my shoulders, a brown robe, click of black rosary beads, a Franciscan priest.\nMy child, my child, my child.\nI'm a child and I lean against him, little Frankie on his father's lap, tell me all about Cuchulain, Dad, my story that Malachy can't have or Freddie Leibowitz on the swings.\nMy child, sit here with me. Tell me what troubles you. Only if you want to. I am Father Gregory.\nI'm sixteen today, Father.\nOh, lovely, lovely, and why should that be a trouble to you?\nI drank my first pint last night.\nYes? I hit my mother.\nGod help us, my child. But He will forgive you. Is there anything\nelse?\nI can't tell you, Father.\nWould you like to go to confession?\nI can't, Father. I did terrible things.\nGod forgives all who repent. He sent His only Beloved Son to die\nfor us.\nI can't tell, Father. I can't.\nBut you could tell St. Francis, couldn't you?\nHe doesn't help me anymore.\nBut you love him, don't you?\nI do. My name is Francis.\nThen tell him. We'll sit here and you'll tell him the things that\ntrouble you. If I sit and listen it will only be a pair of ears for St. Francis and Our Lord. Won't that help?\nI talk to St. Francis and tell him about Margaret, Oliver, Eugene, my father singing Roddy McCorley and bringing home no money, my father sending no money from England, Theresa and the green sofa, my terrible sins on Carrigogunnell, why couldn't they hang Hermann Goering for what he did to the little children with shoes scattered around concentration camps, the Christian Brother who closed the door in my face, the time they wouldn't let me be an altar boy, my small brother Michael walking up the lane with the broken shoe clacking, my bad eyes that I'm ashamed of, the Jesuit brother who closed the door in my face, the tears in Mam's eyes when I slapped her.\nFather Gregory says, Would you like to sit and be silent, perhaps pray a few minutes?\nHis brown robe is rough against my cheek and there's a smell of soap. He looks at St. Francis and the tabernacle and nods and I suppose he's talking to God. Then he tells me kneel, gives me absolution, tells me say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, three Glory Bes. He tells me God forgives me and I must forgive myself, that God loves me and I must love myself for only when you love God in yourself can you love all God's creatures.\nBut I want to know about Theresa Carmody in hell, Father.\nNo, my child. She is surely in heaven. She suffered like the martyrs in olden times and God knows that's penance enough. You can be sure the sisters in the hospital didn't let her die without a priest.\nAre you sure, Father?\nI am, my child.\nHe blesses me again, asks me to pray for him, and I'm happy\ntrotting through the rainy streets of Limerick knowing Theresa is in heaven with the cough gone.\nMonday morning and it's dawn in the railway station. Newspapers and magazines are piled in bundles along the platform wall. Mr. McCaffrey is there with another boy, Willie Harold, cutting the twine on the bundles, counting, entering the count in a ledger. English newspapers and The Irish Times have to be delivered early, magazines later in the morning. We count out the papers and label them for delivery to shops around the city.\nMr. McCaffrey drives the van and stays at the wheel while Willie and I run into shops with bundles and take orders for the next day, add or drop in the ledger. After the papers are delivered we unload the magazines at the office and go home to breakfast for fifty minutes.\nWhen I return to the office there are two other boys, Eamon and Peter, already sorting magazines, counting and stuffing them into news agents' boxes along the wall. Small orders are delivered by Gerry Halvey on his messenger bicycle, big orders in the van. Mr. McCaffrey tells me stay in the office so that I can learn to count magazines and enter them in the ledger. The minute Mr. McCaffrey leaves Eamon and Peter pull out a drawer where they hide cigarette butts and light up. They can't believe I don't smoke. They want to know if there's something wrong with me, the bad eyes or the consumption maybe. How can you go out with a girl if you don't smoke? Peter says, Wouldn't you be a right eejit if you were going out the road with the girl and she asked you for a fag and you said you didn't smoke, wouldn't you be a right eejit then? How would you ever get her into a field for a bit of a feel? Eamon says, 'Tis what my father says about men who don't drink, they're not to be trusted. Peter says if you find a man that won't drink or smoke that's a man that's not even interested in girls and you'd want to keep your hand over the hole of your arse, that's what you'd want to be doing.\nThey laugh and that brings on the cough and the more they laugh the more they cough till they're holding on to one another banging one another between the shoulder blades and wiping tears from their cheeks. When the fit passes we pick out English and American magazines and look at the advertisements for women's underwear, brassieres and panties and long nylon stockings. Eamon is looking at an American magazine called See with pictures of Japanese girls who keep the soldiers happy so far away from home and Eamon says he has to go to the lavatory and when he does Peter gives me a wink, You know what he's up to in there, don't you? and sometimes Mr. McCaffrey gets into a state when boys linger in the lavatory interfering with themselves and wasting the valuable time for which Easons is paying them and on top of it putting their immortal souls in danger. Mr. McCaffrey won't come right out and say, Stop that wanking, because you can't accuse someone of a mortal sin unless you have proof. Sometimes he goes snooping in the lavatory when a boy comes out. He comes back himself with the threatening look and tells the boys, Ye are not to be looking at those dirty magazines from foreign parts. Ye are to count them and put them in the boxes and that's all.\nEamon comes back from the lavatory and Peter goes in with an American magazine, Collier's, that has pictures of girls in a beauty contest. Eamon says, Do you know what he's doing in there? At himself. Five times a day he goes in. Every time a new American magazine comes in with the women's underwear he goes in. Never done going at himself. Borrows magazines to take home unbeknownst to Mr. McCaffrey and God knows what he does with himself and the magazines all night. If he fell dead in there the jaws of hell would open wide.\nI'd like to get into the lavatory myself when Peter comes out but I don't want them saying, There he goes, new boy, first day on the job, already at himself. Won't light up a fag oh no but wanks away like an oul' billygoat.\nMr. McCaffrey returns from van delivery and wants to know why all the magazines aren't counted out, bundled and ready to go. Peter tells him, We were busy teaching the new boy, McCourt. God help us, he was a\nbit slow with the bad eyes you know but we kept at him and now he's getting faster.\nGerry Halvey, the messenger boy, won't be in for a week because he's entitled to his holidays and he wants to spend the time with his girlfriend, Rose, who's coming back from England. I'm the new boy and I have to be messenger boy while he's gone, cycling around Limerick on the bicycle with the big metal basket in front. He shows me how to balance papers and magazines so that the bicycle won't tip over with me in the saddle and a lorry passing by that will run over me and leave me like a piece of salmon in the road. He saw a soldier once that was run over by an army lorry and that's what he looked like, salmon.\nGerry is making a last delivery at Easons kiosk at the railway station at noon on Saturday and that's handy because I can meet him there to get the bicycle and he can meet Rose off the train. We stand at the gate waiting and he tells me he hasn't seen Rose in a year. She's over there working in a pub in Bristol and he doesn't like that one bit because the English are forever pawing the Irish girls, hands up under the skirts and worse, and the Irish girls are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their jobs. Everyone knows Irish girls keep themselves pure especially Limerick girls known the world over for their purity who have a man to come back to like Gerry Halvey himself. He'll be able to tell if she was true to him by her walk. If a girl comes back after a year with a certain class of a walk that's different from the one she went away with then you know she was up to no good with the Englishmen dirty horny bastards that they are.\nThe train hoots into the station and Gerry waves and points to Rose coming toward us from the far end of the train, Rose smiling away with her white teeth and lovely in a green dress. Gerry stops waving and mutters under his breath, Look at the walk on her, bitch, hoor, street walker, flaghopper, trollop, and runs from the station. Rose walks up to me, Was that Gerry Halvey you were standing with?\n'Twas.\nWhere is he?\nOh, he went out.\nI know he went out. Where did he go?\nI don't know. He didn't tell me. He just ran out.\nDidn't say anything?\nI didn't hear him say anything.\nDo you work with him?\nI do. I'm taking over the bike.\nWhat bike?\nThe messenger bike.\nIs he on a messenger bike?\nHe is.\nHe told me he worked in Easons office, clerk, inside job?\nI feel desperate. I don't want to make a liar of Gerry Halvey, to\nget him into trouble with the lovely Rose. Oh, we all take turns on the messenger bike. An hour in the office, an hour on the bike. The manager says 'tis good to get out in the fresh air.\nWell, I'll just go home and put my suitcase down and go to his house. I thought he'd carry this for me.\nI have the bike here and you can stick the case in the basket and I'll walk you home.\nWe walk up to her house in Carey's Road and she tells me she's so excited about Gerry. She saved her money in England and now she wants to go back with him and get married even if he's only nineteen and she's only seventeen. What matter when you're in love. I lived like a nun in England and dreamt of him every night and thank you very much for carrying my case.\nI turn away to jump on the bike and cycle back to Easons when Gerry comes at me from behind. His face is red and he's snorting like a bull. What were you doing with my girl, you little shite? Eh? What? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you did anything with my girl I'll kill you.\nI didn't do anything. Carried her case because 'twas heavy. Don't look at her again or you're dead.\nI won't, Gerry. I don't want to look at her.\nOh, is that a fact? Is she ugly or what?\nNo, no, Gerry, she's yours and she loves you. How do you know?\nShe told me.\nShe did?\nShe did, honest to God.\nJasus.\nHe bangs on her door, Rose, Rose, are you there? and she comes out,\nOf course, I'm here, and I ride away on the messenger bicycle with the sign on the basket that says Easons wondering about the way he's kissing her now and the terrible things he said about her in the station and wondering how Peter in the office could tell Mr. McCaffrey a barefaced lie about me and my eyes when all the time he and Eamon were looking at girls in their underwear and then going at themselves in the lavatory.\nMr. McCaffrey is in a terrible state in the office. Where were you? Great God above in heaven, does it take you all day to cycle from the railway station? We have an emergency here and we should have Halvey but he's gone off on his friggin' holidays, God forgive the language, and you'll have to cycle around as fast as you can, good thing you were a telegram boy that knows every inch of Limerick, and go to every bloody shop that's a customer and walk right in grab whatever copies you see of John O'London's Weekly tear out page sixteen and if anyone bothers you tell them 'tis government orders and they're not to interfere in government business and if they lay a finger on you they're liable to arrest, imprisonment and a large fine now go for God's sake and bring back every page sixteen you tear out so that we can burn them here in the fire.\nEvery shop, Mr. McCaffrey?\nI'll do the big ones, you do the small ones all the way to Ballinacurra and out the Ennis Road and beyond, God help us. Go on, go.\nI'm jumping on the bike and Eamon runs down the steps. Hey, McCourt, wait. Listen. Don't give him all the page sixteens when you come back.\nWhy?\nWe can sell 'em, me an' Peter.\nWhy?\n'Tis all about birth control and that's banned in Ireland.\nWhat's birth control?\nAw, Christ above, don't you know anything? 'Tis condoms, you know,\nrubbers, French letters, things like that to stop the girls from getting up the pole.\nUp the pole?\nPregnant. Sixteen years of age an' you're pure ignorant. Hurry up an' get the pages before everybody starts runnin' to the shop for John O'London's Weekly.\nI'm about to push away on the bike when Mr. McCaffrey runs down the steps. Hold on, McCourt, we'll go in the van. Eamon, you come with us.\nWhat about Peter?\nLeave him. He'll wind up with a magazine in the lavatory anyway. Mr. McCaffrey talks to himself in the van. Nice bloody how do you\ndo ringing down here from Dublin on a fine Saturday to send us tearing around Limerick ripping pages out of an English magazine when I could be at home with a cup of tea and a nice bun and a read of The Irish Press with my feet up on a box under the picture of the Sacred Heart nice bloody how do you do entirely.\nMr. McCaffrey runs into every shop with us behind him. He grabs the magazines, hands each of us a pile and tells us start tearing. Shop owners scream at him, What are ye doing? Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph, is it pure mad ye are? Put back them magazines or I'll call the guards.\nMr. McCaffrey tells them, Government orders, ma'am. There is filth in John O'London this week that's not fit for any Irish eyes and we are here to do God's work. What filth?\nWhat filth? Show me the filth before ye go mutilatin' the magazines. I won't pay Easons for these magazines, so I won't.\nMa'am, we don't care at Easons. We'd rather lose large amounts than have the people of Limerick and Ireland corrupted by this filth.\nWhat filth?\nCan't tell you. Come on, boys.\nWe throw the pages on the floor of the van and when Mr. McCaffrey\nis in a shop arguing we stuff some into our shirts. There are old magazines in the van and we tear and scatter them so that Mr. McCaffrey will think they're all page sixteen from John O'London.\nThe biggest customer for the magazine, Mr. Hutchinson, tells Mr. McCaffrey get to hell out of his shop or he'll brain him, get away from them magazines, and when Mr. McCaffrey keeps on tearing out pages Mr. Hutchinson throws him into the street, Mr. McCaffrey yelling that this is a Catholic country and just because Hutchinson is a Protestant that doesn't give him the right to sell filth in the holiest city in Ireland. Mr. Hutchinson says, Ah, kiss my arse, and Mr. McCaffrey says, See, boys? See what happens when you're not a member of the True Church?\nSome shops says they've already sold all their copies of John O'London and Mr. McCaffrey says, Oh, Mother o'God, what's going to become of us all? Who did ye sell them to?\nHe demands the names and address of the customers who are in danger of losing their immortal souls from reading articles on birth control. He will go to their houses and rip out that filthy page but the shopkeepers say, 'Tis Saturday night, McCaffrey, and getting dark and would you ever take a good running jump for yourself.\nOn the way back to the office Eamon whispers to me in the back of the van, I have twenty-one pages. How many do you have? I tell him fourteen but I have over forty and I'm not telling him because you never have to tell the truth to people who lie about your bad eyes. Mr. McCaffrey tells us bring in the pages from the van. We scoop up everything on the floor and he's happy sitting at his desk at the other end of the office ringing Dublin to tell them how he stormed through\nshops like God's avenger and saved Limerick from the horrors of birth control while he watches a dancing fire of pages that have nothing to do with John O'London's Weekly.\nMonday morning I cycle through the streets delivering magazines and people see the Easons sign on the bike and stop me to see if there's any chance they could get their hands on a copy of John O'London's Weekly. They're all rich looking people, some in motor cars, men with hats, collars and ties, and two fountain pens in their pockets, women with hats and little bits of fur dangling from their shoulders, people who have tea at the Savoy or the Stella and stick out their little fingers to show how well bred they are and now want to read this page about birth control.\nEamon told me early in the day, Don't sell the bloody page for less than five shillings. I asked him if he was joking. No, he wasn't. Everyone in Limerick is talking about this page and they're dying to get their hands on it.\nFive shillings or nothing, Frankie. If they're rich charge more but that's what I'm charging so don't be going around on your bicycle and puttin' me out of business with low prices. We have to give Peter something or he'll be running to McCaffrey and spilling the beans.\nSome people are willing to pay seven shillings and sixpence and I'm rich in two days with over ten pounds in my pocket minus one for Peter the snake, who would betray us to McCaffrey. I put eight pounds in the post office for my fare to America and that night we have a big supper of ham, tomatoes, bread, butter, jam. Mam wants to know if I won the sweepstakes and I tell her people give me tips. She's not happy I'm a messenger boy because that's the lowest you can drop in Limerick but if it brings in ham like this we should light a candle in gratitude. She doesn't know the money for my fare is growing in the post office and she'd die if she knew what I was earning from writing threatening letters.\nMalachy has a new job in the stockroom of a garage handing out parts to mechanics and Mam herself is taking care of an old man, Mr. Sliney, out in the South Circular Road while his two daughters go off to work every day. She tells me if I'm delivering papers out there to come to the house for tea and a sandwich. The daughters will never know and the old man won't mind because he's only half conscious most of the time worn out from all his years in the English army in India.\nShe looks peaceful in the kitchen of this house in her spotless apron, everything clean and polished around her, flowers bobbing in the garden beyond, birds chirping away, music from Radio Eireann on the wireless. She sits at the table with a pot of tea, cups and saucers, plenty of bread, butter, cold meats of all kinds. I can have any class of a sandwich but all I know is ham and brawn. She doesn't have any brawn because that's the kind of thing you'd find people eating in lanes not in a house on the South Circular Road. She says the rich won't eat brawn because it's what they scoop off floors and counters in bacon factories and you never know what you're getting. The rich are very particular about what they stick between two slices of bread. Over in America brawn is called head cheese and she doesn't know why.\nShe gives me a ham sandwich with juicy slices of tomato and tea in a cup with little pink angels flying around shooting arrows at other little flying angels who are blue and I wonder why they can't make teacups and chamber pots without all kinds of angels and maidens cavorting in the glen. Mam says that's the way the rich are, they love\nthe bit of decoration and wouldn't we if we had the money. She'd give her two eyes to have a house like this with flowers and birds abroad in the garden and the wireless playing that lovely Warsaw Concerto or the Dream of Olwyn and no end of cups and saucers with angels shooting arrows.\nShe says she has to look in on Mr. Sliney he's so old and feeble he forgets to call for the chamber pot.\nChamber pot? You have to empty his chamber pot?\nOf course I do. There's a silence here because I think we're remembering the cause of all our troubles, Laman Griffin's chamber pot. But that was a long time ago and now it's Mr. Sliney's chamber pot, which is no harm because she's paid for this and he's harmless. When she comes back she tells me Mr. Sliney would like to see me, so come in while he's awake.\nHe's lying in a bed in the front parlor, the window blocked with a black sheet, no sign of light. He tells my mother, Lift me up a bit, missus, and pull back that bloody thing off the window so I can see the boy. He has long white hair down to his shoulders. Mam whispers he won't let anyone cut it. He says, I have me own teeth, son. Would you credit that? Do you have your own teeth, son?\nI do, Mr. Sliney.\nAh. I was in India you know. Me and Timoney up the road. Bunch of Limerick men in India. Do you know Timoney, son?\nI did, Mr. Sliney.\nHe's dead, you know. Poor bugger went blind. I have me sight. I have me teeth. Keep your teeth, son.\nI will, Mr. Sliney.\nI'm getting tired, son, but there's one thing I want to tell you. Are you listening to me?\nI am, Mr. Sliney.\nIs he listening to me, missus?\nOh, he is, Mr. Sliney.\nGood. Now here's what I want to tell you. Lean over here so I can\nwhisper in your ear. What I want to tell you is, Never smoke another man's pipe.\n***\nHalvey goes off to England with Rose and I have to stay on the messenger bike all through the winter. It's a bitter winter, ice everywhere, and I never know when the bike will go out from under me and send me flying into the street or onto the pavement, magazines and papers scattered. Shops complain to Mr. McCaffrey that The Irish Times is coming in decorated with bits of ice and dog shit and he mutters to us that's the way that paper should be delivered, Protestant rag that it is.\nEvery day after my deliveries I take The Irish Times home and read it to see where the danger is. Mam says it's a good thing Dad isn't here. He'd say, Is this what the men of Ireland fought and died for that my own son is sitting there at the kitchen table reading the freemason paper?\nThere are letters to the editor from people all over Ireland claiming they heard the first cuckoo of the year and you can read between the lines that people are calling each other liars. There are reports about Protestant weddings and pictures and the women always look lovelier than the ones we know in the lanes. You can see Protestant women have perfect teeth although Halvey's Rose had lovely teeth.\nI keep reading The Irish Times and wondering if it's an occasion of sin though I don't care. As long as Theresa Carmody is in heaven not\ncoughing I don't go to confession anymore. I read The Irish Times and TheTimes of London because that tells me what the King is up to every day and what Elizabeth and Margaret are doing.\nI read English women's magazines for all the food articles and the answers to women's questions. Peter and Eamon put on English accents and pretend they're reading from English women's magazines.\nPeter says, Dear Miss Hope, I'm going out with a fellow from Ireland named McCaffrey and he has his hands all over me and his thing pushing against my belly button and I'm demented not knowing what to do. I remain, yours anxiously, Miss Lulu Smith, Yorkshire.\nEamon says, Dear Lulu, If this McCaffrey is that tall that he's pushing his yoke against your belly button I suggest you find a smaller man who will slip it between your thighs. Surely you can find a decent short man in Yorkshire.\nDear Miss Hope, I am thirteen years old with black hair and something terrible is happening and I can't tell anyone not even my mother. I'm bleeding every few weeks you know where and I'm afraid I'll be found out. Miss Agnes Tripple, Little Biddle-on-the-Twiddle, Devon.\nDear Agnes, You are to be congratulated. You are now a woman and you can get your hair permed because you are having your monthlies. Do not fear your monthlies for all Englishwomen have them. They are a gift of God to purify us so that we can have stronger children for the empire, soldiers to keep the Irish in their place. In some parts of the world a woman with a monthly is unclean but we British cherish our women with the monthlies, oh we do indeed.\nIn the springtime there's a new messenger boy and I'm back in the office. Peter and Eamon drift off to England. Peter is fed up with Limerick, no girls, and you're driven to yourself, wank wank wank, that's all we ever do in Limerick. There are new boys. I'm senior boy and the job is easier because I'm fast and when Mr. McCaffrey is out in the van and my work is done I read the English, Irish, American magazines and papers. Day and night I dream of America.\nMalachy goes to England to work in a rich Catholic boys' boarding school and he walks around cheerful and smiling as if he's the equal of any boy in the school and everyone knows when you work in an English boarding school you're supposed to hang your head and shuffle like a proper Irish servant. They fire him for his ways and Malachy tells them they can kiss his royal Irish arse and they say that's the kind of foul language and behavior you'd expect. He gets a job in the gas works in Coventry shoveling coal into the furnaces like Uncle Pa Keating, shoveling coal and waiting for the day he can go to America after me.\nXVIII\nI'm seventeen, eighteen, going on nineteen, working away at Easons, writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane, who says she's not long for this world and the more Masses said for her soul the better she'll feel. She puts money in envelopes and sends me to churches around the city to knock on priests' doors, hand in the envelopes with the request for Masses. She wants prayers from all the priests but the Jesuits. She says, They're useless, all head and no heart. That's what they should\nhave over their door in Latin and I won't give them a penny because every penny you give a Jesuit goes to a fancy book or a bottle of wine.\nShe sends the money, she hopes the Masses are said, but she's never sure and if she's not sure why should I be handing out all that money to priests when I need the money to go to America and if I keep back a few pounds for myself and put it in the post office who will ever know the difference and if I say a prayer for Mrs. Finucane and light candles for her soul when she dies won't God listen even if I'm a sinner long past my last confession.\nI'll be nineteen in a month. All I need is a few pounds to make up the fare and a few pounds in my pocket when I land in America.\nThe Friday night before my nineteenth birthday Mrs. Finucane sends me for the sherry. When I return she is dead in the chair, her eyes wide open, and her purse on the floor wide open. I can't look at her but I help myself to a roll of money. Seventeen pounds. I take the key to the trunk upstairs. I take forty of the hundred pounds in the trunk and the ledger. I'll add this to what I have in the post office and I have enough to go to America. On my way out I take the sherry bottle to save it from being wasted.\nI sit by the River Shannon near the dry docks sipping Mrs. Finucane's sherry. Aunt Aggie's name is in the ledger. She owes nine pounds. It might have been the money she spent on my clothes a long time ago but now she'll never have to pay it because I heave the ledger into the river. I'm sorry I'll never be able to tell Aunt Aggie I saved her nine pounds. I'm sorry I wrote threatening letters to the poor people in the lanes of Limerick, my own people, but the ledger is gone, no one will ever know what they owe and they won't have to pay their balances. I wish I could tell them, I'm your Robin Hood.\nAnother sip of the sherry. I'll spare a pound or two for a Mass for Mrs. Finucane's soul. Her ledger is well on its way down the Shannon and out to the Atlantic and I know I'll follow it someday soon.\nThe man at O'Riordan's Travel Agency says he can't get me to America by air unless I travel to London first, which would cost a fortune. He can put me on a ship called the Irish Oak, which will be leaving Cork in a few weeks. He says, Nine days at sea, September October, best time of the year, your own cabin, thirteen passengers, best of food, bit of a holiday for yourself and that will cost fifty-five pounds, do you have it?\nI do.\nI tell Mam I'm going in a few weeks and she cries. Michael says, Will we all go some day?\nWe will.\nAlphie says, Will you send me a cowboy hat and a thing you throw that comes back to you?\nMichael tells him that's a boomerang and you'd have to go all the way to Australia to get the likes of that, you can't get it in America.\nAlphie says you can get it in America yes you can and they argue about America and Australia and boomerangs till Mam says, For the love o' Jesus, yeer brother is leaving us and the two of ye are there squabbling over boomerangs. Will ye give over?\nMam says we'll have to have a bit of party the night before I go. They used to have parties in the old days when anyone would go to America, which was so far away the parties were called American wakes because the family never expected to see the departing one again in this\nlife. She says 'tis a great pity Malachy can't come back from England but we'll be together in America someday with the help of God and His Blessed Mother.\nOn my days off from work I walk around Limerick and look at all the places we lived, the Windmill Street, Hartstonge Street, Roden Lane, Rosbrien Road, Little Barrington Street, which is really a lane. I stand looking at Theresa Carmody's house till her mother comes out and says, What do you want? I sit at the graves of Oliver and Eugene in the old St. Patrick's Burying Ground and cross the road to St. Lawrence's Cemetery where Theresa is buried. Wherever I go I hear voices of the dead and I wonder if they can follow you across the Atlantic Ocean.\nI want to get pictures of Limerick stuck in my head in case I never come back. I sit in St. Joseph's Church and the Redemptorist church and tell myself take a good look because I might never see this again. I walk down Henry Street to say good-bye to St. Francis though I'm sure I'll be able to talk to him in America.\nNow there are days I don't want to go to America. I'd like to go to O'Riordan's Travel Agency and get back my fifty-five pounds. I could wait till I'm twenty-one and Malachy can go with me so that I'll know at least one person in New York. I have strange feelings and sometimes when I'm sitting by the fire with Mam and my brothers I feel tears coming and I'm ashamed of myself for being weak. At first Mam laughs and tells me, Your bladder must be near your eye, but then Michael says, We'll all go to America, Dad will be there, Malachy will be there and we'll all be together, and she gets the tears herself and we sit there, the four of us, like weeping eejits.\nMam says this is the first time we ever had a party and isn't it a sad thing altogether that you have it when your children are slipping away one by one, Malachy to England, Frank to America. She saves a few shillings from her wages taking care of Mr. Sliney to buy bread, ham, brawn, cheese, lemonade and a few bottles of stout. Uncle Pa Keating brings stout, whiskey and a little sherry for Aunt Aggie's delicate stomach and she brings a cake loaded with currants and raisins she baked herself. The Abbot brings six bottles of stout and says, That's all right, Frankie, ye can all drink it as long as I have a bottle or two for meself to help me sing me song.\nHe sings \"The Road to Rasheen. \" He holds his stout, closes his eyes, and song comes out in a high whine. The words make no sense and everyone wonders why tears are seeping from his shut eyes. Alphie whispers to me, Why is he crying over a song that makes no sense?\nI don't know.\nThe Abbot ends his song, opens his eyes, wipes his cheeks and tells us that was a sad song about an Irish boy that went to America and got shot by gangsters and died before a priest could reach his side and he tells me don't be gettin' shot if you're not near a priest.\nUncle Pa says that's the saddest song he ever heard and is there any chance we could have something lively. He calls on Mam and she says, Ah, no, Pa, sure I don't have the wind.\nCome on, Angela, come on. One voice now, one voice and one voice\nonly.\nAll right. I'll try.\nWe all join in the chorus of her sad song,\nA mother's love is a blessing No matter where you roam. Keep her while you have her,\nYou'll miss her when she's gone.\nUncle Pa says one song is worse than the one before and are we turning this night into a wake altogether, is there any chance someone would sing a song to liven up the proceedings or will he be driven to drink with the sadness.\nOh, God, says Aunt Aggie, I forgot. The moon is having an eclipse abroad this minute.\nWe stand out in the lane watching the moon disappear behind a round black shadow. Uncle Pa says, That's a very good sign for you going to America, Frankie.\nNo, says Aunt Aggie, 'tis a bad sign. I read in the paper that the moon is practicing for the end of the world.\nOh, end of the world my arse, says Uncle Pa. 'Tis the beginning for Frankie McCourt. He'll come back in a few years with a new suit and fat on his bones like any Yank and a lovely girl with white teeth hangin' from his arm.\nMam says, Ah, no, Pa, ah, no, and they take her inside and comfort her with a drop of sherry from Spain.\nIt's late in the day when the Irish Oak sails from Cork, past Kinsale and Cape Clear, and dark when lights twinkle on Mizen Head, the last of Ireland I'll see for God knows how long.\nSurely I should have stayed, taken the post office examination, climbed in the world. I could have brought in enough money for Michael and Alphie to go to school with proper shoes and bellies well filled. We could have moved from the lane to a street or even an avenue where houses have gardens. I should have taken that examination and Mam would never again have to empty the chamber pots of Mr. Sliney or anyone else.\nIt's too late now. I'm on the ship and there goes Ireland into the night and it's foolish to be standing on this deck looking back and thinking of my family and Limerick and Malachy and my father in England and even more foolish that songs are going through my head Roddy McCorley goes to die and Mam gasping Oh the days of the Kerry dancing with poor Mr. Clohessy hacking away in the bed and now I want Ireland back at least I had Mam and my brothers and Aunt Aggie bad as she was and Uncle Pa, standing me my first pint, and my bladder is near my eye and here's a priest standing by me on the deck and you can see he's curious.\nHe's a Limerickman but he has an American accent from his years in Los Angeles. He knows how it is to leave Ireland, did it himself and never got over it. You live in Los Angeles with sun and palm trees day in day out and you ask God if there's any chance He could give you one soft rainy Limerick day.\nThe priest sits beside me at the table of the First Officer, who tells us ship's orders have been changed and instead of sailing to New York we're bound for Montreal.\nThree days out and orders are changed again. We are going to New York after all.\nThree American passengers complain, Goddam Irish. Can't they get it straight?\nThe day before we sail into New York orders are changed again. We are going to a place up the Hudson River called Albany.\nThe Americans say, Albany? Goddam Albany? Why the hell did we have to sail on a goddam Irish tub? Goddam.\nThe priest tells me pay no attention. All Americans are not like that.\nI'm on deck the dawn we sail into New York. I'm sure I'm in a film, that it will end and lights will come up in the Lyric Cinema. The priest wants to point out things but he doesn't have to. I can pick out the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Brooklyn Bridge. There are thousands of cars speeding along the roads and the sun turns everything to gold. Rich Americans in top hats white ties and tails must be going home to bed with the gorgeous women with white teeth. The rest are going to work in warm comfortable offices and no one has a care in the world.\nThe Americans are arguing with the captain and a man who climbed aboard from a tugboat. Why can't we get off here? Why do we have to sail all the goddam way to goddam Albany?\nThe man says, Because you're passengers on the vessel and the captain is the captain and we have no procedures for taking you ashore.\nOh, yeah. Well, this is a free country and we're American citizens.\nIs that a fact? Well, you're on an Irish ship with an Irish captain and you'll do what he goddam tells you or swim ashore.\nHe climbs down the ladder, tugboat chugs away, and we sail up the Hudson past Manhattan, under the George Washington Bridge, past hundreds of Liberty ships that did their bit in the war, moored now and ready to rot.\nThe captain announces the tide will force us to drop anchor overnight opposite a place called, the priest spells it for me, Poughkeepsie. The priest says that's an Indian name and the Americans say goddam Poughkeepsie.\nAfter dark a small boat put-puts to the ship and an Irish voice calls up, Hello, there. Bejasus, I saw the Irish flag, so I did. Couldn't believe me two eyes. Hello, there.\nHe invites the First Officer to go ashore for a drink and bring a friend and, You, too, Father. Bring a friend.\nThe priest invites me and we climb down a ladder to the small boat with the First Officer and the Wireless Officer. The man in the boat says his name is Tim Boyle from Mayo God help us and we docked there at the right time because there's a bit of a party and we're all invited. He takes us to a house with a lawn, a fountain and three pink birds standing on one leg. There are five women in a room called a living room. The women have stiff hair, spotless frocks. They have glasses in their hands and they're friendly and smile with perfect teeth. One says, Come right in. Just in time for the pawty.\nPawty. That's the way they talk and I suppose I'll be talking like that in a few years.\nTim Boyle tells us the girls are having a bit of a time while their husbands are away overnight hunting deer, and one woman, Betty, says, Yeah. Buddies from the war. That war is over nearly five years and they can't get over it so they shoot animals every weekend and drink Rheingold till they can't see. Goddam war, excuse the language, Fawder.\nThe priest whispers to me, These are bad women. We won't stay here long.\nThe bad women say, Whatcha like to drink? We got everything. What's your name, honey?\nFrank McCourt.\nNice name. So you take a little drink. All the Irish take a little drink. You like a beer?\nYes, please. Gee, so polite. I like the Irish. My grandmother was half Irish so that makes me half, quarter? I dunno. My name is Frieda. So here's your beer, honey.\nThe priest sits at the end of a sofa which they call a couch and two women talk to him. Betty asks the First Officer if he'd like to see the house and he says, Oh, I would, because we don't have houses like this in Ireland. Another woman tells the Wireless Officer he should see what they have growing in the garden, you wouldn't believe the flowers. Frieda asks me if I'm okay and I tell her yes but would she mind telling me where the lavatory is.\nThe what?\nLavatory.\nOh, you mean the bathroom. Right this way, honey, down the hall. Thanks.\nShe pushes in the door, turns on the light, kisses my cheek and\nwhispers she'll be right outside if I need anything.\nI stand at the toilet bowl firing away and wonder what I'd need at\na time like this and if this is a common thing in America, women waiting outside while you take a splash.\nI finish, flush and go outside. She takes my hand and leads me into a bedroom, puts down her glass, locks the door, pushes me down on the bed. She's fumbling at my fly. Damn buttons. Don't you have zippers in Ireland? She pulls out my excitement climbs up on me slides up and down up and down Jesus I'm in heaven and there's a knock on the door the priest Frank are you in there Frieda putting her finger to her lips and her eyes rolling to heaven Frank are you in there Father would you ever take a good running jump for yourself and oh God oh Theresa do you see what's happening to me at long last I don't give a fiddler's fart if the Pope himself knocked on this door and the College of Cardinals gathered gawking at the windows oh God the whole inside of me is gone into her and she collapses on me and tells me I'm wonderful and would I ever consider settling in Poughkeepsie.\nFrieda tells the priest I had a bit of a dizziness after going to the bathroom, that's what happens when you travel and you're drinking a strange beer like Rheingold, which she believes they don't have in Ireland. I can see the priest doesn't believe her and I can't stop the way the heat is coming and going in my face. He already wrote down my mother's name and address and now I'm afraid he'll write and say your fine son spent his first night in America in a bedroom in Poughkeepsie romping with a woman whose husband was away shooting deer for a bit of relaxation after doing his bit for America in the war and isn't this a fine way to treat the men who fought for their country.\nThe First Officer and the Wireless Officer return from their tours of the house and the garden and they don't look at the priest. The women tell us we must be starving and they go into the kitchen. We sit in the living room saying nothing to each other and listening to the women whispering and laughing in the kitchen. The priest whispers to me again, Bad women, bad women, occasion of sin, and I don't know what to say to him.\nThe bad women bring out sandwiches and pour more beer and when we finish eating they put on Frank Sinatra records and ask if anyone would like to dance. No one says yes because you'd never get up and dance with bad women in the presence of a priest, so the women dance with each other and laugh as if they all had little secrets. Tim Boyle drinks whiskey and\nfalls asleep in a corner till Frieda wakes him and tells him take us back to the ship. When we're leaving Frieda leans toward me as if she might kiss my cheek but the priest says good night in a very sharp way and no one shakes hands. As we walk down the street to the river we hear the women laughing, tinkling and bright in the night air.\nWe climb the ladder and Tim calls to us from his little boat, Mind yourselves going up that ladder. Oh, boys, oh, boys, wasn't that a grand night? Good night, boys, and good night, Father.\nWe watch his little boat till it disappears into the dark of the Pough- keepsie riverbank. The priest says good night and goes below and the First Officer follows him.\nI stand on the deck with the Wireless Officer looking at the lights of America twinkling. He says, My God, that was a lovely night, Frank. Isn't this a great country altogether?\nXIX 'Tis.3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1547754", "artist_names": "Freddie And The Dreamers", "full_title": "I Understand (Just How You Feel) by\u00a0Freddie\u00a0And The Dreamers", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/448b0f8d002ddbf5cefe6bee473265ad.293x293x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/448b0f8d002ddbf5cefe6bee473265ad.293x293x1.jpg", "id": 1547754, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429896128, "path": "/Freddie-and-the-dreamers-i-understand-just-how-you-feel-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Freddie-and-the-dreamers-i-understand-just-how-you-feel-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/448b0f8d002ddbf5cefe6bee473265ad.293x293x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/448b0f8d002ddbf5cefe6bee473265ad.293x293x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "I Understand (Just How You Feel)", "title_with_featured": "I Understand (Just How You Feel)", "updated_by_human_at": 1444057659, "url": "https://genius.com/Freddie-and-the-dreamers-i-understand-just-how-you-feel-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/363396", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fe80d9d5f2af30449a8383e4c77df866.468x293x1.jpg", "id": 363396, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/448b0f8d002ddbf5cefe6bee473265ad.293x293x1.jpg", "index_character": "f", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Freddie And The Dreamers", "slug": "Freddie-and-the-dreamers", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Freddie-and-the-dreamers"}, "artist": "Freddie And The Dreamers", "lyrics": "I Understand (Just How You Feel) LyricsI understand just how you feel\nYour love for me, why not be mine?\nIt's over now but it was grand\nI understand, I understand\n\nIf you ever change your mind\nCome back to me and you will find\nMe waiting there, at your command\nI understand, I understand\n\nI miss you so, please believe me when I tell you\nI just can't stand to see you go\nYou know\nIf you ever change your mind\nCome back to me and you will find\nMe waiting there at your command\nI understand, I understand\n\nSPOKEN:\n\"I understand just how you feel.

uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.)

(He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening.

Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.)

Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear!

I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported.

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken.

Lady Bloom accepts no presents.\n\nCROFTON This is indeed a festivity.\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.\n\nALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?\n\nBLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old.

I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Sjambok him!\n\n(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)\n\nTHE ARTANE ORPHANS\n\nYou big, you bog, you dirty dog!\nYou think the ladies love you!\n\n\nTHE PRISON GATE GIRLS\n\nIf you see kay\nTell him he may\nSee you in tea\nTell him from me.\n\n\nHORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.)

And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.\n\n(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)\n\nMESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.\n\nBLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!\n\n(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)\n\nREUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.\n\n(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)\n\nTHE CITIZEN Thank heaven!\n\nBLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.\n\n(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)\n\nTHE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.\n\n(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut.

Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill.

He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says.

Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!\n\nBLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!\n\nBELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.\n\nBELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.\n\nLYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.\n\nZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!\n\n(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)\n\nTHE CROWD\n\nCard of the races.

The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap!

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.\n\n\nZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!\n\n\nFLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.\n\n\nBLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C.

I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/1393178", "artist_names": "Dobie Gray", "full_title": "The 'In' Crowd by\u00a0Dobie\u00a0Gray", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/10c66eaab2efff79a09d2c10bd52334d.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/10c66eaab2efff79a09d2c10bd52334d.482x482x1.jpg", "id": 1393178, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1603147049, "path": "/Dobie-gray-the-in-crowd-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Dobie-gray-the-in-crowd-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1964, "month": 11, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "November 1964", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Nov. 1964", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/10c66eaab2efff79a09d2c10bd52334d.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/10c66eaab2efff79a09d2c10bd52334d.482x482x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 3, "hot": false}, "title": "The \u2018In\u2019 Crowd", "title_with_featured": "The 'In' Crowd", "updated_by_human_at": 1658255520, "url": "https://genius.com/Dobie-gray-the-in-crowd-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/18918", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/668fad932d66dd67436b27a4bcbfb10d.1000x750x1.jpg", "id": 18918, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/668fad932d66dd67436b27a4bcbfb10d.1000x750x1.jpg", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Dobie Gray", "slug": "Dobie-gray", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Dobie-gray"}, "artist": "Dobie Gray", "lyrics": "The \u2018In\u2019 Crowd LyricsI'm in with the in crowd (Do-do-do)\nI go where the in crowd goes (Do-do-do)\nI'm in with the in crowd (Do-do-do)\nAnd I know what the in crowd knows (Da-da-da-da)\n\nAny time of the year, don't you hear?

Ritter von Leopold Sacher-Masoch\n\nTranslator: Fernanda Savage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVENUS IN FURS\n\n\nOf this book, intended for\nprivate circulation, only\n1225 copies have been\nprinted, and type afterward\ndistributed.\n\n\n\n\nVENUS IN FURS\n\nBy\n\nLEOPOLD VON SACHER-MASOCH\n\n\nTranslated from the German\n\nBy\n\nFERNANDA SAVAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\"But the Almighty Lord hath struck him,\nand hath delivered him into the hands of\na woman.\"_\n\n--The Vulgate, Judith, xvi. 7.\n\n\nMy company was charming.\n\nOpposite me by the massive Renaissance fireplace sat Venus; she was not a casual woman of the half-world, who under this pseudonym wages war against the enemy sex, like Mademoiselle Cleopatra, but the real, true goddess of love.\n\nShe sat in an armchair and had kindled a crackling fire, whose\nreflection ran in red flames over her pale face with its white eyes, and from time to time over her feet when she sought to warm them.\n\nHer head was wonderful in spite of the dead stony eyes; it was all I could see of her. She had wrapped her marble-like body in a huge fur, and rolled herself up trembling like a cat.\n\n\"I don't understand it,\" I exclaimed, \"It isn't really cold any\nlonger. For two weeks past we have had perfect spring weather. You must be nervous.\"\n\"Much obliged for your spring,\" she replied with a low stony voice, and immediately afterwards sneezed divinely, twice in succession. \"I really can't stand it here much longer, and I am beginning to understand--\"\n\n\"What, dear lady?\"\n\n\"I am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the un-understandable. All of a sudden I understand the Germanic virtue of woman, and German philosophy, and I am no longer surprised that you of the North do not know how to love, haven't even an idea of what love is.\"\n\n\"But, madame,\" I replied flaring up, \"I surely haven't given you any reason.\"\n\n\"Oh, you--\" The divinity sneezed for the third time, and shrugged her shoulders with inimitable grace. \"That's why I have always been nice to you, and even come to see you now and then, although I catch a cold every time, in spite of all my furs. Do you remember the first time we met?\"\n\n\"How could I forget it,\" I said. \"You wore your abundant hair in\nbrown curls, and you had brown eyes and a red mouth, but I recognized you immediately by the outline of your face and its marble-like pallor--you always wore a violet-blue velvet jacket edged with squirrel-skin.\"\n\n\"You were really in love with the costume, and awfully docile.\"\n\n\"You have taught me what love is. Your serene form of worship let me forget two thousand years.\"\n\n\"And my faithfulness to you was without equal!\"\n\n\"Well, as far as faithfulness goes--\"\n\n\"Ungrateful!\"\n\n\"I will not reproach you with anything. You are a divine woman, but nevertheless a woman, and like every woman cruel in love.\"\n\n\"What you call cruel,\" the goddess of love replied eagerly, \"is\nsimply the element of passion and of natural love, which is woman's nature and makes her give herself where she loves, and makes her love everything, that pleases her.\"\n\n\"Can there be any greater cruelty for a lover than the\nunfaithfulness of the woman he loves?\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" she replied. \"We are faithful as long as we love, but you demand faithfulness of a woman without love, and the giving of herself without enjoyment. Who is cruel there--woman or man? You of\nthe North in general take love too soberly and seriously. You talk\nof duties where there should be only a question of pleasure.\"\n\n\"That is why our emotions are honorable and virtuous, and our\nrelations permanent.\"\n\n\"And yet a restless, always unsatisfied craving for the nudity of\npaganism,\" she interrupted, \"but that love, which is the highest joy,\nwhich is divine simplicity itself, is not for you moderns, you\nchildren of reflection. It works only evil in you. _As soon as you\nwish to be natural, you become common._ To you nature seems something\nhostile; you have made devils out of the smiling gods of Greece, and\nout of me a demon. You can only exorcise and curse me, or slay\nyourselves in bacchantic madness before my altar. And if ever one of\nyou has had the courage to kiss my red mouth, he makes a barefoot\npilgrimage to Rome in penitential robes and expects flowers to grow\nfrom his withered staff, while under my feet roses, violets, and\nmyrtles spring up every hour, but their fragrance does not agree with\nyou. Stay among your northern fogs and Christian incense; let us\npagans remain under the debris, beneath the lava; do not disinter us.\nPompeii was not built for you, nor our villas, our baths, our temples.\nYou do not require gods. We are chilled in your world.\"\n\nThe beautiful marble woman coughed, and drew the dark sables still\ncloser about her shoulders.\n\n\"Much obliged for the classical lesson,\" I replied, \"but you cannot\ndeny, that man and woman are mortal enemies, in your serene sunlit\nworld as well as in our foggy one. In love there is union into a\nsingle being for a short time only, capable of only one thought, one\nsensation, one will, in order to be then further disunited. And you\nknow this better than I; whichever of the two fails to subjugate will\nsoon feel the feet of the other on his neck--\"\n\n\"And as a rule the man that of the woman,\" cried Madame Venus with\nproud mockery, \"which you know better than I.\"\n\n\"Of course, and that is why I don't have any illusions.\"\n\n\"You mean you are now my slave without illusions, and for that\nreason you shall feel the weight of my foot without mercy.\"\n\n\"Madame!\"\n\n\"Don't you know me yet? Yes, I am _cruel_--since you take so much\ndelight in that word-and am I not entitled to be so? Man is the one\nwho desires, woman the one who is desired. This is woman's entire but\ndecisive advantage. Through his passion nature has given man into\nwoman's hands, and the woman who does not know how to make him her\nsubject, her slave, her toy, and how to betray him with a smile in the\nend is not wise.\"\n\n\"Exactly your principles,\" I interrupted angrily.\n\n\"They are based on the experience of thousands of years,\" she\nreplied ironically, while her white fingers played over the dark fur.\n\"The more devoted a woman shows herself, the sooner the man sobers\ndown and becomes domineering. The more cruelly she treats him and the\nmore faithless she is, the worse she uses him, the more wantonly she\nplays with him, the less pity she shows him, by so much the more will\nshe increase his desire, be loved, worshipped by him. So it has\nalways been, since the time of Helen and Delilah, down to Catherine\nthe Second and Lola Montez.\"\n\n\"I cannot deny,\" I said, \"that nothing will attract a man more than\nthe picture of a beautiful, passionate, cruel, and despotic woman who\nwantonly changes her favorites without scruple in accordance with her\nwhim--\"\n\n\"And in addition wears furs,\" exclaimed the divinity.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I know your predilection.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" I interrupted, \"that, since we last saw each other,\nyou have grown very coquettish.\"\n\n\"In what way, may I ask?\"\n\n\"In that there is no way of accentuating your white body to greater\nadvantage than by these dark furs, and that--\"\n\nThe divinity laughed.\n\n\"You are dreaming,\" she cried, \"wake up!\" and she clasped my arm\nwith her marble-white hand. \"Do wake up,\" she repeated raucously with\nthe low register of her voice. I opened my eyes with difficulty.\n\nI saw the hand which shook me, and suddenly it was brown as bronze;\nthe voice was the thick alcoholic voice of my cossack servant who\nstood before me at his full height of nearly six feet.\n\n\"Do get up,\" continued the good fellow, \"it is really disgraceful.\"\n\n\"What is disgraceful?\"\n\n\"To fall asleep in your clothes and with a book besides.\" He snuffed\nthe candles which had burned down, and picked up the volume which had\nfallen from my hand, \"with a book by\"--he looked at the title page--\n\"by Hegel. Besides it is high time you were starting for Mr.\nSeverin's who is expecting us for tea.\"\n\n\"A curious dream,\" said Severin when I had finished. He supported\nhis arms on his knees, resting his face in his delicate, finely\nveined hands, and fell to pondering.\n\nI knew that he wouldn't move for a long time, hardly even breathe. This\nactually happened, but I didn't consider his behavior as in any way\nremarkable. I had been on terms of close friendship with him for nearly\nthree years, and gotten used to his peculiarities. For it cannot be\ndenied that he was peculiar, although he wasn't quite the dangerous\nmadman that the neighborhood, or indeed the entire district of Kolomea,\nconsidered him to be. I found his personality not only interesting--and\nthat is why many also regarded me a bit mad--but to a degree\nsympathetic. For a Galician nobleman and land-owner, and considering his\nage--he was hardly over thirty--he displayed surprising sobriety, a\ncertain seriousness, even pedantry. He lived according to a minutely\nelaborated, half-philosophical, half-practical system, like clock-work;\nnot this alone, but also by the thermometer, barometer, aerometer,\nhydrometer, Hippocrates, Hufeland, Plato, Kant, Knigge, and Lord\nChesterfield. But at times he had violent attacks of sudden passion, and\ngave the impression of being about to run with his head right through a\nwall. At such times every one preferred to get out of his way.\n\nWhile he remained silent, the fire sang in the chimney and the large\nvenerable samovar sang; and the ancient chair in which I sat rocking\nto and fro smoking my cigar, and the cricket in the old walls sang\ntoo. I let my eyes glide over the curious apparatus, skeletons of\nanimals, stuffed birds, globes, plaster-casts, with which his room\nwas heaped full, until by chance my glance remained fixed on a\npicture which I had seen often enough before. But to-day, under the\nreflected red glow of the fire, it made an indescribable impression\non me.\n\nIt was a large oil painting, done in the robust full-bodied manner\nof the Belgian school. Its subject was strange enough.\n\nA beautiful woman with a radiant smile upon her face, with abundant\nhair tied into a classical knot, on which white powder lay like a\nsoft hoarfrost, was resting on an ottoman, supported on her left arm.\nShe was nude in her dark furs. Her right hand played with a lash,\nwhile her bare foot rested carelessly on a man, lying before her like\na slave, like a dog. In the sharply outlined, but well-formed\nlinaments of this man lay brooding melancholy and passionate\ndevotion; he looked up to her with the ecstatic burning eye of a\nmartyr. This man, the footstool for her feet, was Severin, but\nbeardless, and, it seemed, some ten years younger.\n\n\"_Venus in Furs_,\" I cried, pointing to the picture. \"That is the way\nI saw her in my dream.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" said Severin, \"only I dreamed my dream with open eyes.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"It is a tiresome story.\"\n\n\"Your picture apparently suggested my dream,\" I continued. \"But do\ntell me what it means. I can imagine that it played a role in your\nlife, and perhaps a very decisive one. But the details I can only get\nfrom you.\"\n\n\"Look at its counterpart,\" replied my strange friend, without\nheeding my question.\n\nThe counterpart was an excellent copy of Titian's well-known \"Venus\nwith the Mirror\" in the Dresden Gallery.\n\n\"And what is the significance?\"\n\nSeverin rose and pointed with his finger at the fur with which\nTitian garbed his goddess of love.\n\n\"It, too, is a 'Venus in Furs,'\" he said with a slight smile. \"I\ndon't believe that the old Venetian had any secondary intention. He\nsimply painted the portrait of some aristocratic Mesalina, and was\ntactful enough to let Cupid hold the mirror in which she tests her\nmajestic allure with cold satisfaction. He looks as though his task\nwere becoming burdensome enough. The picture is painted flattery.\nLater an 'expert' in the Rococo period baptized the lady with the\nname of Venus. The furs of the despot in which Titian's fair model\nwrapped herself, probably more for fear of a cold than out of\nmodesty, have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that\nconstitute woman's essence and her beauty.\n\n\"But enough of that. The picture, as it now exists, is a bitter\nsatire on our love. Venus in this abstract North, in this icy\nChristian world, has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch\ncold--\"\n\nSeverin laughed, and lighted a fresh cigarette.\n\nJust then the door opened and an attractive, stoutish, blonde girl\nentered. She had wise, kindly eyes, was dressed in black silk, and\nbrought us cold meat and eggs with our tea. Severin took one of the\nlatter, and decapitated it with his knife.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you that I want them soft-boiled?\" he cried with a\nviolence that made the young woman tremble.\n\n\"But my dear Sevtchu--\" she said timidly.\n\n\"Sevtchu, nothing,\" he yelled, \"you are to obey, obey, do you\nunderstand?\" and he tore the _kantchuk_ [Footnote: A long whip with a\nshort handle.] which was hanging beside the weapons from its hook.\n\nThe woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doe.\n\n\"Just wait, I'll get you yet,\" he called after her.\n\n\"But Severin,\" I said placing my hand on his arm, \"how can you treat\na pretty young woman thus?\"\n\n\"Look at the woman,\" he replied, blinking humorously with his eyes.\n\"Had I flattered her, she would have cast the noose around my neck,\nbut now, when I bring her up with the _kantchuk_, she adores me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, nothing, that is the way you have to break in women.\"\n\n\"Well, if you like it, live like a pasha in your harem, but don't\nlay down theories for me--\"\n\n\"Why not,\" he said animatedly. \"Goethe's 'you must be hammer or anvil'\nis absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and woman.\nDidn't Lady Venus in your dream prove that to you? Woman's power lies\nin man's passion, and she knows how to use it, if man doesn't\nunderstand himself. He has only one choice: to be the _tyrant_ over or\nthe _slave_ of woman. As soon as he gives in, his neck is under the\nyoke, and the lash will soon fall upon him.\"\n\n\"Strange maxims!\"\n\n\"Not maxims, but experiences,\" he replied, nodding his head, \"_I have\nactually felt the lash_. I am cured. Do you care to know how?\"\n\nHe rose, and got a small manuscript from his massive desk, and put\nit in front of me.\n\n\"You have already asked about the picture. I have long owed you an\nexplanation. Here--read!\"\n\nSeverin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me, and seemed\nto dream with open eyes. Silence had fallen again, and again the fire\nsang in the chimney, and the samovar and the cricket in the old\nwalls. I opened the manuscript and read:\n\nCONFESSIONS OF A SUPERSENSUAL MAN.\n\nThe margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the well-known\nlines from _Faust_:\n\n\"Thou supersensual sensual wooer\nA woman leads you by the nose.\"\n--MEPHISTOPHELES.\n\nI turned the title-page and read: \"What follows has been compiled\nfrom my diary of that period, because it is impossible ever frankly\nto write of one's past, but in this way everything retains its fresh\ncolors, the colors of the present.\"\n\nGogol, the Russian Moliere, says--where? well, somewhere--\"the real\ncomic muse is the one under whose laughing mask tears roll down.\"\n\nA wonderful saying.\n\nSo I have a very curious feeling as I am writing all this down. The\natmosphere seems filled with a stimulating fragrance of flowers,\nwhich overcomes me and gives me a headache. The smoke of the\nfireplace curls and condenses into figures, small gray-bearded\nkokolds that mockingly point their finger at me. Chubby-cheeked\ncupids ride on the arms of my chair and on my knees. I have to smile\ninvoluntarily, even laugh aloud, as I am writing down my adventures.\nYet I am not writing with ordinary ink, but with red blood that drips\nfrom my heart. All its wounds long scarred over have opened and it\nthrobs and hurts, and now and then a tear falls on the paper.\n\nThe days creep along sluggishly in the little Carpathian health-resort.\nYou see no one, and no one sees you. It is boring enough to write idyls.\nI would have leisure here to supply a whole gallery of paintings,\nfurnish a theater with new pieces for an entire season, a dozen\nvirtuosos with concertos, trios, and duos, but--what am I saying--the\nupshot of it all is that I don't do much more than to stretch the\ncanvas, smooth the bow, line the scores. For I am--no false modesty,\nFriend Severin; you can lie to others, but you don't quite succeed any\nlonger in lying to yourself--I am nothing but a dilettante, a dilettante\nin painting, in poetry, in music, and several other of the so-called\nunprofitable arts, which, however, at present secure for their masters\nthe income of a cabinet minister, or even that of a minor potentate.\nAbove all else I am a dilettante in life.\n\nUp to the present I have lived as I have painted and written poetry.\nI never got far beyond the preparation, the plan, the first act, the\nfirst stanza. There are people like that who begin everything, and\nnever finish anything. I am such a one.\n\nBut what am I saying?\n\nTo the business in hand.\n\nI lie in my window, and the miserable little town, which fills me\nwith despondency, really seems infinitely full of poetry. How\nwonderful the outlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwoven\nwith golden sunlight; mountain-torrents weave through them like\nribbons of silver! How clear and blue the heavens into which\nsnowcapped crags project; how green and fresh the forested slopes;\nthe meadows on which small herds graze, down to the yellow billows\nof grain where reapers stand and bend over and rise up again.\n\nThe house in which I live stands in a sort of park, or forest, or\nwilderness, whatever one wants to call it, and is very solitary.\n\nIts sole inhabitants are myself, a widow from Lemberg, and Madame\nTartakovska, who runs the house, a little old woman, who grows older\nand smaller each day. There are also an old dog that limps on one\nleg, and a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn. This\nball of yarn, I believe, belongs to the widow.\n\nShe is said to be really beautiful, this widow, still very young,\ntwenty-four at the most, and very rich. She dwells in the first story,\nand I on the ground floor. She always keeps the green blinds drawn, and\nhas a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbing-plants. I for my\npart down below have a comfortable, intimate arbor of honeysuckle, in\nwhich I read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs. I\ncan look up on the balcony. Sometimes I actually do so, and then from\ntime to time a white gown gleams between the dense green network.\n\nReally the beautiful woman up there doesn't interest me very much, for I\nam in love with someone else, and terribly unhappy at that; far more\nunhappy than the Knight of Toggenburg or the Chevalier in Manon\nl'Escault, because the object of my adoration is of stone.\n\nIn the garden, in the tiny wilderness, there is a graceful little\nmeadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully. On this meadow is\na stone statue of Venus, the original of which, I believe, is in\nFlorence. This Venus is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in\nall my life.\n\nThat, however, does not signify much, for I have seen few beautiful\nwomen, or rather few women at all. In love too, I am a dilettante who\nnever got beyond the preparation, the first act.\n\nBut why talk in superlatives, as if something that is beautiful\ncould be surpassed?\n\nIt is sufficient to say that this Venus is beautiful. I love her\npassionately with a morbid intensity; madly as one can only love a\nwoman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternally\nuniform, eternally calm, stony smile. I literally adore her.\n\nI often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch when\nthe sun broods over the forest. Often I visit that cold, cruel\nmistress of mine by night and lie on my knees before her, with the\nface pressed against the cold pedestal on which her feet rest, and\nmy prayers go up to her.\n\nThe rising moon, which just now is waning, produces an indescribable\neffect. It seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadow\nin its gleam of silver. The goddess stands as if transfigured, and\nseems to bathe in the soft moonlight.\n\nOnce when I was returning from my devotions by one of the walks\nleading to the house, I suddenly saw a woman's figure, white as\nstone, under the illumination of the moon and separated from me\nmerely by a screen of trees. It seemed as if the beautiful woman of\nmarble had taken pity on me, become alive, and followed me. I was\nseized by a nameless fear, my heart threatened to burst, and instead--\n\nWell, I am a dilettante. As always, I broke down at the second\nstanza; rather, on the contrary, I did not break down, but ran away\nas fast as my legs would carry me.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat an accident! Through a Jew, dealing in photographs I secured a\npicture of my ideal. It is a small reproduction of Titian's \"Venus\nwith the Mirror.\" What a woman! I want to write a poem, but instead,\nI take the reproduction, and write on it: _Venus in Furs_.\n\nYou are cold, while you yourself fan flames. By all means wrap\nyourself in your despotic furs, there is no one to whom they are more\nappropriate, cruel goddess of love and of beauty!--After a while I add\na few verses from Goethe, which I recently found in his paralipomena\nto _Faust_.\n\nTO AMOR\n\n\"The pair of wings a fiction are,\nThe arrows, they are naught but claws,\nThe wreath conceals the little horns,\nFor without any doubt he is\nLike all the gods of ancient Greece\nOnly a devil in disguise.\"\n\nThen I put the picture before me on my table, supporting it with a\nbook, and looked at it.\n\nI was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear by\nthe cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms\nin her furs of dark sable; by the severity and hardness which lay in\nthis cold marble-like face. Again I took my pen in hand, and wrote\nthe following words:\n\n\"To love, to be loved, what happiness! And yet how the glamour of\nthis pales in comparison with the tormenting bliss of worshipping a\nwoman who makes a plaything out of us, of being the slave of a\nbeautiful tyrant who treads us pitilessly underfoot. Even Samson, the\nhero, the giant, again put himself into the hands of Delilah, even\nafter she had betrayed him, and again she betrayed him, and the\nPhilistines bound him and put out his eyes which until the very end\nhe kept fixed, drunken with rage and love, upon the beautiful\nbetrayer.\"\n\nI was breakfasting in my honey-suckle arbor, and reading in the Book\nof Judith. I envied the hero Holofernes because of the regal woman\nwho cut off his head with a sword, and because of his beautiful\nsanguinary end.\n\n\"The almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the\nhands of a woman.\"\n\nThis sentence strangely impressed me.\n\nHow ungallant these Jews are, I thought. And their God might choose\nmore becoming expressions when he speaks of the fair sex.\n\n\"The almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the\nhands of a woman,\" I repeated to myself. What shall I do, so that He\nmay punish me?\n\nHeaven preserve us! Here comes the housekeeper, who has again\ndiminished somewhat in size overnight. And up there among the green\ntwinings and garlandings the white gown gleams again. Is it Venus,\nor the widow?\n\nThis time it happens to be the widow, for Madame Tartakovska makes\na courtesy, and asks me in her name for something to read. I run to\nmy room, and gather together a couple of volumes.\n\nLater I remember that my picture of Venus is in one of them, and now\nit and my effusions are in the hands of the white woman up there\ntogether. What will she say?\n\nI hear her laugh.\n\nIs she laughing at me?\n\nIt is full moon. It is already peering over the tops of the low\nhemlocks that fringe the park. A silvery exhalation fills the\nterrace, the groups of trees, all the landscape, as far as the eye\ncan reach; in the distance it gradually fades away, like trembling\nwaters.\n\nI cannot resist. I feel a strange urge and call within me. I put on\nmy clothes again and go out into the garden.\n\nSome power draws me toward the meadow, toward her, who is my\ndivinity and my beloved.\n\nThe night is cool. I feel a slight chill. The atmosphere is heavy\nwith the odor of flowers and of the forest. It intoxicates.\n\nWhat solemnity! What music round about! A nightingale sobs. The\nstars quiver very faintly in the pale-blue glamour. The meadow seems\nsmooth, like a mirror, like a covering of ice on a pond.\n\nThe statue of Venus stands out august and luminous.\n\nBut--what has happened? From the marble shoulders of the goddess a\nlarge dark fur flows down to her heels. I stand dumbfounded and stare\nat her in amazement; again an indescribable fear seizes hold of me\nand I take flight.\n\nI hasten my steps, and notice that I have missed the main path. As\nI am about to turn aside into one of the green walks I see Venus\nsitting before me on a stone bench, not the beautiful woman of\nmarble, but the goddess of love herself with warm blood and throbbing\npulses. She has actually come to life for me, like the statue that\nbegan to breathe for her creator. Indeed, the miracle is only half\ncompleted. Her white hair seems still to be of stone, and her white\ngown shimmers like moonlight, or is it satin? From her shoulders the\ndark fur flows. But her lips are already reddening and her cheeks\nbegin to take color. Two diabolical green rays out of her eyes fall\nupon me, and now she laughs.\n\nHer laughter is very mysterious, very--I don't know. It cannot be\ndescribed, it takes my breath away. I flee further, and after every\nfew steps I have to pause to take breath. The mocking laughter\npursues me through the dark leafy paths, across light open spaces,\nthrough the thicket where only single moonbeams can pierce. I can no\nlonger find my way, I wander about utterly confused, with cold drops\nof perspiration on the forehead.\n\nFinally I stand still, and engage in a short monologue.\n\nIt runs--well--one is either very polite to one's self or very rude.\n\nI say to myself:\n\n\"Donkey!\"\n\nThis word exercises a remarkable effect, like a magic formula, which\nsets me free and makes me master of myself.\n\nI am perfectly quiet in a moment.\n\nWith considerable pleasure I repeat: \"Donkey!\"\n\nNow everything is perfectly clear and distinct before my eyes again.\nThere is the fountain, there the alley of box-wood, there the house\nwhich I am slowly approaching.\n\nYet--suddenly the appearance is here again. Behind the green screen\nthrough which the moonlight gleams so that it seems embroidered with\nsilver, I again see the white figure, the woman of stone whom I\nadore, whom I fear and flee.\n\nWith a couple of leaps I am within the house and catch my breath and\nreflect.\n\nWhat am I really, a little dilettante or a great big donkey?\n\nA sultry morning, the atmosphere is dead, heavily laden with odors,\nyet stimulating. Again I am sitting in my honey-suckle arbor, reading\nin the Odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirers\ninto beasts. A wonderful picture of antique love.\n\nThere is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of my\nbook rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustling.\n\nA woman's dress--\n\nShe is there--Venus--but without furs--No, this time it is merely\nthe widow--and yet--Venus-oh, what a woman!\n\nAs she stands there in her light white morning gown, looking at me, her\nslight figure seems full of poetry and grace. She is neither large, nor\nsmall; her head is alluring, piquant--in the sense of the period of the\nFrench marquises--rather than formally beautiful. What enchantment and\nsoftness, what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth! Her\nskin is so infinitely delicate, that the blue veins show through\neverywhere; even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom. How\nabundant her red hair-it is red, not blonde or golden-yellow--how\ndiabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck! Now her eyes\nmeet mine like green lightnings--they are green, these eyes of hers,\nwhose power is so indescribable--green, but as are precious stones, or\ndeep unfathomable mountain lakes.\n\nShe observes my confusion, which has even made me discourteous, for I\nhave remained seated and still have my cap on my head.\n\nShe smiles roguishly.\n\nFinally I rise and bow to her. She comes closer, and bursts out into\na loud, almost childlike laughter. I stammer, as only a little\ndilettante or great big donkey can do on such an occasion.\n\nThus our acquaintance began.\n\nThe divinity asks for my name, and mentions her own.\n\nHer name is Wanda von Dunajew.\n\nAnd she is actually my Venus.\n\n\"But madame, what put the idea into your head?\"\n\n\"The little picture in one of your books--\"\n\n\"I had forgotten about it.\"\n\n\"The curious notes on its back--\"\n\n\"Why curious?\"\n\nShe looked at me.\n\n\"I have always wanted to know a real dreamer some time--for the sake\nof the change--and you seem one of the maddest of the tribe.\"\n\n\"Dear lady--in fact--\" Again I fell victim to an odious, asinine\nstammering, and in addition blushed in a way that might have been\nappropriate for a youngster of sixteen, but not for me, who was\nalmost a full ten years older--\n\n\"You were afraid of me last night.\"\n\n\"Really--of course--but won't you sit down?\"\n\nShe sat down, and enjoyed my embarrassment--for actually I was even\nmore afraid of her now in the full light of day. A delightful\nexpression of contempt hovered about her upper lip.\n\n\"You look at love, and especially woman,\" she began, \"as something\nhostile, something against which you put up a defense, even if\nunsuccessfully. You feel that their power over you gives you a\nsensation of pleasurable torture, of pungent cruelty. This is a\ngenuinely modern point of view.\"\n\n\"You don't share it?\"\n\n\"I do not share it,\" she said quickly and decisively, shaking her\nhead, so that her curls flew up like red flames.\n\n\"The ideal which I strive to realize in my life is the serene\nsensuousness of the Greeks--pleasure without pain. I do not believe\nin the kind of love which is preached by Christianity, by the\nmoderns, by the knights of the spirit. Yes, look at me, I am worse\nthan a heretic, I am a pagan.\n\n'Doest thou imagine long the goddess of love took counsel\nWhen in Ida's grove she was pleased with the hero Achilles?'\n\n\"These lines from Goethe's _Roman Elegy_ have always delighted me.\n\n\"In nature there is only the love of the heroic age, 'when gods and\ngoddesses loved.' At that time 'desire followed the glance, enjoyment\ndesire.' All else is factitious, affected, a lie. Christianity, whose\ncruel emblem, the cross, has always had for me an element of the\nmonstrous, brought something alien and hostile into nature and its\ninnocent instincts.\n\n\"The battle of the spirit with the senses is the gospel of modern\nman. I do not care to have a share in it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mount Olympus would be the place for you, madame,\" I replied,\n\"but we moderns can no longer support the antique serenity, least of\nall in love. The idea of sharing a woman, even if it were an Aspasia,\nwith another revolts us. We are jealous as is our God. For example,\nwe have made a term abuse out of the name of the glorious Phryne.\n\n\"We prefer one of Holbein's meagre, pallid virgins, which is wholly\nours to an antique Venus, no matter how divinely beautiful she is,\nbut who loves Anchises to-day, Paris to-morrow, Adonis the day after.\nAnd if nature triumphs in us so that we give our whole glowing,\npassionate devotion to such a woman, her serene joy of life appears\nto us as something demonic and cruel, and we read into our happiness\na sin which we must expiate.\"\n\n\"So you too are one of those who rave about modern women, those\nmiserable hysterical feminine creatures who don't appreciate a real\nman in their somnambulistic search for some dream-man and masculine\nideal. Amid tears and convulsions they daily outrage their Christian\nduties; they cheat and are cheated; they always seek again and choose\nand reject; they are never happy, and never give happiness. They\naccuse fate instead of calmly confessing that they want to love and\nlive as Helen and Aspasia lived. Nature admits of no permanence in\nthe relation between man and woman.\"\n\n\"But, my dear lady--\"\n\n\"Let me finish. It is only man's egoism which wants to keep woman\nlike some buried treasure. All endeavors to introduce permanence in\nlove, the most changeable thing in this changeable human existence,\nhave gone shipwreck in spite of religious ceremonies, vows, and\nlegalities. Can you deny that our Christian world has given itself\nover to corruption?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"But you are about to say, the individual who rebels against the\narrangements of society is ostracized, branded, stoned. So be it. I\nam willing to take the risk; my principles are very pagan. I will\nlive my own life as it pleases me. I am willing to do without your\nhypocritical respect; I prefer to be happy. The inventors of the\nChristian marriage have done well, simultaneously to invent\nimmortality. I, however, have no wish to live eternally. When with\nmy last breath everything as far as Wanda von Dunajew is concerned\ncomes to an end here below, what does it profit me whether my pure\nspirit joins the choirs of angels, or whether my dust goes into the\nformation of new beings? Shall I belong to one man whom I don't love,\nmerely because I have once loved him? No, I do not renounce; I love\neveryone who pleases me, and give happiness to everyone who loves me.\nIs that ugly? No, it is more beautiful by far, than if cruelly I\nenjoy the tortures, which my beauty excites, and virtuously reject\nthe poor fellow who is pining away for me. I am young, rich, and\nbeautiful, and I live serenely for the sake of pleasure and\nenjoyment.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking her eyes sparkled roguishly, and I had taken\nhold of her hands without exactly knowing what to do with them, but\nbeing a genuine dilettante I hastily let go of them again.\n\n\"Your frankness,\" I said, \"delights me, and not it alone--\"\n\nMy confounded dilettantism again throttled me as though there were\na rope around my neck.\n\n\"You were about to say--\"\n\n\"I was about to say--I was--I am sorry--I interrupted you.\"\n\n\"How, so?\"\n\nA long pause. She is doubtless engaging in a monologue, which\ntranslated into my language would be comprised in the single word,\n\"donkey.\"\n\n\"If I may ask,\" I finally began, \"how did you arrive at these--these\nconclusions?\"\n\n\"Quite simply, my father was an intelligent man. From my cradle onward\nI was surrounded by replicas of ancient art; at ten years of age I\nread _Gil Blas_, at twelve _La Pucelle_. Where others had\nHop-o'-my-thumb, Bluebeard, Cinderella, as childhood friends, mine\nwere Venus and Apollo, Hercules and Lackoon. My husband's personality\nwas filled with serenity and sunlight. Not even the incurable illness\nwhich fell upon him soon after our marriage could long cloud his brow.\nOn the very night of his death he took me in his arms, and during the\nmany months when he lay dying in his wheel chair, he often said\njokingly to me: 'Well, have you already picked out a lover?' I blushed\nwith shame. 'Don't deceive me,' he added on one occasion, 'that would\nseem ugly to me, but pick out an attractive lover, or preferably\nseveral. You are a splendid woman, but still half a child, and you\nneed toys.'\n\n\"I suppose, I hardly need tell you that during his life time I had\nno lover; but it was through him that I have become what I am, a\nwoman of Greece.\"\n\n\"A goddess,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"Which one,\" she smiled.\n\n\"Venus.\"\n\nShe threatened me with her finger and knitted her brows. \"Perhaps,\neven a 'Venus in Furs.' Watch out, I have a large, very large fur,\nwith which I could cover you up entirely, and I have a mind to catch\nyou in it as in a net.\"\n\n\"Do you believe,\" I said quickly, for an idea which seemed good, in\nspite of its conventionality and triteness, flashed into my head, \"do\nyou believe that your theories could be carried into execution at the\npresent time, that Venus would be permitted to stray with impunity\namong our railroads and telegraphs in all her undraped beauty and\nserenity?\"\n\n\"_Undraped_, of course not, but in furs,\" she replied smiling, \"would\nyou care to see mine?\"\n\n\"And then--\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Beautiful, free, serene, and happy human beings, such as the Greeks\nwere, are only possible when it is permitted to have _slaves_ who will\nperform the prosaic tasks of every day for them and above all else\nlabor for them.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied playfully, \"an Olympian divinity, such as\nI am, requires a whole army of slaves. Beware of me!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nI myself was frightened at the hardiness with which I uttered this\n\"why\"; it did not startle her in the least.\n\nShe drew back her lips a little so that her small white teeth became\nvisible, and then said lightly, as if she were discussing some\ntrifling matter, \"Do you want to be my slave?\"\n\n\"There is no equality in love,\" I replied solemnly. \"Whenever it is\na matter of choice for me of ruling or being ruled, it seems much\nmore satisfactory to me to be the slave of a beautiful woman. But\nwhere shall I find the woman who knows how to rule, calmly, full of\nself-confidence, even harshly, and not seek to gain her power by\nmeans of petty nagging?\"\n\n\"Oh, that might not be so difficult.\"\n\n\"You think--\"\n\n\"I--for instance--\" she laughed and leaned far back--\"I have a real\ntalent for despotism--I also have the necessary furs--but last night\nyou were really seriously afraid of me!\"\n\n\"Quite seriously.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"Now, I am more afraid of you than ever!\"\n\nWe are together every day, I and--Venus; we are together a great\ndeal. We breakfast in my honey-suckle arbor, and have tea in her\nlittle sitting-room. I have an opportunity to unfold all my small,\nvery small talents. Of what use would have been my study of all the\nvarious sciences, my playing at all the arts, if I were unable in the\ncase of a pretty, little woman--\n\nBut this woman is by no means little; in fact she impresses me\ntremendously. I made a drawing of her to-day, and felt particularly\nclearly, how inappropriate the modern way of dressing is for a\ncameo-head like hers. The configuration of her face has little of the\nRoman, but much of the Greek.\n\nSometimes I should like to paint her as Psyche, and then again as\nAstarte. It depends upon the expression in her eyes, whether it is\nvaguely dreamy, or half-consuming, filled with tired desire.\nShe, however, insists that it be a portrait-likeness.\n\nI shall make her a present of furs.\n\nHow could I have any doubts? If not for her, for whom would princely\nfurs be suitable?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI was with her yesterday evening, reading the _Roman Elegies_ to her.\nThen I laid the book aside, and improvised something for her. She\nseemed pleased; rather more than that, she actually hung upon my\nwords, and her bosom heaved.\n\nOr was I mistaken?\n\nThe rain beat in melancholy fashion on the window-panes, the fire\ncrackled in the fireplace in wintery comfort. I felt quite at home\nwith her, and for a moment lost all my fear of this beautiful woman;\nI kissed her hand, and she permitted it.\n\nThen I sat down at her feet and read a short poem I had written for\nher.\n\nVENUS IN FURS.\n\n\"Place thy foot upon thy slave,\nOh thou, half of hell, half of dreams;\nAmong the shadows, dark and grave,\nThy extended body softly gleams.\"\n\nAnd--so on. This time I really got beyond the first stanza. At her\nrequest I gave her the poem in the evening, keeping no copy. And now\nas I am writing this down in my diary I can only remember the first\nstanza.\n\nI am filled with a very curious sensation. I don't believe that I am\nin love with Wanda; I am sure that at our first meeting, I felt\nnothing of the lightning-like flashes of passion. But I feel how her\nextraordinary, really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snares\nabout me. It isn't any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me; it\nis a physical subjection, coming on slowly, but for that reason more\nabsolutely.\n\nI suffer under it more and more each day, and she--she merely smiles.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout any provocation she suddenly said to me to-day: \"You\ninterest me. Most men are very commonplace, without verve or poetry.\nIn you there is a certain depth and capacity for enthusiasm and a\ndeep seriousness, which delight me. I might learn to love you.\"\n\nAfter a short but severe shower we went out together to the meadow\nand the statue of Venus. All about us the earth steamed; mists rose\nup toward heaven like clouds of incense; a shattered rainbow still\nhovered in the air. The trees were still shedding drops, but sparrows\nand finches were already hopping from twig to twig. They are\ntwittering gaily, as if very much pleased at something. Everything\nis filled with a fresh fragrance. We cannot cross the meadow for it\nis still wet. In the sunlight it looks like a small pool, and the\ngoddess of love seems to rise from the undulations of its mirror-like\nsurface. About her head a swarm of gnats is dancing, which,\nilluminated by the sun, seem to hover above her like an aureole.\n\nWanda is enjoying the lovely scene. As all the benches along the\nwalk are still wet, she supports herself on my arm to rest a while.\nA soft weariness permeates her whole being, her eyes are half closed;\nI feel the touch of her breath on my cheek.\n\nHow I managed to get up courage enough I really don't know, but I\ntook hold of her hand, asking,\n\n\"Could you love me?\"\n\n\"Why not,\" she replied, letting her calm, clear look rest upon me,\nbut not for long.\n\nA moment later I am kneeling before her, pressing my burning face\nagainst the fragrant muslin of her gown.\n\n\"But Severin--this isn't right,\" she cried.\n\nBut I take hold of her little foot, and press my lips upon it.\n\n\"You are getting worse and worse!\" she cried. She tore herself free,\nand fled rapidly toward the house, the while her adorable slipper\nremained in my hand.\n\nIs it an omen?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAll day long I didn't dare to go near her. Toward evening as I was\nsitting in my arbor her gay red head peered suddenly through the\ngreenery of her balcony. \"Why don't you come up?\" he called down\nimpatiently.\n\nI ran upstairs, and at the top lost courage again. I knocked very\nlightly. She didn't say come-in, but opened the door herself, and\nstood on the threshold.\n\n\"Where is my slipper?\"\n\n\"It is--I have--I want,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Get it, and then we will have tea together, and chat.\"\n\nWhen I returned, she was engaged in making tea. I ceremoniously\nplaced the slipper on the table, and stood in the corner like a child\nawaiting punishment.\n\nI noticed that her brows were slightly contracted, and there was an\nexpression of hardness and dominance about her lips which delighted\nme.\n\nAll of a sudden she broke out laughing.\n\n\"So--you are really in love--with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I suffer more from it than you can imagine?\"\n\n\"You suffer?\" she laughed again.\n\nI was revolted, mortified, annihilated, but all this was quite\nuseless.\n\n\"Why?\" she continued, \"I like you, with all my heart.\"\n\nShe gave me her hand, and looked at me in the friendliest fashion.\n\n\"And will you be my wife?\"\n\nWanda looked at me--how did she look at me? I think first of all\nwith surprise, and then with a tinge of irony.\n\n\"What has given you so much courage, all at once?\"\n\n\"Courage?\"\n\n\"Yes courage, to ask anyone to be your wife, and me in particular?\"\nShe lifted up the slipper. \"Was it through a sudden friendship with\nthis? But joking aside. Do you really wish to marry me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, Severin, that is a serious matter. I believe, you love me,\nand I care for you too, and what is more important each of us finds\nthe other interesting. There is no danger that we would soon get\nbored, but, you know, I am a fickle person, and just for that reason\nI take marriage seriously. If I assume obligations, I want to be able\nto meet them. But I am afraid--no--it would hurt you.\"\n\n\"Please be perfectly frank with me,\" I replied.\n\n\"Well then honestly, I don't believe I could love a man longer than--\"\nShe inclined her head gracefully to one side and mused.\n\n\"A year.\"\n\n\"What do you imagine--a month perhaps.\"\n\n\"Not even me?\"\n\n\"Oh you--perhaps two.\"\n\n\"Two months!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Two months is very long.\"\n\n\"You go beyond antiquity, madame.\"\n\n\"You see, you cannot stand the truth.\"\n\nWanda walked across the room and leaned back against the fireplace,\nwatching me and resting one of her arms on the mantelpiece.\n\n\"What shall I do with you?\" she began anew.\n\n\"Whatever you wish,\" I replied with resignation, \"whatever will give\nyou pleasure.\"\n\n\"How illogical!\" she cried, \"first you want to make me your wife,\nand then you offer yourself to me as something to toy with.\"\n\n\"Wanda--I love you.\"\n\n\"Now we are back to the place where we started. You love me, and\nwant to make me your wife, but I don't want to enter into a new\nmarriage, because I doubt the permanence of both my and your\nfeelings.\"\n\n\"But if I am willing to take the risk with you?\" I replied.\n\n\"But it also depends on whether I am willing to risk it with you,\"\nshe said quietly. \"I can easily imagine belonging to one man for my\nentire life, but he would have to be a whole man, a man who would\ndominate me, who would subjugate me by his inate strength, do you\nunderstand? And every man--I know this very well--as soon as he falls\nin love becomes weak, pliable, ridiculous. He puts himself into the\nwoman's hands, kneels down before her. The only man whom I could love\npermanently would be he before whom I should have to kneel. I've gotten\nto like you so much, however, that I'll try it with you.\"\n\nI fell down at her feet.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, here you are kneeling already,\" she said\nmockingly. \"You are making a good beginning.\" When I had risen again\nshe continued, \"I will give you a year's time to win me, to convince\nme that we are suited to each other, that we might live together. If\nyou succeed, I will become your wife, and a wife, Severin, who will\nconscientiously and strictly perform all her duties. During this year\nwe will live as though we were married--\"\n\nMy blood rose to my head.\n\nIn her eyes too there was a sudden flame--\n\n\"We will live together,\" she continued, \"share our daily life, so that\nwe may find out whether we are really fitted for each other. _I grant\nyou all the rights of a husband, of a lover, of a friend._ Are you\nsatisfied?\"\n\n\"I suppose, I'll have to be?\"\n\n\"You don't have to.\"\n\n\"Well then, I want to--\"\n\n\"Splendid. That is how a man speaks. Here is my hand.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor ten days I have been with her every hour, except at night. All\nthe time I was allowed to look into her eyes, hold her hands, listen\nto what she said, accompany her wherever she went.\n\nMy love seems to me like a deep, bottomless abyss, into which I\nsubside deeper and deeper. There is nothing now which could save me\nfrom it.\n\nThis afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of the\nVenus-statue. I plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap; she\nwound them into wreaths with which we adorned our goddess.\n\nSuddenly Wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became\nconfused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration. Losing\ncommand over myself, I threw my arms about her and clung to her lips,\nand she--she drew me close to her heaving breast.\n\n\"Are you angry?\" I then asked her.\n\n\"I am never angry at anything that is natural--\" she replied, \"but\n_I_ am afraid you suffer.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am suffering frightfully.\"\n\n\"Poor friend!\" she brushed my disordered hair back from my fore-head. \"I\nhope it isn't through any fault of mine.\"\n\n\"No--\" I replied,--\"and yet my love for you has become a sort of\nmadness. The thought that I might lose you, perhaps actually lose\nyou, torments me day and night.\"\n\n\"But you don't yet possess me,\" said Wanda, and again she looked at\nme with that vibrant, consuming expression, which had already once\nbefore carried me away. Then she rose, and with her small transparent\nhands placed a wreath of blue anemones upon the ringletted white head\nof Venus. Half against my will I threw my arm around her body.\n\n\"I can no longer live without you, oh wonderful woman,\" I said.\n\"Believe me, believe only this once, that this time it is not a\nphrase, not a thing of dreams. I feel deep down in my innermost soul,\nthat my life belongs inseparably with yours. If you leave me, I shall\nperish, go to pieces.\"\n\n\"That will hardly be necessary, for I love you,\" she took hold of my\nchin, \"you foolish man!\"\n\n\"But you will be mine only under conditions, while I belong to you\nunconditionally--\"\n\n\"That isn't wise, Severin,\" she replied almost with a start. \"Don't\nyou know me yet, do you absolutely refuse to know me? I am good when\nI am treated seriously and reasonably, but when you abandon yourself\ntoo absolutely to me, I grow arrogant--\"\n\n\"So be it, be arrogant, be despotic,\" I cried in the fulness of\nexaltation, \"only be mine, mine forever.\" I lay at her feet,\nembracing her knees.\n\n\"Things will end badly, my friend,\" she said soberly, without moving.\n\n\"It shall never end,\" I cried excitedly, almost violently. \"Only death\nshall part us. If you cannot be mine, all mine and for always, then _I\nwant to be your slave_, serve you, suffer everything from you, if only\nyou won't drive me away.\"\n\n\"Calm yourself,\" she said, bending down and kissing my forehead, \"I\nam really very fond of you, but your way is not the way to win and\nhold me.\"\n\n\"I want to do everything, absolutely everything, that you want, only\nnot to lose you,\" I cried, \"only not that, I cannot bear the thought.\"\n\n\"Do get up.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"You are a strange person,\" continued Wanda. \"You wish to possess me\nat any price?\"\n\n\"Yes, at any price.\"\n\n\"But of what value, for instance, would that be?\"--She pondered; a\nlurking uncanny expression entered her eyes--\"If I no longer loved\nyou, if I belonged to another.\"\n\nA shudder ran through me. I looked at her She stood firmly and\nconfident before me, and her eyes disclosed a cold gleam.\n\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"the very thought frightens you.\" A\nbeautiful smile suddenly illuminated her face.\n\n\"I feel a perfect horror, when I imagine, that the woman I love and\nwho has responded to my love could give herself to another regardless\nof me. But have I still a choice? If I love such a woman, even unto\nmadness, shall I turn my back to her and lose everything for the sake\nof a bit of boastful strength; shall I send a bullet through my\nbrains? I have two ideals of woman. If I cannot obtain the one that\nis noble and simple, the woman who will faithfully and truly share\nmy life, well then I don't want anything half-way or lukewarm. Then\nI would rather be subject to a woman without virtue, fidelity, or pity.\nSuch a woman in her magnificent selfishness is likewise an ideal. If\nI am not permitted to enjoy the happiness of love, fully and wholly,\nI want to taste its pains and torments to the very dregs; I want to\nbe maltreated and betrayed by the woman I love, and the more cruelly\nthe better. This too is a luxury.\"\n\n\"Have you lost your senses,\" cried Wanda.\n\n\"I love you with all my soul,\" I continued, \"with all my senses, and\nyour presence and personality are absolutely essential to me, if I\nam to go on living. Choose between my ideals. Do with me what you will,\nmake of me your husband or your slave.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Wanda, contracting her small but strongly arched\nbrows, \"it seems to me it would be rather entertaining to have a man,\nwho interests me and loves me, completely in my power; at least I\nshall not lack pastime. You were imprudent enough to leave the choice\nto me. Therefore I choose; I want you to be my slave, I shall make\na plaything for myself out of you!\"\n\n\"Oh, please do,\" I cried half-shuddering, half-enraptured. \"If the\nfoundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement, it is\nlikewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites. We\nare such opposites, almost enemies. That is why my love is part hate,\npart fear. In such a relation only one can be hammer and the other\nanvil. I wish to be the anvil. I cannot be happy when I look down\nupon the woman I love. I want to adore a woman, and this I can only\ndo when she is cruel towards me.\"\n\n\"But, Severin,\" replied Wanda, almost angrily, \"do you believe me\ncapable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do, and whom I love?\"\n\n\"Why not, if I adore you the more on this account? _It is possible to\nlove really only that which stands above us,_ a woman, who through her\nbeauty, temperament, intelligence, and strength of will subjugates us\nand becomes a despot over us.\"\n\n\"Then that which repels others, attracts you.\"\n\n\"Yes. That is the strange part of me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, after all, there isn't anything so very unique or strange\nin all your passions, for who doesn't love beautiful furs? And\neveryone knows and feels how closely sexual love and cruelty are\nrelated.\"\n\n\"But in my case all these elements are raised to their highest\ndegree,\" I replied.\n\n\"In other words, reason has little power over you, and you are by\nnature, soft, sensual, yielding.\"\n\n\"Were the martyrs also soft and sensual by nature?\"\n\n\"The martyrs?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, they were _supersensual men,_ who found enjoyment in\nsuffering. They sought out the most frightful tortures, even death\nitself, as others seek joy, and as they were, so am I--_supersensual.\"_\n\n\"Have a care that in being such, you do not become a martyr to love,\nthe _martyr of a woman_.\"\n\nWe are sitting on Wanda's little balcony in the mellow fragrant\nsummer night. A twofold roof is above us, first the green ceiling of\nclimbing-plants, and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerable\nstars. The low wailing love-call of a cat rises from the park. I am\nsitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity, and am telling her\nof my childhood.\n\n\"And even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly marked\nin you?\" asked Wanda.\n\n\"Of course, I can't remember a time when I didn't have them. Even in\nmy cradle, so mother has told me, I was _supersensual._ I scorned the\nhealthy breast of my nurse, and had to be brought up on goats' milk.\nAs a little boy I was mysteriously shy before women, which really was\nonly an expression of an inordinate interest in them. I was oppressed\nby the gray arches and half-darknesses of the church, and actually\nafraid of the glittering altars and images of the saints. Secretly,\nhowever, I sneaked as to a secret joy to a plaster-Venus which stood\nin my father's little library. I kneeled down before her, and to her I\nsaid the prayers I had been taught--the Paternoster, the Ave Maria,\nand the Credo.\n\n\"Once at night I left my bed to visit her. The sickle of the moon\nwas my light and showed me the goddess in a pale-blue cold light. I\nprostrated myself before her and kissed her cold feet, as I had seen\nour peasants do when they kissed the feet of the dead Savior.\n\n\"An irresistible yearning seized me.\n\n\"I got up and embraced the beautiful cold body and kissed the cold\nlips. A deep shudder fell upon me and I fled, and later in a dream,\nit seemed to me, as if the goddess stood beside my bed, threatening\nme with up-raised arm.\n\n\"I was sent to school early and soon reached the gymnasium. I\npassionately grasped at everything which promised to make the world\nof antiquity accessible to me. Soon I was more familiar with the gods\nof Greece than with the religion of Jesus. I was with Paris when he\ngave the fateful apple to Venus, I saw Troy burn, and followed\nUlysses on his wanderings. The prototypes of all that is beautiful\nsank deep into my soul, and consequently at the time when other boys\nare coarse and obscene, I displayed an insurmountable aversion to\neverything base, vulgar, unbeautiful.\n\n\"To me, the maturing youth, love for women seemed something\nespecially base and unbeautiful, for it showed itself to me first in\nall its commonness. I avoided all contact with the fair sex; in\nshort, I was supersensual to madness.\n\n\"When I was about fourteen my mother had a charming chamber-maid,\nyoung, attractive, with a figure just budding into womanhood. I was\nsitting one day studying my Tacitus and growing enthusiastic over the\nvirtues of the ancient Teutons, while she was sweeping my room.\nSuddenly she stopped, bent down over me, in the meantime holding fast\nto the broom, and a pair of fresh, full, adorable lips touched mine.\nThe kiss of the enamoured little cat ran through me like a shudder,\nbut I raised up my _Germania_, like a shield against the temptress,\nand indignantly left the room.\"\n\nWanda broke out in loud laughter. \"It would, indeed, be hard to find\nanother man like you, but continue.\"\n\n\"There is another unforgetable incident belonging to that period,\"\nI continued my story. \"Countess Sobol, a distant aunt of mine, was\nvisiting my parents. She was a beautiful majestic woman with an\nattractive smile. I, however, hated her, for she was regarded by the\nfamily as a sort of Messalina. My behavior toward her was as rude,\nmalicious, and awkward as possible.\n\n\"One day my parents drove to the capital of the district. My aunt\ndetermined to take advantage of their absence, and to exercise\njudgment over me. She entered unexpectedly in her fur-lined\n_kazabaika,_ [Footnote: A woman's jacket.] followed by the cook,\nkitchen-maid, and the cat of a chamber-maid whom I had scorned.\nWithout asking any questions, they seized me and bound me hand and\nfoot, in spite of my violent resistance. Then my aunt, with an evil\nsmile, rolled up her sleeve and began to whip me with a stout switch.\nShe whipped so hard that the blood flowed, and that, at last,\nnotwithstanding my heroic spirit, I cried and wept and begged for\nmercy. She then had me untied, but I had to get down on my knees and\nthank her for the punishment and kiss her hand.\n\n\"Now you understand the supersensual fool! Under the lash of a\nbeautiful woman my senses first realized the meaning of woman. In her\nfur-jacket she seemed to me like a wrathful queen, and from then on\nmy aunt became the most desirable woman on God's earth.\n\n\"My Cato-like austerity, my shyness before woman, was nothing but an\nexcessive feeling for beauty. In my imagination sensuality became a\nsort of cult. I took an oath to myself that I would not squander its\nholy wealth upon any ordinary person, but I would reserve it for an\nideal woman, if possible for the goddess of love herself.\n\n\"I went to the university at a very early age. It was in the capital\nwhere my aunt lived. My room looked at that time like Doctor\nFaustus's. Everything in it was in a wild confusion. There were huge\nclosets stuffed full of books, which I bought for a song from a\nJewish dealer on the Servanica; [Footnote: The street of the Jews in\nLemberg.] there were globes, atlases, flasks, charts of the heavens,\nskeletons of animals, skulls, the busts of eminent men. It looked as\nthough Mephistopheles might have stepped out from behind the huge\ngreen store as a wandering scholiast at any moment.\n\n\"I studied everything in a jumble without system, without selection:\nchemistry, alchemy, history, astronomy, philosophy, law, anatomy, and\nliterature; I read Homer, Virgil, Ossian, Schiller, Goethe,\nShakespeare, Cervantes, Voltaire, Moliere, the Koran, the Kosmos,\nCasanova's Memoirs. I grew more confused each day, more fantastical,\nmore supersensual. All the time a beautiful ideal woman hovered in my\nimagination. Every so and so often she appeared before me like a\nvision among my leather-bound books and dead bones, lying on a bed of\nroses, surrounded by cupids. Sometimes she appeared gowned like the\nOlympians with the stern white face of the plaster Venus; sometimes in\nbraids of a rich brown, blue-eyes, in my aunt's red velvet\n_kazabaika,_ trimmed with ermine.\n\n\"One morning when she had again risen out of the golden mist of my\nimagination in all her smiling beauty, I went to see Countess Sobol,\nwho received me in a friendly, even cordial manner. She gave me a\nkiss of welcome, which put all my senses in a turmoil. She was\nprobably about forty years old, but like most well-preserved women\nof the world, still very attractive. She wore as always her fur-edged\njacket. This time it was one of green velvet with brown marten. But\nnothing of the sternness which had so delighted me the other time was\nnow discernable.\n\n\"On the contrary, there was so little of cruelty in her that without\nany more ado she let me adore her.\n\n\"Only too soon did she discover my supersensual folly and innocence,\nand it pleased her to make me happy. As for myself--I was as happy\nas a young god. What rapture for me to be allowed to lie before her\non my knees, and to kiss her hands, those with which she had scourged\nme! What marvellous hands they were, of beautiful form, delicate,\nrounded, and white, with adorable dimples! I really was in love with\nher hands only. I played with them, let them submerge and emerge in\nthe dark fur, held them against the light, and was unable to satiate\nmy eyes with them.\"\n\nWanda involuntarily looked at her hand; I noticed it, and had to\nsmile.\n\n\"From the way in which the supersensual predominated in me in those\ndays you can see that I was in love only with the cruel lashes I\nreceived from my aunt; and about two years later when I paid court\nto a young actress only in the roles she played. Still later I became\nthe admirer of a respectable woman. She acted the part of\nirreproachable virtue, only in the end to betray me with a rich Jew.\nYou see, it is because I was betrayed, sold, by a woman who feigned\nthe strictest principles and the highest ideals, that I hate that\nsort of poetical, sentimental virtue so intensely. Give me rather a\nwoman who is honest enough to say to me: I am a Pompadour, a Lucretia\nBorgia, and I am ready to adore her.\"\n\nWanda rose and opened the window.\n\n\"You have a curious way of arousing one's imagination, stimulating\nall one's nerves, and making one's pulses beat faster. You put an\naureole on vice, provided only if it is honest. Your ideal is a\ndaring courtesan of genius. Oh, you are the kind of man who will\ncorrupt a woman to her very last fiber.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the middle of the night there was a knock at my window; I got up,\nopened it, and was startled. Without stood \"Venus in Furs,\" just as\nshe had appeared to me the first time.\n\n\"You have disturbed me with your stories; I have been tossing about\nin bed, and can't go to sleep,\" she said. \"Now come and stay with me.\"\n\n\"In a moment.\"\n\nAs I entered Wanda was crouching by the fireplace where she had\nkindled a small fire.\n\n\"Autumn is coming,\" she began, \"the nights are really quite cold\nalready. I am afraid you may not like it, but I can't put off my furs\nuntil the room is sufficiently warm.\"\n\n\"Not like it--you are joking--you know--\" I threw my arm around her,\nand kissed her.\n\n\"Of course, I know, but why this great fondness for furs?\"\n\n\"I was born with it,\" I replied. \"I already had it as a child.\nFurthermore furs have a stimulating effect on all highly organized\nnatures. This is due both to general and natural laws. It is a\nphysical stimulus which sets you tingling, and no one can wholly\nescape it. Science has recently shown a certain relationship between\nelectricity and warmth; at any rate, their effects upon the human\norganism are related. The torrid zone produces more passionate\ncharacters, a heated atmosphere stimulation. Likewise with\nelectricity. This is the reason why the presence of cats exercises\nsuch a magic influence upon highly-organized men of intellect. This\nis why these long-tailed Graces of the animal kingdom, these\nadorable, scintillating electric batteries have been the favorite\nanimal of a Mahommed, Cardinal Richelieu, Crebillon, Rousseau,\nWieland.\"\n\n\"A woman wearing furs, then,\" cried Wanda, \"is nothing else than a\nlarge cat, an augmented electric battery?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied. \"That is my explanation of the symbolic\nmeaning which fur has acquired as the attribute of power and beauty.\nMonarchs and the dominant higher nobility in former times used it in\nthis sense for their costume, exclusively; great painters used it\nonly for queenly beauty. The most beautiful frame, which Raphael\ncould find for the divine forms of Fornarina and Titian for the\nroseate body of his beloved, was dark furs.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the learned discourse on love,\" said Wanda, \"but you\nhaven't told me everything. You associate something entirely\nindividual with furs.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I cried. \"I have repeatedly told you that suffering has\na peculiar attraction for me. Nothing can intensify my passion more\nthan tyranny, cruelty, and especially the faithlessness of a\nbeautiful woman. And I cannot imagine this woman, this strange ideal\nderived from an aesthetics of ugliness, this soul of Nero in the body\nof a Phryne, except in furs.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Wanda interrupted. \"It gives a dominant and imposing\nquality to a woman.\"\n\n\"Not only that,\" I continued. \"You know I am _supersensual._ With me\neverything has its roots in the imagination, and thence it receives\nits nourishment. I was already pre-maturely developed and highly\nsensitive, when at about the age of ten the legends of the martyrs\nfell into my hands. I remember reading with a kind of horror, which\nreally was rapture, of how they pined in prisons, were laid on the\ngridiron, pierced with arrows, boiled in pitch, thrown to wild\nanimals, nailed to the cross, and suffered the most horrible torment\nwith a kind of joy. To suffer and endure cruel torture from then on\nseemed to me exquisite delight, especially when it was inflicted by a\nbeautiful woman, for ever since I can remember all poetry and\neverything demonic was for me concentrated in woman. I literally\ncarried the idea into a sort of cult.\n\n\"I felt there was something sacred in sex; in fact, it was the only\nsacred thing. In woman and her beauty I saw something divine, because\nthe most important function of existence--the continuation of the\nspecies--is her vocation. To me woman represented a personification of\nnature, _Isis_, and man was her priest, her slave. In contrast to him\nshe was cruel like nature herself who tosses aside whatever has served\nher purposes as soon as she no longer has need for it. To him her\ncruelties, even death itself, still were sensual raptures.\n\n\"I envied King Gunther whom the mighty Brunhilde fettered on the\nbridal night, and the poor troubadour whom his capricious mistress\nhad sewed in the skins of wolves to have him hunted like game. I\nenvied the Knight Ctirad whom the daring Amazon Scharka craftily\nensnared in a forest near Prague, and carried to her castle Divin,\nwhere, after having amused herself a while with him, she had him\nbroken on the wheel--\"\n\n\"Disgusting,\" cried Wanda. \"I almost wish you might fall into the\nhands of a woman of their savage race. In the wolf's skin, under the\nteeth of the dogs, or upon the wheel, you would lose the taste for\nyour kind of poetry.\"\n\n\"Do you think so? I hardly do.\"\n\n\"Have you actually lost your senses.\"\n\n\"Possibly. But let me go on. I developed a perfect passion for\nreading stories in which the extremest cruelties were described. I\nloved especially to look at pictures and prints which represented\nthem. All the sanguinary tyrants that ever occupied a throne; the\ninquisitors who had the heretics tortured, roasted, and butchered;\nall the woman whom the pages of history have recorded as lustful,\nbeautiful, and violent women like Libussa, Lucretia Borgia, Agnes of\nHungary, Queen Margot, Isabeau, the Sultana Roxolane, the Russian\nCzarinas of last century--all these I saw in furs or in robes\nbordered with ermine.\"\n\n\"And so furs now rouse strange imaginings in you,\" said Wanda, and\nsimultaneously she began to drape her magnificent fur-cloak\ncoquettishly about her, so that the dark shining sable played\nbeautifully around her bust and arms. \"Well, how do you feel now,\nhalf broken on the wheel?\"\n\nHer piercing green eyes rested on me with a peculiar mocking\nsatisfaction. Overcome by desire, I flung myself down before her, and\nthrew my arms about her.\n\n\"Yes--you have awakened my dearest dream,\" I cried. \"It has slept\nlong enough.\"\n\n\"And this is?\" She put her hand on my neck.\n\nI was seized with a sweet intoxication under the influence of this\nwarm little hand and of her regard, which, tenderly searching, fell\nupon me through her half-closed lids.\n\n_\"To be the slave of a woman, a beautiful woman, whom I love, whom\nI worship.\"_\n\n\"And who on that account maltreats you,\" interrupted Wanda, laughing.\n\n\"Yes, who fetters me and whips me, treads me underfoot, the while\nshe gives herself to another.\"\n\n\"And who in her wantonness will go so far as to make a present of\nyou to your successful rival when driven insane by jealousy you must\nmeet him face to face, who will turn you over to his absolute mercy.\nWhy not? This final tableau doesn't please you so well?\"\n\nI looked at Wanda frightened.\n\n\"You surpass my dreams.\"\n\n\"Yes, we women are inventive,\" she said, \"take heed, when you find\nyour ideal, it might easily happen, that she will treat you more\ncruelly than you anticipate.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that I have already found my ideal!\" I exclaimed,\nburying my burning face in her lap.\n\n\"Not I?\" exclaimed Wanda, throwing off her furs and moving about the\nroom laughing. She was still laughing as I went downstairs, and when\nI stood musing in the yard, I still heard her peals of laughter above.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Do you really then expect me to embody your ideal?\" Wanda asked\narchly, when we met in the park to-day.\n\nAt first I could find no answer. The most antagonistic emotions were\nbattling within me. In the meantime she sat down on one of the\nstone-benches, and played with a flower.\n\n\"Well--am I?\"\n\nI kneeled down and seized her hands.\n\n\"Once more I beg you to become my wife, my true and loyal wife; if\nyou can't do that then become the embodiment of my ideal, absolutely,\nwithout reservation, without softness.\"\n\n\"You know I am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand, if\nyou prove to be the man I am seeking,\" Wanda replied very seriously,\n\"but I think you would be more grateful to me if through me you\nrealized your imaginings. Well, which do you prefer?\"\n\n\"I believe that everything my imagination has dreamed lies latent in\nyour personality.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" I continued, \"that you enjoy having a man wholly in\nyour power, torturing him--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she exclaimed quickly, \"or perhaps--.\" She pondered.\n\n\"I don't understand myself any longer,\" she continued, \"but I have\na confession to make to you. You have corrupted my imagination and\ninflamed my blood. I am beginning to like the things you speak of.\nThe enthusiasm with which you speak of a Pompadour, a Catherine the\nSecond, and all the other selfish, frivolous, cruel women, carries\nme away and takes hold of my soul. It urges me on to become like those\nwomen, who in spite of their vileness were slavishly adored during\ntheir lifetime and still exert a miraculous power from their graves.\n\n\"You will end by making of me a despot in miniature, a domestic\nPompadour.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" I said in agitation, \"if all this is inherent in you,\ngive way to this trend of your nature. Nothing half-way. If you can't\nbe a true and loyal wife to me, be a demon.\"\n\nI was nervous from loss of sleep, and the proximity of the beautiful\nwoman affected me like a fever. I no longer recall what I said, but\nI remember that I kissed her feet, and finally raised her foot and\nput my neck under it. She withdrew it quickly, and rose almost angrily.\n\n\"If you love me, Severin,\" she said quickly, and her voice sounded\nsharp and commanding, \"never speak to me of those things again.\nUnderstand, never! Otherwise I might really--\" She smiled and sat\ndown again.\n\n\"I am entirely serious,\" I exclaimed, half-raving. \"I adore you so\ninfinitely that I am willing to suffer anything from you, for the\nsake of spending my whole life near you.\"\n\n\"Severin, once more I warn you.\"\n\n\"Your warning is vain. Do with me what you will, as long as you\ndon't drive me away.\"\n\n\"Severin,\" replied Wanda, \"I am a frivolous young woman; it is\ndangerous for you to put yourself so completely in my power. You will\nend by actually becoming a plaything to me. Who will give warrant\nthat I shall not abuse your insane desire?\"\n\n\"Your own nobility of character.\"\n\n\"Power makes people over-bearing.\"\n\n\"Be it,\" I cried, \"tread me underfoot.\"\n\nWanda threw her arms around my neck, looked into my eyes, and shook\nher head.\n\n\"I am afraid I can't, but I will try, for your sake, for I love you\nSeverin, as I have loved no other man.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day she suddenly took her hat and shawl, and I had to go shopping\nwith her. She looked at whips, long whips with a short handle, the\nkind that are used on dogs.\n\n\"Are these satisfactory?\" said the shopkeeper.\n\n\"No, they are much too small,\" replied Wanda, with a side-glance at\nme. \"I need a large--\"\n\n\"For a bull-dog, I suppose?\" opined the merchant.\n\n\"Yes,\" she exclaimed, \"of the kind that are used in Russia for\nintractable slaves.\"\n\nShe looked further and finally selected a whip, at whose sight I\nfelt a strange creeping sensation.\n\n\"Now good-by, Severin,\" she said. \"I have some other purchases to\nmake, but you can't go along.\"\n\nI left her and took a walk. On the way back I saw Wanda coming out\nat a furrier's. She beckoned me.\n\n\"Consider it well,\" she began in good spirits, \"I have never made a\nsecret of how deeply your serious, dreamy character has fascinated\nme. The idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power, actually\nlying enraptured at my feet, of course, stimulates me--but will this\nattraction last? Woman loves a man; she maltreats a slave, and ends\nby kicking him aside.\"\n\n\"Very well then, kick me aside,\" I replied, \"when you are tired of\nme. I want to be your slave.\"\n\n\"Dangerous forces lie within me,\" said Wanda, after we had gone a\nfew steps further. \"You awaken them, and not to your advantage. You\nknow how to paint pleasure, cruelty, arrogance in glowing colors.\nWhat would you say should I try my hand at them, and make you the\nfirst object of my experiments. I would be like Dionysius who had the\ninventor of the iron ox roasted within it in order to see whether his\nwails and groans really resembled the bellowing of an ox.\n\n\"Perhaps I am a female Dionysius?\"\n\n\"Be it,\" I exclaimed, \"and my dreams will be fulfilled. I am yours\nfor good or evil, choose. The destiny that lies concealed within my\nbreast drives me on--demoniacally--relentlessly.\"\n\n\"My Beloved,\n\nI do not care to see you to-day or to-morrow, and not until evening\nthe day after tomorrow, and then _as my slave_.\n\nYour mistress\n\nWanda.\"\n\n\"As my slave\" was underlined. I read the note which I received early\nin the morning a second time. Then I had a donkey saddled, an animal\nsymbolic of learned professors, and rode into the mountains. I wanted\nto numb my desire, my yearning, with the magnificent scenery of the\nCarpathians. I am back, tired, hungry, thirsty, and more in love than\never. I quickly change my clothes, and a few moments later knock at\nher door.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nI enter. She is standing in the center of the room, dressed in a gown\nof white satin which floods down her body like light. Over it she\nwears a scarlet _kazabaika_, richly edged with ermine. Upon her\npowdered, snowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds. She stands with\nher arms folded across her breast, and with her brows contracted.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I run toward her, and am about to throw my arm about her to\nkiss her. She retreats a step, measuring me from top to bottom.\n\n\"Slave!\"\n\n\"Mistress!\" I kneel down, and kiss the hem of her garment.\n\n\"That is as it should be.\"\n\n\"Oh, how beautiful you are.\"\n\n\"Do I please you?\" She stepped before the mirror, and looked at\nherself with proud satisfaction.\n\n\"I shall become mad!\"\n\nHer lower lip twitched derisively, and she looked at me mockingly\nfrom behind half-closed lids.\n\n\"Give me the whip.\"\n\nI looked about the room.\n\n\"No,\" she exclaimed, \"stay as you are, kneeling.\" She went over to\nthe fire-place, took the whip from the mantle-piece, and, watching\nme with a smile, let it hiss through the air; then she slowly rolled\nup the sleeve of her fur-jacket.\n\n\"Marvellous woman!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Silence, slave!\" She suddenly scowled, looked savage, and struck me\nwith the whip. A moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me, and\npityingly bent down to me. \"Did I hurt you?\" she asked, half-shyly,\nhalf-timidly.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"and even if you had, pains that come through you\nare a joy. Strike again, if it gives you pleasure.\"\n\n\"But it doesn't give me pleasure.\"\n\nAgain I was seized with that strange intoxication.\n\n\"Whip me,\" I begged, \"whip me without mercy.\"\n\nWanda swung the whip, and hit me twice. \"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Seriously, no?\"\n\n\"Whip me, I beg you, it is a joy to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, because you know very well that it isn't serious,\" she\nreplied, \"because I haven't the heart to hurt you. This brutal game\ngoes against my grain. Were I really the woman who beats her slaves\nyou would be horrified.\"\n\n\"No, Wanda,\" I replied, \"I love you more than myself; I am devoted\nto you for death and life. In all seriousness, you can do with me\nwhatever you will, whatever your caprice suggests.\"\n\n\"Severin!\"\n\n\"Tread me underfoot!\" I exclaimed, and flung myself face to the\nfloor before her.\n\n\"I hate all this play-acting,\" said Wanda impatiently.\n\n\"Well, then maltreat me seriously.\"\n\nAn uncanny pause.\n\n\"Severin, I warn you for the last time,\" began Wanda.\n\n\"If you love me, be cruel towards me,\" I pleaded with upraised eyes.\n\n\"If I love you,\" repeated Wanda. \"Very well!\" She stepped back and\nlooked at me with a sombre smile. _\"Be then my slave, and know what\nit means to be delivered into the hands of a woman.\"_ And at the\nsame moment she gave me a kick.\n\n\"How do you like that, slave?\"\n\nThen she flourished the whip.\n\n\"Get up!\"\n\nI was about to rise.\n\n\"Not that way,\" she commanded, \"on your knees.\"\n\nI obeyed, and she began to apply the lash.\n\nThe blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms. Each one\ncut into my flesh and burned there, but the pains enraptured me. They\ncame from her whom I adored, and for whom I was ready at any hour to\nlay down my life.\n\nShe stopped. \"I am beginning to enjoy it,\" she said, \"but enough for\nto-day. I am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to see how far\nyour strength goes. I take a cruel joy in seeing you tremble and\nwrithe beneath my whip, and in hearing your groans and wails; I want\nto go on whipping without pity until you beg for mercy, until you\nlose your senses. You have awakened dangerous elements in my being.\nBut now get up.\"\n\nI seized her hand to press it to my lips.\n\n\"What impudence.\"\n\nShe shoved me away with her foot.\n\n\"Out of my sight, slave!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams, I\nawoke. Dawn was just beginning to break.\n\nHow much of what was hovering in my memory was true; what had I\nactually experienced and what had I dreamed? That I had been whipped\nwas certain. I can still feel each blow, and count the burning red\nstripes on my body. And _she_ whipped me. Now I know everything.\n\nMy dream has become truth. How does it make me feel? Am I\ndisappointed in the realization of my dream?\n\nNo, I am merely somewhat tired, but her cruelty has enraptured me.\nOh, how I love her, adore her! All this cannot express in the\nremotest way my feeling for her, my complete devotion to her. What\nhappiness to be her slave!\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe calls to me from her balcony. I hurry upstairs. She is standing\non the threshold, holding out her hand in friendly fashion. \"I am\nashamed of myself,\" she says, while I embrace her, and she hides her\nhead against my breast.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Please try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday,\" she said with\nquivering voice, \"I have fulfilled your mad wish, now let us be\nreasonable and happy and love each other, and in a year I will be\nyour wife.\"\n\n\"My mistress,\" I exclaimed, \"and I your slave!\"\n\n\"Not another word of slavery, cruelty, or the whip,\" interrupted\nWanda. \"I shall not grant you any of those favors, none except\nwearing my fur-jacket; come and help me into it.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little bronze clock on which stood a cupid who had just shot his\nbolt struck midnight.\n\nI rose, and wanted to leave.\n\nWanda said nothing, but embraced me and drew me back on the ottoman.\nShe began to kiss me anew, and this silent language was so\ncomprehensible, so convincing--\n\nAnd it told me more than I dared to understand.\n\nA languid abandonment pervaded Wanda's entire being. What a\nvoluptuous softness there was in the gloaming of her half-closed\neyes, in the red flood of her hair which shimmered faintly under the\nwhite powder, in the red and white satin which crackled about her\nwith every movement, in the swelling ermine of the _kazabaika_\nin which she carelessly nestled.\n\n\"Please,\" I stammered, \"but you will be angry with me.\"\n\n\"Do with me what you will,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Well, then whip me, or I shall go mad.\"\n\n\"Haven't I forbidden you,\" said Wanda sternly, \"but you are\nincorrigible.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so terribly in love.\" I had sunken on my knees, and was\nburying my glowing face in her lap.\n\n\"I really believe,\" said Wanda thoughtfully, \"that your madness is\nnothing but a demonic, unsatisfied sensuality. _Our unnatural way\nof life must generate such illnesses._ Were you less virtuous, you\nwould be completely sane.\"\n\n\"Well then, make me sane,\" I murmured. My hands were running through\nher hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur, which rose\nand fell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom, and drove all\nmy senses into confusion.\n\nAnd I kissed her. No, she kissed me savagely, pitilessly, as if she\nwanted to slay me with her kisses. I was as in a delirium, and had\nlong since lost my reason, but now I, too, was breathless. I sought\nto free myself.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Wanda.\n\n\"I am suffering agonies.\"\n\n\"You are suffering--\" she broke out into a loud amused laughter.\n\n\"You laugh!\" I moaned, \"have you no idea--\"\n\nShe was serious all of a sudden. She raised my head in her hands,\nand with a violent gesture drew me to her breast.\n\n\"Wanda,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Of course, you enjoy suffering,\" she said, and laughed again, \"but\nwait, I'll bring you to your senses.\"\n\n\"No, I will no longer ask,\" I exclaimed, \"whether you want to belong\nto me for always or for only a brief moment of intoxication. I want\nto drain my happiness to the full. You are mine now, and I would\nrather lose you than never to have had you.\"\n\n\"Now you are sensible,\" she said. She kissed me again with her\nmurderous lips. I tore the ermine apart and the covering of lace and\nher naked breast surged against mine.\n\nThen my senses left me--\n\nThe first thing I remember is the moment when I saw blood dripping\nfrom my hand, and she asked apathetically: \"Did you scratch me?\"\n\n\"No, I believe, I have bitten you.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is strange how every relation in life assumes a different face as\nsoon as a new person enters.\n\nWe spent marvellous days together; we visited the mountains and\nlakes, we read together, and I completed Wanda's portrait. And how\nwe loved one another, how beautiful her smiling face was!\n\nThen a friend of hers arrived, a divorced woman somewhat older, more\nexperienced, and less scrupulous than Wanda. Her influence is already\nmaking itself felt in every direction.\n\nWanda wrinkles her brows, and displays a certain impatience with me.\n\nHas she ceased loving me?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor almost a fortnight this unbearable restraint has lain upon us.\nHer friend lives with her, and we are never alone. A circle of men\nsurrounds the young women. With my seriousness and melancholy I am\nplaying an absurd role as lover. Wanda treats me like a stranger.\n\nTo-day, while out walking, she staid behind with me. I saw that this\nwas done intentionally, and I rejoiced. But what did she tell me?\n\n\"My friend doesn't understand how I can love you. She doesn't think\nyou either handsome or particularly attractive otherwise. She is\ntelling me from morning till night about the glamour of the frivolous\nlife in the capital, hinting at the advantages to which I could lay\nclaim, the large parties which I would find there, and the\ndistinguished and handsome admirers which I would attract. But of\nwhat use is all this, since it happens that I love you.\"\n\nFor a moment I lost my breath, then I said: \"I have no wish to stand\nin the way of your happiness, Wanda. Do not consider me.\" Then I\nraised my hat, and let her go ahead. She looked at me surprised, but\ndid not answer a syllable.\n\nWhen by chance I happened to be close to her on the way back, she\nsecretly pressed my hand. Her glance was so radiant, so full of\npromised happiness, that in a moment all the torments of these days\nwere forgotten and all their wounds healed.\n\nI now am aware again of how much I love her.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"My friend has complained about you,\" said Wanda to-day.\n\n\"Perhaps she feels that I despise her.\"\n\n\"But why do you despise her, you foolish young man?\" exclaimed\nWanda, pulling my ears with both hands.\n\n\"Because she is a hypocrite,\" I said. \"I respect only a woman who is\nactually virtuous, or who openly lives for pleasure's sake.\"\n\n\"Like me, for instance,\" replied Wanda jestingly, \"but you see,\nchild, a woman can only do that in the rarest cases. She can neither\nbe as gaily sensual, nor as spiritually free as man; her state is\nalways a mixture of the sensual and spiritual. Her heart desires to\nenchain man permanently, while she herself is ever subject to the\ndesire for change. The result is a conflict, and thus usually against\nher wishes lies and deception enter into her actions and personality\nand corrupt her character.\"\n\n\"Certainly that is true,\" I said. \"The transcendental character with\nwhich woman wants to stamp love leads her to deception.\"\n\n\"But the world likewise demands it,\" Wanda interrupted. \"Look at\nthis woman. She has a husband and a lover in Lemberg and has found\na new admirer here. She deceives all three and yet is honored by all\nand respected by the world.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" I exclaimed, \"but she is to leave you alone; she\ntreats you like an article of commerce.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the beautiful woman interrupted vivaciously. \"Every woman\nhas the instinct or desire to draw advantage out of her attractions,\nand much is to be said for giving one's self without love or pleasure\nbecause if you do it in cold blood, you can reap profit to best\nadvantage.\"\n\n\"Wanda, what are you saying?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" she said, \"and take note of what I am about to say to you.\n_Never feel secure with the woman you love,_ for there are more\ndangers in woman's nature than you imagine. Women are neither as\n_good_ as their admirers and defenders maintain, nor as _bad_ as their\nenemies make them out to be. _Woman's character is characterlessness._\nThe best woman will momentarily go down into the mire, and the worst\nunexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts to\nshame those that despise her. No woman is so good or so bad, but that\nat any moment she is capable of the most diabolical as well as of the\nmost divine, of the filthiest as well as of the purest, thoughts,\nemotions, and actions. In spite of all the advances of civilization,\nwoman has remained as she came out of the hand of nature. She has the\nnature of a savage, who is faithful or faithless, magnanimous or\ncruel, according to the impulse that dominates at the moment.\nThroughout history it has always been a serious deep culture which has\nproduced moral character. Man even when he is selfish or evil always\nfollows _principles,_ woman never follows anything but _impulses._\nDon't ever forget that, and never feel secure with the woman you\nlove.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nHer friend has left. At last an evening alone with her again. It\nseems as if Wanda had saved up all the love, which had been kept from\nher, for this superlative evening; never had she been so kind, so\nnear, so full of tenderness.\n\nWhat happiness to cling to her lips, and to die away in her arms! In\na state of relaxation and wholly mine, her head rests against my\nbreast, and with drunken rapture our eyes seek each other.\n\nI cannot yet believe, comprehend, that this woman is mine, wholly\nmine.\n\n\"She is right on one point,\" Wanda began, without moving, without\nopening her eyes, as if she were asleep.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nShe remained silent.\n\n\"Your friend?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, she is right, you are not a man, you are a\ndreamer, a charming cavalier, and you certainly would be a priceless\nslave, but I cannot imagine you as husband.\"\n\nI was frightened.\n\n\"What is the matter? You are trembling?\"\n\n\"I tremble at the thought of how easily I might lose you,\" I replied.\n\n\"Are you made less happy now, because of this?\" she replied. \"Does\nit rob you of any of your joys, that I have belonged to another\nbefore I did to you, that others after you will possess me, and would\nyou enjoy less if another were made happy simultaneously with you?\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"that would be a way out. You won't ever\nlose me then. I care deeply for you and intellectually we are\nharmonious, and I should like to live with you always, if in addition\nto you I might have--\"\n\n\"What an idea,\" I cried. \"You fill me with a sort of horror.\"\n\n\"Do you love me any the less?\"\n\n\"On the contrary.\"\n\nWanda had raised herself on her left arm. \"I believe,\" she said,\n\"that to hold a man permanently, it is vitally important not to be\nfaithful to him. What honest woman has ever been as devotedly loved\nas a hetaira?\"\n\n\"There is a painful stimulus in the unfaithfulness of a beloved\nwoman. It is the highest kind of ecstacy.\"\n\n\"For you, too?\" Wanda asked quickly.\n\n\"For me, too.\"\n\n\"And if I should give you that pleasure,\" Wanda exclaimed mockingly.\n\n\"I shall suffer terrible agonies, but I shall adore you the more,\"\nI replied. \"But you would never deceive me, you would have the daemonic\ngreatness of saying to me: I shall love no one but you, but I shall\nmake happy whoever pleases me.\"\n\nWanda shook her head. \"I don't like deception, I am honest, but what\nman exists who can support the burden of truth. Were I say to you:\nthis serene, sensual life, this paganism is my ideal, would you be\nstrong enough to bear it?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I could endure anything so as not to lose you. I feel\nhow little I really mean to you.\"\n\n\"But Severin--\"\n\n\"But it is so,\" said I, \"and just for that reason--\"\n\n\"For that reason you would--\" she smiled roguishly--\"have I guessed\nit?\"\n\n\"Be your slave!\" I exclaimed. \"Be your unrestricted property,\nwithout a will of my own, of which you could dispose as you wished,\nand which would therefore never be a burden to you. While you drink\nlife at its fullness, while surrounded by luxury, you enjoy the\nserene happiness and Olympian love, I want to be your servant, put\non and take off your shoes.\"\n\n\"You really aren't so far from wrong,\" replied Wanda, \"for only as\nmy slave could you endure my loving others. Furthermore the freedom\nof enjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable without slavery. It\nmust give one a feeling of like unto a god to see a man kneel before\none and tremble. I want a slave, do you hear, Severin?\"\n\n\"Am I not your slave?\"\n\n\"Then listen to me,\" said Wanda excitedly, seizing my hand. \"I want\nto be yours, as long as I love you.\"\n\n\"A month?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, even two.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then you become my slave.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I? Why do you ask? I am a goddess and sometimes I descend from my\nOlympian heights to you, softly, very softly, and secretly.\n\n\"But what does all this mean,\" said Wanda, resting her head in both\nhands with her gaze lost in the distance, \"a golden fancy which never\ncan become true.\" An uncanny brooding melancholy seemed shed over her\nentire being; I have never seen her like that.\n\n\"Why unachievable?\" I began.\n\n\"Because slavery doesn't exist any longer.\"\n\n\"Then we will go to a country where it still exists, to the Orient,\nto Turkey,\" I said eagerly.\n\n\"You would--Severin--in all seriousness,\" Wanda replied. Her eyes\nburned.\n\n\"Yes, in all seriousness, I want to be your slave,\" I continued. \"I\nwant your power over me to be sanctified by law; I want my life to\nbe in your hands, I want nothing that could protect or save me from\nyou. Oh, what a voluptuous joy when once I feel myself entirely dependent\nupon your absolute will, your whim, at your beck and call. And then\nwhat happiness, when at some time you deign to be gracious, and the\nslave may kiss the lips which mean life and death to him.\" I knelt\ndown, and leaned my burning forehead against her knee.\n\n\"You are talking as in a fever,\" said Wanda agitatedly, \"and you\nreally love me so endlessly.\" She held me to her breast, and covered\nme with kisses.\n\n\"You really want it?\"\n\n\"I swear to you now by God and my honor, that I shall be your slave,\nwherever and whenever you wish it, as soon as you command,\" I\nexclaimed, hardly master of myself.\n\n\"And if I take you at your word?\" said Wanda.\n\n\"Please do!\"\n\n\"All this appeals to me,\" she said then. \"It is different from\nanything else--to know that a man who worships me, and whom I love\nwith all my heart, is so wholly mine, dependent on my will and\ncaprice, my possession and slave, while I--\"\n\nShe looked strangely at me.\n\n\"If I should become frightfully frivolous you are to blame,\" she\ncontinued. \"It almost seems as if you were afraid of me already, but\nyou have sworn.\"\n\n\"And I shall keep my oath.\"\n\n\"I shall see to that,\" she replied. \"I am beginning to enjoy it,\nand, heaven help me, we won't stick to fancies now. You shall become\nmy slave, and I--I shall try to be _Venus in Furs_.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI thought that at last I knew this woman, understood her, and now I\nsee I have to begin at the very beginning again. Only a little while\nago her reaction to my dreams was violently hostile, and now she\ntries to carry them into execution with the soberest seriousness.\n\nShe has drawn up a contract according to which I give my word of\nhonor and agree under oath to be her slave, as long as she wishes.\n\nWith her arm around my neck she reads this, unprecedented,\nincredible document to me. The end of each sentence she punctuates\nwith a kiss.\n\n\"But all the obligations in the contract are on my side,\" I said,\nteasing her.\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied with great seriousness, \"you cease to be my\nlover, and consequently I am released from all duties and obligations\ntowards you. You will have to look upon my favors as pure\nbenevolence. You no longer have any rights, and no longer can lay\nclaim to any. There can be no limit to my power over you. Remember,\nthat you won't be much better than a dog, or some inanimate object.\nYou will be mine, my plaything, which I can break to pieces, whenever\nI want an hour's amusement. You are nothing, I am everything. Do you\nunderstand?\" She laughed and kissed me again, and yet a sort of cold\nshiver ran through me.\n\n\"Won't you allow me a few conditions--\" I began.\n\n\"Conditions?\" She contracted her forehead. \"Ah! You are afraid\nalready, or perhaps you regret, but it is too late now. You have\nsworn, I have your word of honor. But let me hear them.\"\n\n\"First of all I should like to have it included in our contract,\nthat you will never completely leave me, and then that you will never\ngive me over to the mercies of any of your admirers--\"\n\n\"But Severin,\" exclaimed Wanda with her voice full of emotion and\nwith tears in her eyes, \"how can you imagine that I--and you, a man\nwho loves me so absolutely, who puts himself so entirely in my power--\"\nShe halted.\n\n\"No, no!\" I said, covering her hands with kisses. \"I don't fear\nanything from you that might dishonor me. Forgive me the ugly\nthought.\"\n\nWanda smiled happily, leaned her cheek against mine, and seemed to\nreflect.\n\n\"You have forgotten something,\" she whispered coquettishly, \"the\nmost important thing!\"\n\n\"A condition?\"\n\n\"Yes, that I must always wear my furs,\" exclaimed Wanda. \"But I\npromise you I'll do that anyhow because they give me a despotic\nfeeling. And I shall be very cruel to you, do you understand?\"\n\n\"Shall I sign the contract?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Wanda. \"I shall first add your conditions, and the\nactual signing won't occur until the proper time and place.\"\n\n\"In Constantinople?\"\n\n\"No. I have thought things over. What special value would there be\nin owning a slave where everyone owns slaves. What I want is to\n_have a slave, I alone,_ here in our civilized sober, Philistine\nworld, and a slave who submits helplessly to my power solely on\naccount of my beauty and personality, not because of law, of property\nrights, or compulsions. This attracts me. But at any rate we will go\nto a country where we are not known and where you can appear before\nthe world as my servant without embarrassment. Perhaps to Italy, to\nRome or Naples.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were sitting on Wanda's ottoman. She wore her ermine jacket, her\nhair was loose and fell like a lion's mane down her back. She clung\nto my lips, drawing my soul from my body. My head whirled, my blood\nbegan to seethe, my heart beat violently against hers.\n\n\"I want to be absolutely in your power, Wanda,\" I exclaimed\nsuddenly, seized by that frenzy of passion when I can scarcely think\nclearly or decide freely. \"I want to put myself absolutely at your\nmercy for good or evil without any condition, without any limit to\nyour power.\"\n\nWhile saying this I had slipped from the ottoman, and lay at her\nfeet looking up at her with drunken eyes.\n\n\"How beautiful you now are,\" she exclaimed, \"your eyes half-broken\nin ecstacy fill me with joy, carry me away. How wonderful your look\nwould be if you were being beaten to death, in the extreme agony. You\nhave the eye of a martyr.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nSometimes, nevertheless, I have an uneasy feeling about placing\nmyself so absolutely, so unconditionally into a woman's hands.\nSuppose she did abuse my passion, her power?\n\nWell, then I would experience what has occupied my imagination since\nmy childhood, what has always given me the feeling of seductive\nterror. A foolish apprehension! It will be a wanton game she will play\nwith me, nothing more. She loves me, and she is good, a noble\npersonality, incapable of a breach of faith. But it lies in her hands\n--_if she wants to she can._ What a temptation in this doubt, this\nfear!\n\nNow I understand Manon l'Escault and the poor chevalier, who, even\nin the pillory, while she was another man's mistress, still adored\nher.\n\nLove knows no virtue, no profit; it loves and forgives and suffers\neverything, because it must. It is not our judgment that leads us;\nit is neither the advantages nor the faults which we discover, that\nmake us abandon ourselves, or that repel us.\n\nIt is a sweet, soft, enigmatic power that drives us on. We cease to\nthink, to feel, to will; we let ourselves be carried away by it, and\nask not whither?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA Russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenade.\nHe aroused general interest on account of his athletic figure,\nmagnificent face, and splendid bearing. The women particularly gaped\nat him as though he were a wild animal, but he went his way gloomily\nwithout paying attention to any one. He was accompanied by two\nservants, one a negro, completely dressed in red satin, and the other\na Circassian in his full gleaming uniform. Suddenly he saw Wanda, and\nfixed his cold piercing look upon her; he even turned his head after\nher, and when she had passed, he stood still and followed her with\nhis eyes.\n\nAnd she--she veritably devoured him with her radiant green eyes--and\ndid everything possible to meet him again.\n\nThe cunning coquetry with which she walked, moved, and looked at\nhim, almost stifled me. On the way home I remarked about it. She knit\nher brows.\n\n\"What do you want,\" she said, \"the prince is a man whom I might\nlike, who even dazzles me, and I am free. I can do what I please--\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any longer--\" I stammered, frightened.\n\n\"I love only you,\" she replied, \"but I shall have the prince pay\ncourt to me.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Aren't you my slave?\" she said calmly. \"Am I not Venus, the cruel\nnorthern Venus in Furs?\"\n\nI was silent. I felt literally crushed by her words; her cold look\nentered my heart like a dagger.\n\n\"You will find out immediately the prince's name, residence, and\ncircumstances,\" she continued. \"Do you understand?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"No argument, obey!\" exclaimed Wanda, more sternly than I would have\nthought possible for her, \"and don't dare to enter my sight until you\ncan answer my questions.\"\n\nIt was not till afternoon that I could obtain the desired\ninformation for Wanda. She let me stand before her like a servant,\nwhile she leaned back in her arm-chair and listened to me, smiling.\nThen she nodded; she seemed to be satisfied.\n\n\"Bring me my footstool,\" she commanded shortly.\n\nI obeyed, and after having put it before her and having put her feet\non it, I remained kneeling.\n\n\"How will this end?\" I asked sadly after a short pause.\n\nShe broke into playful laughter. \"Why things haven't even begun yet.\"\n\n\"You are more heartless than I imagined,\" I replied, hurt.\n\n\"Severin,\" Wanda began earnestly. \"I haven't done anything yet, not\nthe slightest thing, and you are already calling me heartless. What\nwill happen when I begin to carry your dreams to their realization,\nwhen I shall lead a gay, free life and have a circle of admirers\nabout me, when I shall actually fulfil your ideal, tread you\nunderfoot and apply the lash?\"\n\n\"You take my dreams too seriously.\"\n\n\"Too seriously? I can't stop at make-believe, when once I begin,\"\nshe replied. \"You know I hate all play-acting and comedy. You have\nwished it. Was it my idea or yours? Did I persuade you or did you\ninflame my imagination? I am taking things seriously now.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I replied, caressingly, \"listen quietly to me. We love each\nother infinitely, we are very happy, will you sacrifice our entire\nfuture to a whim?\"\n\n\"It is no longer a whim,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked frightened.\n\n\"Something that was probably latent in me,\" she said quietly and\nthoughtfully. \"Perhaps it would never have come to light, if you had\nnot called it to life, and made it grow. Now that it has become a\npowerful impulse, fills my whole being, now that I enjoy it, now that\nI cannot and do not want to do otherwise, now you want to back out--\nyou--are you a man?\"\n\n\"Dear, sweet Wanda!\" I began to caress her, kiss her.\n\n\"Don't--you are not a man--\"\n\n\"And you,\" I flared up.\n\n\"I am stubborn,\" she said, \"you know that. I haven't a strong\nimagination, and like you I am weak in execution. But when I make up\nmy mind to do something, I carry it through, and the more certainly,\nthe more opposition I meet. Leave me alone!\"\n\nShe pushed me away, and got up.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I likewise rose, and stood facing her.\n\n\"Now you know what I am,\" she continued. \"Once more I warn you. You\nstill have the choice. I am not compelling you to be my slave.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I replied with emotion and tears filling my eyes, \"don't\nyou know how I love you?\"\n\nHer lips quivered contemptuously.\n\n\"You are mistaken, you make yourself out worse than you are; you are\ngood and noble by nature--\"\n\n\"What do you know about my nature,\" she interrupted vehemently, \"you\nwill get to know me as I am.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Decide, will you submit, unconditionally?\"\n\n\"And if I say no.\"\n\n\"Then--\"\n\nShe stepped close up to me, cold and contemptuous. As she stood\nbefore me now, the arms folded across her breast, with an evil smile\nabout her lips, she was in fact the despotic woman of my dreams. Her\nexpression seemed hard, and nothing lay in her eyes that promised\nkindness or mercy.\n\n\"Well--\" she said at last.\n\n\"You are angry,\" I cried, \"you will punish me.\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" she replied, \"I shall let you go. You are free. I am not\nholding you.\"\n\n\"Wanda--I, who love you so--\"\n\n\"Yes, you, my dear sir, you who adore me,\" she exclaimed\ncontemptuously, \"but who are a coward, a liar, and a breaker of\npromises. Leave me instantly--\"\n\n\"Wanda I--\"\n\n\"Wretch!\"\n\nMy blood rose in my heart. I threw myself down at her feet and began\nto cry.\n\n\"Tears, too!\" She began to laugh. Oh, this laughter was frightful.\n\"Leave me--I don't want to see you again.\"\n\n\"Oh my God!\" I cried, beside myself. \"I will do whatever you\ncommand, be your slave, a mere object with which you can do what you\nwill--only don't send me away--I can't bear it--I cannot live without\nyou.\" I embraced her knees, and covered her hand with kisses.\n\n\"Yes, you must be a slave, and feel the lash, for you are not a\nman,\" she said calmly. She said this to me with perfect composure,\nnot angrily, not even excitedly, and it was what hurt most. \"Now I\nknow you, your dog-like nature, that adores where it is kicked, and\nthe more, the more it is maltreated. Now I know you, and now you\nshall come to know me.\"\n\nShe walked up and down with long strides, while I remained crushed\non my knees; my head was hanging supine, tears flowed from my eyes.\n\n\"Come here,\" Wanda commanded harshly, sitting down on the ottoman.\nI obeyed her command, and sat down beside her. She looked at me\nsombrely, and then a light suddenly seemed to illuminate the interior\nof her eye. Smiling, she drew me toward her breast, and began to kiss\nthe tears out of my eyes.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe odd part of my situation is that I am like the bear in Lily's\npark. I can escape and don't want to; I am ready to endure everything\nas soon as she threatens to set me free.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIf only she would use the whip again. There is something uncanny in\nthe kindness with which she treats me. I seem like a little captive\nmouse with which a beautiful cat prettily plays. She is ready at any\nmoment to tear it to pieces, and my heart of a mouse threatens to\nburst.\n\nWhat are her intentions? What does she purpose to do with me?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seems she has completely forgotten the contract, my slavehood. Or\nwas it actually only stubbornness? And she gave up her whole plan as\nsoon as I no longer opposed her and submitted to her imperial whim?\n\nHow kind she is to me, how tender, how loving! We are spending\nmarvellously happy days.\n\nTo-day she had me read to her the scene between Faust and\nMephistopheles, in which the latter appears as a wandering scholar.\nHer glance hung on me with strange pleasure.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said when I had finished, \"how a man who\ncan read such great and beautiful thoughts with such expression, and\ninterpret them so clearly, concisely, and intelligently, can at the\nsame time be such a visionary and supersensual ninny as you are.\"\n\n\"Were you pleased,\" said I, and kissed her forehead.\n\nShe gently stroked my brow. \"I love you, Severin,\" she whispered. \"I\ndon't believe I could ever love any one more than you. Let us be\nsensible, what do you say?\"\n\nInstead of replying I folded her in my arms; a deep inward, yet\nvaguely sad happiness filled my breast, my eyes grew moist, and a\ntear fell upon her hand.\n\n\"How can you cry!\" she exclaimed, \"you are a child!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn a pleasure drive we met the Russian prince in his carriage. He\nseemed to be unpleasantly surprised to see me by Wanda's side, and\nlooked as if he wanted to pierce her through and through with his\nelectric gray eyes. She, however, did not seem to notice him. I felt\nat that moment like kneeling down before her and kissing her feet.\nShe let her glance glide over him indifferently as though he were an\ninanimate object, a tree, for instance, and turned to me with her\ngracious smile.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I said good-night to her to-day she seemed suddenly\nunaccountably distracted and moody. What was occupying her?\n\n\"I am sorry you are going,\" she said when I was already standing on\nthe threshold.\n\n\"It is entirely in your hands to shorten the hard period of my\ntrial, to cease tormenting me--\" I pleaded.\n\n\"Do you imagine that this compulsion isn't a torment for me, too,\"\nWanda interjected.\n\n\"Then end it,\" I exclaimed, embracing her, \"be my wife.\"\n\n\"_Never, Severin_,\" she said gently, but with great firmness.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nI was frightened in my innermost soul.\n\n\"_You are not the man for me._\"\n\nI looked at her, and slowly withdrew my arm which was still about\nher waist; then I left the room, and she--she did not call me back.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA sleepless night; I made countless decisions, only to toss them\naside again. In the morning I wrote her a letter in which I declared\nour relationship dissolved. My hand trembled when I put on the seal,\nand I burned my fingers.\n\nAs I went upstairs to hand it to the maid, my knees threatened to\ngive way.\n\nThe door opened, and Wanda thrust forth her head full of curling-papers.\n\n\"I haven't had my hair dressed yet,\" she said, smiling. \"What have\nyou there?\"\n\n\"A letter--\"\n\n\"For me?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Ah, you want to break with me,\" she exclaimed, mockingly.\n\n\"Didn't you tell me yesterday that I wasn't the man for you?\"\n\n_\"I repeat it now!\"_\n\n\"Very well, then.\" My whole body was trembling, my voice failed me,\nand I handed her the letter.\n\n\"Keep it,\" she said, measuring me coldly. \"You forget that is no\nlonger a question as to whether you satisfy me as a man; as a _slave_\nyou will doubtless do well enough.\"\n\n\"Madame!\" I exclaimed, aghast.\n\n\"That is what you will call me in the future,\" replied Wanda,\nthrowing back her head with a movement of unutterable contempt. \"Put\nyour affairs in order within the next twenty-four hours. The day\nafter to-morrow I shall start for Italy, and you will accompany me\nas my servant.\"\n\n\"Wanda--\"\n\n\"I forbid any sort of familiarity,\" she said, cutting my words short,\n\"likewise you are not to come in unless I call or ring for you, and\nyou are not to speak to me until you are spoken to. From now on your\nname is no longer Severin, but _Gregor_.\"\n\nI trembled with rage, and yet, unfortunately, I cannot deny it, I\nalso felt a strange pleasure and stimulation.\n\n\"But, madame, you know my circumstances,\" I began in my confusion.\n\"I am dependent on my father, and I doubt whether he will give me the\nlarge sum of money needed for this journey--\"\n\n\"That means you have no money, Gregor,\" said Wanda, delightedly, \"so\nmuch the better, you are then entirely dependent on me, and in fact\nmy slave.\"\n\n\"You don't consider,\" I tried to object, \"that as man of honor it is\nimpossible for me--\"\n\n\"I have indeed considered it,\" she replied almost with a tone of\ncommand. \"As a man of honor you must keep your oath and redeem your\npromise to follow me as slave whithersoever I demand and to obey\nwhatever I command. Now leave me, Gregor!\"\n\nI turned toward the door.\n\n\"Not yet--you may first kiss my hand.\" She held it out to me with a\ncertain proud indifference, and I the dilettante, the donkey, the\nmiserable slave pressed it with intense tenderness against my lips\nwhich were dry and hot with excitement.\n\nThere was another gracious nod of the head.\n\nThen I was dismissed.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThough it was late in the evening my light was still lit, and a fire\nwas burning in the large green stove. There were still many things\namong my letters and documents to be put in order. Autumn, as is\nusually the case with us, had fallen with all its power.\n\nSuddenly she knocked at my window with the handle of her whip.\n\nI opened and saw her standing outside in her ermine-lined jacket and\nin a high round Cossack cap of ermine of the kind which the great\nCatherine favored.\n\n\"Are you ready, Gregor?\" she asked darkly.\n\n\"Not yet, mistress,\" I replied.\n\n\"I like that word,\" she said then, \"you are always to call me\nmistress, do you understand? We leave here to-morrow morning at nine\no'clock. As far as the district capital you will be my companion and\nfriend, but from the moment that we enter the railway-coach you are\nmy slave, my servant. Now close the window, and open the door.\"\n\nAfter I had done as she had demanded, and after she had entered, she\nasked, contracting her brows ironically, \"well, how do you like me.\"\n\n\"Wanda, you--\"\n\n\"Who gave you permission?\" She gave me a blow with the whip.\n\n\"You are very beautiful, mistress.\"\n\nWanda smiled and sat down in the arm-chair. \"Kneel down--here beside\nmy chair.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"Kiss my hand.\"\n\nI seized her small cold hand and kissed it.\n\n\"And the mouth--\"\n\nIn a surge of passion I threw my arms around the beautiful cruel\nwoman, and covered her face, arms, and breast with glowing kisses.\nShe returned them with equal fervor--the eyelids closed as in a\ndream. It was after midnight when she left.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAt nine o'clock sharp in the morning everything was ready for departure,\nas she had ordered. We left the little Carpathian health-resort in a\ncomfortable light carriage. The most interesting drama of my life had\nreached a point of development whose denouement it was then impossible\nto foretell.\n\nSo far everything went well. I sat beside Wanda, and she chatted\nvery graciously and intelligently with me, as with a good friend,\nconcerning Italy, Pisemski's new novel, and Wagner's music. She wore\na sort of Amazonesque travelling-dress of black cloth with a short\njacket of the same material, set with dark fur. It fitted closely and\nshowed her figure to best advantage. Over it she wore dark furs. Her\nhair wound into an antique knot, lay beneath a small dark fur-hat\nfrom which a black veil hung. Wanda was in very good humor; she fed\nme candies, played with my hair, loosened my neck cloth and made a\npretty cockade of it; she covered my knees with her furs and\nstealthily pressed the fingers of my hand. When our Jewish driver\npersistently went on nodding to himself, she even gave me a kiss, and\nher cold lips had the fresh frosty fragrance of a young autumnal\nrose, which blossoms alone amid bare stalks and yellow leaves and\nupon whose calyx the first frost has hung tiny diamonds of ice.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWe are at the district capital. We get out at the railway station.\nWanda throws off her furs and places them over my arm, and goes\nto secure the tickets.\n\nWhen she returns she has completely changed.\n\n\"Here is your ticket, Gregor,\" she says in a tone which supercilious\nladies use to their servants.\n\n\"A third-class ticket,\" I reply with comic horror.\n\n\"Of course,\" she continues, \"but now be careful. You won't get on\nuntil I am settled in my compartment and don't need you any longer.\nAt each station you will hurry to my car and ask for my orders. Don't\nforget. And now give me my furs.\"\n\nAfter I had helped her into them, humbly like a slave, she went to\nfind an empty first-class coupe. I followed. Supporting herself on\nmy shoulder, she got on and I wrapped her feet in bear-skins and placed\nthem on the warming bottle.\n\nThen she nodded to me, and dismissed me. I slowly ascended a third-class\ncarriage, which was filled with abominable tobacco-smoke that seemed\nlike the fogs of Acheron at the entrance to Hades. I now had the leisure\nto muse about the riddle of human existence, and about its greatest\nriddle of all--_woman_.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhenever the train stops, I jump off, run to her carriage, and with\ndrawn cap await her orders. She wants coffee and then a glass of\nwater, at another time a bowl of warm water to wash her hands, and\nthus it goes on. She lets several men who have entered her\ncompartment pay court to her. I am dying of jealousy and have to leap\nabout like an antelope so as to secure what she wants quickly and\nnot miss the train.\n\nIn this way the night passes. I haven't had time to eat a mouthful\nand I can't sleep, I have to breathe the same oniony air with Polish\npeasants, Jewish peddlers, and common soldiers.\n\nWhen I mount the steps of her coupe, she is lying stretched out\non cushions in her comfortable furs, covered up with the skins of\nanimals. She is like an oriental despot, and the men sit like Indian\ndeities, straight upright against the walls and scarcely dare to\nbreathe.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stops over in Vienna for a day to go shopping, and particularly\nto buy series of luxurious gowns. She continues to treat me as her\nservant. I follow her at the respectful distance of ten paces. She\nhands me her packages without so much as even deigning a kind look,\nand laden down like a donkey I pant along behind.\n\nBefore leaving she takes all my clothes and gives them to the hotel\nwaiters. I am ordered to put on her livery. It is a Cracovian costume\nin her colors, light-blue with red facings, and red quadrangular cap,\nornamented with peacock-feathers. The costume is rather becoming to\nme.\n\nThe silver buttons bear her coat of arms. I have the feeling of having\nbeen sold or of having bonded myself to the devil. My fair demon leads\nme from Vienna to Florence. Instead of linen-garbed Mazovians and\ngreasy-haired Jews, my companions now are curly-haired Contadini, a\nmagnificent sergeant of the first Italian Grenadiers, and a poor German\npainter. The tobacco smoke no longer smells of onions, but of salami and\ncheese.\n\nNight has fallen again. I lie on my wooden bed as on a rack; my arms and\nlegs seem broken. But there nevertheless is an element of poetry in the\naffair. The stars sparkle round about, the Italian sergeant has a face\nlike Apollo Belvedere, and the German painter sings a lovely German\nsong.\n\n\"Now that all the shadows gather\nAnd endless stars grow light,\nDeep yearning on me falls\nAnd softly fills the night.\"\n\n\"Through the sea of dreams\nSailing without cease,\nSailing goes my soul\nIn thine to find release.\"\n\nAnd I am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regal\ncomfort among her soft furs.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFlorence! Crowds, cries, importunate porters and cab-drivers. Wanda\nchooses a carriage, and dismisses the porters.\n\n\"What have I a servant for,\" she says, \"Gregor--here is the ticket--\nget the luggage.\"\n\nShe wraps herself in her furs and sits quietly in the carriage while I\ndrag the heavy trunks hither, one after another. I break down for a\nmoment under the last one; a good-natured _carabiniere_ with an\nintelligent face comes to my assistance. She laughs.\n\n\"It must be heavy,\" said she, \"all my furs are in it.\"\n\nI get up on the driver's seat, wiping drops of perspiration from my\nbrow. She gives the name of the hotel, and the driver urges on his\nhorse. In a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated\nentrance.\n\n\"Have you any rooms?\" she asks the portier.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"Two for me, one for my servant, all with stoves.\"\n\n\"Two first-class rooms for you, madame, both with stoves,\" replied\nthe waiter who had hastily come up, \"and one without heat for your\nservant.\"\n\nShe looked at them, and then abruptly said: \"they are satisfactory,\nhave fires built at once; my servant can sleep in the unheated room.\"\n\nI merely looked at her.\n\n\"Bring up the trunks, Gregor,\" she commands, paying no attention to\nmy looks. \"In the meantime I'll be dressing, and then will go down\nto the dining-room, and you can eat something for supper.\"\n\nAs she goes into the adjoining room, I drag the trunks upstairs and\nhelp the waiter build a fire in her bed-room. He tries to question\nme in bad French about my employer. With a brief glance I see the\nblazing fire, the fragrant white poster-bed, and the rugs which cover\nthe floor. Tired and hungry I then descend the stairs, and ask for\nsomething to eat. A good-natured waiter, who used to be in the\nAustrian army and takes all sorts of pains to entertain me in German,\nshows me the dining-room and waits on me. I have just had the first\nfresh drink in thirty-six hours and the first bite of warm food on\nmy fork, when she enters.\n\nI rise.\n\n\"What do you mean by taking me into a dining-room in which my\nservant is eating,\" she snaps at the waiter, flaring with anger. She\nturns around and leaves.\n\nMeanwhile I thank heaven that I am permitted to go on eating. Later\nI climb the four flights upstairs to my room. My small trunk is\nalready there, and a miserable little oil-lamp is burning. It is a\nnarrow room without fire-place, without a window, but with a small\nair-hole. If it weren't so beastly cold, it would remind me of one\nof the Venetian _piombi_. [Footnote: These were notorious prisons\nunder the leaden roof of the Palace of the Doges.] Involuntarily I\nhave to laugh out aloud, so that it re-echoes, and I am startled by\nmy own laughter.\n\nSuddenly the door is pulled open and the waiter with a theatrical\nItalian gesture calls \"You are to come down to madame, at once.\" I\npick up my cap, stumble down the first few steps, but finally arrive\nin front of her door on the first floor and knock.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nI enter, shut the door, and stand attention.\n\nWanda has made herself comfortable. She is sitting in a neglige of\nwhite muslin and laces on a small red divan with her feet on a\nfootstool that matches. She has thrown her fur-cloak about her. It\nis the identical cloak in which she appeared to me for the first time,\nas goddess of love.\n\nThe yellow lights of the candelabra which stand on projections,\ntheir reflections in the large mirrors, and the red flames from the\nopen fireplace play beautifully on the green velvet, the dark-brown\nsable of the cloak, the smooth white skin, and the red, flaming hair\nof the beautiful woman. Her clear, but cold face is turned toward me,\nand her cold green eyes rest upon me.\n\n\"I am satisfied with you, Gregor,\" she began.\n\nI bowed.\n\n\"Come closer.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"Still closer,\" she looked down, and stroked the sable with her\nhand. \"Venus in Furs receives her slave. I can see that you are more\nthan an ordinary dreamer, you don't remain far in arrears of your\ndreams; you are the sort of man who is ready to carry his dreams into\neffect, no matter how mad they are. I confess, I like this; it\nimpresses me. There is strength in this, and strength is the only\nthing one respects. I actually believe that under unusual\ncircumstances, in a period of great deeds, what seems to be your\nweakness would reveal itself as extraordinary power. Under the early\nemperors you would have been a martyr, at the time of the Reformation\nan anabaptist, during the French Revolution one of those inspired\nGirondists who mounted the guillotine with the marseillaise on their\nlips. But you are my slave, my--\"\n\nShe suddenly leaped up; the furs slipped down, and she threw her\narms with soft pressure about my neck.\n\n\"My beloved slave, Severin, oh, how I love you, how I adore you, how\nhandsome you are in your Cracovian costume! You will be cold to-night\nup in your wretched room without a fire. Shall I give you one of my\nfurs, dear heart, the large one there--\"\n\nShe quickly picked it up, throwing it over my shoulders, and before\nI knew what had happened I was completely wrapped up in it.\n\n\"How wonderfully becoming furs are to your face, they bring out your\nnoble lines. As soon as you cease being my slave, you must wear a\nvelvet coat with sable, do you understand? Otherwise I shall never\nput on my fur-jacket again.\"\n\nAnd again she began to caress me and kiss me; finally she drew me\ndown on the little divan.\n\n\"You seem to be pleased with yourself in furs,\" she said. \"Quick,\nquick, give them to me, or I will lose all sense of dignity.\"\n\nI placed the furs about her, and Wanda slipped her right arm into\nthe sleeve.\n\n\"This is the pose in Titian's picture. But now enough of joking.\nDon't always look so solemn, it makes me feel sad. As far as the\nworld is concerned you are still merely my servant; you are not yet\nmy slave, for you have not yet signed the contract. You are still\nfree, and can leave me any moment. You have played your part\nmagnificently. I have been delighted, but aren't you tired of it\nalready, and don't you think I am abominable? Well, say something--I\ncommand it.\"\n\n\"Must I confess to you, Wanda?\" I began.\n\n\"Yes, you must.\"\n\n\"Even it you take advantage of it,\" I continued, \"I shall love you\nthe more deeply, adore you the more fanatically, the worse you treat\nme. What you have just done inflames my blood and intoxicates all my\nsenses.\" I held her close to me and clung for several moments to her\nmoist lips.\n\n\"Oh, you beautiful woman,\" I then exclaimed, looking at her. In my\nenthusiasm I tore the sable from her shoulders and pressed my mouth\nagainst her neck.\n\n\"You love me even when I am cruel,\" said Wanda, \"now go!--you bore\nme--don't you hear?\"\n\nShe boxed my ears so that I saw stars and bells rang in my ears.\n\n\"Help me into my furs, slave.\"\n\nI helped her, as well as I could.\n\n\"How awkward,\" she exclaimed, and was scarcely in it before she\nstruck me in the face again. I felt myself growing pale.\n\n\"Did I hurt you?\" she asked, softly touching me with her hand.\n\n\"No, no,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"At any rate you have no reason to complain, you want it thus; now\nkiss me again.\"\n\nI threw my arms about her, and her lips clung closely to mine. As\nshe lay against my breast in her large heavy furs, I had a curiously\noppressive sensation. It was as if a wild beast, a she-bear, were\nembracing me. It seemed as if I were about to feel her claws in my\nflesh. But this time the she-bear let me off easily.\n\nWith my heart filled with smiling hopes, I went up to my miserable\nservant's room, and threw myself down on my hard couch.\n\n\"Life is really amazingly droll,\" I thought. \"A short time ago the\nmost beautiful woman, Venus herself, rested against your breast, and\nnow you have an opportunity for studying the Chinese hell. Unlike us,\nthey don't hurl the damned into flames, but they have devils chasing\nthem out into fields of ice.\n\n\"Very likely the founders of their religion also slept in unheated\nrooms.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the night I startled out of my sleep with a scream. I had\nbeen dreaming of an icefield in which I had lost my way; I had been\nlooking in vain for a way out. Suddenly an eskimo drove up in a\nsleigh harnessed with reindeer; he had the face of the waiter who had\nshown me to the unheated room.\n\n\"What are you looking for here, my dear sir?\" he exclaimed. \"This is\nthe North Pole.\"\n\nA moment later he had disappeared, and Wanda flew over the smooth\nice on tiny skates. Her white satin skirt fluttered and crackled; the\nermine of her jacket and cap, but especially her face, gleamed whiter\nthan the snow. She shot toward me, inclosed me in her arms, and began\nto kiss me. Suddenly I felt my blood running warm down my side.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked horror-stricken.\n\nShe laughed, and as I looked at her now, it was no longer Wanda, but\na huge, white she-bear, who was digging her paws into my body.\n\nI cried out in despair, and still heard her diabolical laughter when\nI awoke, and looked about the room in surprise.\n\nEarly in the morning I stood at Wanda's door, and the waiter brought\nthe coffee. I took it from him, and served it to my beautiful\nmistress. She had already dressed, and looked magnificent, all fresh\nand roseate. She smiled graciously at me and called me back, when I\nwas about to withdraw respectfully.\n\n\"Come, Gregor, have your breakfast quickly too,\" she said, \"then we\nwill go house-hunting. I don't want to stay in the hotel any longer\nthan I have to. It is very embarassing here. If I chat with you for\nmore than a minute, people will immediately say: 'The fair Russian\nis having an affair with her servant, you see, the race of Catherines\nisn't extinct yet.'\"\n\nHalf an hour later we went out; Wanda was in her cloth-gown with the\nRussian cap, and I in my Cracovian costume. We created quite a stir. I\nwalked about ten paces behind, looking very solemn, but expected\nmomentarily to have to break out into loud laughter. There was scarcely\na street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not bear\nthe sign _camere ammobiliate_. Wanda always sent me upstairs, and only\nwhen the apartment seemed to answer her requirements did she herself\nascend. By noon I was as tired as a stag-hound after the hunt.\n\nWe entered a new house and left it again without having found a suitable\nhabitation. Wanda was already somewhat out of humor. Suddenly she said\nto me: \"Severin, the seriousness with which you play your part is\ncharming, and the restrictions, which we have placed upon each other are\nreally annoying me. I can't stand it any longer, I do love you, I must\nkiss you. Let's go into one of the houses.\"\n\n\"But, my lady--\" I interposed.\n\n\"Gregor?\" She entered the next open corridor and ascended a few\nsteps of the dark stair-way; then she threw her arms about me with\npassionate tenderness and kissed me.\n\n\"Oh, Severin, you were very wise. You are much more dangerous as\nslave than I would have imagined; you are positively irrestible, and\nI am afraid I shall have to fall in love with you again.\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any longer then,\" I asked seized by a sudden\nfright.\n\nShe solemnly shook her head, but kissed me again with her swelling,\nadorable lips.\n\nWe returned to the hotel. Wanda had luncheon, and ordered me also\nquickly to get something to eat.\n\nOf course, I wasn't served as quickly as she, and so it happened\nthat just as I was carrying the second bite of my steak to my mouth,\nthe waiter entered and called out with his theatrical gesture:\n\"Madame wants you, at once.\"\n\nI took a rapid and painful leave of my food, and, tired and hungry,\nhurried toward Wanda, who was already on the street.\n\n\"I wouldn't have imagined you could be so cruel,\" I said\nreproachfully. \"With all these, fatiguing duties you don't even leave\nme time to eat in peace.\"\n\nWanda laughed gaily. \"I thought you had finished,\" she said, \"but\nnever mind. Man was born to suffer, and you in particular. The\nmartyrs didn't have any beefsteaks either.\"\n\nI followed her resentfully, gnawing at my hunger.\n\n\"I have given up the idea of finding a place in the city,\" Wanda\ncontinued. \"It will be difficult to find an entire floor which is\nshut off and where you can do as you please. In such a strange, mad\nrelationship as ours there must be no jarring note. I shall rent an\nentire villa--and you will be surprised. You have my permission now\nto satisfy your hunger, and look about a bit in Florence. I won't be\nhome till evening. If I need you then, I will have you called.\"\n\nI looked at the Duomo, the Palazzo Vecchio, the Logia di Lanzi, and\nthen I stood for a long time on the banks of the Arno. Again and\nagain I let my eyes rest on the magnificent ancient Florence, whose\nround cupolas and towers were drawn in soft lines against the blue,\ncloudless sky. I watched its splendid bridges beneath whose wide\narches the lively waves of the beautiful, yellow river ran, and the\ngreen hills which surrounded the city, bearing slender cypresses and\nextensive buildings, palaces and monasteries.\n\nIt is a different world, this one in which we are--a gay, sensuous,\nsmiling world. The landscape too has nothing of the seriousness and\nsomberness of ours. It is a long ways off to the last white villas\nscattered among the pale green of the mountains, and yet there isn't\na spot that isn't bright with sunlight. The people are less serious\nthan we; perhaps, they think less, but they all look as though they\nwere happy.\n\nIt is also maintained that death is easier in the South.\n\nI have a vague feeling now that such a thing as beauty without thorn\nand love of the senses without torment does exist.\n\nWanda has discovered a delightful little villa and rented it for the\nwinter. It is situated on a charming hill on the left bank of the\nArno, opposite the Cascine. It is surrounded by an attractive garden\nwith lovely paths, grass plots, and magnificent meadow of camelias.\nIt is only two stories high, quadrangular in the Italian fashion. An\nopen gallery runs along one side, a sort of loggia with plaster-casts\nof antique statues; stone steps lead from it down into the garden.\nFrom the gallery you enter a bath with a magnificent marble basin,\nfrom which winding stairs lead to my mistress' bed-chamber.\n\nWanda occupies the second story by herself.\n\nA room on the ground floor has been assigned to me; it is very\nattractive, and even has a fireplace.\n\nI have roamed through the garden. On a round hillock I discovered a\nlittle temple, but I found its door locked. However, there is a chink\nin the door and when I glue my eye to it, I see the goddess of love\non a white pedestal.\n\nA slight shudder passes over me. It seems to me as if she were\nsmiling at me saying: \"Are you there? I have been expecting you.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is evening. An attractive maid brings me orders to appear before\nmy mistress. I ascend the wide marble stairs, pass through the\nanteroom, a large salon furnished with extravagant magnificence, and\nknock at the door of the bedroom. I knock very softly for the luxury\ndisplayed everywhere intimidates me. Consequently no one hears me,\nand I stand for some time in front of the door. I have a feeling as\nif I were standing before the bed-room of the great Catherine, and\nit seems as if at any moment she might come out in her green sleeping\nfurs, with the red ribbon and decoration on her bare breast, and with\nher little white powdered curls.\n\nI knocked again. Wanda impatiently pulls the door open.\n\n\"Why so late?\" she asks.\n\n\"I was standing in front of the door, but you didn't hear me knock,\"\nI reply timidly. She closes the door, and clinging to me, she leads\nme to the red damask ottoman on which she had been resting. The\nentire arrangement of the room is in red damask--wall-paper,\ncurtains, portieres, hangings of the bed. A magnificent painting of\nSamson and Delilah forms the ceiling.\n\nWanda receives me in an intoxicating dishabille. Her white satin\ndress flows gracefully and picturesquely down her slender body,\nleaving her arms and breast bare, and carelessly they nestle amid the\ndark hair of the great fur of sable, lined with green velvet. Her red\nhair falls down her back as far as the hips, only half held by\nstrings of black pearls.\n\n\"Venus in Furs,\" I whisper, while she draws me to her breast and\nthreatens to stifle me with her kisses. Then I no longer speak and\nneither do I think; everything is drowned out in an ocean of\nunimagined bliss.\n\n\"Do you still love me?\" she asks, her eye softening in passionate\ntenderness.\n\n\"You ask!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"You still remember your oath,\" she continued with an alluring\nsmile, \"now that everything is prepared, everything in readiness, I\nask you once more, is it still your serious wish to become my slave?\"\n\n\"Am I not ready?\" I asked in surprise.\n\n\"You have not yet signed the papers.\"\n\n\"Papers--what papers?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see, you want to give it up,\" she said, \"well then, we will\nlet it go.\"\n\n\"But Wanda,\" I said, \"you know that nothing gives me greater\nhappiness than to serve you, to be your slave. I would give\neverything for the sake of feeling myself wholly in your power, even\nunto death--\"\n\n\"How beautiful you are,\" she whispered, \"when you speak so\nenthusiastically, so passionately. I am more in love with you than\never and you want me to be dominant, stern, and cruel. I am afraid,\nit will be impossible for me to be so.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" I replied smiling, \"where are the papers?'\"\n\n\"So that you may know what it means to be absolutely in my power, I\nhave drafted a second agreement in which you declare that you have\ndecided to kill yourself. In that way I can even kill you, if I so\ndesire.\"\n\n\"Give them to me.\"\n\nWhile I was unfolding the documents and reading them, Wanda got pen\nand ink. She then sat down beside me with her arm about my neck, and\nlooked over my shoulder at the paper.\n\nThe first one read:\n\nAGREEMENT BETWEEN MME. VON DUNAJEW AND SEVERIN VON KUSIEMSKI\n\n\"Severin von Kusiemski ceases with the present day being the affianced\nof Mme. Wanda von Dunajew, and renounces all the rights appertaining\nthereunto; he on the contrary binds himself on his word of honor as a\nman and nobleman, that hereafter he will be her _slave_ until such\ntime that she herself sets him at liberty again.\n\n\"As the slave of Mme. von Dunajew he is to bear the name Gregor, and\nhe is unconditionally to comply with every one of her wishes, and to\nobey every one of her commands; he is always to be submissive to his\nmistress, and is to consider her every sign of favor as an\nextraordinary mercy.\n\n\"Mme. von Dunajew is entitled not only to punish her slave as she\ndeems best, even for the slightest inadvertence or fault, but also\nis herewith given the right to torture him as the mood may seize her\nor merely for the sake of whiling away the time. Should she so desire,\nshe may kill him whenever she wishes; in short, he is her\nunrestricted property.\n\n\"Should Mme. von Dunajew ever set her slave at liberty, Severin von\nKusiemski agrees to forget everything that he has experienced or\nsuffered as her slave, and promises _never under any circumstances and\nin no wise to think of vengeance or retaliation_.\n\n\"Mme. von Dunajew on her behalf agrees as his mistress to appear as\noften as possible in her furs, especially when she purposes some\ncruelty toward her slave.\"\n\nAppended at the bottom of the agreement was the date of the present\nday.\n\nThe second document contained only a few words.\n\n\"Having since many years become weary of existence and its\nillusions, I have of my own free will put an end to my worthless\nlife.\"\n\nI was seized with a deep horror when I had finished. There was still\ntime, I could still withdraw, but the madness of passion and the\nsight of the beautiful woman that lay all relaxed against my shoulder\ncarried me away.\n\n\"This one you will have to copy, Severin,\" said Wanda, indicating\nthe second document. \"It has to be entirely in your own handwriting;\nthis, of course, isn't necessary in the case of the agreement.\"\n\nI quickly copied the few lines in which I designated myself a\nsuicide, and handed them to Wanda. She read them, and put them on the\ntable with a smile.\n\n\"Now have you the courage to sign it?\" she asked with a crafty\nsmile, inclining her head.\n\nI took the pen.\n\n\"Let me sign first,\" said Wanda, \"your hand is trembling, are you\nafraid of the happiness that is to be yours?\"\n\nShe took the agreement and pen. While engaging in my internal struggle,\nI looked upward for a moment. It occurred to me that the painting on the\nceiling, like many of those of the Italian and Dutch schools, was\nutterly unhistorical, but this very fact gave it a strange mood which\nhad an almost uncanny effect on me. Delilah, an opulent woman with\nflaming red hair, lay extended, half-disrobed, in a dark fur-cloak, upon\na red ottoman, and bent smiling over Samson who had been overthrown and\nbound by the Philistines. Her smile in its mocking coquetry was full of\na diabolical cruelty; her eyes, half-closed, met Samson's, and his with\na last look of insane passion cling to hers, for already one of his\nenemies is kneeling on his breast with the red-hot iron to blind him.\n\n\"Now--\" said Wanda. \"Why you are all lost in thought. What is the\nmatter with you, everything will remain just as it was, even after\nyou have signed, don't you know me yet, dear heart?\"\n\nI looked at the agreement. Her name was written there in bold\nletters. I peered once more into her eyes with their potent magic,\nthen I took the pen and quickly signed the agreement.\n\n\"You are trembling,\" said Wanda calmly, \"shall I help you?\"\n\nShe gently took hold of my hand, and my name appeared at the bottom\nof the second paper. Wanda looked once more at the two documents, and\nthen locked them in the desk which stood at the head of the ottoman.\n\n\"Now then, give me your passport and money.\"\n\nI took out my wallet and handed it to her. She inspected it, nodded,\nand put it with other things while in a sweet drunkenness I kneeled\nbefore her leaning my head against her breast.\n\nSuddenly she thrusts me away with her foot, leaps up, and pulls the\nbell-rope. In answer to its sound three young, slender negresses\nenter; they are as if carved of ebony, and are dressed from head to\nfoot in red satin; each one has a rope in her hand.\n\nSuddenly I realize my position, and am about to rise. Wanda stands\nproudly erect, her cold beautiful face with its sombre brows and\ncontemptous eyes is turned toward me. She stands before me as\nmistress, commanding, gives a sign with her hand, and before I really\nknow what has happened to me the negresses have dragged me to the\nground, and have tied me hand and foot. As in the case of one about\nto be executed my arms are bound behind my back, so that I can\nscarcely move.\n\n\"Give me the whip, Haydee,\" commands Wanda, with unearthly calm.\n\nThe negress hands it to her mistress, kneeling.\n\n\"And now take off my heavy furs,\" she continues, \"they impede me.\"\n\nThe negress obeyed.\n\n\"The jacket there!\" Wanda commanded.\n\nHaydee quickly brought her the _kazabaika_, set with ermine, which lay\non the bed, and Wanda slipped into it with two inimitably graceful\nmovements.\n\n\"Now tie him to the pillar here!\"\n\nThe negresses lifted me up, and twisting a heavy rope around my\nbody, tied me standing against one of the massive pillars which\nsupported the top of the wide Italian bed.\n\nThen they suddenly disappeared, as if the earth had swallowed them.\n\nWanda swiftly approached me. Her white satin dress flowed behind her\nin a long train, like silver, like moonlight; her hair flared like\nflames against the white fur of her jacket. Now she stood in front\nof me with her left hand firmly planted on her hips, in her right hand\nshe held the whip. She uttered an abrupt laugh.\n\n\"Now play has come to an end between us,\" she said with heartless\ncoldness. \"Now we will begin in dead earnest. You fool, I laugh at you\nand despise you; you who in your insane infatuation have given\nyourself as a plaything to _me_, the frivolous and capricious woman.\nYou are no longer the man I love, but _my slave_, at my mercy even\nunto life and death.\n\n\"You shall know me!\n\n\"First of all you shall have a taste of the whip in all seriousness,\nwithout having done anything to deserve it, so that you may\nunderstand what to expect, if you are awkward, disobedient, or\nrefractory.\"\n\nWith a wild grace she rolled back her fur-lined sleeve, and struck\nme across the back.\n\nI winced, for the whip cut like a knife into my flesh.\n\n\"Well, how do you like that?\" she exclaimed.\n\nI was silent.\n\n\"Just wait, you will yet whine like a dog beneath my whip,\" she\nthreatened, and simultaneously began to strike me again.\n\nThe blows fell quickly, in rapid succession, with terrific force\nupon my back, arms, and neck; I had to grit my teeth not to scream\naloud. Now she struck me in the face, warm blood ran down, but she\nlaughed, and continued her blows.\n\n\"It is only now I understand you,\" she exclaimed. \"It really is a\njoy to have some one so completely in one's power, and a man at that,\nwho loves you--you do love me?--No--Oh! I'll tear you to shreds yet,\nand with each blow my pleasure will grow. Now, twist like a worm,\nscream, whine! You will find no mercy in me!\"\n\nFinally she seemed tired.\n\nShe tossed the whip aside, stretched out on the ottoman, and rang.\n\nThe negresses entered.\n\n\"Untie him!\"\n\nAs they loosened the rope, I fell to the floor like a lump of wood.\nThe black women grinned, showing their white teeth.\n\n\"Untie the rope around his feet.\"\n\nThey did it, but I was unable to rise.\n\n\"Come over here, Gregor.\"\n\nI approached the beautiful woman. Never did she seem more seductive\nto me than to-day in spite of all her cruelty and contempt.\n\n\"One step further,\" Wanda commanded. \"Now kneel down, and kiss my\nfoot.\"\n\nShe extended her foot beyond the hem of white satin, and I, the\nsupersensual fool, pressed my lips upon it.\n\n\"Now, you won't lay eyes on me for an entire month, Gregor,\" she\nsaid seriously. \"I want to become a stranger to you, so you will more\neasily adjust yourself to our new relationship. In the meantime you\nwill work in the garden, and await my orders. Now, off with you,\nslave!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA month has passed with monotonous regularity, heavy work, and a\nmelancholy hunger, hunger for her, who is inflicting all these\ntorments on me.\n\nI am under the gardener's orders; I help him lop the trees and prune\nthe hedges, transplant flowers, turn over the flower beds, sweep the\ngravel paths; I share his coarse food and his hard cot; I rise and\ngo to bed with the chickens. Now and then I hear that our mistress\nis amusing herself, surrounded by admirers. Once I heard her gay\nlaughter even down here in the garden.\n\nI seem awfully stupid to myself. Was it the result of my present\nlife, or was I so before? The month is drawing to a close--the day\nafter to-morrow. What will she do with me now, or has she forgotten\nme, and left me to trim hedges and bind bouquets till my dying day?\n\nA written order.\n\n\"The slave Gregor is herewith ordered to my personal service.\n\nWanda Dunajew.\"\n\nWith a beating heart I draw aside the damask curtain on the\nfollowing morning, and enter the bed-room of my divinity. It is still\nfilled with a pleasant half darkness.\n\n\"Is it you, Gregor?\" she asks, while I kneel before the fire-place,\nbuilding a fire. I tremble at the sound of the beloved voice. I\ncannot see her herself; she is invisible behind the curtains of the\nfour-poster bed.\n\n\"Yes, my mistress,\" I reply.\n\n\"How late is it?\"\n\n\"Past nine o'clock.\"\n\n\"Breakfast.\"\n\nI hasten to get it, and then kneel down with the tray beside her bed.\n\n\"Here is breakfast, my mistress.\"\n\nWanda draws back the curtains, and curiously enough at the first\nglance when I see her among the pillows with loosened flowing hair,\nshe seems an absolute stranger, a beautiful woman, but the beloved\nsoft lines are gone. This face is hard and has an expression of\nweariness and satiety.\n\nOr is it simply that formerly my eye did not see this?\n\nShe fixes her green eyes upon me, more with curiosity than with\nmenace, perhaps even somewhat pityingly, and lazily pulls the dark\nsleeping fur on which she lies over the bared shoulder.\n\nAt this moment she is very charming, very maddening, and I feel my\nblood rising to my head and heart. The tray in my hands begins to\nsway. She notices it and reached out for the whip which is lying on\nthe toilet-table.\n\n\"You are awkward, slave,\" she says furrowing her brow.\n\nI lower my looks to the ground, and hold the tray as steadily as\npossible. She eats her breakfast, yawns, and stretches her opulent\nlimbs in the magnificent furs.\n\nShe has rung. I enter.\n\n\"Take this letter to Prince Corsini.\"\n\nI hurry into the city, and hand the letter to the Prince. He is a\nhandsome young man with glowing black eyes. Consumed with jealousy,\nI take his answer to her.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" she asks with lurking spitefulness.\n\"You are very pale.\"\n\n\"Nothing, mistress, I merely walked rather fast.\"\n\nAt luncheon the prince is at her side, and I am condemned to serve\nboth her and him. They joke, and I am, as if non-existent, for both.\nFor a brief moment I see black; I was just pouring some Bordeaux into\nhis glass, and spilled it over the table-cloth and her gown.\n\n\"How awkward,\" Wanda exclaimed and slapped my face. The prince\nlaughed, and she also, but I felt the blood rising to my face.\n\nAfter luncheon she drove in the Cascine. She has a little carriage\nwith a handsome, brown English horse, and holds the reins herself.\nI sit behind and notice how coquettishly she acts, and nods with a\nsmile when one of the distinguished gentlemen bows to her.\n\nAs I help her out of the carriage, she leans lightly on my arm; the\ncontact runs through me like an electric shock. She _is_ a wonderful\nwoman, and I love her more than ever.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor dinner at six she has invited a small group of men and women. I\nserve, but this time I do not spill any wine over the table-cloth.\n\nA slap in the face is more effective than ten lectures. It makes you\nunderstand very quickly, especially when the instruction is by the\nway of a small woman's hand.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter dinner she drives to the Pergola Theater. As she descends the\nstairs in her black velvet dress with its large collar of ermine and\nwith a diadem of white roses on her hair, she is literally stunning.\nI open the carriage-door, and help her in. In front of the theater\nI leap from the driver's seat, and in alighting she leaned on my arm,\nwhich trembled under the sweet burden. I open the door of her box,\nand then wait in the vestibule. The performance lasts four hours; she\nreceives visits from her cavaliers, the while I grit my teeth with\nrage.\n\nIt is way beyond midnight when my mistress's bell sounds for the\nlast time.\n\n\"Fire!\" she orders abruptly, and when the fire-place crackles, \"Tea!\"\n\nWhen I return with the samovar, she has already undressed, and with\nthe aid of the negress slipped into a white negligee.\n\nHaydee thereupon leaves.\n\n\"Hand me the sleeping-furs,\" says Wanda, sleepily stretching her\nlovely limbs. I take them from the arm-chair, and hold them while she\nslowly and lazily slides into the sleeves. She then throws herself\ndown on the cushions of the ottoman.\n\n\"Take off my shoes, and put on my velvet slippers.\"\n\nI kneel down and tug at the little shoe which resists my efforts.\n\"Hurry, hurry!\" Wanda exclaims, \"you are hurting me! just you wait--I\nwill teach you.\" She strikes me with the whip, but now the shoe is\noff.\n\n\"Now get out!\" Still a kick--and then I can go to bed.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-night I accompanied her to a soiree. In the entrance-hall she\nordered me to help her out of her furs; then with a proud smile,\nconfident of victory, she entered the brilliantly illuminated room.\nI again waited with gloomy and monotonous thoughts, watching hour after\nhour run by. From time to time the sounds of music reached me, when\nthe door remained open for a moment. Several servants tried to start\na conversation with me, but soon desisted, since I knew only a few\nwords of Italian.\n\nFinally I fell asleep, and dreamed that I murdered Wanda in a\nviolent attack of jealousy. I was condemned to death, and saw myself\nstrapped on the board; the knife fell, I felt it on my neck, but I\nwas still alive--\n\nThen the executioner slapped my face.\n\nNo, it wasn't the executioner; it was Wanda who stood wrathfully\nbefore me demanding her furs. I am at her side in a moment, and help\nher on with it.\n\nThere is a deep joy in wrapping a beautiful woman into her furs, and\nin seeing and feeling how her neck and magnificent limbs nestle in\nthe precious soft furs, and to lift the flowing hair over the collar.\nWhen she throws it off a soft warmth and a faint fragrance of her\nbody still clings to the ends of the hairs of sable. It is enough to\ndrive one mad.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFinally a day came when there were neither guests, nor theater, nor\nother company. I breathed a sigh of relief. Wanda sat in the gallery,\nreading, and apparently had no orders for me. At dusk when the\nsilvery evening mists fell she withdrew. I served her at dinner, she\nate by herself, but had not a look, not a syllable for me, not even\na slap in the face.\n\nI actually desire a slap from her hand. Tears fill my eyes, and I\nfeel that she has humiliated me so deeply, that she doesn't even find\nit worth while to torture or maltreat me any further.\n\nBefore she goes to bed, her bell calls me.\n\n\"You will sleep here to-night, I had horrible dreams last night, and\nam afraid of being alone. Take one of the cushions from the ottoman,\nand lie down on the bearskin at my feet.\"\n\nThen Wanda put out the lights. The only illumination in the room was\nfrom a small lamp suspended from the ceiling. She herself got into\nbed. \"Don't stir, so as not to wake me.\"\n\nI did as she had commanded, but could not fall asleep for a long\ntime. I saw the beautiful woman, beautiful as a goddess, lying on her\nback on the dark sleeping-furs; her arms beneath her neck, with a\nflood of red hair over them. I heard her magnificent breast rise in\ndeep regular breathing, and whenever she moved ever so slightly. I\nwoke up and listened to see whether she needed me.\n\nBut she did not require me.\n\nNo task was required of me; I meant no more to her than a night-lamp, or\na revolver which one places under one's pillow.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAm I mad or is she? Does all this arise out of an inventive, wanton\nwoman's brain with the intention of surpassing my supersensual\nfantasies, or is this woman really one of those Neronian characters\nwho take a diabolical pleasure in treading underfoot, like a worm,\nhuman beings, who have thoughts and feelings and a will like theirs?\n\nWhat have I experienced?\n\nWhen I knelt with the coffee-tray beside her bed, Wanda suddenly\nplaced her hand on my shoulder and her eyes plunged deep into mine.\n\n\"What beautiful eyes you have,\" she said softly, \"and especially now\nsince you suffer. Are you very unhappy?\"\n\nI bowed my head, and kept silent.\n\n\"Severin, do you still love me,\" she suddenly exclaimed\npassionately, \"can you still love me?\"\n\nShe drew me close with such vehemence that the coffee-tray upset,\nthe can and cups fell to the floor, and the coffee ran over the\ncarpet.\n\n\"Wanda--my Wanda,\" I cried out and held her passionately against me;\nI covered her mouth, face, and breast with kisses.\n\n\"It is my unhappiness that I love you more and more madly the worse\nyou treat me, the more frequently you betray me. Oh, I shall die of\npain and love and jealousy.\"\n\n\"But I haven't betrayed you, as yet, Severin,\" replied Wanda smiling.\n\n\"Not? Wanda! Don't jest so mercilessly with me,\" I cried. \"Haven't\nI myself taken the letter to the Prince--\"\n\n\"Of course, it was an invitation for luncheon.\"\n\n\"You have, since we have been in Florence--\"\n\n\"I have been absolutely faithful to you,\" replied Wanda, \"I swear it\nby all that is holy to me. All that I have done was merely to fulfill\nyour dream and it was done for your sake.\n\n\"However, I shall take a lover, otherwise things will be only half\naccomplished, and in the end you will yet reproach me with not having\ntreated you cruelly enough, my dear beautiful slave! But to-day you\nshall be Severin again, the only one I love. I haven't given away\nyour clothes. They are here in the chest. Go and dress as you used\nto in the little Carpathian health-resort when our love was so intimate.\nForget everything that has happened since; oh, you will forget it\neasily in my arms; I shall kiss away all your sorrows.\"\n\nShe began to treat me tenderly like a child, to kiss me and caress\nme. Finally she said with a gracious smile, \"Go now and dress, I too\nwill dress. Shall I put on my fur-jacket? Oh yes, I know, now run\nalong!\"\n\nWhen I returned she was standing in the center of the room in her\nwhite satin dress, and the red _kazabaika_ edged with ermine; her hair\nwas white with powder and over her forehead she wore a small diamond\ndiadem. For a moment she reminded me in an uncanny way of Catherine\nthe Second, but she did not give me much time for reminiscences. She\ndrew me down on the ottoman beside her and we enjoyed two blissful\nhours. She was no longer the stern capricious mistress, she was\nentirely a fine lady, a tender sweetheart. She showed me photographs\nand books which had just appeared, and talked about them with so much\nintelligence, clarity, and good taste, that I more than once carried\nher hand to my lips, enraptured. She then had me recite several of\nLermontov's poems, and when I was all afire with enthusiasm, she\nplaced her small hand gently on mine. Her expression was soft, and her\neyes were filled with tender pleasure.\n\n\"Are you happy?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nShe then leaned back on the cushions, and slowly opened her\n_kazabaika_.\n\nBut I quickly covered the half-bared breast again with the ermine.\n\"You are driving me mad.\" I stammered.\n\n\"Come!\"\n\nI was already lying in her arms, and like a serpent she was kissing\nme with her tongue, when again she whispered, \"Are you happy?\"\n\n\"Infinitely!\" I exclaimed.\n\nShe laughed aloud. It was an evil, shrill laugh which made cold\nshivers run down by back.\n\n\"You used to dream of being the slave, the plaything of a beautiful\nwoman, and now you imagine you are a free human being, a man, my\nlover-you fool! A sign from me, and you are a slave again. Down on\nyour knees!\"\n\nI sank down from the ottoman to her feet, but my eye still clung\ndoubtingly on hers.\n\n\"You can't believe it,\" she said, looking at me with her arms folded\nacross her breast. \"I am bored, and you will just do to while away\na couple of hours of time. Don't look at me that way--\"\n\nShe kicked me with her foot.\n\n\"You are just what I want, a human being, a thing, an animal--\"\n\nShe rang. The three negresses entered.\n\n\"Tie his hands behind his back.\"\n\nI remained kneeling and unresistingly let them do this. They led me\ninto the garden, down to the little vineyard, which forms the\nsouthern boundary. Corn had been planted between the espaliers, and\nhere and there a few dead stalks still stood. To one side was a\nplough.\n\nThe negresses tied me to a post, and amused themselves sticking me\nwith their golden hair-needles. But this did not last long, before\nWanda appeared with her ermine cap on her head, and with her hands\nin the pockets of her jacket. She had me untied, and then my hands\nwere fastened together on my back. She finally had a yoke put around\nmy neck, and harnessed me to the plough.\n\nThen her black demons drove me out into the field. One of them held\nthe plough, the other one led me by a line, the third applied the\nwhip, and Venus in Furs stood to one side and looked on.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I was serving dinner on the following day Wanda said: \"Bring\nanother cover, I want you to dine with me to-day,\" and when I was\nabout to sit down opposite her, she added, \"No, over here, close by\nmy side.\"\n\nShe is in the best of humors, gives me soup with her spoon, feeds me\nwith her fork, and places her head on the table like a playful kitten\nand flirts with me. I have the misfortune of looking at Haydee, who\nserves in my place, perhaps a little longer than is necessary. It is\nonly now that I noticed her noble, almost European cast of\ncountenance and her magnificent statuesque bust, which is as if hewn\nout of black marble. The black devil observes that she pleases me,\nand, grinning, shows her teeth. She has hardly left the room, before\nWanda leaps up in a rage.\n\n\"What, you dare to look at another woman besides me! Perhaps you\nlike her even better than you do me, she is even more demonic!\"\n\nI am frightened; I have never seen her like this before; she is\nsuddenly pale even to the lips and her whole body trembles. Venus in\nFurs is jealous of her slave. She snatches the whip from its hook and\nstrikes me in the face; then she calls her black servants, who bind\nme, and carry me down into the cellar, where they throw me into a\ndark, dank, subterranean compartment, a veritable prison-cell.\n\nThen the lock of the door clicks, the bolts are drawn, a key sings\nin the lock. I am a prisoner, buried.\n\nI have been lying here for I don't know how long, bound like a calf\nabout to be hauled to the slaughter, on a bundle of damp straw,\nwithout any light, without food, without drink, without sleep. It\nwould be like her to let me starve to death, if I don't freeze to\ndeath before then. I am shaking with cold. Or is it fever? I believe\nI am beginning to hate this woman.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA red streak, like blood, floods across the floor; it is a light\nfalling through the door which is now thrust open.\n\nWanda appears on the threshold, wrapped in her sables, holding a\nlighted torch.\n\n\"Are you still alive?\" she asks.\n\n\"Are you coming to kill me?\" I reply with a low, hoarse voice.\n\nWith two rapid strides Wanda reaches my side, she kneels down beside\nme, and places my head in her lap. \"Are you ill? Your eyes glow so,\ndo you love me? I want you to love me.\"\n\nShe draws forth a short dagger. I start with fright when its blade\ngleams in front of my eyes. I actually believe that she is about to\nkill me. She laughs, and cuts the ropes that bind me.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery evening after dinner she now has me called. I have to read to\nher, and she discusses with me all sorts of interesting problems and\nsubjects. She seems entirely transformed; it is as if she were\nashamed of the savagery which she betrayed to me and of the cruelty\nwith which she treated me. A touching gentleness transfigures her\nentire being, and when at the good-night she gives me her hand, a\nsuperhuman power of goodness and love lies in her eyes, of the kind\nwhich calls forth tears in us and causes us to forget all the\nmiseries of existence and all the terrors of death.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI am reading _Manon l'Escault_ to her. She feels the association, she\ndoesn't say a word, but she smiles from time to time, and finally she\nshuts up the little book.\n\n\"Don't you want to go on reading?\"\n\n\"Not to-day. We will ourselves act _Manon l'Escault_ to-day. I have a\nrendezvous in the Cascine, and you, my dear Chevalier, will accompany\nme; I know, you will do it, won't you?\"\n\n\"You command it.\"\n\n\"I do not command it, I beg it of you,\" she says with irresistible\ncharm. She then rises, puts her hands on my shoulders, and looks at\nme.\n\n\"Your eyes!\" she exclaims. \"I love you, Severin, you have no idea\nhow I love you!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have!\" I replied bitterly, \"so much so that you have\narranged for a rendezvous with some one else.\"\n\n\"I do this only to allure you the more,\" she replied vivaciously. \"I\nmust have admirers, so as not to lose you. I don't ever want to lose\nyou, never, do you hear, for I love only you, you alone.\"\n\nShe clung passionately to my lips.\n\n\"Oh, if I only could, as I would, give you all of my soul in a kiss--\nthus--but now come.\"\n\nShe slipped into a simple black velvet coat, and put a dark _bashlyk_\n[Footnote: A kind of Russian cap.] on her head. Then she rapidly went\nthrough the gallery, and entered the carriage.\n\n\"Gregor will drive,\" she called out to the coachman who withdrew in\nsurprise.\n\nI ascended the driver's seat, and angrily whipped up the horses.\n\nIn the Cascine where the main roadway turns into a leafy path, Wanda\ngot out. It was night, only occasional stars shone through the gray\nclouds that fled across the sky. By the bank of the Arno stood a man\nin a dark cloak, with a brigand's hat, and looked at the yellow\nwaves. Wanda rapidly walked through the shrubbery, and tapped him on\nthe shoulder. I saw him turn and seize her hand, and then they\ndisappeared behind the green wall.\n\nAn hour full of torments. Finally there was a rustling in the bushes\nto one side, and they returned.\n\nThe man accompanied her to the carriage. The light of the lamp fell\nfull and glaringly upon an infinitely young, soft and dreamy face\nwhich I had never before seen, and played in his long, blond curls.\n\nShe held out her hand which he kissed with deep respect, then she\nsignaled to me, and immediately the carriage flew along the leafy\nwall which follows the river like a long green screen.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bell at the garden-gate rings. It is a familiar face. The man\nfrom the Cascine.\n\n\"Whom shall I announce?\" I ask him in French. He timidly shakes his\nhead.\n\n\"Do you, perhaps, understand some German?\" he asks shyly.\n\n\"Yes. Your name, please.\"\n\n\"Oh! I haven't any yet,\" he replies, embarrassed--\"Tell your\nmistress the German painter from the Cascine is here and would like--\nbut there she is herself.\"\n\nWanda had stepped out on the balcony, and nodded toward the stranger.\n\n\"Gregor, show the gentleman in!\" she called to me.\n\nI showed the painter the stairs.\n\n\"Thanks, I'll find her now, thanks, thanks very much.\" He ran up the\nsteps. I remained standing below, and looked with deep pity on the\npoor German.\n\nVenus in Furs has caught his soul in the red snares of hair. He will\npaint her, and go mad.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is a sunny winter's day. Something that looks like gold trembles\non the leaves of the clusters of trees down below in the green level\nof the meadow. The camelias at the foot of the gallery are glorious\nin their abundant buds. Wanda is sitting in the loggia; she is\ndrawing. The German painter stands opposite her with his hands folded\nas in adoration, and looks at her. No, he rather looks at her face,\nand is entirely absorbed in it, enraptured.\n\nBut she does not see him, neither does she see me, who with the\nspade in my hand am turning over the flower-bed, solely that I may\nsee her and feel her nearness, which produces an effect on me like\npoetry, like music.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe painter has gone. It is a hazardous thing to do, but I risk it.\nI go up to the gallery, quite close, and ask Wanda \"Do you love the\npainter, mistress?\"\n\nShe looks at me without getting angry, shakes her head, and finally\neven smiles.\n\n\"I feel sorry for him,\" she replies, \"but I do not love him. I love no\none. _I used to love you, as ardently, as passionately, as deeply as\nit was possible for me to love,_ but now I don't love even you any\nmore; my heart is a void, dead, and this makes me sad.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I exclaimed, deeply moved.\n\n\"Soon, you too will no longer love me,\" she continued, \"tell me when\nyou have reached that point, and I will give back to you your\nfreedom.\"\n\n\"Then I shall remain your slave, all my life long, for I adore you\nand shall always adore you,\" I cried, seized by that fanaticism of\nlove which has repeatedly been so fatal to me.\n\nWanda looked at me with a curious pleasure. \"Consider well what you\ndo,\" she said. \"I have loved you infinitely and have been despotic\ntowards you so that I might fulfil your dream. Something of my old\nfeeling, a sort of real sympathy for you, still trembles in my\nbreast. When that too has gone who knows whether then I shall give\nyou your liberty; whether I shall not then become really cruel,\nmerciless, even brutal toward; whether I shall not take a diabolical\npleasure in tormenting and putting on the rack the man who worships\nme idolatrously, the while I remain indifferent or love someone else;\nperhaps, I shall enjoy seeing him die of his love for me. Consider\nthis well.\"\n\n\"I have long since considered all that,\" I replied as in a glow of\nfever. \"I cannot exist, cannot live without you; I shall die if you\nset me at liberty; let me remain your slave, kill me, but do not\ndrive me away.\"\n\n\"Very well then, be my slave,\" she replied, \"but don't forget that\nI no longer love you, and your love doesn't mean any more to me than\na dog's, and dogs are kicked.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day I visited the Venus of Medici.\n\nIt was still early, and the little octagonal room in the Tribuna was\nfilled with half-lights like a sanctuary; I stood with folded hands\nin deep adoration before the silent image of the divinity.\n\nBut I did not stand for long.\n\nNot a human soul was in the gallery, not even an Englishman, and I\nfell down on my knees. I looked up at the lovely slender body, the\nbudding breasts, the virginal and yet voluptuous face, the fragrant\ncurls which seemed to conceal tiny horns on each side of the forehead.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nMy mistress's bell.\n\nIt is noonday. She, however, is still abed with her arms intertwined\nbehind her neck.\n\n\"I want to bathe,\" she says, \"and you will attend me. Lock the door!\"\n\nI obey.\n\n\"Now go downstairs and make sure the door below is also locked.\"\n\nI descended the winding stairs that lead from her bedroom to the\nbath; my feet gave way beneath me, and I had to support myself\nagainst the iron banister. After having ascertained that the door\nleading to the Loggia and the garden was locked, I returned. Wanda\nwas now sitting on the bed with loosened hair, wrapped in her green\nvelvet furs. When she made a rapid movement, I noticed that the furs\nwere her only covering. It made me start terribly, I don't know why?\nI was like one condemned to death, who knows he is on the way to the\nscaffold, and yet begins to tremble when he sees it.\n\n\"Come, Gregor, take me on your arms.\"\n\n\"You mean, mistress?\"\n\n\"You are to carry me, don't you understand?\"\n\nI lifted her up, so that she rested in my arms, while she twined\nhers around my neck. Slowly, step by step, I went down the stairs\nwith her and her hair beat from time to time against my cheek and her\nfoot sought support against my knee. I trembled under the beautiful\nburden I was carrying, and every moment it seemed as if I had to\nbreak down beneath it.\n\nThe bath consisted of a wide, high rotunda, which received a soft\nquiet light from a red glass cupola above. Two palms extended their\nbroad leaves like a roof over a couch of velvet cushions. From here\nsteps covered with Turkish rugs led to the white marble basin which\noccupied the center.\n\n\"There is a green ribbon on my toilet-table upstairs,\" said Wanda,\nas I let her down on the couch, \"go get it, and also bring the whip.\"\n\nI flew upstairs and back again, and kneeling put both in my mistress's\nhands. She then had me twist her heavy electric hair into a large knot\nwhich I fastened with the green ribbon. Then I prepared the bath. I did\nthis very awkwardly because my hands and feet refused to obey me. Again\nand again I had to look at the beautiful woman lying on the red velvet\ncushions, and from time to time her wonderful body gleamed here and\nthere beneath the furs. Some magnetic power stronger than my will\ncompelled me to look. I felt that all sensuality and lustfulness lies in\nthat which is half-concealed or intentionally disclosed; and the truth\nof this I recognized even more acutely, when the basin at last was full,\nand Wanda threw off the fur-cloak with a single gesture, and stood\nbefore me like the goddess in the Tribuna.\n\nAt that moment she seemed as sacred and chaste to me in her unveiled\nbeauty, as did the divinity of long ago. I sank down on my knees\nbefore her, and devoutly pressed my lips on her foot.\n\nMy soul which had been storm-tossed only a little while earlier,\nsuddenly was perfectly calm, and I now felt no element of cruelty in\nWanda.\n\nShe slowly descended the stairs, and I could watch her with a\ncalmness in which not a single atom of torment or desire was\nintermingled. I could see her plunge into and rise out of the\ncrystalline water, and the wavelets which she herself raised played\nabout her like tender lovers.\n\nOur nihilistic aesthetician is right when he says: a real apple is\nmore beautiful than a painted one, and a living woman is more\nbeautiful than a Venus of stone.\n\nAnd when she left the bath, and the silvery drops and the roseate\nlight rippled down her body, I was seized with silent rapture. I\nwrapped the linen sheets about her, drying her glorious body. The\ncalm bliss remained with me, even now when one foot upon me as upon\na footstool, she rested on the cushions in her large velvet cloak.\nThe lithe sables nestled desirously against her cold marble-like body.\nHer left arm on which she supported herself lay like a sleeping swan\nin the dark fur of the sleeve, while her left hand played carelessly\nwith the whip.\n\nBy chance my look fell on the massive mirror on the wall opposite,\nand I cried out, for I saw the two of us in its golden frame as in\na picture. The picture was so marvellously beautiful, so strange, so\nimaginative, that I was filled with deep sorrow at the thought that\nits lines and colors would have to dissolve like mist.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Wanda.\n\nI pointed to the mirror.\n\n\"Ah, that is really beautiful,\" she exclaimed, \"too bad one can't\ncapture the moment and make it permanent.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" I asked. \"Would not any artist, even the most famous,\nbe proud if you gave him leave to paint you and make you immortal by\nmeans of his brush.\n\n\"The very thought that this extra-ordinary beauty is to be lost to\nthe world,\" I continued still watching her enthusiastically, \"is\nhorrible--all this glorious facial expression, this mysterious eye\nwith its green fires, this demonic hair, this magnificence of body.\nThe idea fills me with a horror of death, of annihilation. But the\nhand of an artist shall snatch you from this. You shall not like the\nrest of us disappear absolutely and forever, without leaving a trace\nof your having been. Your picture must live, even when you yourself\nhave long fallen to dust; your beauty must triumph beyond death!\"\n\nWanda smiled.\n\n\"Too bad, that present-day Italy hasn't a Titian or Raphael,\" she\nsaid, \"but, perhaps, love will make amends for genius, who knows; our\nlittle German might do?\" She pondered.\n\n\"Yes, he shall paint you, and I will see to it that the god of love\nmixes his colors.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe young painter has established his studio in her villa; he is\ncompletely in her net. He has just begun a Madonna, a Madonna with\nred hair and green eyes! Only the idealism of a German would attempt\nto use this thorough-bred woman as a model for a picture of\nvirginity. The poor fellow really is an almost bigger donkey than I\nam. Our misfortune is that our Titania has discovered our ass's ears\ntoo soon.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nNow she laughs derisively at us, and how she laughs! I hear her\ninsolent melodious laughter in his studio, under the open window of\nwhich I stand, jealously listening.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Are you mad, me--ah, it is unbelievable, me as the Mother of God!\"\nshe exclaimed and laughed again. \"Wait a moment, I will show you\nanother picture of myself, one that I myself have painted, and you\nshall copy it.\"\n\nHer head appeared in the window, luminous like a flame under the\nsunlight.\n\n\"Gregor!\"\n\nI hurried up the stairs, through the gallery, into the studio.\n\n\"Lead him to the bath,\" Wanda commanded, while she herself hurried\naway.\n\nA few moments passed and Wanda arrived; dressed in nothing but the\nsable fur, with the whip in her hand; she descended the stairs and\nstretched out on the velvet cushions as on the former occasion. I lay\nat her feet and she placed one of her feet upon me; her right hand\nplayed with the whip. \"Look at me,\" she said, \"with your deep,\nfanatical look, that's it.\"\n\nThe painter had turned terribly pale. He devoured the scene with his\nbeautiful dreamy blue eyes; his lips opened, but he remained dumb.\n\n\"Well, how do you like the picture?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is how I want to paint you,\" said the German, but it was\nreally not a spoken language; it was the eloquent moaning, the\nweeping of a sick soul, a soul sick unto death.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe charcoal outline of the painting is done; the heads and flesh\nparts are painted in. Her diabolical face is already becoming visible\nunder a few bold strokes, life flashes in her green eyes.\n\nWanda stands in front of the canvas with her arms crossed over her\nbreast.\n\n\"This picture, like many of those of the Venetian school, is\nsimultaneously to represent a portrait and to tell a story,\"\nexplained the painter, who again had become pale as death.\n\n\"And what will you call it?\" she asked, \"but what is the matter with\nyou, are you ill?\"\n\n\"I am afraid--\" he answered with a consuming look fixed on the\nbeautiful woman in furs, \"but let us talk of the picture.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us talk about the picture.\"\n\n\"I imagine the goddess of love as having descended from Mount Olympus\nfor the sake of some mortal man. And always cold in this modern world\nof ours, she seeks to keep her sublime body warm in a large heavy fur\nand her feet in the lap of her lover. I imagine the favorite of a\nbeautiful despot, who whips her slave, when she is tired of kissing\nhim, and the more she treads him underfoot, the more insanely he loves\nher. And so I shall call the picture: _Venus in Furs_.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe painter paints slowly, but his passion grows more and more\nrapidly. I am afraid he will end up by committing suicide. She plays\nwith him and propounds riddles to him which he cannot solve, and he\nfeels his blood congealing in the process, but it amuses her.\n\nDuring the sitting she nibbles at candies, and rolls the paper-wrappers\ninto little pellets with which she bombards him.\n\n\"I am glad you are in such good humor,\" said the painter, \"but your face\nhas lost the expression which I need for my picture.\"\n\n\"The expression which you need for your picture,\" she replied,\nsmiling. \"Wait a moment.\"\n\nShe rose, and dealt me a blow with the whip. The painter looked at\nher with stupefaction, and a child-like surprise showed on his face,\nmingled with disgust and admiration.\n\nWhile whipping me, Wanda's face acquired more and more of the cruel,\ncontemptuous character, which so haunts and intoxicates me.\n\n\"Is this the expression you need for your picture?\" she exclaimed.\nThe painter lowered his look in confusion before the cold ray of her\neye.\n\n\"It is the expression--\" he stammered, \"but I can't paint now--\"\n\n\"What?\" said Wanda, scornfully, \"perhaps I can help you?\"\n\n\"Yes--\" cried the German, as if taken with madness, \"whip me too.\"\n\n\"Oh! With pleasure,\" she replied, shrugging her shoulders, \"but if\nI am to whip you I want to do it in sober earnest.\"\n\n\"Whip me to death,\" cried the painter.\n\n\"Will you let me tie you?\" she asked, smiling.\n\n\"Yes--\" he moaned--\n\nWanda left the room for a moment, and returned with ropes.\n\n\"Well--are you still brave enough to put yourself into the power of\nVenus in Furs, the beautiful despot, for better or worse?\" she began\nironically.\n\n\"Yes, tie me,\" the painter replied dully. Wanda tied his hands on\nhis back and drew a rope through his arms and a second one around his\nbody, and fettered him to the cross-bars of the window. Then she\nrolled back the fur, seized the whip, and stepped in front of him.\n\nThe scene had a grim attraction for me, which I cannot describe. I\nfelt my heart beat, when, with a smile, she drew back her arm for the\nfirst blow, and the whip hissed through the air. He winced slightly\nunder the blow. Then she let blow after blow rain upon him, with her\nmouth half-opened and her teeth flashing between her red lips, until\nhe finally seemed to ask for mercy with his piteous, blue eyes. It\nwas indescribable.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe is sitting for him now, alone. He is working on her head.\n\nShe has posted me in the adjoining room behind a heavy curtain,\nwhere I can't be seen, but can see everything.\n\nWhat does she intend now?\n\nIs she afraid of him? She has driven him insane enough to be sure,\nor is she hatching a new torment for me? My knees tremble.\n\nThey are talking. He has lowered his voice so that I cannot\nunderstand a word, and she replies in the same way. What is the\nmeaning of this? Is there an understanding between them?\n\nI suffer frightful torments; my heart seems about to burst.\n\nHe kneels down before her, embraces her, and presses his head\nagainst her breast, and she--in her heartlessness--laughs--and now\nI hear her saying aloud:\n\n\"Ah! You need another application of the whip.\"\n\n\"Woman! Goddess! Are you without a heart--can't you love,\" exclaimed\nthe German, \"don't you even know, what it means to love, to be\nconsumed with desire and passion, can't you even imagine what I\nsuffer? Have you no pity for me?\"\n\n\"No!\" she replied proudly and mockingly, \"but I have the whip.\"\n\nShe drew it quickly from the pocket of her fur-coat, and struck him\nin the face with the handle. He rose, and drew back a couple of paces.\n\n\"Now, are you ready to paint again?\" she asked indifferently. He did\nnot reply, but again went to the easel and took up his brush and\npalette.\n\nThe painting is marvellously successful. It is a portrait which as\nfar as the likeness goes couldn't be better, and at the same time it\nseems to have an ideal quality. The colors glow, are supernatural;\nalmost diabolical, I would call them.\n\nThe painter has put all his sufferings, his adoration, and all his\nexecration into the picture.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nNow he is painting me; we are alone together for several hours every\nday. To-day he suddenly turned to me with his vibrant voice and said:\n\n\"You love this woman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I also love her.\" His eyes were bathed in tears. He remained silent\nfor a while, and continued painting.\n\n\"We have a mountain at home in Germany within which she dwells,\" he\nmurmured to himself. \"She is a demon.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe picture is finished. She insisted on paying him for it,\nmunificently, in the manner of queens.\n\n\"Oh, you have already paid me,\" he said, with a tormented smile,\nrefusing her offer.\n\nBefore he left, he secretly opened his portfolio, and let me look\ninside. I was startled. Her head looked at me as if out of a mirror\nand seemed actually to be alive.\n\n\"I shall take it along,\" he said, \"it is mine; she can't take it\naway from me. I have earned it with my heart's blood.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I am really rather sorry for the poor painter,\" she said to me to-day,\n\"it is absurd to be as virtuous as I am. Don't you think so too?\"\n\nI did not dare to reply to her.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot that I am talking with a slave; I need some fresh air,\nI want to be diverted, I want to forget.\n\n\"The carriage, quick!\"\n\nHer new dress is extravagant: Russian half-boots of violet-blue\nvelvet trimmed with ermine, and a skirt of the same material,\ndecorated with narrow stripes and rosettes of furs. Above it is an\nappropriate, close-fitting jacket, also richly trimmed and lined with\nermine. The headdress is a tall cap of ermine of the style of\nCatherine the Second, with a small aigrette, held in place by a\ndiamond-agraffe; her red hair falls loose down her back. She ascends\non the driver's seat, and holds the reins herself; I take my seat\nbehind. How she lashes on the horses! The carriage flies along like\nmad.\n\nApparently it is her intention to attract attention to-day, to make\nconquests, and she succeeds completely. She is the lioness of the\nCascine. People nod to her from carriages; on the footpath people\ngather in groups to discuss her. She pays no attention to anyone,\nexcept now and then acknowledging the greetings of elderly gentlemen\nwith a slight nod.\n\nSuddenly a young man on a lithe black horse dashes up at full speed.\nAs soon as he sees Wanda, he stops his horse and makes it walk. When\nhe is quite close, he stops entirely and lets her pass. And she too\nsees him--the lioness, the lion. Their eyes meet. She madly drives\npast him, but she cannot tear herself free from the magic power of\nhis look, and she turns her head after him.\n\nMy heart stops when I see the half-surprised, half-enraptured look\nwith which she devours him, but he is worthy of it.\n\nFor he is, indeed, a magnificent specimen of man, No, rather, he is\na man whose like I have never yet seen among the living. He is in the\nBelvedere, graven in marble, with the same slender, yet steely\nmusculature, with the same face and the same waving curls. What makes\nhim particularly beautiful is that he is beardless. If his hips were\nless narrow, one might take him for a woman in disguise. The curious\nexpression about the mouth, the lion's lip which slightly discloses\nthe teeth beneath, lends a flashing tinge of cruelty to the beautiful\nface--\n\nApollo flaying Marsyas.\n\nHe wears high black boots, closely fitting breeches of white\nleather, short fur coat of black cloth, of the kind worn by Italian\ncavalry officers, trimmed with astrakhan and many rich loops; on his\nblack locks is a red fez.\n\nI now understand the masculine Eros, and I marvel at Socrates for\nhaving remained virtuous in view of an Alcibiades like this.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have never seen my lioness so excited. Her cheeks flamed when she\nleft from the carriage at her villa. She hurried upstairs, and with\nan imperious gesture ordered me to follow.\n\nWalking up and down her room with long strides, she began to talk so\nrapidly, that I was frightened.\n\n\"You are to find out who the man in the Cascine was, immediately--\n\n\"Oh, what a man! Did you see him? What do you think of him? Tell me.\"\n\n\"The man is beautiful,\" I replied dully.\n\n\"He is so beautiful,\" she paused, supporting herself on the arm of\na chair, \"that he has taken my breath away.\"\n\n\"I can understand the impression he has made on you,\" I replied, my\nimagination carrying me away in a mad whirl. \"I am quite lost in\nadmiration myself, and I can imagine--\"\n\n\"You may imagine,\" she laughed aloud, \"that this man is my lover,\nand that he will apply the lash to you, and that you will enjoy being\npunished by him.\n\n\"But now go, go.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore evening fell, I had the desired information.\n\nWanda was still fully dressed when I returned. She reclined on the\nottoman, her face buried in her hands, her hair in a wild tangle,\nlike the red mane of a lioness.\n\n\"What is his name?\" she asked, uncanny calm.\n\n\"Alexis Papadopolis.\"\n\n\"A Greek, then,\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"He is very young?\"\n\n\"Scarcely older than you. They say he was educated in Paris, and\nthat he is an atheist. He fought against the Turks in Candia, and is\nsaid to have distinguished himself there no less by his race-hatred\nand cruelty, than by his bravery.\"\n\n\"All in all, then, a man,\" she cried with sparkling eyes.\n\n\"At present he is living in Florence,\" I continued, \"he is said to\nbe tremendously rich--\"\n\n\"I didn't ask you about that,\" she interrupted quickly and sharply.\n\"The man is dangerous. Aren't you afraid of him? I am afraid of him.\nHas he a wife?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A mistress?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What theaters does he attend?\"\n\n\"To-night he will be at the Nicolini Theater, where Virginia Marini\nand Salvini are acting; they are the greatest living artists in\nItaly, perhaps in Europe.\n\n\"See that you get a box--and be quick about it!\" she commanded.\n\n\"But, mistress--\"\n\n\"Do you want a taste of the whip?\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You can wait down in the lobby,\" she said when I had placed the\nopera-glasses and the programme on the edge of her box and adjusted\nthe footstool.\n\nI am standing there and had to lean against the wall for support so\nas not to fall down with envy and rage--no, rage isn't the right\nword; it was a mortal fear.\n\nI saw her in her box dressed in blue moire, with a huge ermine cloak\nabout her bare shoulders; he sat opposite. I saw them devour each\nother with their eyes. For both of them the stage, Goldoni's _Pamela,_\nSalvini, Marini, the public, even the entire world, were non-existant\nto-night. And I--what was I at that moment?--\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day she is attending the ball at the Greek ambassador's. Does she\nknow, that she will meet him there?\n\nAt any rate she dressed, as if she did. A heavy sea-green silk dress\nplastically encloses her divine form, leaving the bust and arms bare. In\nher hair, which is done into a single flaming knot, a white water-lily\nblossoms; from it the leaves of reeds interwoven with a few loose\nstrands fall down toward her neck. There no longer is any trace of\nagitation or trembling feverishness in her being. She is calm, so calm,\nthat I feel my blood congealing and my heart growing cold under her\nglance. Slowly, with a weary, indolent majesty, she ascends the marble\nstaircase, lets her precious wrap slide off, and listlessly enters the\nhall, where the smoke of a hundred candles has formed a silvery mist.\n\nFor a few moments my eyes follow her in a daze, then I pick up her\nfurs, which without my being aware, had slipped from my hands. They\nare still warm from her shoulders.\n\nI kiss the spot, and my eyes fill with tears.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nHe has arrived.\n\nIn his black velvet coat extravagantly trimmed with sable, he is a\nbeautiful, haughty despot who plays with the lives and souls of men.\nHe stands in the ante-room, looking around proudly, and his eyes rest\non me for an uncomfortably long time.\n\nUnder his icy glance I am again seized by a mortal fear. I have a\npresentiment that this man can enchain her, captivate her, subjugate\nher, and I feel inferior in contrast with his savage masculinity; I\nam filled with envy, with jealousy.\n\nI feel that I am a queer weakly creature of brains, merely! And what\nis most humiliating, I want to hate him, but I can't. Why is that\namong all the host of servants he has chosen me.\n\nWith an inimitably aristocratic nod of the head he calls me over to\nhim, and I--I obey his call--against my own will.\n\n\"Take my furs,\" he quickly commands.\n\nMy entire body trembles with resentment, but I obey, abjectly like\na slave.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAll night long I waited in the ante-room, raving as in a fever.\nStrange images hovered past my inner eye. I saw their meeting--their\nlong exchange of looks. I saw her float through the hall in his arms,\ndrunken, lying with half-closed lids against his breast. I saw him\nin the holy of holies of love, lying on the ottoman, not as slave,\nbut as master, and she at his feet. On my knees I served them, the\ntea-tray faltering in my hands, and I saw him reach for the whip.\nBut now the servants are talking about him.\n\nHe is a man who is like a woman; he knows that he is beautiful, and\nhe acts accordingly. He changes his clothes four or five times a day,\nlike a vain courtesan.\n\nIn Paris he appeared first in woman's dress, and the men assailed\nhim with love-letters. An Italian singer, famous equally for his art\nand his passionate intensity, even invaded his home, and lying on his\nknees before him threatened to commit suicide if he wouldn't be his.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he replied, smiling, \"I should like to do you the\nfavor, but you will have to carry out your threat, for I am a man.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe drawing-room has already thinned out to a marked degree, but she\napparently has no thought of leaving.\n\nMorning is already peering through the blinds.\n\nAt last I hear the rustling of her heavy gown which flows along\nbehind her like green waves. She advances step by step, engaged in\nconversation with him.\n\nI hardly exist for her any longer; she doesn't even trouble to give\nme an order.\n\n\"The cloak for madame,\" he commands. He, of course, doesn't think of\nlooking after her himself.\n\nWhile I put her furs about her, he stands to one side with his arms\ncrossed. While I am on my knees putting on her fur over-shoes, she\nlightly supports herself with her hand on his shoulder. She asks:\n\n\"And what about the lioness?\"\n\n\"When the lion whom she has chosen and with whom she lives is\nattacked by another,\" the Greek went on with his narrative, \"the\nlioness quietly lies down and watches the battle. Even if her mate\nis worsted she does not go to his aid. She looks on indifferently as\nhe bleeds to death under his opponent's claws, and follows the victor,\nthe stronger--that is the female's nature.\"\n\nAt this moment my lioness looked quickly and curiously at me.\n\nIt made me shudder, though I didn't know why--and the red dawn\nimmerses me and her and him in blood.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe did not go to bed, but merely threw off her ball-dress and undid\nher hair; then she ordered me to build a fire, and she sat by the\nfire-place, and stared into the flames.\n\n\"Do you need me any longer, mistress?\" I asked, my voice failed me\nat the last word.\n\nWanda shook her head.\n\nI left the room, passed through the gallery, and sat down on one of\nthe steps, leading from there down into the garden. A gentle north\nwind brought a fresh, damp coolness from the Arno, the green hills\nextended into the distance in a rosy mist, a golden haze hovered over\nthe city, over the round cupola of the Duomo.\n\nA few stars still tremble in the pale-blue sky.\n\nI tore open my coat, and pressed my burning forehead against the\nmarble. Everything that had happened so far seemed to me a mere\nchild's play; but now things were beginning to be serious, terribly\nserious.\n\nI anticipated a catastrophe, I visualized it, I could lay hold of it\nwith my hands, but I lacked the courage to meet it. My strength was\nbroken. And if I am honest with myself, neither the pains and\nsufferings that threatened me, not the humiliations that impended,\nwere the thing that frightened me.\n\nI merely felt a fear, the fear of losing her whom I loved with a\nsort of fanatical devotion; but it was so overwhelming, so crushing\nthat I suddenly began to sob like a child.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the day she remained locked in her room, and had the negress\nattend her. When the evening star rose glowing in the blue sky, I saw\nher pass through the garden, and, carefully following her at a\ndistance, watched her enter the shrine of Venus. I stealthily\nfollowed and peered through the chink in the door.\n\nShe stood before the divine image of the goddess, her hands folded\nas in prayer, and the sacred light of the star of love casts its blue\nrays over her.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn my couch at night the fear of losing her and despair took such\npowerful hold of me that they made a hero and a libertine of me. I\nlighted the little red oil-lamp which hung in the corridor beneath\na saint's image, and entered her bedroom, covering the light with one\nhand.\n\nThe lioness had been hunted and driven until she was exhausted. She\nhad fallen asleep among her pillows, lying on her back, her hands\nclenched, breathing heavily. A dream seemed to oppress her. I slowly\nwithdrew my hand, and let the red light fall full on her wonderful\nface.\n\nBut she did not awaken.\n\nI gently set the lamp on the floor, sank down beside Wanda's bed,\nand rested my head on her soft, glowing arm.\n\nShe moved slightly, but even now did not awaken. I do not know how\nlong I lay thus in the middle of the night, turned as into a stone\nby horrible torments.\n\nFinally a severe trembling seized me, and I was able to cry. My\ntears flowed over her arm. She quivered several times and finally sat\nup; she brushed her hand across her eyes, and looked at me.\n\n\"Severin,\" she exclaimed, more frightened than angry.\n\nI was unable to reply.\n\n\"Severin,\" she continued softly, \"what is the matter? Are you ill?\"\n\nHer voice sounded so sympathetic, so kind, so full of love, that it\nclutched my breast like red-hot tongs and I began to sob aloud.\n\n\"Severin,\" she began anew. \"My poor unhappy friend.\" Her hand gently\nstroked my hair. \"I am sorry, very sorry for you; but I can't help\nyou; with the best intention in the world I know of nothing that\nwould cure you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Wanda, must it be?\" I moaned in my agony.\n\n\"What, Severin? What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any more?\" I continued. \"Haven't you even a\nlittle bit of pity for me? Has the beautiful stranger taken complete\npossession of you?\"\n\n\"I cannot lie,\" she replied softly after a short pause. \"He has made\nan impression on me which I haven't yet been able to analyse, further\nthan that I suffer and tremble beneath it. It is an impression of the\nsort I have met with in the works of poets or on the stage, but I\nalways thought it was a figment of the imagination. Oh, he is a man\nlike a lion, strong and beautiful and yet gentle, not brutal like the\nmen of our northern world. I am sorry for you, Severin, I am; but I\nmust possess him. What am I saying? I must give myself to him, if he\nwill have me.\"\n\n\"Consider your reputation, Wanda, which so far has remained\nspotless,\" I exclaimed, \"even if I no longer mean anything to you.\"\n\n\"I am considering it,\" she replied, \"I intend to be strong, as long\nas it is possible, I want--\" she buried her head shyly in the pillows\n--\"I want to become his wife--if he will have me.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I cried, seized again by that mortal fear, which always\nrobs me of my breath, makes me lose possession of myself, \"you want\nto be his wife, belong to him for always. Oh! Do not drive me away!\nHe does not love you--\"\n\n\"Who says that?\" she exclaimed, flaring up.\n\n\"He does not love you,\" I went on passionately, \"but I love you, I\nadore you, I am your slave, I let you tread me underfoot, I want to\ncarry you on my arms through life.\"\n\n\"Who says that he doesn't love me?\" she interrupted vehemently.\n\n\"Oh! be mine,\" I replied, \"be mine! I cannot exist, cannot live\nwithout you. Have mercy on me, Wanda, have mercy!\"\n\nShe looked at me again, and her face had her cold heartless\nexpression, her evil smile.\n\n\"You say he doesn't love me,\" she said, scornfully. \"Very well then,\nget what consolation you can out of it.\"\n\nWith this she turned over on the other side, and contemptuously\nshowed me her back.\n\n\"Good God, are you a woman without flesh or blood, haven't you a\nheart as well as I!\" I cried, while my breast heaved convulsively.\n\n\"You know what I am,\" she replied, coldly. \"I am a woman of stone,\n_Venus in Furs_, your ideal, kneel down, and pray to me.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I implored, \"mercy!\"\n\nShe began to laugh. I buried my face in her pillows. Pain had\nloosened the floodgates of my tears and I let them flow.\n\nFor a long time silence reigned, then Wanda slowly raised herself.\n\n\"You bore me,\" she began.\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"I am tired, let me go to sleep.\"\n\n\"Mercy,\" I implored. \"Do not drive me away. No man, no one, will\nlove you as I do.\"\n\n\"Let me go to sleep,\"--she turned her back to me again.\n\nI leaped up, and snatched the poinard, which hung beside her bed,\nfrom its sheath, and placed its point against my breast.\n\n\"I shall kill myself here before your eyes,\" I murmured dully.\n\n\"Do what you please,\" Wanda replied with complete indifference. \"But\nlet me go to sleep.\" She yawned aloud. \"I am very sleepy.\"\n\nFor a moment I stood as if petrified. Then I began to laugh and cry\nat the same time. Finally I placed the poinard in my belt, and again\nfell on my knees before her.\n\n\"Wanda, listen to me, only for a few moments,\" I begged.\n\n\"I want to go to sleep! Don't you hear!\" she cried, leaping angrily\nout of bed and pushing me away with her foot. \"You forget that I am\nyour mistress?\" When I didn't budge, she seized the whip and struck\nme. I rose; she struck me again--this time right in the face.\n\n\"Wretch, slave!\"\n\nWith clenched fist held heavenward, I left her bedroom with a sudden\nresolve. She tossed the whip aside, and broke out into clear\nlaughter. I can imagine that my theatrical attitude must have been\nvery droll.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have determined to set myself free from this heartless woman, who\nhas treated me so cruelly, and is now about to break faith and betray\nme, as a reward for all my slavish devotion, for everything I have\nsuffered from her. I packed my few belongings into a bundle, and then\nwrote her as follows:\n\n\"Dear Madam,--\n\nI have loved you even to madness, I have given myself to you as no man\never has given himself to a woman. You have abused my most sacred\nemotions, and played an impudent, frivolous game with me. However, as\nlong as you were merely cruel and merciless, it was still possible for\nme to love you. Now you are about to become _cheap_. I am no longer\nthe slave whom you can kick about and whip. You yourself have set me\nfree, and I am leaving a woman I can only hate and despise.\n\nSeverin Kusiemski.\"\n\nI handed these lines to the negress, and hastened away as fast as I\ncould go. I arrived at the railway-station all out of breath.\nSuddenly I felt a sharp pain in my heart and stopped. I began to\nweep. It is humiliating that I want to flee and I can't. I turn back--\nwhither?--to her, whom I abhor, and yet, at the same time, adore.\n\nAgain I pause. I cannot go back. I dare not.\n\nBut how am I to leave Florence. I remember that I haven't any money,\nnot a penny. Very well then, on foot; it is better to be an honest\nbeggar than to eat the bread of a courtesan.\n\nBut still I can't leave.\n\nShe has my pledge, my word of honor. I have to return. Perhaps she\nwill release me.\n\nAfter a few rapid strides, I stop again.\n\nShe has my word of honor and my bond, that I shall remain her slave\nas long as she desires, until she herself gives me my freedom. But\nI might kill myself.\n\nI go through the Cascine down to the Arno, where its yellow waters\nplash monotonously about a couple of stray willows. There I sit, and\ncast up my final accounts with existence. I let my entire life pass\nbefore me in review. On the whole, it is rather a wretched affair--a\nfew joys, an endless number of indifferent and worthless things, and\nbetween these an abundant harvest of pains, miseries, fears,\ndisappointments, shipwrecked hopes, afflictions, sorrow and grief.\n\nI thought of my mother, whom I loved so deeply and whom I had to\nwatch waste away beneath a horrible disease; of my brother, who full\nof the promise of joy and happiness died in the flower of youth,\nwithout even having put his lips to the cup of life. I thought of my\ndead nurse, my childhood playmates, the friends that had striven and\nstudied with me; of all those, covered by the cold, dead, indifferent\nearth. I thought of my turtle-dove, who not infrequently made his\ncooing bows to me, instead of to his mate.--All have returned, dust\nunto dust.\n\nI laughed aloud, and slid down into the water, but at the same\nmoment I caught hold of one of the willow-branches, hanging above the\nyellow waves. As in a vision, I see the woman who has caused all my\nmisery. She hovers above the level of the water, luminous in the\nsunlight as though she were transparent, with red flames about her\nhead and neck. She turns her face toward me and smiles.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI am back again, dripping, wet through, glowing with shame and\nfever. The negress has delivered my letter; I am judged, lost, in the\npower of a heartless, affronted woman.\n\nWell, let her kill me. I am unable to do it myself, and yet I have\nno wish to go on living.\n\nAs I walk around the house, she is standing in the gallery, leaning\nover the railing. Her face is full in the light of the sun, and her\ngreen eyes sparkle.\n\n\"Still alive?\" she asked, without moving. I stood silent, with bowed\nhead.\n\n\"Give me back my poinard,\" she continued. \"It is of no use to you.\nYou haven't even the courage to take your own life.\"\n\n\"I have lost it,\" I replied, trembling, shaken by chills.\n\nShe looked me over with a proud, scornful glance.\n\n\"I suppose you lost it in the Arno?\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"No\nmatter. Well, and why didn't you leave?\"\n\nI mumbled something which neither she nor I myself could understand.\n\n\"Oh! you haven't any money,\" she cried. \"Here!\" With an\nindescribably disdainful gesture she tossed me her purse.\n\nI did not pick it up.\n\nBoth of us were silent for some time.\n\n\"You don't want to leave then?\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWanda drives in the Cascine without me, and goes to the theater\nwithout me; she receives company, and the negress serves her. No one\nasks after me. I stray about the garden, irresolutely, like an animal\nthat has lost its master.\n\nLying among the bushes, I watch a couple of sparrows, fighting over\na seed.\n\nSuddenly I hear the swish of a woman's dress.\n\nWanda approaches in a gown of dark silk, modestly closed up to the\nneck; the Greek is with her. They are in an eager discussion, but I\ncannot as yet understand a word of what they are saying. He stamps\nhis foot so that the gravel scatters about in all directions, and he\nlashes the air with his riding whip. Wanda startles.\n\nIs she afraid that he will strike her?\n\nHave they gone that far?\n\nHe has left her, she calls him; he does not hear her, does not want\nto hear her.\n\nWanda sadly lowers her head, and then sits down on the nearest\nstone-bench. She sits for a long time, lost in thought. I watch her with\na sort of malevolent pleasure, finally I pull myself together by sheer\nforce of will, and ironically step before her. She startles, and\ntrembles all over.\n\n\"I come to wish you happiness,\" I said, bowing, \"I see, my dear\nlady, too, has found a master.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank God!\" she exclaimed, \"not a new slave, I have had enough\nof them. A master! Woman needs a master, and she adores him.\"\n\n\"You adore him, Wanda?\" I cried, \"this brutal person--\"\n\n\"Yes, I love him, as I have never loved any one else.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I clenched my fists, but tears already filled my eyes, and\nI was seized by the delirium of passion, as by a sweet madness. \"Very\nwell, take him as your husband, let him be your master, but I want\nto remain your slave, as long as I live.\"\n\n\"You want to remain my slave, even then?\" she said, \"that would be\ninteresting, but I am afraid he wouldn't permit it.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is already jealous of you,\" she exclaimed, \"he, of you! He\ndemanded that I dismiss you immediately, and when I told him who you\nwere--\"\n\n\"You told him--\" I repeated, thunderstruck.\n\n\"I told him everything,\" she replied, \"our whole story, all your\nqueerness, everything--and he, instead of being amused, grew angry,\nand stamped his foot.\"\n\n\"And threatened to strike you?\"\n\nWanda looked to the ground, and remained silent.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" I said with mocking bitterness, \"you are afraid of\nhim, Wanda!\" I threw myself down at her feet, and in my agitation\nembraced her knees. \"I don't want anything of you, except to be your\nslave, to be always near you! I will be your dog-\"\n\n\"Do you know, you bore me?\" said Wanda, indifferently.\n\nI leaped up. Everything within me was seething.\n\n\"You are now no longer cruel, but cheap,\" I said, clearly and\ndistinctly, accentuating every word.\n\n\"You have already written that in your letter,\" Wanda replied, with\na proud shrug of the shoulders. \"A man of brains should never repeat\nhimself.\"\n\n\"The way you are treating me,\" I broke out, \"what would you call it?\"\n\n\"I might punish you,\" she replied ironically, \"but I prefer this\ntime to reply with reasons instead of lashes. You have no right to\naccuse me. Haven't I always been honest with you? Haven't I warned\nyou more than once? Didn't I love you with all my heart, even\npassionately, and did I conceal the fact from you, that it was\ndangerous to give yourself into my power, to abase yourself before\nme, and that I want to be dominated? But you wished to be my\nplaything, my slave! You found the highest pleasure in feeling the\nfoot, the whip of an arrogant, cruel woman. What do you want now?\n\n\"Dangerous potentialities were slumbering in me, but you were the\nfirst to awaken them. If I now take pleasure in torturing you,\nabusing you, it is your fault; you have made of me what I now am, and\nnow you are even unmanly, weak, and miserable enough to accuse me.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am guilty,\" I said, \"but haven't I suffered because of it?\nLet us put an end now to the cruel game.\"\n\n\"That is my wish, too,\" she replied with a curious deceitful look.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I exclaimed violently, \"don't drive me to extremes; you see\nthat I am a man again.\"\n\n\"A fire of straw,\" she replied, \"which makes a lot of stir for a\nmoment, and goes out as quickly as it flared up. You imagine you can\nintimidate me, and you only make yourself ridiculous. Had you been\nthe man I first thought you were, serious, reserved, stern, I would\nhave loved you faithfully, and become your wife. Woman demands that\nshe can look up to a man, but one like you who voluntarily places his\nneck under her foot, she uses as a welcome plaything, only to toss\nit aside when she is tired of it.\"\n\n\"Try to toss me aside,\" I said, jeeringly. \"Some toys are dangerous.\"\n\n\"Don't challenge me,\" exclaimed Wanda. Her eyes began to flash, and\na flush entered her cheeks.\n\n\"If you won't be mine now,\" I continued, with a voice stifled with\nrage, \"no one else shall possess you either.\"\n\n\"What play is this from?\" she mocked, seizing me by the breast. She\nwas pale with anger at this moment. \"Don't challenge me,\" she\ncontinued, \"I am not cruel, but I don't know whether I may not become\nso and whether then there will be any bounds.\"\n\n\"What worse can you do, than to make your lover, your husband?\" I\nexclaimed, more and more enraged.\n\n\"I might make you _his_ slave,\" she replied quickly, \"are you not in\nmy power? Haven't I the agreement? But, of course, you will merely\ntake pleasure in it, if I have you bound, and say to him.\n\n\"Do with him what you please.\"\n\n\"Woman, are you mad!\" I cried.\n\n\"I am entirely rational,\" she said, calmly. \"I warn you for the last\ntime. Don't offer any resistance, one who has gone as far as I have\ngone might easily go still further. I feel a sort of hatred for you,\nand would find a real joy in seeing him beat you to death; I am still\nrestraining myself, but--\"\n\nScarcely master of myself any longer, I seized her by the wrist and\nforced her to the ground, so that she lay on her knees before me.\n\n\"Severin!\" she cried. Rage and terror were painted on her face.\n\n\"I shall kill you if you marry him,\" I threatened; the words came\nhoarsely and dully from my breast. \"You are mine, I won't let you go,\nI love you too much.\" Then I clutched her and pressed her close to\nme; my right hand involuntarily seized the dagger which I still had\nin my belt.\n\nWanda fixed a large, calm, incomprehensible look on me.\n\n\"I like you that way,\" she said, carelessly. \"Now you are a man, and\nat this moment I know I still love you.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I wept with rapture, and bent down over her, covering her\ndear face with kisses, and she, suddenly breaking into a loud gay\nlaugh, said, \"Have you finished with your ideal now, are you\nsatisfied with me?\"\n\n\"You mean?\" I stammered, \"that you weren't serious?\"\n\n\"I am very serious,\" she gaily continued. \"I love you, only you, and\nyou--you foolish, little man, didn't know that everything was only\nmake-believe and play-acting. How hard it often was for me to strike\nyou with the whip, when I would have rather taken your head and\ncovered it with kisses. But now we are through with that, aren't we?\nI have played my cruel role better than you expected, and now you\nwill be satisfied with my being a good, little wife who isn't\naltogether unattractive. Isn't that so? We will live like rational\npeople--\"\n\n\"You will marry me!\" I cried, overflowing with happiness.\n\n\"Yes--marry you--you dear, darling man,\" whispered Wanda, kissing my\nhands.\n\nI drew her up to my breast.\n\n\"Now, you are no longer Gregor, my slave,\" said she, \"but Severin,\nthe dear man I love--\"\n\n\"And he--you don't love him?\" I asked in agitation.\n\n\"How could you imagine my loving a man of his brutal type? You were\nblind to everything, I was really afraid for you.\"\n\n\"I almost killed myself for your sake.\"\n\n\"Really?\" she cried, \"ah, I still tremble at the thought, that you\nwere already in the Arno.\"\n\n\"But you saved me,\" I replied, tenderly. \"You hovered over the\nwaters and smiled, and your smile called me back to life.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have a curious feeling when I now hold her in my arms and she lies\nsilently against my breast and lets me kiss her and smiles. I feel\nlike one who has suddenly awakened out of a feverish delirium, or\nlike a shipwrecked man who has for many days battled with waves that\nmomentarily threatened to devour him and finally has found a safe\nshore.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hate this Florence, where you have been so unhappy,\" she\ndeclared, as I was saying good-night to her. \"I want to leave\nimmediately, tomorrow, you will be good enough to write a couple of\nletters for me, and, while you are doing that, I will drive to the\ncity to pay my farewell visits. Is that satisfactory to you?\"\n\n\"Of course, you dear, sweet, beautiful woman.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly in the morning she knocked at my door to ask how I had slept.\nHer tenderness is positively wonderful. I should never have believed\nthat she could be so tender.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe has now been gone for over four hours. I have long since\nfinished the letters, and am now sitting in the gallery, looking down\nthe street to see whether I cannot discover her carriage in the\ndistance. I am a little worried about her, and yet I know there is\nno reason under heaven why I should doubt or fear. However, a feeling\nof oppression weighs me down, and I cannot rid myself of it. It is\nprobably the sufferings of the past days, which still cast their\nshadows into my soul.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe is back, radiant with happiness and contentment.\n\n\"Well, has everything gone as you wished?\" I asked tenderly, kissing\nher hand.\n\n\"Yes, dear heart,\" she replied, \"and we shall leave to-night. Help\nme pack my trunks.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nToward evening she asked me to go to the post-office and mail her\nletters myself. I took her carriage, and was back within an hour.\n\n\"Mistress has asked for you,\" said the negress, with a grin, as I\nascended the wide marble stairs.\n\n\"Has anyone been here?\"\n\n\"No one,\" she replied, crouching down on the steps like a black cat.\n\nI slowly passed through the drawing-room, and then stood before her\nbedroom door.\n\nWhy does my heart beat so? Am I not perfectly happy?\n\nOpening the door softly, I draw back the portiere. Wanda is lying on\nthe ottoman, and does not seem to notice me. How beautiful she looks,\nin her silver-gray dress, which fits closely, and while displaying\nin tell-tale fashion her splendid figure, leaves her wonderful bust\nand arms bare.\n\nHer hair is interwoven with, and held up by a black velvet ribbon.\nA mighty fire is burning in the fire-place, the hanging lamp casts\na reddish glow, and the whole room is as if drowned in blood.\n\n\"Wanda,\" I said at last.\n\n\"Oh Severin,\" she cried out joyously. \"I have been impatiently\nwaiting for you.\" She leaped up, and folded me in her arms. She sat\ndown again on the rich cushions and tried to draw me down to her\nside, but I softly slid down to her feet and placed my head in her\nlap.\n\n\"Do you know I am very much in love with you to-day?\" she whispered,\nbrushing a few stray hairs from my forehead and kissing my eyes.\n\n\"How beautiful your eyes are, I have always loved them as the best\nof you, but to-day they fairly intoxicate me. I am all--\" She\nextended her magnificent limbs and tenderly looked at me from beneath\nher red lashes.\n\n\"And you--you are cold--you hold me like a block of wood; wait, I'll\nstir you with the fire of love,\" she said, and again clung fawningly\nand caressingly to my lips.\n\n\"I no longer please you; I suppose I'll have to be cruel to you\nagain, evidently I have been too kind to you to-day. Do you know, you\nlittle fool, what I shall do, I shall whip you for a while--\"\n\n\"But child--\"\n\n\"I want to.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Come, let me bind you,\" she continued, and ran gaily through the\nroom. \"I want to see you very much in love, do you understand? Here\nare the ropes. I wonder if I can still do it?\"\n\nShe began with fettering my feet and then she tied my hands behind\nmy back, pinioning my arms like those of a prisoner.\n\n\"So,\" she said, with gay eagerness. \"Can you still move?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Fine--\"\n\nShe then tied a noose in a stout rope, threw it over my head, and\nlet it slip down as far as the hips. She drew it tight, and bound me\nto a pillar.\n\nA curious tremor seized me at that moment.\n\n\"I have a feeling as if I were about to be executed,\" I said with a\nlow voice.\n\n\"Well, you shall have a thorough punishment to-day,\" exclaimed Wanda.\n\n\"But put on your fur-jacket, please,\" I said.\n\n\"I shall gladly give you that pleasure,\" she replied. She got her\n_kazabaika_, and put it on. Then she stood in front of me with\nher arms folded across her chest, and looked at me out of half-closed\neyes.\n\n\"Do you remember the story of the ox of Dionysius?\" she asked.\n\n\"I remember it only vaguely, what about it?\"\n\n\"A courtier invented a new implement of torture for the Tyrant of\nSyracuse. It was an iron ox in which those condemned to death were\nto be shut, and then pushed into a mighty furnace.\n\n\"As soon as the iron ox began to get hot, and the condemned person\nbegan to cry out in his torment, his wails sounded like the bellowing\nof an ox.\n\n\"Dionysius nodded graciously to the inventor, and to put his\ninvention to an immediate test had him shut up in the iron ox.\n\n\"It is a very instructive story.\n\n\"It was you who innoculated me with selfishness, pride, and cruelty,\nand _you shall be their first victim._ I now literally enjoy having a\nhuman being that thinks and feels and desires like myself in my power;\nI love to abuse a man who is stronger in intelligence and body than I,\nespecially a man who loves me.\n\n\"Do you still love me?\"\n\n\"Even to madness,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"So much the better,\" she replied, \"and so much the more will you\nenjoy what I am about to do with you now.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" I asked. \"I don't understand you,\nthere is a gleam of real cruelty in your eyes to-day, and you are\nstrangely beautiful--completely _Venus in Furs.\"_\n\nWithout replying Wanda placed her arms around my neck and kissed me.\nI was again seized by my fanatical passion.\n\n\"Where is the whip?\" I asked.\n\nWanda laughed, and withdrew a couple of steps.\n\n\"You really insist upon being punished?\" she exclaimed, proudly\ntossing back her head.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSuddenly Wanda's face was completely transformed. It was as if\ndisfigured by rage; for a moment she seemed even ugly to me.\n\n\"Very well, then _you_ whip him!\" she called loudly.\n\nAt the same instant the beautiful Greek stuck his head of black\ncurls through the curtains of her four-poster bed. At first I was\nspeechless, petrified. There was a horribly comic element in the\nsituation. I would have laughed aloud, had not my position been at\nthe same time so terribly cruel and humiliating.\n\nIt went beyond anything I had imagined. A cold shudder ran down my\nback, when my rival stepped from the bed in his riding boots, his\ntight-fitting white breeches, and his short velvet jacket, and I saw\nhis athletic limbs.\n\n\"You are indeed cruel,\" he said, turning to Wanda.\n\n\"Only inordinately fond of pleasure,\" she replied with a wild sort\nof humor. \"Pleasure alone lends value to existence; whoever enjoys\ndoes not easily part from life, whoever suffers or is needy meets\ndeath like a friend.\n\n\"But whoever wants to enjoy must take life gaily in the sense of the\nancient world; he dare not hesitate to enjoy at the expense of others;\nhe must never feel pity; he must be ready to harness others to his\ncarriage or his plough as though they were animals. He must know how to\nmake slaves of men who feel and would enjoy as he does, and use them for\nhis service and pleasure without remorse. It is not his affair whether\nthey like it, or whether they go to rack and ruin. He must always\nremember this, that if they had him in their power, as he has them they\nwould act in exactly the same way, and he would have to pay for their\npleasure with his sweat and blood and soul. That was the world of the\nancients: pleasure and cruelty, liberty and slavery went hand in hand.\nPeople who want to live like the gods of Olympus must of necessity have\nslaves whom they can toss into their fish-ponds, and gladiators who will\ndo battle, the while they banquet, and they must not mind if by chance a\nbit of blood bespatters them.\"\n\nHer words brought back my complete self-possession.\n\n\"Unloosen me!\" I exclaimed angrily.\n\n\"Aren't you my slave, my property?\" replied Wanda. \"Do you want me\nto show you the agreement?\"\n\n\"Untie me!\" I threatened, \"otherwise--\" I tugged at the ropes.\n\n\"Can he tear himself free?\" she asked. \"He has threatened to kill me.\"\n\n\"Be entirely at ease,\" said the Greek, testing my fetters.\n\n\"I shall call for help,\" I began again.\n\n\"No one will hear you,\" replied Wanda, \"and no one will hinder me\nfrom abusing your most sacred emotions or playing a frivolous game\nwith you.\" she continued, repeating with satanic mockery phrases from\nmy letter to her.\n\n\"Do you think I am at this moment merely cruel and merciless, or am\nI also about to become cheap? What? Do you still love me, or do you\nalready hate and despise me? Here is the whip--\" She handed it to the\nGreek who quickly stepped closer.\n\n\"Don't you dare!\" I exclaimed, trembling with indignation, \"I won't\npermit it--\"\n\n\"Oh, because I don't wear furs,\" the Greek replied with an ironical\nsmile, and he took his short sable from the bed.\n\n\"You are adorable,\" exclaimed Wanda, kissing him, and helping him\ninto his furs.\n\n\"May I really whip him?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do with him what you please,\" replied Wanda.\n\n\"Beast!\" I exclaimed, utterly revolted.\n\nThe Greek fixed his cold tigerish look upon me and tried out the\nwhip. His muscles swelled when he drew back his arms, and made the\nwhip hiss through the air. I was bound like Marsyas while Apollo was\ngetting ready to flay me.\n\nMy look wandered about the room and remained fixed on the ceiling,\nwhere Samson, lying at Delilah's feet, was about to have his eyes put\nout by the Philistines. The picture at that moment seemed to me like\na symbol, an eternal parable of passion and lust, of the love of man\nfor woman. \"Each one of us in the end is a Samson,\" I thought, \"and\nultimately for better or worse is betrayed by the woman he loves,\nwhether he wears an ordinary coat or sables.\"\n\n\"Now watch me break him in,\" said the Greek. He showed his teeth,\nand his face acquired the blood-thirsty expression, which startled\nme the first time I saw him.\n\nAnd he began to apply the lash--so mercilessly, with such frightful\nforce that I quivered under each blow, and began to tremble all over\nwith pain. Tears rolled down over my cheeks. In the meantime Wanda\nlay on the ottoman in her fur-jacket, supporting herself on her arm;\nshe looked on with cruel curiosity, and was convulsed with laughter.\n\nThe sensation of being whipped by a successful rival before the eyes\nof an adored woman cannot be described. I almost went mad with shame\nand despair.\n\nWhat was most humiliating was that at first I felt a certain wild,\nsupersensual stimulation under Apollo's whip and the cruel laughter\nof my Venus, no matter how horrible my position was. But Apollo\nwhipped on and on, blow after blow, until I forgot all about poetry,\nand finally gritted my teeth in impotent rage, and cursed my wild\ndreams, woman, and love.\n\nAll of a sudden I saw with horrible clarity whither blind passion\nand lust have led man, ever since Holofernes and Agamemnon--into a\nblind alley, into the net of woman's treachery, into misery, slavery,\nand death.\n\nIt was as though I were awakening from a dream.\n\nBlood was already flowing under the whip. I wound like a worm that\nis trodden on, but he whipped on without mercy, and she continued to\nlaugh without mercy. In the meantime she locked her packed trunk and\nslipped into her travelling furs, and was still laughing, when she\nwent downstairs on his arm and entered the carriage.\n\nThen everything was silent for a moment.\n\nI listened breathlessly.\n\nThe carriage door slammed, the horse began to pull--the rolling of\nthe carriage for a short time--then all was over.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment I thought of taking vengeance, of killing him, but I\nwas bound by the abominable agreement. So nothing was left for me to\ndo except to keep my pledged word and grit my teeth.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nMy first impulse after this, the most cruel catastrophe of my life,\nwas to seek laborious tasks, dangers, and privations. I wanted to\nbecome a soldier and go to Asia or Algiers, but my father was old and\nill and wanted me.\n\nSo I quietly returned home and for two years helped him bear his\nburdens, and learned how to look after the estate which I had never\ndone before. To _labor_ and to _do my duty_ was comforting like a\ndrink of fresh water. Then my father died, and I inherited the estate,\nbut it meant no change.\n\nI had put on my own Spanish boots and went on living just as\nrationally as if the old man were standing behind me, looking over\nmy shoulder with his large wise eyes.\n\nOne day a box arrived, accompanied by a letter. I recognized Wanda's\nwriting.\n\nCuriously moved, I opened it, and read.\n\n\"Sir.--\n\nNow that over three years have passed since that night in Florence,\nI suppose, I may confess to you that I loved you deeply. You\nyourself, however, stifled my love by your fantastic devotion and\nyour insane passion. From the moment that you became my slave, I knew\nit would be impossible for you ever to become my husband. However,\nI found it interesting to have you realize your ideal in my own person,\nand, while I gloriously amused myself, perhaps, to cure you.\n\nI found the strong man for whom I felt a need, and I was as happy\nwith him as, I suppose, it is possible for any one to be on this\nfunny ball of clay.\n\nBut my happiness, like all things mortal, was of short duration.\nAbout a year ago he fell in a duel, and since then I have been living\nin Paris, like an Aspasia--\n\nAnd you?--Your life surely is not without its sunshine, if you have\ngained control of your imagination, and those qualities in you have\nmaterialized, which at first so attracted me to you--your clarity of\nintellect, kindness of heart, and, above all else, your--_moral\nseriousness_.\n\nI hope you have been cured under my whip; the cure was cruel, but\nradical. In memory of that time and of a woman who loved you\npassionately, I am sending you the portrait by the poor German.\n\n_Venus in Furs_.\"\n\nI had to smile, and as I fell to musing the beautiful woman suddenly\nstood before me in her velvet jacket trimmed with ermine, with the\nwhip in her hand. And I continued to smile at the woman I had once\nloved so insanely, at the fur-jacket that had once so entranced me,\nat the whip, and ended by smiling at myself and saying: The cure was\ncruel, but radical; but the main point is, I have been cured.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And the moral of the story?\" I said to Severin when I put the\nmanuscript down on the table.\n\n\"That I was a donkey,\" he exclaimed without turning around, for he\nseemed to be embarrassed. \"If only I had beaten her!\"\n\n\"A curious remedy,\" I exclaimed, \"which might answer with your\npeasant-women--\"\n\n\"Oh, they are used to it,\" he replied eagerly, \"but imagine the\neffect upon one of our delicate, nervous, hysterical ladies--\"\n\n\"But the moral?\"\n\n\"That woman, as nature has created her and as man is at present\neducating her, is his enemy. She can only be his slave or his despot,\nbut _never his companion._ This she can become only when she has\nthe same rights as he, and is his equal in education and work.\n\n\"At present we have only the choice of being hammer or anvil, and I\nwas the kind of donkey who let a woman make a slave of him, do you\nunderstand?\n\n\"The moral of the tale is this: whoever allows himself to be\nwhipped, deserves to be whipped.\n\n\"The blows, as you see, have agreed with me; the roseate supersensual\nmist has dissolved, and no one can ever make me believe again that\nthese 'sacred apes of Benares' [Footnote: One of Schopenhauer's\ndesignations for women.] or Plato's rooster [Footnote: Diogenes\nthrew a plucked rooster into Plato's school and exclaimed: \"Here\nyou have Plato's human being.\"] are the image of God.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Venus in Furs, by Ritter von Leopold Sacher-Masoch\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VENUS IN FURS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6852-8.txt or 6852-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/6/8/5/6852/\n\nProduced by Avinash Kothare, Tom Allen, Tiffany Vergon,\nCharles Aldarondo, Charles Franks and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\nChief Executive and Director\ngbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/722294", "artist_names": "Idina Menzel (Ft.

"lyrics": "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (Chap. 2) LyricsUncle Charles smoked such black twist that at last his nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke in a little outhouse at the end of the garden.\n\n\u2014Very good, Simon. All serene, Simon, said the old man tranquilly. Anywhere you like. The outhouse will do me nicely: it will be more salubrious.\n\n\u2014Damn me, said Mr Dedalus frankly, if I know how you can smoke such villainous awful tobacco. It's like gunpowder, by God.\n\n\u2014It's very nice, Simon, replied the old man. Very cool and mollifying.\n\nEvery morning, therefore, uncle Charles repaired to his outhouse but not before he had greased and brushed scrupulously his back hair and brushed and put on his tall hat. While he smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his pipe were just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door. His arbour, as he called the reeking outhouse which he shared with the cat and the garden tools, served him also as a sounding-box: and every morning he hummed contentedly one of his favourite songs: O, TWINE ME A BOWER or BLUE EYES AND GOLDEN HAIR or THE GROVES OF BLARNEY while the grey and blue coils of smoke rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air.\n\nDuring the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle Charles was Stephen's constant companion. Uncle Charles was a hale old man with a well tanned skin, rugged features and white side whiskers. On week days he did messages between the house in Carysfort Avenue and those shops in the main street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen was glad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles helped him very liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open boxes and barrels outside the counter. He would seize a handful of grapes and sawdust or three or four American apples and thrust them generously into his grandnephew's hand while the shopman smiled uneasily; and, on Stephen's feigning reluctance to take them, he would frown and say:\n\u2014Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They're good for your bowels.\n\nWhen the order list had been booked the two would go on to the park where an old friend of Stephen's father, Mike Flynn, would be found seated on a bench, waiting for them. Then would begin Stephen's run round the park. Mike Flynn would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees well lifted and his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning practice was over the trainer would make his comments and sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoes. A small ring of wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often glanced at his trainer's flabby stubble-covered face, as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the mild lustreless blue eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze vaguely into the blue distance while the long swollen fingers ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back into the pouch.\n\nOn the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to the chapel and, as the font was above Stephen's reach, the old man would dip his hand and then sprinkle the water briskly about Stephen's clothes and on the floor of the porch. While he prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his breath from a thumb blackened prayer book wherein catchwords were printed at the foot of every page. Stephen knelt at his side respecting, though he did not share, his piety. He often wondered what his grand-uncle prayed for so seriously. Perhaps he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of a happy death or perhaps he prayed that God might send him back a part of the big fortune he had squandered in Cork.\n\nOn Sundays Stephen with his father and his grand-uncle took their constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in spite of his corns and often ten or twelve miles of the road were covered. The little village of Stillorgan was the parting of the ways. Either they went to the left towards the Dublin mountains or along the Goatstown road and thence into Dundrum, coming home by Sandyford. Trudging along the road or standing in some grimy wayside public house his elders spoke constantly of the subjects nearer their hearts, of Irish politics, of Munster and of the legends of their own family, to all of which Stephen lent an avid ear. Words which he did not understand he said over and over to himself till he had learnt them by heart: and through them he had glimpses of the real world about them. The hour when he too would take part in the life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret he began to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the nature of which he only dimly apprehended.\n\nHis evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged translation of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. The figure of that dark avenger stood forth in his mind for whatever he had heard or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible. At night he built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island cave out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured tissue paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in which chocolate is wrapped. When he had broken up this scenery, weary of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright picture of Marseille, of sunny trellises, and of Mercedes.\n\nOutside Blackrock, on the road that led to the mountains, stood a small whitewashed house in the garden of which grew many rosebushes: and in this house, he told himself, another Mercedes lived. Both on the outward and on the homeward journey he measured distance by this landmark: and in his imagination he lived through a long train of adventures, marvellous as those in the book itself, towards the close of which there appeared an image of himself, grown older and sadder, standing in a moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many years before slighted his love, and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal, saying:\n\n\u2014Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes.\n\nHe became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and founded with him a gang of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey carried a whistle dangling from his buttonhole and a bicycle lamp attached to his belt while the others had short sticks thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who had read of Napoleon's plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned and thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel with his lieutenant before giving orders. The gang made forays into the gardens of old maids or went down to the castle and fought a battle on the shaggy weed-grown rocks, coming home after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of the foreshore in their nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack upon their hands and in their hair.\n\nAubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often they drove out in the milk-car to Carrickmines where the cows were at grass. While the men were milking the boys would take turns in riding the tractable mare round the field. But when autumn came the cows were driven home from the grass: and the first sight of the filthy cowyard at Stradbrook with its foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming bran troughs, sickened Stephen's heart. The cattle which had seemed so beautiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could not even look at the milk they yielded.\n\nThe coming of September did not trouble him this year for he was not to be sent back to Clongowes. The practice in the park came to an end when Mike Flynn went into hospital. Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more nightly forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went round with the car which delivered the evening milk and these chilly drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cow hairs and hayseeds on the milkman's coat. Whenever the car drew up before a house he waited to catch a glimpse of a well scrubbed kitchen or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the servant would hold the jug and how she would close the door. He thought it should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowledge which had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubble-covered face as it bent heavily over his long stained fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the reason why he himself had not been sent back to Clongowes. For some time he had felt the slight change in his house; and those changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and rattling behind him.\n\nHe returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her image, a strange unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever gathered within him and led him to rove alone in the evening along the quiet avenue. The peace of the gardens and the kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his restless heart. The noise of children at play annoyed him and their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than he had felt at Clongowes, that he was different from others. He did not want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld. He did not know where to seek it or how, but a premonition which led him on told him that this image would, without any overt act of his, encounter him. They would meet quietly as if they had known each other and had made their tryst, perhaps at one of the gates or in some more secret place. They would be alone, surrounded by darkness and silence: and in that moment of supreme tenderness he would be transfigured.\n\nHe would fade into something impalpable under her eyes and then in a moment he would be transfigured. Weakness and timidity and inexperience would fall from him in that magic moment.\n\n\nTwo great yellow caravans had halted one morning before the door and men had come tramping into the house to dismantle it. The furniture had been hustled out through the front garden which was strewn with wisps of straw and rope ends and into the huge vans at the gate. When all had been safely stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue: and from the window of the railway carriage, in which he had sat with his red-eyed mother, Stephen had seen them lumbering along the Merrion Road.\n\nThe parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Dedalus rested the poker against the bars of the grate to attract the flame. Uncle Charles dozed in a corner of the half furnished uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits leaned against the wall. The lamp on the table shed a weak light over the boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the van-men. Stephen sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a long and incoherent monologue. He understood little or nothing of it at first but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies and that some fight was going to take place. He felt, too, that he was being enlisted for the fight, that some duty was being laid upon his shoulders. The sudden flight from the comfort and revery of Blackrock, the passage through the gloomy foggy city, the thought of the bare cheerless house in which they were now to live made his heart heavy, and again an intuition, a foreknowledge of the future came to him. He understood also why the servants had often whispered together in the hall and why his father had often stood on the hearthrug with his back to the fire, talking loudly to uncle Charles who urged him to sit down and eat his dinner.\n\n\u2014There's a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen, old chap, said Mr Dedalus, poking at the dull fire with fierce energy. We're not dead yet, sonny. No, by the Lord Jesus (God forgive me) not half dead.\n\nDublin was a new and complex sensation. Uncle Charles had grown so witless that he could no longer be sent out on errands and the disorder in settling in the new house left Stephen freer than he had been in Blackrock. In the beginning he contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring square or, at most, going half way down one of the side streets but when he had made a skeleton map of the city in his mind he followed boldly one of its central lines until he reached the customhouse. He passed unchallenged among the docks and along the quays wondering at the multitude of corks that lay bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick yellow scum, at the crowds of quay porters and the rumbling carts and the ill-dressed bearded policeman. The vastness and strangeness of the life suggested to him by the bales of merchandise stocked along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds of steamers wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him wandering in the evening from garden to garden in search of Mercedes. And amid this new bustling life he might have fancied himself in another Marseille but that he missed the bright sky and the sum-warmed trellises of the wineshops. A vague dissatisfaction grew up within him as he looked on the quays and on the river and on the lowering skies and yet he continued to wander up and down day after day as if he really sought someone that eluded him.\n\nHe went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives: and though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and adorned for Christmas his mood of embittered silence did not leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many, remote and near. He was angry with himself for being young and the prey of restless foolish impulses, angry also with the change of fortune which was reshaping the world about him into a vision of squalor and insincerity. Yet his anger lent nothing to the vision. He chronicled with patience what he saw, detaching himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret.\n\nHe was sitting on the backless chair in his aunt's kitchen. A lamp with a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fireplace and by its light his aunt was reading the evening paper that lay on her knees. She looked a long time at a smiling picture that was set in it and said musingly:\n\n\u2014The beautiful Mabel Hunter!\n\nA ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and said softly:\n\n\u2014What is she in, mud?\n\n\u2014In a pantomime, love.\n\nThe child leaned her ringletted head against her mother's sleeve, gazing on the picture, and murmured as if fascinated:\n\n\u2014The beautiful Mabel Hunter!\n\nAs if fascinated, her eyes rested long upon those demurely taunting eyes and she murmured devotedly:\n\u2014Isn't she an exquisite creature?\n\nAnd the boy who came in from the street, stamping crookedly under his stone of coal, heard her words. He dropped his load promptly on the floor and hurried to her side to see. He mauled the edges of the paper with his reddened and blackened hands, shouldering her aside and complaining that he could not see.\n\nHe was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the old dark-windowed house. The firelight flickered on the wall and beyond the window a spectral dusk was gathering upon the river. Before the fire an old woman was busy making tea and, as she bustled at the task, she told in a low voice of what the priest and the doctor had said. She told too of certain changes they had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and sayings. He sat listening to the words and following the ways of adventure that lay open in the coals, arches and vaults and winding galleries and jagged caverns.\n\nSuddenly he became aware of something in the doorway. A skull appeared suspended in the gloom of the doorway. A feeble creature like a monkey was there, drawn thither by the sound of voices at the fire. A whining voice came from the door asking:\n\n\u2014Is that Josephine?\n\nThe old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fireplace:\n\n\u2014No, Ellen, it's Stephen.\n\n\u2014O... O, good evening, Stephen.\n\nHe answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break over the face in the doorway.\n\n\u2014Do you want anything, Ellen? asked the old woman at the fire.\n\nBut she did not answer the question and said:\n\n\u2014I thought it was Josephine. I thought you were Josephine, Stephen.\n\nAnd, repeating this several times, she fell to laughing feebly.\n\nHe was sitting in the midst of a children's party at Harold's Cross. His silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he took little part in the games. The children, wearing the spoils of their crackers, danced and romped noisily and, though he tried to share their merriment, he felt himself a gloomy figure amid the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets.\n\nBut when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug corner of the room he began to taste the joy of his loneliness. The mirth, which in the beginning of the evening had seemed to him false and trivial, was like a soothing air to him, passing gaily by his senses, hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and amid the music and laughter her glance travelled to his corner, flattering, taunting, searching, exciting his heart.\n\nIn the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting on their things: the party was over. She had thrown a shawl about her and, as they went together towards the tram, sprays of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled head and her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road.\n\nIt was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green light of the lamp. On the empty seats of the tram were scattered a few coloured tickets. No sound of footsteps came up or down the road. No sound broke the peace of the night save when the lank brown horses rubbed their noses together and shook their bells.\n\nThey seemed to listen, he on the upper step and she on the lower. She came up to his step many times and went down to hers again between their phrases and once or twice stood close beside him for some moments on the upper step, forgetting to go down, and then went down. His heart danced upon her movements like a cork upon a tide. He heard what her eyes said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim past, whether in life or revery, he had heard their tale before. He saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress and sash and long black stockings, and knew that he had yielded to them a thousand times. Yet a voice within him spoke above the noise of his dancing heart, asking him would he take her gift to which he had only to stretch out his hand. And he remembered the day when he and Eileen had stood looking into the hotel grounds, watching the waiters running up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and the fox terrier scampering to and fro on the sunny lawn and how, all of a sudden, she had broken out into a peal of laughter and had run down the sloping curve of the path. Now, as then, he stood listlessly in his place, seemingly a tranquil watcher of the scene before him.\n\n\u2014She too wants me to catch hold of her, he thought. That's why she came with me to the tram. I could easily catch hold of her when she comes up to my step: nobody is looking. I could hold her and kiss her.\n\nBut he did neither: and, when he was sitting alone in the deserted tram, he tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily at the corrugated footboard.\n\n\n\nThe next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for many hours. Before him lay a new pen, a new bottle of ink and a new emerald exercise. From force of habit he had written at the top of the first page the initial letters of the jesuit motto: A.M.D.G. On the first line of the page appeared the title of the verses he was trying to write: To E\u2014 C\u2014. He knew it was right to begin so for he had seen similar titles in the collected poems of Lord Byron. When he had written this title and drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into a daydream and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the book. He saw himself sitting at his table in Bray the morning after the discussion at the Christmas dinner table, trying to write a poem about Parnell on the back of one of his father's second moiety notices. But his brain had then refused to grapple with the theme and, desisting, he had covered the page with the names and addresses of certain of his classmates:\n\nRoderick Kickham\nJohn Lawton\nAnthony MacSwiney\nSimon Moonan\nNow it seemed as if he would fail again but, by dint of brooding on the incident, he thought himself into confidence. During this process all those elements which he deemed common and insignificant fell out of the scene. There remained no trace of the tram itself nor of the tram-men nor of the horses: nor did he and she appear vividly. The verses told only of the night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon. Some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of the protagonists as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees and when the moment of farewell had come the kiss, which had been withheld by one, was given by both. After this the letters L. D. S. were written at the foot of the page, and, having hidden the book, he went into his mother's bedroom and gazed at his face for a long time in the mirror of her dressing-table.\n\nBut his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its end. One evening his father came home full of news which kept his tongue busy all through dinner. Stephen had been awaiting his father's return for there had been mutton hash that day and he knew that his father would make him dip his bread in the gravy. But he did not relish the hash for the mention of Clongowes had coated his palate with a scum of disgust.\n\n\u2014I walked bang into him, said Mr Dedalus for the fourth time, just at the corner of the square.\n\n\u2014Then I suppose, said Mrs Dedalus, he will be able to arrange it. I mean about Belvedere.\n\n\u2014Of course he will, said Mr Dedalus. Don't I tell you he's provincial of the order now?\n\n\u2014I never liked the idea of sending him to the christian brothers myself, said Mrs Dedalus.\n\n\u2014Christian brothers be damned! said Mr Dedalus. Is it with Paddy Stink and Micky Mud? No, let him stick to the jesuits in God's name since he began with them. They'll be of service to him in after years. Those are the fellows that can get you a position.\n\n\u2014And they're a very rich order, aren't they, Simon?\n\n\u2014Rather. They live well, I tell you. You saw their table at Clongowes. Fed up, by God, like gamecocks.\n\nMr Dedalus pushed his plate over to Stephen and bade him finish what was on it.\n\n\u2014Now then, Stephen, he said, you must put your shoulder to the wheel, old chap. You've had a fine long holiday.\n\n\u2014O, I'm sure he'll work very hard now, said Mrs Dedalus, especially when he has Maurice with him.\n\n\u2014O, Holy Paul, I forgot about Maurice, said Mr Dedalus. Here, Maurice! Come here, you thick-headed ruffian! Do you know I'm going to send you to a college where they'll teach you to spell c.a.t. cat. And I'll buy you a nice little penny handkerchief to keep your nose dry. Won't that be grand fun?\n\nMaurice grinned at his father and then at his brother.\n\nMr Dedalus screwed his glass into his eye and stared hard at both his sons. Stephen mumbled his bread without answering his father's gaze.\n\n\u2014By the bye, said Mr Dedalus at length, the rector, or provincial rather, was telling me that story about you and Father Dolan. You're an impudent thief, he said.\n\n\u2014O, he didn't, Simon!\n\n\u2014Not he! said Mr Dedalus. But he gave me a great account of the whole affair. We were chatting, you know, and one word borrowed another. And, by the way, who do you think he told me will get that job in the corporation? But I'll tell you that after. Well, as I was saying, we were chatting away quite friendly and he asked me did our friend here wear glasses still, and then he told me the whole story.\n\n\u2014And was he annoyed, Simon?\n\n\u2014Annoyed? Not he! MANLY LITTLE CHAP! he said.\n\nMr Dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provincial.\n\nFather Dolan and I, when I told them all at dinner about it, Father Dolan and I had a great laugh over it. YOU BETTER MIND YOURSELF FATHER DOLAN, said I, OR YOUNG DEDALUS WILL SEND YOU UP FOR TWICE NINE. We had a famous laugh together over it. Ha! Ha! Ha!\n\nMr Dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural voice:\n\n\u2014Shows you the spirit in which they take the boys there. O, a jesuit for your life, for diplomacy!\n\nHe reassumed the provincial's voice and repeated:\n\n\u2014I TOLD THEM ALL AT DINNER ABOUT IT AND FATHER DOLAN AND I AND ALL OF US WE HAD A HEARTY LAUGH TOGETHER OVER IT. HA! HA! HA!\n\n\n\nThe night of the Whitsuntide play had come and Stephen from the window of the dressing-room looked out on the small grass-plot across which lines of Chinese lanterns were stretched. He watched the visitors come down the steps from the house and pass into the theatre. Stewards in evening dress, old Belvedereans, loitered in groups about the entrance to the theatre and ushered in the visitors with ceremony. Under the sudden glow of a lantern he could recognize the smiling face of a priest.\n\nThe Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the tabernacle and the first benches had been driven back so as to leave the dais of the altar and the space before it free. Against the walls stood companies of barbells and Indian clubs; the dumbbells were piled in one corner: and in the midst of countless hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leather-jacketed vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on the stage and set in the middle of the winning team at the end of the gymnastic display.\n\nStephen, though in deference to his reputation for essay writing he had been elected secretary to the gymnasium, had had no part in the first section of the programme but in the play which formed the second section he had the chief part, that of a farcical pedagogue. He had been cast for it on account of his stature and grave manners for he was now at the end of his second year at Belvedere and in number two.\n\nA score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets came pattering down from the stage, through the vestry and to the chapel. The vestry and chapel were peopled with eager masters and boys. The plump bald sergeant major was testing with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse. The lean young man in a long overcoat, who was to give a special display of intricate club swinging, stood near watching with interest, his silver-coated clubs peeping out of his deep side-pockets. The hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was heard as another team made ready to go up on the stage: and in another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys through the vestry like a flock of geese, flapping the wings of his soutane nervously and crying to the laggards to make haste. A little troop of Neapolitan peasants were practising their steps at the end of the chapel, some circling their arms above their heads, some swaying their baskets of paper violets and curtsying. In a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts. When she stood up a pink-dressed figure, wearing a curly golden wig and an old-fashioned straw sunbonnet, with black pencilled eyebrows and cheeks delicately rouged and powdered, was discovered. A low murmur of curiosity ran round the chapel at the discovery of this girlish figure. One of the prefects, smiling and nodding his head, approached the dark corner and, having bowed to the stout old lady, said pleasantly:\n\n\u2014Is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here, Mrs Tallon?\n\nThen, bending down to peer at the smiling painted face under the leaf of the bonnet, he exclaimed:\n\n\u2014No! Upon my word I believe it's little Bertie Tallon after all!\n\nStephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and the priest laugh together and heard the boys' murmurs of admiration behind him as they passed forward to see the little boy who had to dance the sunbonnet dance by himself. A movement of impatience escaped him. He let the edge of the blind fall and, stepping down from the bench on which he had been standing, walked out of the chapel.\n\nHe passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed that flanked the garden. From the theatre opposite came the muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clashes of the soldiers' band. The light spread upwards from the glass roof making the theatre seem a festive ark, anchored among the hulks of houses, her frail cables of lanterns looping her to her moorings. A side door of the theatre opened suddenly and a shaft of light flew across the grass plots. A sudden burst of music issued from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when the side door closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the music. The sentiment of the opening bars, their languor and supple movement, evoked the incommunicable emotion which had been the cause of all his day's unrest and of his impatient movement of a moment before. His unrest issued from him like a wave of sound: and on the tide of flowing music the ark was journeying, trailing her cables of lanterns in her wake. Then a noise like dwarf artillery broke the movement. It was the clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on the stage.\n\nAt the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink light showed in the darkness and as he walked towards it he became aware of a faint aromatic odour. Two boys were standing in the shelter of a doorway, smoking, and before he reached them he had recognised Heron by his voice.\n\n\u2014Here comes the noble Dedalus! cried a high throaty voice. Welcome to our trusty friend!\n\nThis welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as Heron salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his cane.\n\n\u2014Here I am, said Stephen, halting and glancing from Heron to his friend.\n\nThe latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the aid of the glowing cigarette tips, he could make out a pale dandyish face over which a smile was travelling slowly, a tall overcoated figure and a hard hat. Heron did not trouble himself about an introduction but said instead:\n\n\u2014I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would be tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster. It would be a ripping good joke.\n\nHeron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis the rector's pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure, asked Stephen to do it.\n\n\u2014Go on, Dedalus, he urged, you can take him off rippingly. HE THAT WILL NOT HEAR THE CHURCHA LET HIM BE TO THEEA AS THE HEATHENA AND THE PUBLICANA.\n\nThe imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger from Wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too tightly wedged.\n\n\u2014Damn this blankety blank holder, he said, taking it from his mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly. It's always getting stuck like that. Do you use a holder?\n\n\u2014I don't smoke, answered Stephen.\n\n\u2014No, said Heron, Dedalus is a model youth. He doesn't smoke and he doesn't go to bazaars and he doesn't flirt and he doesn't damn anything or damn all.\n\nStephen shook his head and smiled in his rival's flushed and mobile face, beaked like a bird's. He had often thought it strange that Vincent Heron had a bird's face as well as a bird's name. A shock of pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled crest: the forehead was narrow and bony and a thin hooked nose stood out between the close-set prominent eyes which were light and inexpressive. The rivals were school friends. They sat together in class, knelt together in the chapel, talked together after beads over their lunches. As the fellows in number one were undistinguished dullards, Stephen and Heron had been during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was they who went up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a fellow off.\n\n\u2014O by the way, said Heron suddenly, I saw your governor going in.\n\nThe smile waned on Stephen's face. Any allusion made to his father by a fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a moment. He waited in timorous silence to hear what Heron might say next. Heron, however, nudged him expressively with his elbow and said:\n\n\u2014You're a sly dog.\n\n\u2014Why so? said Stephen.\n\n\u2014You'd think butter wouldn't melt in your mouth said Heron. But I'm afraid you're a sly dog.\n\n\u2014Might I ask you what you are talking about? said Stephen urbanely.\n\n\u2014Indeed you might, answered Heron. We saw her, Wallis, didn't we? And deucedly pretty she is too. And inquisitive! AND WHAT PART DOES STEPHEN TAKE, MR DEDALUS? AND WILL STEPHEN NOT SING, MR DEDALUS? Your governor was staring at her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that I think the old man has found you out too. I wouldn't care a bit, by Jove. She's ripping, isn't she, Wallis?\n\n\u2014Not half bad, answered Wallis quietly as he placed his holder once more in a corner of his mouth.\n\nA shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen's mind at these indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For him there was nothing amusing in a girl's interest and regard. All day he had thought of nothing but their leave-taking on the steps of the tram at Harold's Cross, the stream of moody emotions it had made to course through him and the poem he had written about it. All day he had imagined a new meeting with her for he knew that she was to come to the play. The old restless moodiness had again filled his breast as it had done on the night of the party, but had not found an outlet in verse. The growth and knowledge of two years of boyhood stood between then and now, forbidding such an outlet: and all day the stream of gloomy tenderness within him had started forth and returned upon itself in dark courses and eddies, wearying him in the end until the pleasantry of the prefect and the painted little boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience.\n\n\u2014So you may as well admit, Heron went on, that we've fairly found you out this time. You can't play the saint on me any more, that's one sure five.\n\nA soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and, bending down as before, he struck Stephen lightly across the calf of the leg with his cane, as if in jesting reproof.\n\nStephen's moment of anger had already passed. He was neither flattered nor confused, but simply wished the banter to end. He scarcely resented what had seemed to him a silly indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind stood in no danger from these words: and his face mirrored his rival's false smile.\n\n\u2014Admit! repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane across the calf of the leg.\n\nThe stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first one had been. Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and almost painlessly; and, bowing submissively, as if to meet his companion's jesting mood, began to recite the CONFITEOR. The episode ended well, for both Heron and Wallis laughed indulgently at the irreverence.\n\nThe confession came only from Stephen's lips and, while they spoke the words, a sudden memory had carried him to another scene called up, as if by magic, at the moment when he had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of Heron's smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition:\n\n\u2014Admit.\n\nIt was towards the close of his first term in the college when he was in number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting under the lashes of an undivined and squalid way of life. His soul was still disquieted and cast down by the dull phenomenon of Dublin. He had emerged from a two years' spell of revery to find himself in the midst of a new scene, every event and figure of which affected him intimately, disheartened him or allured and, whether alluring or disheartening, filled him always with unrest and bitter thoughts. All the leisure which his school life left him was passed in the company of subversive writers whose jibes and violence of speech set up a ferment in his brain before they passed out of it into his crude writings.\n\nThe essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every Tuesday, as he marched from home to the school, he read his fate in the incidents of the way, pitting himself against some figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to outstrip it before a certain goal was reached or planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork of the pathway and telling himself that he would be first and not first in the weekly essay.\n\nOn a certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely broken. Mr Tate, the English master, pointed his finger at him and said bluntly:\n\n\u2014This fellow has heresy in his essay.\n\nA hush fell on the class. Mr Tate did not break it but dug with his hand between his thighs while his heavily starched linen creaked about his neck and wrists. Stephen did not look up. It was a raw spring morning and his eyes were still smarting and weak. He was conscious of failure and of detection, of the squalor of his own mind and home, and felt against his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar.\n\nA short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease.\n\n\u2014Perhaps you didn't know that, he said.\n\n\u2014Where? asked Stephen.\n\nMr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the essay.\n\n\u2014Here. It's about the Creator and the soul. Rrm... rrm... rrm... Ah! WITHOUT A POSSIBILITY OF EVER APPROACHING NEARER. That's heresy.\n\nStephen murmured:\n\n\u2014I meant WITHOUT A POSSIBILITY OF EVER REACHING.\n\nIt was a submission and Mr Tate, appeased, folded up the essay and passed it across to him, saying:\n\n\u2014O...Ah! EVER REACHING. That's another story.\n\nBut the class was not so soon appeased. Though nobody spoke to him of the affair after class he could feel about him a vague general malignant joy.\n\nA few nights after this public chiding he was walking with a letter along the Drumcondra Road when he heard a voice cry:\n\n\u2014Halt!\n\nHe turned and saw three boys of his own class coming towards him in the dusk. It was Heron who had called out and, as he marched forward between his two attendants, he cleft the air before him with a thin cane in time to their steps. Boland, his friend, marched beside him, a large grin on his face, while Nash came on a few steps behind, blowing from the pace and wagging his great red head.\n\nAs soon as the boys had turned into Clonliffe Road together they began to speak about books and writers, saying what books they were reading and how many books there were in their fathers' bookcases at home. Stephen listened to them in some wonderment for Boland was the dunce and Nash the idler of the class. In fact, after some talk about their favourite writers, Nash declared for Captain Marryat who, he said, was the greatest writer.\n\n\u2014Fudge! said Heron. Ask Dedalus. Who is the greatest writer, Dedalus?\n\nStephen noted the mockery in the question and said:\n\n\u2014Of prose do you mean?\n\n\u2014Yes.\n\n\u2014Newman, I think.\n\n\u2014Is it Cardinal Newman? asked Boland.\n\n\u2014Yes, answered Stephen.\n\nThe grin broadened on Nash's freckled face as he turned to Stephen and said:\n\n\u2014And do you like Cardinal Newman, Dedalus?\n\n\u2014O, many say that Newman has the best prose style, Heron said to the other two in explanation, of course he's not a poet.\n\n\u2014And who is the best poet, Heron? asked Boland.\n\n\u2014Lord Tennyson, of course, answered Heron.\n\n\u2014O, yes, Lord Tennyson, said Nash. We have all his poetry at home in a book.\n\nAt this Stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making and burst out:\n\n\u2014Tennyson a poet! Why, he's only a rhymester!\n\n\u2014O, get out! said Heron. Everyone knows that Tennyson is the greatest poet.\n\n\u2014And who do you think is the greatest poet? asked Boland, nudging his neighbour.\n\n\u2014Byron, of course, answered Stephen.\n\nHeron gave the lead and all three joined in a scornful laugh.\n\n\u2014What are you laughing at? asked Stephen.\n\n\u2014You, said Heron. Byron the greatest poet! He's only a poet for uneducated people.\n\n\u2014He must be a fine poet! said Boland.\n\n\u2014You may keep your mouth shut, said Stephen, turning on him boldly. All you know about poetry is what you wrote up on the slates in the yard and were going to be sent to the loft for.\n\nBoland, in fact, was said to have written on the slates in the yard a couplet about a classmate of his who often rode home from the college on a pony:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Tyson was riding into Jerusalem\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He fell and hurt his Alec Kafoozelum.\n\n\nThis thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but Heron went on:\n\n\u2014In any case Byron was a heretic and immoral too.\n\n\u2014I don't care what he was, cried Stephen hotly.\n\n\u2014You don't care whether he was a heretic or not? said Nash.\n\n\u2014What do you know about it? shouted Stephen. You never read a line of anything in your life except a trans, or Boland either.\n\n\u2014I know that Byron was a bad man, said Boland.\n\n\u2014Here, catch hold of this heretic, Heron called out. In a moment Stephen was a prisoner.\n\n\u2014Tate made you buck up the other day, Heron went on, about the heresy in your essay.\n\n\u2014I'll tell him tomorrow, said Boland.\n\n\u2014Will you? said Stephen. You'd be afraid to open your lips.\n\n\u2014Afraid?\n\n\u2014Ay. Afraid of your life.\n\n\u2014Behave yourself! cried Heron, cutting at Stephen's legs with his cane.\n\nIt was the signal for their onset. Nash pinioned his arms behind while Boland seized a long cabbage stump which was lying in the gutter. Struggling and kicking under the cuts of the cane and the blows of the knotty stump Stephen was borne back against a barbed wire fence.\n\n\u2014Admit that Byron was no good.\n\n\u2014No.\n\n\u2014Admit.\n\n\u2014No.\n\n\u2014Admit.\n\n\u2014No. No.\n\nAt last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free. His tormentors set off towards Jones's Road, laughing and jeering at him, while he, half blinded with tears, stumbled on, clenching his fists madly and sobbing.\n\nWhile he was still repeating the CONFITEOR amid the indulgent laughter of his hearers and while the scenes of that malignant episode were still passing sharply and swiftly before his mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to those who had tormented him. He had not forgotten a whit of their cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it called forth no anger from him. All the descriptions of fierce love and hatred which he had met in books had seemed to him therefore unreal. Even that night as he stumbled homewards along Jones's Road he had felt that some power was divesting him of that sudden-woven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of its soft ripe peel.\n\nHe remained standing with his two companions at the end of the shed listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of applause in the theatre. She was sitting there among the others perhaps waiting for him to appear. He tried to recall her appearance but could not. He could remember only that she had worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark eyes had invited and unnerved him. He wondered had he been in her thoughts as she had been in his. Then in the dark and unseen by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one hand upon the palm of the other hand, scarcely touching it lightly. But the pressure of her fingers had been lighter and steadier: and suddenly the memory of their touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible wave.\n\nA boy came towards them, running along under the shed. He was excited and breathless.\n\n\u2014O, Dedalus, he cried, Doyle is in a great bake about you. You're to go in at once and get dressed for the play. Hurry up, you better.\n\n\u2014He's coming now, said Heron to the messenger with a haughty drawl, when he wants to.\n\nThe boy turned to Heron and repeated:\n\n\u2014But Doyle is in an awful bake.\n\n\u2014Will you tell Doyle with my best compliments that I damned his eyes? answered Heron.\n\n\u2014Well, I must go now, said Stephen, who cared little for such points of honour.\n\n\u2014I wouldn't, said Heron, damn me if I would. That's no way to send for one of the senior boys. In a bake, indeed! I think it's quite enough that you're taking a part in his bally old play.\n\nThis spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had observed lately in his rival had not seduced Stephen from his habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the turbulence and doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to him a sorry anticipation of manhood. The question of honour here raised was, like all such questions, trivial to him. While his mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and turning in irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about him the constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging him to be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good catholic above all things. These voices had now come to be hollow-sounding in his ears. When the gymnasium had been opened he had heard another voice urging him to be strong and manly and healthy and when the movement towards national revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice had bidden him be true to his country and help to raise up her language and tradition. In the profane world, as he foresaw, a worldly voice would bid him raise up his father's fallen state by his labours and, meanwhile, the voice of his school comrades urged him to be a decent fellow, to shield others from blame or to beg them off and to do his best to get free days for the school. And it was the din of all these hollow-sounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit of phantoms. He gave them ear only for a time but he was happy only when he was far from them, beyond their call, alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades.\n\nIn the vestry a plump fresh-faced jesuit and an elderly man, in shabby blue clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and chalks. The boys who had been painted walked about or stood still awkwardly, touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and back again, his hands thrust well forward into his side-pockets. His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane and with his spotless shoes.\n\nAs he watched this swaying form and tried to read for himself the legend of the priest's mocking smile there came into Stephen's memory a saying which he had heard from his father before he had been sent to Clongowes, that you could always tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes. At the same moment he thought he saw a likeness between his father's mind and that of this smiling well-dressed priest: and he was aware of some desecration of the priest's office or of the vestry itself whose silence was now routed by loud talk and joking and its air pungent with the smells of the gas-jets and the grease.\n\nWhile his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted black and blue by the elderly man, he listened distractedly to the voice of the plump young jesuit which bade him speak up and make his points clearly. He could hear the band playing THE LILY OF KILLARNEY and knew that in a few moments the curtain would go up. He felt no stage fright but the thought of the part he had to play humiliated him. A remembrance of some of his lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted cheeks. He saw her serious alluring eyes watching him from among the audience and their image at once swept away his scruples, leaving his will compact. Another nature seemed to have been lent him: the infection of the excitement and youth about him entered into and transformed his moody mistrustfulness. For one rare moment he seemed to be clothed in the real apparel of boyhood: and, as he stood in the wings among the other players, he shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene was hauled upwards by two able-bodied priests with violent jerks and all awry.\n\nA few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the garish gas and the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable faces of the void. It surprised him to see that the play which he had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing had suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play itself, he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When the curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with applause and, through a rift in a side scene, saw the simple body before which he had acted magically deformed, the void of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy groups.\n\nHe left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery and passed out through the chapel into the college garden. Now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake it. The doors of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out. On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few lanterns swung in the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly. He mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that some prey should not elude him, and forced his way through the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the visitors. He pushed onward nervously, feigning a still greater haste and faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges which his powdered head left in its wake.\n\nWhen he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for him at the first lamp. In a glance he noted that every figure of the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily.\n\n\u2014I have to leave a message down in George's Street, he said to his father quickly. I'll be home after you.\n\nWithout waiting for his father's questions he ran across the road and began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill. He hardly knew where he was walking. Pride and hope and desire like crushed herbs in his heart sent up vapours of maddening incense before the eyes of his mind. He strode down the hill amid the tumult of sudden-risen vapours of wounded pride and fallen hope and baffled desire. They streamed upwards before his anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again.\n\nA film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer. A power, akin to that which had often made anger or resentment fall from him, brought his steps to rest. He stood still and gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to the dark cobbled laneway at its side. He saw the word LOTTS on the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air.\n\nThat is horse piss and rotted straw, he thought. It is a good odour to breathe. It will calm my heart. My heart is quite calm now. I will go back.\n\n\n\nStephen was once again seated beside his father in the corner of a railway carriage at Kingsbridge. He was travelling with his father by the night mail to Cork. As the train steamed out of the station he recalled his childish wonder of years before and every event of his first day at Clongowes. But he felt no wonder now. He saw the darkening lands slipping away past him, the silent telegraph-poles passing his window swiftly every four seconds, the little glimmering stations, manned by a few silent sentries, flung by the mail behind her and twinkling for a moment in the darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a runner.\n\nHe listened without sympathy to his father's evocation of Cork and of scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or draughts from his pocket flask whenever the image of some dead friend appeared in it or whenever the evoker remembered suddenly the purpose of his actual visit. Stephen heard but could feel no pity. The images of the dead were all strangers to him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had lately been fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father's property was going to be sold by auction, and in the manner of his own dispossession he felt the world give the lie rudely to his phantasy.\n\nAt Maryborough he fell asleep. When he awoke the train had passed out of Mallow and his father was stretched asleep on the other seat. The cold light of the dawn lay over the country, over the unpeopled fields and the closed cottages. The terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the silent country or heard from time to time his father's deep breath or sudden sleepy movement. The neighbourhood of unseen sleepers filled him with strange dread, as though they could harm him, and he prayed that the day might come quickly. His prayer, addressed neither to God nor saint, began with a shiver, as the chilly morning breeze crept through the chink of the carriage door to his feet, and ended in a trail of foolish words which he made to fit the insistent rhythm of the train; and silently, at intervals of four seconds, the telegraph-poles held the galloping notes of the music between punctual bars. This furious music allayed his dread and, leaning against the windowledge, he let his eyelids close again.\n\nThey drove in a jingle across Cork while it was still early morning and Stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the Victoria Hotel. The bright warm sunlight was streaming through the window and he could hear the din of traffic. His father was standing before the dressing-table, examining his hair and face and moustache with great care, craning his neck across the water-jug and drawing it back sideways to see the better. While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint accent and phrasing:\n\n\n'Tis youth and folly\nMakes young men marry,\nSo here, my love, I'll\nNo longer stay.\nWhat can't be cured, sure,\nMust be injured, sure,\nSo I'll go to\nAmerikay.\nMy love she's handsome,\nMy love she's bony:\nShe's like good whisky\nWhen it is new;\nBut when 'tis old\nAnd growing cold\nIt fades and dies like\nThe mountain dew.\n\nThe consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his window and the tender tremors with which his father's voice festooned the strange sad happy air, drove off all the mists of the night's ill humour from Stephen's brain. He got up quickly to dress and, when the song had ended, said:\n\n\u2014That's much prettier than any of your other COME-ALL-YOUS.\n\n\u2014Do you think so? asked Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014I like it, said Stephen.\n\n\u2014It's a pretty old air, said Mr Dedalus, twirling the points of his moustache. Ah, but you should have heard Mick Lacy sing it! Poor Mick Lacy! He had little turns for it, grace notes that he used to put in that I haven't got. That was the boy who could sing a COME-ALL-YOU, if you like.\n\nMr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during the meal he cross-examined the waiter for local news. For the most part they spoke at cross purposes when a name was mentioned, the waiter having in mind the present holder and Mr Dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather.\n\n\u2014Well, I hope they haven't moved the Queen's College anyhow, said Mr Dedalus, for I want to show it to this youngster of mine.\n\nAlong the Mardyke the trees were in bloom. They entered the grounds of the college and were led by the garrulous porter across the quadrangle. But their progress across the gravel was brought to a halt after every dozen or so paces by some reply of the porter's.\n\n\u2014Ah, do you tell me so? And is poor Pottlebelly dead?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir. Dead, sir.\n\nDuring these halts Stephen stood awkwardly behind the two men, weary of the subject and waiting restlessly for the slow march to begin again. By the time they had crossed the quadrangle his restlessness had risen to fever. He wondered how his father, whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man, could be duped by the servile manners of the porter; and the lively southern speech which had entertained him all the morning now irritated his ears.\n\nThey passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus, the porter aiding him, searched the desks for his initials. Stephen remained in the background, depressed more than ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it wore of jaded and formal study. On the desk he read the word FOETUS cut several times in the dark stained wood. The sudden legend startled his blood: he seemed to feel the absent students of the college about him and to shrink from their company. A vision of their life, which his father's words had been powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out of the word cut in the desk. A broad-shouldered student with a moustache was cutting in the letters with a jack-knife, seriously. Other students stood or sat near him laughing at his handiwork. One jogged his elbow. The big student turned on him, frowning. He was dressed in loose grey clothes and had tan boots.\n\nStephen's name was called. He hurried down the steps of the theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as he could be and, peering closely at his father's initials, hid his flushed face.\n\nBut the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he walked back across the quadrangle and towards the college gate. It shocked him to find in the outer world a trace of what he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of his own mind. His monstrous reveries came thronging into his memory. They too had sprung up before him, suddenly and furiously, out of mere words. He had soon given in to them and allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect, wondering always where they came from, from what den of monstrous images, and always weak and humble towards others, restless and sickened of himself when they had swept over him.\n\n\u2014Ay, bedad! And there's the Groceries sure enough! cried Mr Dedalus. You often heard me speak of the Groceries, didn't you, Stephen. Many's the time we went down there when our names had been marked, a crowd of us, Harry Peard and little Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and Maurice Moriarty, the Frenchman, and Tom O'Grady and Mick Lacy that I told you of this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little good-hearted Johnny Keevers of the Tantiles.\n\nThe leaves of the trees along the Mardyke were astir and whispering in the sunlight. A team of cricketers passed, agile young men in flannels and blazers, one of them carrying the long green wicket-bag. In a quiet bystreet a German band of five players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments was playing to an audience of street arabs and leisurely messenger boys. A maid in a white cap and apron was watering a box of plants on a sill which shone like a slab of limestone in the warm glare. From another window open to the air came the sound of a piano, scale after scale rising into the treble.\n\nStephen walked on at his father's side, listening to stories he had heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and dead revellers who had been the companions of his father's youth. And a faint sickness sighed in his heart.\n\nHe recalled his own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a leader afraid of his own authority, proud and sensitive and suspicious, battling against the squalor of his life and against the riot of his mind. The letters cut in the stained wood of the desk stared upon him, mocking his bodily weakness and futile enthusiasms and making him loathe himself for his own mad and filthy orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul to swallow and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that for a moment he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness.\n\nHe could still hear his father's voice\u2014\n\n\u2014When you kick out for yourself, Stephen\u2014as I daresay you will one of these days\u2014remember, whatever you do, to mix with gentlemen. When I was a young fellow I tell you I enjoyed myself. I mixed with fine decent fellows. Everyone of us could do something. One fellow had a good voice, another fellow was a good actor, another could sing a good comic song, another was a good oarsman or a good racket player, another could tell a good story and so on. We kept the ball rolling anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen, Stephen\u2014at least I hope we were\u2014and bloody good honest Irishmen too. That's the kind of fellows I want you to associate with, fellows of the right kidney. I'm talking to you as a friend, Stephen. I don't believe a son should be afraid of his father. No, I treat you as your grandfather treated me when I was a young chap. We were more like brothers than father and son. I'll never forget the first day he caught me smoking. I was standing at the end of the South Terrace one day with some maneens like myself and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we had pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the governor passed. He didn't say a word, or stop even. But the next day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together and when we were coming home he took out his cigar case and said:\u2014By the by, Simon, I didn't know you smoked, or something like that.\u2014Of course I tried to carry it off as best I could.\u2014If you want a good smoke, he said, try one of these cigars. An American captain made me a present of them last night in Queenstown.\n\nStephen heard his father's voice break into a laugh which was almost a sob.\n\n\u2014He was the handsomest man in Cork at that time, by God he was! The women used to stand to look after him in the street.\n\nHe heard the sob passing loudly down his father's throat and opened his eyes with a nervous impulse. The sunlight breaking suddenly on his sight turned the sky and clouds into a fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces of dark rosy light. His very brain was sick and powerless. He could scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of the shops. By his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put himself beyond the limits of reality. Nothing moved him or spoke to him from the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the infuriated cries within him. He could respond to no earthly or human appeal, dumb and insensible to the call of summer and gladness and companionship, wearied and dejected by his father's voice. He could scarcely recognize as his own thoughts, and repeated slowly to himself:\n\n\u2014I am Stephen Dedalus. I am walking beside my father whose name is Simon Dedalus. We are in Cork, in Ireland. Cork is a city. Our room is in the Victoria Hotel. Victoria and Stephen and Simon. Simon and Stephen and Victoria. Names.\n\nThe memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim. He tried to call forth some of its vivid moments but could not. He recalled only names. Dante, Parnell, Clane, Clongowes. A little boy had been taught geography by an old woman who kept two brushes in her wardrobe. Then he had been sent away from home to a college, he had made his first communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricket cap and watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being dead, of mass being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope, of being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes. But he had not died then. Parnell had died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and no procession. He had not died but he had faded out like a film in the sun. He had been lost or had wandered out of existence for he no longer existed. How strange to think of him passing out of existence in such a way, not by death but by fading out in the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere in the universe! It was strange to see his small body appear again for a moment: a little boy in a grey belted suit. His hands were in his side-pockets and his trousers were tucked in at the knees by elastic bands.\n\nOn the evening of the day on which the property was sold Stephen followed his father meekly about the city from bar to bar. To the sellers in the market, to the barmen and barmaids, to the beggars who importuned him for a lob Mr Dedalus told the same tale\u2014that he was an old Corkonian, that he had been trying for thirty years to get rid of his Cork accent up in Dublin and that Peter Pickackafax beside him was his eldest son but that he was only a Dublin jackeen.\n\nThey had set out early in the morning from Newcombe's coffee-house, where Mr Dedalus's cup had rattled noisily against its saucer, and Stephen had tried to cover that shameful sign of his father's drinking bout of the night before by moving his chair and coughing. One humiliation had succeeded another\u2014the false smiles of the market sellers, the curvetings and oglings of the barmaids with whom his father flirted, the compliments and encouraging words of his father's friends. They had told him that he had a great look of his grandfather and Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness. They had unearthed traces of a Cork accent in his speech and made him admit that the Lee was a much finer river than the Liffey. One of them, in order to put his Latin to the proof, had made him translate short passages from Dilectus and asked him whether it was correct to say: TEMPORA MUTANTUR NOS ET MUTAMUR IN ILLIS or TEMPORA MUTANTUR ET NOS MUTAMUR IN ILLIS. Another, a brisk old man, whom Mr Dedalus called Johnny Cashman, had covered him with confusion by asking him to say which were prettier, the Dublin girls or the Cork girls.\n\n\u2014He's not that way built, said Mr Dedalus. Leave him alone. He's a level-headed thinking boy who doesn't bother his head about that kind of nonsense.\n\n\u2014Then he's not his father's son, said the little old man.\n\n\u2014I don't know, I'm sure, said Mr Dedalus, smiling complacently.\n\n\u2014Your father, said the little old man to Stephen, was the boldest flirt in the City of Cork in his day. Do you know that?\n\nStephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar into which they had drifted.\n\n\u2014Now don't be putting ideas into his head, said Mr Dedalus. Leave him to his Maker.\n\n\u2014Yerra, sure I wouldn't put any ideas into his head. I'm old enough to be his grandfather. And I am a grandfather, said the little old man to Stephen. Do you know that?\n\n\u2014Are you? asked Stephen.\n\n\u2014Bedad I am, said the little old man. I have two bouncing grandchildren out at Sunday's Well. Now, then! What age do you think I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in his red coat riding out to hounds. That was before you were born.\n\n\u2014Ay, or thought of, said Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014Bedad I did, repeated the little old man. And, more than that, I can remember even your great-grandfather, old John Stephen Dedalus, and a fierce old fire-eater he was. Now, then! There's a memory for you!\n\n\u2014That's three generations\u2014four generations, said another of the company. Why, Johnny Cashman, you must be nearing the century.\n\n\u2014Well, I'll tell you the truth, said the little old man. I'm just twenty-seven years of age.\n\n\u2014We're as old as we feel, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus. And just finish what you have there and we'll have another. Here, Tim or Tom or whatever your name is, give us the same again here. By God, I don't feel more than eighteen myself. There's that son of mine there not half my age and I'm a better man than he is any day of the week.\n\n\u2014Draw it mild now, Dedalus. I think it's time for you to take a back seat, said the gentleman who had spoken before.\n\n\u2014No, by God! asserted Mr Dedalus. I'll sing a tenor song against him or I'll vault a five-barred gate against him or I'll run with him after the hounds across the country as I did thirty years ago along with the Kerry Boy and the best man for it.\n\n\u2014But he'll beat you here, said the little old man, tapping his forehead and raising his glass to drain it.\n\n\u2014Well, I hope he'll be as good a man as his father. That's all I can say, said Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014If he is, he'll do, said the little old man.\n\n\u2014And thanks be to God, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus, that we lived so long and did so little harm.\n\n\u2014But did so much good, Simon, said the little old man gravely. Thanks be to God we lived so long and did so much good.\n\nStephen watched the three glasses being raised from the counter as his father and his two cronies drank to the memory of their past. An abyss of fortune or of temperament sundered him from them. His mind seemed older than theirs: it shone coldly on their strifes and happiness and regrets like a moon upon a younger earth. No life or youth stirred in him as it had stirred in them. He had known neither the pleasure of companionship with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor filial piety. Nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel and loveless lust. His childhood was dead or lost and with it his soul capable of simple joys and he was drifting amid life like the barren shell of the moon.\n\n\nArt thou pale for weariness\nOf climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,\nWandering companionless...?\n\nHe repeated to himself the lines of Shelley's fragment. Its alternation of sad human ineffectiveness with vast inhuman cycles of activity chilled him and he forgot his own human and ineffectual grieving.\n\n\n\nStephen's mother and his brother and one of his cousins waited at the corner of quiet Foster Place while he and his father went up the steps and along the colonnade where the Highland sentry was parading. When they had passed into the great hall and stood at the counter Stephen drew forth his orders on the governor of the bank of Ireland for thirty and three pounds; and these sums, the moneys of his exhibition and essay prize, were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in notes and in coin respectively. He bestowed them in his pockets with feigned composure and suffered the friendly teller, to whom his father chatted, to take his hand across the broad counter and wish him a brilliant career in after life. He was impatient of their voices and could not keep his feet at rest. But the teller still deferred the serving of others to say he was living in changed times and that there was nothing like giving a boy the best education that money could buy. Mr Dedalus lingered in the hall gazing about him and up at the roof and telling Stephen, who urged him to come out, that they were standing in the house of commons of the old Irish parliament.\n\n\u2014God help us! he said piously, to think of the men of those times, Stephen, Hely Hutchinson and Flood and Henry Grattan and Charles Kendal Bushe, and the noblemen we have now, leaders of the Irish people at home and abroad. Why, by God, they wouldn't be seen dead in a ten-acre field with them. No, Stephen, old chap, I'm sorry to say that they are only as I roved out one fine May morning in the merry month of sweet July.\n\nA keen October wind was blowing round the bank. The three figures standing at the edge of the muddy path had pinched cheeks and watery eyes. Stephen looked at his thinly clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had seen a mantle priced at twenty guineas in the windows of Barnardo's.\n\n\u2014Well that's done, said Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014We had better go to dinner, said Stephen. Where?\n\n\u2014Dinner? said Mr Dedalus. Well, I suppose we had better, what?\n\n\u2014Some place that's not too dear, said Mrs Dedalus.\n\n\u2014Underdone's?\n\n\u2014Yes. Some quiet place.\n\n\u2014Come along, said Stephen quickly. It doesn't matter about the dearness.\n\nHe walked on before them with short nervous steps, smiling. They tried to keep up with him, smiling also at his eagerness.\n\n\u2014Take it easy like a good young fellow, said his father. We're not out for the half mile, are we?\n\nFor a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes ran through Stephen's fingers. Great parcels of groceries and delicacies and dried fruits arrived from the city. Every day he drew up a bill of fare for the family and every night led a party of three or four to the theatre to see INGOMAR or THE LADY OF LYONS. In his coat pockets he carried squares of Vienna chocolate for his guests while his trousers' pocket bulged with masses of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for everyone, overhauled his room, wrote out resolutions, marshalled his books up and down their shelves, pored upon all kinds of price lists, drew up a form of commonwealth for the household by which every member of it held some office, opened a loan bank for his family and pressed loans on willing borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams. Then the season of pleasure came to an end. The pot of pink enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom remained with its unfinished and ill-plastered coat.\n\nHis household returned to its usual way of life. His mother had no further occasion to upbraid him for squandering his money. He too returned to his old life at school and all his novel enterprises fell to pieces. The commonwealth fell, the loan bank closed its coffers and its books on a sensible loss, the rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into desuetude.\n\nHow foolish his aim had been! He had tried to build a break-water of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life without him and to dam up, by rules of conduct and active interest and new filial relations, the powerful recurrence of the tides within him. Useless. From without as from within the waters had flowed over his barriers: their tides began once more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole.\n\nHe saw clearly too his own futile isolation. He had not gone one step nearer the lives he had sought to approach nor bridged the restless shame and rancour that had divided him from mother and brother and sister. He felt that he was hardly of the one blood with them but stood to them rather in the mystical kinship of fosterage, fosterchild and fosterbrother.\n\nHe turned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before which everything else was idle and alien. He cared little that he was in mortal sin, that his life had grown to be a tissue of subterfuge and falsehood. Beside the savage desire within him to realize the enormities which he brooded on nothing was sacred. He bore cynically with the shameful details of his secret riots in which he exulted to defile with patience whatever image had attracted his eyes. By day and by night he moved among distorted images of the outer world. A figure that had seemed to him by day demure and innocent came towards him by night through the winding darkness of sleep, her face transfigured by a lecherous cunning, her eyes bright with brutish joy. Only the morning pained him with its dim memory of dark orgiastic riot, its keen and humiliating sense of transgression.\n\nHe returned to his wanderings. The veiled autumnal evenings led him from street to street as they had led him years before along the quiet avenues of Blackrock. But no vision of trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence upon him now. Only at times, in the pauses of his desire, when the luxury that was wasting him gave room to a softer languor, the image of Mercedes traversed the background of his memory. He saw again the small white house and the garden of rose-bushes on the road that led to the mountains and he remembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he was to make there, standing with her in the moonlit garden after years of estrangement and adventure. At those moments the soft speeches of Claude Melnotte rose to his lips and eased his unrest. A tender premonition touched him of the tryst he had then looked forward to and, in spite of the horrible reality which lay between his hope of then and now, of the holy encounter he had then imagined at which weakness and timidity and inexperience were to fall from him.\n\nSuch moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up again. The verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries and the unspoken brutal words rushed forth from his brain to force a passage. His blood was in revolt. He wandered up and down the dark slimy streets peering into the gloom of lanes and doorways, listening eagerly for any sound. He moaned to himself like some baffled prowling beast. He wanted to sin with another of his kind, to force another being to sin with him and to exult with her in sin. He felt some dark presence moving irresistibly upon him from the darkness, a presence subtle and murmurous as a flood filling him wholly with itself. Its murmur besieged his ears like the murmur of some multitude in sleep; its subtle streams penetrated his being. His hands clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he suffered the agony of its penetration. He stretched out his arms in the street to hold fast the frail swooning form that eluded him and incited him: and the cry that he had strangled for so long in his throat issued from his lips. It broke from him like a wail of despair from a hell of sufferers and died in a wail of furious entreaty, a cry for an iniquitous abandonment, a cry which was but the echo of an obscene scrawl which he had read on the oozing wall of a urinal.\n\nHe had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets. From the foul laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and wrangling and the drawling of drunken singers. He walked onward, dismayed, wondering whether he had strayed into the quarter of the Jews. Women and girls dressed in long vivid gowns traversed the street from house to house. They were leisurely and perfumed. A trembling seized him and his eyes grew dim. The yellow gas-flames arose before his troubled vision against the vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar. Before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered arrayed as for some rite. He was in another world: he had awakened from a slumber of centuries.\n\nHe stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clamouring against his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed in a long pink gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and gazed into his face. She said gaily:\n\n\u2014Good night, Willie dear!\n\nHer room was warm and lightsome. A huge doll sat with her legs apart in the copious easy-chair beside the bed. He tried to bid his tongue speak that he might seem at ease, watching her as she undid her gown, noting the proud conscious movements of her perfumed head.\n\nAs he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over to him and embraced him gaily and gravely. Her round arms held him firmly to her and he, seeing her face lifted to him in serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and fall of her breast, all but burst into hysterical weeping. Tears of joy and relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though they would not speak.\n\nShe passed her tinkling hand through his hair, calling him a little rascal.\n\n\u2014Give me a kiss, she said.\n\nHis lips would not bend to kiss her. He wanted to be held firmly in her arms, to be caressed slowly, slowly, slowly. In her arms he felt that he had suddenly become strong and fearless and sure of himself. But his lips would not bend to kiss her.\n\nWith a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her lips to his and he read the meaning of her movements in her frank uplifted eyes. It was too much for him. He closed his eyes, surrendering himself to her, body and mind, conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between them he felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker than the swoon of sin, softer than sound or odour.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1533619", "artist_names": "Peter & Gordon", "full_title": "I Don't Want To See You Again by\u00a0Peter\u00a0& Gordon",
