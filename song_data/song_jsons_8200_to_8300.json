mama off where she needed to go\nFour bald tires, with the ceiling fallin' and the window stuck\nBut the only thing I cared about was the radio\nWe'd turn it on, turn it up to ten, and everybody would jump on in\n\n[Chorus]\nRiding down the highway\nWho wants to be the DJ\nI'll find a spot on the side of the road\nYou find something on the radio\nLike a feel real good song\nWe'll know it when it comes on\nDidn't have no money, no place to go\nAll we needed was a radio\n[Verse 2]\nI'd grab my girl, we'd look for somewhere to watch the stars\nThe perfect place to put it in park and take it slow\nShe'd sing along, to even the ones that she barely knew\nShe still sounded good, a little out of tune, but we didn't care\nI'd look at her, she'd look at me, I'll never forget that melody\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nShhh, hey y'all be quiet\nThat's my favorite song\nHey man turn it up loud\nCome on, come on, come on\n\nRiding down the highway\nWho wants to be the DJ\nI'll find a spot on the side of the road\nYou find something on the radio\nLike a feel real good song\nWe'll know it when it comes on\nDidn't have no money, no place to go\nAll we needed was a radio\n\n[Outro]\nAll we needed, all we needed now\nWas a, was a, was a radioSee Darius Rucker LiveGet tickets as low as $140You might also like1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2,

pavement, you walk me to the car\nAnd you know I wanna ask you to dance right there\nIn the middle of the parking lot, yeah\nOh, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe're driving down the road, I wonder if you know\nI'm trying so hard not to get caught up now\nBut you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair\nAbsentmindedly making me want you\n[Chorus]\nAnd I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first, fearless\nAnd I don't know why but with you, I'd dance\nIn a storm in my best dress, fearless\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road\nIn this one horse town, I wanna stay right here\nIn this passenger's seat\nYou put your eyes on me\nIn this moment now, capture it, remember it\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first, fearless\nAnd I don't know why but with you, I'd dance\nIn a storm in my best dress, fearless\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, you stood there with me in the doorway\nMy hands shake, I'm not usually this way but\nYou pull me in and I'm a little more brave\nIt's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something\nIt's fearless\nOh, yeah\nSee Taylor Swift

wanna, but I took my turn\nI'm glad I did it cause you had to learn\n\n[Chorus]\nI must admit it helped a little bit\nTo think of how you'd feel when you saw it\nI didn't know that I had that much strength\nBut I'm glad you see what happens when\nYou see you can't just play with people's feelings\nTell them you love them and don't mean it\nYou'll probably say that it was juvenile\nBut I think that I deserve to smile, ha, ha, ha, ha\n[Verse 2]\nI bust the windows out your car\nYou know I did it cause I left my mark\nWrote my initials with a crowbar\nAnd then I drove off into the dark\nI bust the windows out your car\nYou should feel lucky that was all I did\nAfter 5 whole years of this bullshit\nGave you all of me and you played with it, ooh, woah\n\n[Chorus]\nI must admit it helped a little bit\nTo think of how you'd feel when you saw it\nI didn't know that I had that much strength\nBut I'm glad you see what happens when\nYou see you can't just play with people's feelings\nTell them you love them and don't mean it\nYou probably say that it was juvenile\nBut I think that I deserve to smile\n\n[Verse 3]\nI bust the windows out your car\nBut it don't compare to my broken heart\nYou could never feel how I felt that day\nUntil it happens, baby, you don't know pain, oh\nYeah, I did it (Yeah, I did it), you should know it (You should know)\nI ain't sorry (I ain't sorry),

Summer Long LyricsIt was 1989, my thoughts were short, my hair was long\nCaught somewhere between a boy and man\nShe was seventeen and she was far from in-between\nIt was summertime in Northern Michigan\n\nSplashing through the sand bar, talking by the campfire\nIt's the simple things in life like when and where\nWe didn't have no Internet but man I never will forget\nThe way the moonlight shined upon her hair\n\nAnd we were trying different things, we were smoking funny things\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\nSipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow\nSinging 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long\nSinging 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long\nCatching Walleye from the dock\nWatching the waves roll off the rocks\nShe'll forever hold a spot inside my soul\nWe'd blister in the sun, we couldn't wait for night to come\nTo hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll\n\nWhile we were trying different things\nAnd we were smoking funny things\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\nSipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow\nSinging 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long\nSinging 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer\n\nNow nothing seems as strange as\nWhen the leaves began to change\nOr how we thought those days would never end\nSometimes I hear that song and I'll start to sing along\nAnd think, man, I'd love to see that girl again\nMan, I'd like to see that girl again\n\nAnd we were trying different things and we were smoking funny things\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\nSipping

Cadillac\nThrow the top back\nAnd roll down to Jackson town\nI wanna be there on the stage with you\nYou and I could be the next rage too\nHear the crowd roar\nMake 'em want more\nKick the footlights out\n[Chorus]\nI wanna love like Johnny and June\nRings of fire burnin' with you\nI wanna walk the line, walk the line\n'Till the end of time\nI wanna love, love ya that much\nCash it all in\nGive it all up\nWhen you're gone, I wanna go too\nLike Johnny and June\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wanna hold you baby right or wrong\nBuild a world around a country song\nPray a sweet prayer\nFollow you there\nDown in history\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna love like Johnny and June\nRings of fire burnin' with you\nI wanna walk the line, walk the line\n'Till the end of time\nI wanna love, love ya that much\nCash it all in\nGive it all up\nWhen you're gone, I wanna go too\nLike Johnny and June\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nLike Johnny and June\nMore than life itself\nNo-one else\nThis endless promise\nThey don't make love like that anymore\nIs that too much to be askin' for\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna love like Johnny and June\nRings of fire burnin' with you\nI wanna walk the line, walk the line\n'Till the end of time\nI wanna love, love ya that much\nCash it all in\nGive it all up\nWhen you're gone, I wanna go too\nLike Johnny and June\n\n[Outro]\nLike Johnny and June\nAnd when we're gone\nThere'll be no tears to cry\nOnly memories of our lives\nThey'll remember, remember\nA love like thatEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/192217", "artist_names": "George Strait",

Lyrics[Intro]\n(Sha, sha, sha)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI probably shouldn't say this, but at times, I get so scared\nWhen I think about the previous relationship we shared\nIt was awesome, but we lost it\nIt's not possible for me not to care\nAnd now we're standin' in the rain\nBut nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear\n[Chorus]\nThe seven things I hate about you\nThe seven things I hate about you, oh, you\nYou're vain, your games, you're insecure\nYou love me, you like her\nYou make me laugh, you make me cry\nI don't know which side to buy\nYour friends, they're jerks\nWhen you act like them, just know it hurts\nI wanna be with the one I know\nAnd the seventh thing I hate the most that you do\nYou make me love you\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say\nBut what I need to hear now, your sincere apology\nWhen you mean it, I'll believe it\nIf you text it, I'll delete it\nLet's be clear (Clear, clear)\nOh, I'm not comin' back\nYou're taking seven steps here\n\n[Chorus]\nThe seven things I hate about you\nYou're vain, your games, you're insecure\nYou love me, you like her\nYou make me laugh, you make me cry\nI don't know which side to buy\nYour friends, they're jerks\nWhen you act like them, just know it hurts\nI wanna be with the one I know\nAnd the seventh thing I hate the most that you do\nYou make me love you\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nAnd compared to all the great things\nThat would take too long to write\nI probably should mention the seven that I like\n\n[Chorus]\nThe seven things I like about you\nYour hair, your eyes, your old Levi's\nWhen we kiss, I'm hypnotized\nYou make me laugh, you make me cry\nBut I guess that's both I'll have to buy\nYour hand in mine\nWhen we're intertwined, everything's alright\nI wanna be with the one I know\nAnd the seventh thing I like the most that you do\nYou make me love you\n\n[Outro]\n(Sha, sha)\nYou do, oh\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n(La, la, la,

hell that I've gone through\nBut look at me still smiling as I'm wondering what I'll do\nSince I ain\u2019t got nothing I've got nothing to lose\nEverybody say \"hahaha, hahaha\"\nMy friends are always giving me watches, hats, and wine\nThat's how I know this is serious that's how I know it's time\nI don't have to worry about things that I don't have\n'Cause if I ain't got nothing I've got nothing to hold me back\n[Chorus]\n1-2-3 like a bird I sing\n'Cause you\u2019ve given me the most beautiful set of wings\nI'm so glad you're here today\n'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away\nFly away, fly away\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere's nothing that's worth keeping me\nFrom places I should go\nFrom happy Ville to loving land\nI'm going to tour from coast to coast\nI'm leaving everything

from South Dakota\nShe was a first grade school teacher Phoenix Arizona\n(No, my first time here)\nThey started dancing and it got real hot\nThen it spilled over to the parking lot\nOne more tequila they were falling in love\nOne more is never enough\n[Chorus]\nDon't bite off more than you can chew\nThere's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do\nJust remember when you let it all go\nWhat happens down in Mexico\nStays in Mexico\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe woke up in the morning and he made a little telephone call\nTo check on his wife and his kids back at home in Sioux Falls\n(Hey babe everything okay)\nShe hopped right in the shower with a heavy heavy mind\n(What am I doing)\nHe knew it was the first time Gina had ever crossed that line\nThey walked down to the beach and started drinking again\nJumped into the ocean for a dirty swim\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOne more margarita then we're falling in love\nOne more's never enough\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't bite off more than you can chew\nThere's things

thought it was funny but now I got money on a monkey-fight\n\nSome chimps in hard-hats\nChimps a-working on a chain gang\nSome chimps who love cats\nBurning rubber in a Mustang\nA birthday wishing
